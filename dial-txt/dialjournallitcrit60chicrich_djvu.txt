FACT, TRUTH, FICTION, AND THE 
STORY. 

Might it not straighten out matters for us 
a little, I sometimes wonder, if we were to 
throw overboard some of our verbal ballast, 
for instance, the word " fiction " and the 
word "novel"? The first would probably 
sink of its own clumsy weight, and trouble us 
no more; and the other, when we had let it 
out of its gilt cage, would skitter off into the 
thin air where it belongs, and we should not 
have that pet to take care of in the future. 

Very likely we should miss them at first; 
but what a relief to discover, as time went on, 
that we were no longer fuddling ourselves 
and others with talk about " realistic fiction," 
and (shade of Boccaccio!) "novels of ideas," 
and such strange cattle ! What luxury to be, 
as it were, alone on a wide, wide sea, with no 
critical baggage aboard but a few simple 
words like "story" and "story-telling"! 
How much easier, when we fell into the in- 
evitable discussion of So-and-so's latest, to 
make out what the other fellow might be talk- 
ing about ! How much more possible for him 
to get an inkling, now and then, as to what 
we were driving at ! The muddle we have got 
into over this whole business of " fiction " is 
amazing, when one thinks of it. Poetry is a 
still more boggy theme, to be sure, let us 
hasten to turn our backs on it. Fact, truth, 
fiction, the real, the romantic, the ideal. are 
these live words ? Or are they dead counters, 
to be shuffled about as we will? 

It was a long time ago that Pilate clinched 
his immortality by merely inquiring. What 
was Truth? A good many centuries later 
somebody was it Byron? remarked that 
It was stranger than Fiction. But we are 
now being earnestly assured on many hands 
that Fiction is at least as true as Truth. And 
barking at our heels, while we try to engage 
each other in quiet literary conversation, is 
the rude word " Fact," demanding that some 
one shall pay it a little attention, and tell us 
what it is. and where it came from, and what 
it is doing at the party. Now the truth is, 
fact is often fiction but let us pause for a 
moment, and advance with every appearance 
of caution. 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 6 



I suppose the meaning of Pilate's famous 
inquiry was, "What is the deep and abiding 
reality in life?" Every nian must answer 
that for himself in a way, and does answer it. 
He has various aids in formulating his an- 
swer, experience, observation, religion, even 
art. But of course Byron was n't thinking of 
an abstraction. What he meant was simply 
that the things that happen, the facts of expe- 
rience, are often more strikingly improbable 
than the things that are imagined. We all 
know this is true, we need only read the 
newspapers to have it brought home to us 
every week. Coincidences happen, bits of 
lurid incident take place before our eyes, 
which a theatre audience would laugh at. 
There are interventions of chance, feats of 
heroism, eventualities so startling that no 
manager of melodrama or " movie " would 
dare ask an audience to credit them. Here is 
one that, because I heard of it at first-hand, 
made more impression on me than if I had 
read it in a newspaper. It is literally true, I 
know that; and it is utterly preposterous, 
you could not make a story of it that anybody 
would believe. An undertaker was leaving 
home for two days. There was a sick woman 
at a neighbor's boarding-house, a stranger in 
the village. The landlady was afraid the 
woman would die while the undertaker was 
away. He said she might be laid out in his 
own parlor till his return: his wife is used 
to things and doesn't mind, though she will 
be alone in the house. He returns late the 
second night, he is not expected home till 
morning. There is a light in the parlor. He 
lets himself in, finds the sheeted figure he has 
half-expected, uncovers the face with a pro- 
fessional hand : it is his wife. Now the mere 
fact is easily explained; but there is no use 
in explaining such a thing for the purposes 
of the story-teller. It is too preposterously 
neat in its tragic irony. 

This happened some years ago, two miles 
north of my desk. Only the other day, two 
miles south of it, there was another incident 
which for bitter squalid pathos no "natu- 
ralist" could overmatch: the death, in every 
circumstance of meaningless horror, of a 
negro washerwoman. I shall not tell that 
thing. If the other incident had its element 
of artistic irony too complete for credibility, 
this one (am I here betraying a creed out- 
worn?) is quite as complete in its disability 
for sane interpretation. It remains in my 



mind as one of those human experiences which 
we rightly try to keep in their places as mere 
items of sordid and sickening fact. It will 
not do to dwell upon them and magnify them : 
that way madness lies. Many such facts, it is 
true, are now employed as a basis for the 
thing called fiction, or for the " story " in the 
journalistic sense. But for the art of story- 
telling, they do not exist. 

You see what we win by narrowing our 
vocabulary. When we speak of a story, we 
are thinking of something fairly concrete and 
intelligible. For a story, if it is worth telling, 
is a thing organic, or at least composed. It 
hangs together, has a beginning, a middle, 
and an end, has, above all, a meaning. 
Read a tale in. the Arabian Nights, or in 
Boccaccio, and you have the story in its 
essence. You may expand or vary it indefi- 
nitely, in substance or in meaning, and yet 
not change its nature. If the golden material 
is there, the size of the product is largely (I 
don't say altogether) a question of arrange- 
ment. Every story has, perhaps, its natural, 
or preferable, scale. But I confess myself 
pretty skeptical as to the value of all our talk 
about a distinct and " new " art of the short 
story. Many of the best stories of our time 
are in the short form. But is this true alto- 
gether because they were preordained for that 
form, or partly because the longer form which 
we call the novel has been so generally di- 
verted to other uses than the uses of story- 
telling? Having been a reviewer for many 
years, I may own that, for my part, I have 
been unceasingly engaged in extricating my- 
self from the labyrinths of modern " fiction '' 
by hanging to the clue of the story. 

I don't mean by this the "plot." What, 
then, do I mean? How do I know a story 
when I see one? What is a "good story," 
giving the phrase its highest possible mean- 
ing ? Well, I shall content myself with saying 
that I think I have and that very many of 
us have a natural instinct about that, if we 
do not permit ourselves to be robbed of it. 
But many of the people who use the extended 
story form, or something like it, and many of 
the people who praise them for having writ- 
ten something other than a story under cover 
of that form, are very busy trying to rob us 
of just this instinct. To begin with, they ask 
us to believe that a novel is something differ- 
ent from a story, and that it is something 
bigger and better. I believe that the great 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



novels are first of all great stories, and that 
we love them for that, however much we may 
admire them for other things. And if I be- 
lieve that " Pride and Prejudice " and " The 
Rise of Silas Lapham" are great books, as 
well as " Ivanhoe " or " The Scarlet Letter," it 
is because I believe that, scale, manner, intel- 
lectual, moral, aesthetic, and other accessories 
apart, they are all great examples of the 
story-teller's art. 

It is for this reason that I deplore our 
servility in the presence of sundry set and 
unduly emphasized distinctions as between 
realism and romanticism, between the novel 
of incident and the novel of character or of 
fact or of ideas. These distinctions are all 
useful enough as far as they go. But it is not 
necessary to bow down to them as before a 
row of idols. There is infinite gradation in 
these matters. The attempt to draw hard and 
fast lines has got criticism into such a mess 
that we are now fain to pull ourselves out 
with the aid of monstrous categories like 
"romantic realism," "realistic romance/' and 
so on. 

A good deal of light is thrown upon one of 
the places that have been darkened by this 
sort of counsel in a recent " Nation " article 
by Mr. Stuart P. Sherman. His immediate 
object is a searching and scorching analy- 
sis of the books of Mr. Theodore Dreiser. 
Mr. Dreiser, of course, is a professed realist. 
He is out after the truth with a small t; no 
gloss of imagination or theory is to sully with 
its gold the pure tin of his pages. Mr. Sher- 
man points out the fact that, like all realists 
who are in any sense whatever story-tellers, 
Mr. Dreiser's work, instead of a ruthless 
camera-process, represents a clear and con- 
sistent (if paltry) interpretation of life. 
" There is no such thing," says Mr. Sherman, 
" as a ' cross-section ' or ' slice ' or ' photo- 
graph ' of life in art least of all in the real- 
istic novel. The use of these words is but a 
clever hypnotizing pass of the artist, em- 
ployed to win the assent of the reader to the 
reality of the show, and, in some cases, to 
evade moral responsibility for any questiona- 
ble features of the exhibition. A realistic 
novel no more than any other type of novel 
can escape being a composition, involving pre- 
conception, imagination, and divination." 

And what does this mean but that, as we 
are saying, the novel, in so far as it is a work 
of art, is, for a ' that and a' that, a story : an 



interpreting narrative, as definitely inspired, 
and at its height as purely wrought, as a 
poem or a statue. As for Mr. Dreiser, nature 
gave him the story-telling instinct, and he 
happened to find his material in his own back 
yard. In his first book, " Sister Carrie," that 
instinct asserted itself to good purpose, though 
at times it nearly lost itself among the rub- 
bish. In his latest novel, " The ' Genius/ " it is 
quite gone, buried somewhere under the moun- 
tain of malodorous litter upon which Mr. 
Dreiser still broods with innocent and earnest 
devotion as a hen will brood her clutch of 
pebbles long after you have taken her last 
egg from her. To such futile employment the 
grosser realistic illusion, which, if Mr. Sher- 
man likes, we will call naturalism, may bring 
even a born story-teller. 

I have said that the great story is purely 
wrought. I mean that it is sound as to sub- 
stance and well-knit as to structure. Only 
the short tale need be close-knit, and then 
largely (as with the play) for extraneous rea- 
sons. " Jean-Christophe " is a great story no 
more in spite of than because of its many 
volumes. The excellence of "Joseph Vance" 
as a story is in no way compromised either by 
its length, by its digressions, or by that air 
of negligence upon which Mr. De Morgan so 
ingenuously plumes himself. When Mr. Kip- 
ling made his famous declaration about the 
nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal 
lays, he was justifiably challenging the critics 
who wish (or are supposed to wish) to tie 
down artists with petty rules. But not one 
of those ways, however unruly, can afford to 
be really lawless. Even the tribe has its 
standards, or at least its touchstones. How- 
ever it vary in size or pattern > in color or 
texture or stitch, our good story is a web well 
knitted, and not a chance jumbling of parti- 
colored threads. Mr. Joseph Conrad's stitch 
is singularly intricate, but there is no doubt 
about the firmness of his fabric. Even Mr. 
Henry James but the interests of neutral- 
ity now urge that we be chary of attempting 
to reduce that expansive Briton to a nutshell. 

And if an immense variety of pattern and 
weft is available for the true story-teller, 
there is not less surely a vast choice of mate- 
rials. The simpler and more primitive (but 
not on that account despicable) forms of yarn 
or tale deal naturally with incident and type 
rather than with sustained action and the 
development of character. "We have a right

[ Jan. 6 



to insist, in a general way, that the longer the 
story, the longer we are asked by the story- 
teller to associate with his persons, the more 
justified we shall be in expecting them to find 
that they are real beings, and not mere types 
or mouthpieces ; that the action shall be inter- 
esting because it has to do with them in- 
stead of their being simply puppets necessary 
for its carrying on. To be sure, a puppet is 
an admirable thing in a puppet-show; and a 
puppet-show, or its written equivalent, is a 
pure if rudimentary vehicle for the story- 
teller. The exasperating and maddening thing 
is the sort of fiction, or figment, in which mere 
puppets are connected with an action demand- 
ing real characters. I suppose more long nar- 
ratives are offered us, year in and year out, 
which deserve to be condemned on this ground 
than on any other. Sham characterization is 
a chief mark of what Mr. Wister has called 
the " quack-novel " ; and a disheartening fact 
it is that so many of our confirmed story- 
readers though not, I am sure, most of 
them are satisfied to accept, under the 
well-sounding label of "fiction," these empty 
travesties of human action and character. 

As for the rest of us which means. I am 
happy to believe, the great majority if we 
could get rid of the muddle of terms, and stop 
harping upon differences of taste as to unes- 
sentials, should we not find ourselves pretty 
comfortably agreed as to what we really ask 
of our writers of prose narrative ? We ask, I 
suggest, such a handling of sturdy fact or 
creative fancy as shall illumine some aspect 
of human truth of the truth that is truer 
than either fact or fiction. To such a narra- 
tive, however colored by personal observation, 
thought, or imagination, I like to think the 
fine old word "story" may be fitly awarded 

as a symbol of merit.

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN LONDON. 

CAPRICES OF THE RARE BOOK COLLECTOR. A 
NEW STUDY OF OSCAR WILDE. SIR SIDNEY 
LEE'S " LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE " IN A NEW EDI- 
TION. THE LATE STEPHEN PHILLIPS. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
It is a noticeable thing that though pub- 
lishing has been so badly hit by the war and 
the ordinary second-hand book trade has also 
suffered, the prices fetched by old and rare 



books at the great auctions have been well 
maintained, and in some cases have beaten 
records. At first sight puzzling, this fact is 
not inexplicable. Persons wdth modest in- 
comes, on wiiom, by virtue of their numbers, 
the book-trade in the larger and more popu- 
lar sense must depend, are feeling the eco- 
nomic pinch, and are, for the most part, 
inclined to think of books as dispensable luxu- 
ries. But the collectors of rare books are a 
small and peculiar class. In the first place, 
they are normally well-to-do, and still have 
money to play with in spite of the present 
raids on their pockets and appeals to their 
patriotism. And in the second place, they are 
such slaves to their hobby that they would go 
on buying as long as they had a penny left. 
To what the passion can lead a man is shown 
in the late George Gissing's "Private Papers 
of Henry Ryecroft." Gissing in his early 
days, when he lived in a garret and read 
JEschylus, used often to have to consider the 
question of book versus meal. Standing be- 
fore a beautiful old volume in a shop-window, 
he would poise his last sixpence in his hand 
and wonder whether to do without the book or 
go without his dinner. The book always won ; 
for, he argued, if he bought the book he would 
have it a week afterwards, but on sont les 
diners d' ant an? Had he been more prosper- 
ous, no such trifles as Armageddon would 
have restricted his bids at auctions when first 
editions of North's " Plutarch " or Sir Thomas 
Browne came up. That is what the book- 
collector is like. And beyond this, there is of 
course the influence of the American pur- 
chaser. American competition is the factor 
that has sent the prices of books, as of pic- 
tures, up so enormously in recent years; and 
that factor is still operative. Americans ap- 
pear to be buying more freely than ever; we 
may be said, in a sense, to be bartering Folios 
for Munitions of War. The more valuable 
the book the more American competition for 
it becomes operative. 

I was talking on the subject a day or two 
ago to one of the best London dealers in 
incunabula and other rare books. He spoke 
of the large American purchases ; at the same 
time he complained that American buying 
was unsystematic and capricious. He could 
never make sure, he said, what he would place 
in America; few Americans appeared to spe- 
cialize in a particular type or period of book. 
Possibly this is true; I know nothing about 
it. But one may say of collectors all the 
world over that one cannot quite make out 
why they collect what they do collect, and 
why they do not collect what they do not col- 
lect. With first editions of famous authors 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



the case is fairly clear : the forces of intrinsic 
interest, rarety, and age produce a compre- 
hensible resultant. "What I am thinking of, 
rather, are books which are collected solely, 
or principally, because they are early or very 
rare, or because of the beauty of their print. 
With the earliest books of all. date is. perhaps 
not unreasonably, the most important factor. 
But it is impossible to account on any ground 
of reason for the habits of collectors who pro- 
fess to specialize in beautiful books. Fashion 
seems to govern them completely. They get 
hold of the idea of Aldines; they rush for 
Aldines. But Aldus Manutius was not every- 
body; and, though Aldines are often beautiful 
books, there are others. Why should Elze- 
virs have had their vogue, and books printed 
at Basel (save for a few Erasmuses) be given 
the go-by? I have bought recently two most 
glorious Basel folios. Erasmus's Annota- 
tions to the New Testament (printed by Fro- 
ben with marginal cuts by Holbein) and 
Polydore Virgil's History of England. for 
a few shillings a piece. Why do so few people 
(though a number of Germans have begun 
specializing in this field) intelligently collect 
the beautiful Italian books of 1500-1530? 
Why are French printers like Stephanus so 
neglected? Why. indeed, do not the biblio- 
philes pay some attention to our few good 
English printers? Some years ago a man 
wrote a book about John Baskerville, the 
eighteenth century Birmingham and Cam- 
bridge printer, who used beautiful type and 
(almost as important) paper which has kept 
white. The result was a sudden rush for 
Baskervilles. But why not collect the books 
of his predecessor, Jacob Tonson. who not 
only printed well but usually illustrated his 
books with most entertaining engravings? 
Tonsons are. of course, common. You can 
find them in every shop: you can buy for 
example, his great " Prior " or his admirable 
"Lucretius" for five shillings or seven-and- 
six. But if all who profess to care for digni- 
fied book-production began to collect Tonsons 
it would soon be found that the supply of 
good copies of his volumes is not inexhausti- 
ble, and prices would certainly not remain at 
their present level. Foulis of Glasgow is 
another eighteenth century printer who de- 
serves the honor of being collected: his 
small classics are charming little books. But 
I suppose that if I persist in this sort of 
propaganda. I shall end by raising prices 
against myself! 

Recent books worth mentioning though 
some of them at least, .will certainly have 
been published on your side are Sir Ed- 
ward Cook's monograph on Delane, the Victo- 



rian editor of "The Times." J. 11. Hone's 
monograph on W. B. Yeats (much more sensi- 
ble and full of matter than most books on 
contemporary authors), Boyd Cable's "Be- 
tween the Lines " (about the best book of war- 
sketches yet published), G. K. Chesterton's 
" The Crimes of England," the seventh edi- 
tion of Sir Sidney Lee's "Life of Shake- 
speare," and R. H. Sherard's "The Real 
Oscar Wilde." Wilde's friends appear to 
think this last subject inexhaustible: the 
British Museum authorities will soon have to 
build a new wing to house the mounds of 
monographs on Wilde that every year pro- 
duces. The latest, as these books go, is a good 
one. It is quite uncritical, and scarcely dis- 
tinguished in point of style: but the per- 
sonality of the hero comes through, and many 
of the anecdotes are new. It contains one 
great gem, for which not Wilde but Mr. 
Sherard is responsible. Contemplating the 
enormous reverence that they have for Wilde 
in Germany, Mr. Sherard suddenly wonders 
what would have happened had Oscar still 
been alive. Surely, he asks, had Wilde's eye 
been upon them the Germans would never 
have risked his disapproval by committing the 
excesses of Lou vain and Rheims? Xo! the 
prospect of reproaches from such a quarter 
would have checked and chilled them! It 
only remained to argue further that a word 
from Wilde would have stopped the war. But 
this step Mr. Sherard leaves to his reader. 

As for Sir Sidney Lee's book, what can one 
do but stand before it with that measure of 
humility and awe with which a pigmy tour- 
ist contemplates the uptowering mass of the 
Pyramid of Cheops ? For seventeen years Sir 
Sidney has been adding and adding to it. 
incorporating every new fact which can con- 
ceivably be brought into relation with Shake- 
speare's life or work, until now we have 
something which is less a book than a public 
monument. It would be possible to burlesque 
the kind of research in which he disports him- 
self. Group after group of people, Strat- 
ford tradesmen, lawyers, authors, publishers, 
and peers. have been, in the process of 
years, brought into use in the effort to build 
up a hypothetical life for the Elusive Bard, 
until one feels that, by the time ten more 
years have passed, the index of the then cur- 
rent edition of Sir Sidney's " Life " may pro- 
vide a complete census of the inhabitants of 
England in the reigns of Elizabeth and 
James I. Almost any contemporary docu- 
ment may be made to have its bearing. If, in 
1575, Anthony Jones of Stratford sold a 
dozen herrings to Peter Piper of the same 
town for two shillings nine pence, the fact

may well illuminate something in the elabo- 
rate argument; and, after all, every man 
then living was or was not Mr. W. H., and 
every woman was either dark or fair. But it 
is a change to come to a great mass of hard 
facts, however trivial, after the deluge of 
"aesthetic" appreciation of Shakespeare, and 
the endless attempts to deduce "The Man" 
( failing any more trustworthy sources ! ) from 
his Works. Sir Sidney Lee makes no bones 
about his own proclivities. He is a " dryas- 
dust," and proud of it, a thorough and 
painstaking and extraordinarily sensible dry- 
asdust. The result is that he is anything but 
dry. His judgments on controversial points 
are always worth having, though, like all 
Shakespearean controversialists, he tends to 
think that 1 probability -f 1 probability = 1 
certainty. But his accumulation of facts is so 
enormous and his detail so precise that his 
book would be fascinating reading even if one 
took no particular interest in Shakespeare at 
all and did not care whether or not he was 
Bacon. As a work of reference concerning 
Shakespeareana, this book with its appendices 
has no rival ; it even provides one with bibli- 
ographies of all the more important aspects 
of the Shakespeare Question. I observe I 
had not observed it before that by a tragic 
coincidence one of the witnesses to Shake- 
speare's Last Will and Testament bore the 
surname of Shaw. I also had not realized 
before that the German taste for "Unser 
Shaxpur" developed very early. Two of 
Shakespeare's plays, in a very mutilated 
form, were published in a German translation 
in 1620, only four years after the dramatist's 
death. 

The death of Stephen Phillips would have 
been much more widely noticed ten years ago. 
From 1899 to 1905, when his early poems and 
dramas "Marpessa," "Christ in Hades," 
"Herod," "Paolo and Francesca," and so on 
were being published, all but the most level- 
headed critics were raving about his genius. 
He was, they said, another Webster, another 
Wordsworth, another Milton, even another 
Shakespeare. In sober truth, he was a man 
of sensibility, with a liking for words and a 
knowledge of the stage, who had nothing new 
to say and no new way in which to say it. 
Almost everywhere in his verse you may see 
that his memory is dominating, his memory 
of either the melody of Tennyson or the 
march of Milton. The success of the pleasant 
imitator was as transient as it was great ; and 
of late years (he has been ill, and writing 
poorly, too) he occupied the unenviable posi- 
tion of the man who has survived his early 



popularity. His best play was "Paolo and 
Francesca," and he did one or two slight 
lyrics (such as "Beautiful Are the Dead") 
which anthologists may use.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

A NEW JUSTIFICATION OF THE NOVEL IN THE 

PUBLIC LIBRARY is offered by Mr. Montrose J. 
Moses in the New York " Evening Post." We 
are all familiar with the prominently dis- 
played bargain in the shop window, a display 
that is hoped to win custom for other goods 
also in the same emporium. Apparently with 
this in mind Mr. Moses writes, in the course 
of his article, " In Defence of Novels," as fol- 
lows: "Let us suppose that Mr. Tax Payer 
had had his way that the buying of novels 
had been ruled out of the public libraries sys- 
tem, what would have happened ? One of two 
things : either there would have been a greater 
buying of novels among the people, thus en- 
couraging the output of fiction, or there would 
have sprung up a greater number of fiction 
libraries than there are, run strictly on a com- 
mercial basis. The public library would have 
found itself, therefore, working against a sys- 
tem which was reaping benefit through its 
neglect, and which was counteracting the pub- 
lic library's source of influence by keeping 
away from it a great many people who, unless 
it had novels to offer, would never go in. 
Most libraries look to the novel as a means of 
exploiting other books." It is undoubtedly true 
that such a novel as Erckmann-Chatrian's 
" Conscript " has prompted many a reader to 
make a serious study of the Napoleonic wars, 
and other romances have suggested other 
branches of research; but it is questionable 
whether " most libraries " (which may be 
taken to mean most librarians) consciously 
maintain that commercial attitude toward 
their fiction department which seems to be 
indicated in the foregoing. Novels have their 
own independent virtues, as do other books; 
like beauty they may be their own excuse for 
being. . . . 

SOME IRRATIONALITIES OF THE PRINTED PAGE, 

minor departures from that correctness in 
detail which every author and every printer 
ought to strive for, are brought to mind upon 
reading, with considerable entertainment and 
hearty approval, Mr. Charles Fitzhugh Tal- 
man's amusing "Atlantic" article, "Accents 
Wild." Though the writer claims for himself 
uniqueness in his irritation at the carelessness 
with which accents and umlauts and similar 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



9 



diacritical marks are commonly used, many 
another observer must have noted with the 
same vexation this lack of scholarly accuracy. 
What accents are used in foreign words, and 
where they are placed, seems to be regarded 
as a matter of indifference, with an easy as- 
sumption that the more we have, the better; 
some at least are likely to land in the right 
place if we throw them in with sufficiently 
lavish hand. A very carefully edited New 
York newspaper persisted for some time in 
recording the military movements of one Gen- 
eral Joffre, which was not unpardonable, 
though a little surprising. In one of the most 
popular of current war books, Mr. Frederick 
Palmer's "My Year of the Great War," he 
writes, in referring to the Kaiser and Berlin : 
" Not far away one had glimpses of the white 
statues of My Ancestors of the Sieges Alice, 
or avenue of victory," and he so likes the look 
of this impossible thoroughfare that he intro- 
duces it again on the next page, and still 
again on the one following, although he is j 
describing an actual sojourn in the German j 
capital and must have seen in print the word 
" Siegesallee " more than once. But there \ 
is a French word "siege" (which has nothing 
to do with " victory ") and there is a French ! 
word " allee " ; therefore he thinks to improve 
on the Kaiser's German by making the august 
Hohenzollerns adorn the "Sieges Allee." An j 
irrationality of a different sort reveals itself ' 
in the following current news item, the news- 
paper, however, being blameless: "Five thou- 
sand cards mailed from the White House last 
evening read as follows : ' Mr. Woodrow 
Wilson and Mrs. Norman Gait, nee Edith 
Boiling, announce their marriage,' " etc. Most 
of us, not so fortunate as to be presidents' 
brides, have to wait until after birth, some- 
times a whole week, or even longer, before j 
acquiring a prefix to our patronymic. 


CRIMINAL SHEDDING OF INK, advocacy through 
the printing press of doctrines or policies 
fraught with evil, may be less horrible than 
criminal bloodshed, or on the other hand 
it may be worse than any single act of vio- 
lence if it incites masses of men to excesses 
of brutality. The number of pens in this 
country at present engaged in urging the 
necessity of immediate preparation for war 
(though they may call it simply armed de- 
fence) is beyond counting; and this frenzied 
activity illustrates, apart from all questions 
of ethics or of expediency, that habit of false 
and hasty reasoning which Herbert Spencer 
found typified in the involuntary impulse 
that makes an onlooker bestir himself to jerk

i. 



into an upright position the man who has 
slipped and fallen, and who needs at the mo- 
ment nothing so much as to be left for a 
brief space to catch his breath and rally his 
powers. An instant's reflection ought to 
make clear, whatever one's attitude toward 
war in general, that now, when a large part 
of the world is rapidly bleeding to death, or 
to exhaustion, the danger of attack upon this 
country is reduced to a minimum; and that 
now, of all times, is the proper season to cher- 
ish some reasonable expectation of success in 
the age-long endeavor to devise a practicable 
substitute for war as a means of settling inter- 
national disputes. Let us at least wait and 
see whether some league to enforce peace may 
not take promising shape when the battle- 
smoke at present filling the air shall have 
cleared away. On higher grounds than mere 
expediency and common sense there is of 
course much to urge against what the panic- 
mongers call "preparedness." Never before 
has there been offered so fine an opportunity 
to show the world that our traditional policy 
in things military comes near to being the one 
right policy to pursue. Never before has this 
country had such a chance or been so well 
able to assume leadership in a worthy cause. 
But here is no place for detailed argument or 
for indulgence in long-winded moralizing. 
Let it suffice to quote the words of Isaac Dis- 
raeli, written a century ago, but never so 
applicable as now: "War has corrupted the 
morals of the people, and has occasioned them 
to form horrible ideas of virtue." 



THE INADEQUACY OP TRANSLATIONS, 6V6U the 

best, is undeniable. Consequently one is not 
prepared to criticize as altogether extravagant 
the language of a writer in " The Unpopular 
Review " who, discussing " The Way of the 
Translator," goes so far as to assert that " the 
translation of literature is a meddling an 
irreverence, a sacrilege. It is this because it 
is impossible, and it is impossible because it is 
this." Again, in the same strain, he says: 
" Literature is art, and art is emotion. Emo- 
tion is inspiration, a divine thing, the most 
delicate and the most sacred in human ex- 
istence. . . Translation is meddling with in- 
spiration, blasphemy against the Holy Ghost." 
He is also moved to exclaim : " The older 
generation may thank God for bringing them 
into the world in time to go to college before 
every housetop in Jerusalem became a pulpit 
for some sophomore or state legislator preach- 
ing in bad grammar the glories of the superfi- 
cial and the shameful waste of the deep things 
of God." Impassioned eloquence we have

here, surely, and if it turns but a single 
reader to the serious study of one great work 
of foreign literature in the original, it will 
not have been wasted. At the same time, 
even though oranges and figs ought to be 
eaten ripe from the tree if one would get their 
full flavor, it would be absurd for us of a 
colder clime to deny ourselves oranges and 
figs altogether. To be consistent, moreover, 
the writer should have called it an irrever- 
ence to attempt to read in the original any 
work not written in one's mother tongue ; for 
only the native Italian can fully understand 
and enjoy his Dante and his Petrarch, only 
the Spaniard can thoroughly appreciate Cer- 
vantes and Calderon. Translations, except 
of scientific treatises, business letters, or other 
technical matter, are always inadequate; yet 
they have their uses and sometimes their very 
conspicuous virtues. What would English 
literature (to push speculation no further) be 
like to-day if all English writers had been 
obliged to go to the Hebrew and Greek for 
their knowledge of the Bible, or forego such 

knowledge entirely? 



FROM AN OLD SCHOOLBOY, a graduate of the 
same preparatory academy as the present 
writer, these few sentences from a letter ad- 
dressed to the school principal offer them- 
selves for quotation : " Somehow tag-ends of 
memories bob up unexpectedly. Yesterday I 
was trying to translate, with the aid of a 
dictionary, a French official war communique, 
when some French word suddenly called up 
the picture of Mr. Davis sitting back in his 
chair before his class and making an alien 
language fairly live. His knack of making 
boys think in French and read their texts 
through French eyes was marvellous. Any- 
one who has heard him illuminate and vivify 
' 1'Abbe Constantin ' by the little phrases and 
remarks he drops out in passing, cannot escape 
without having learned much more of French 
than is in the textbooks. Is Mr. Hecker still 
at Roxbury? I hope so. Although I have 
worked in about fifteen different cities since 
I left school, and have left a part of my per- 
sonal effects in each one, I still have in my 
trunk the card index of Latin idioms with 
which he used to make sight translation of 
Cicero mere child's play. I shall never forget 
how he hammered those idioms into our heads, 
one by one, and then drove each idiom home 
with a final witty remark. After we had 
learned those few-score idioms, reading Cicero 
at sight was much easier than reading the war 
news of to-day." No doubt Cicero, accom- 
plished rhetorician though he was, stuck 
closer to the truth than the present-day writer 



of war dispatches, even official ones. The 
whole letter of which a small part is here 
given prompts one to quote, for the benefit of 
schoolboys now groaning under what may 
seem to them an unbearable linguistic grind, 
the Virgilian tag, " Forsan et hsec olim memi- 
nisse juvabit." But what can those words 
mean to the schoolboy until long after he has 
left school? . . . 

THE LITERARY OUTLOOK FOR THE SOUTH pre- 

sents itself to that loyal Southerner. Professor 
Archibald Henderson, as highly promising. 
Hisi Phi Beta Kappa address at Tulane Uni- 
versity last June has been printed in pam- 
phlet form, and no Southerner can read it 
without rejoicing in his birthright, no North- 
erner without some momentary regret at hav- 
ing been born north of Mason and Dixon's 
line. Although, as Professor Henderson ad- 
mits, the Hall of Fame on University Heights 
has but one of its fifty-one tablets devoted to 
a distinctively literary genius of the South 
Edgar Allan Poe (and he was born in Boston, 
of English parentage) appreciation of good 
literature and a fondness for the classics were 
early developed in the southern States, though 
the call to authorship failed to make itself 
heard there long after the North had pro- 
duced writers of more than local repute. But 
with the South again resuming something 
of its old political leadership a quickening of 
other activities, including the writing of 
books, is looked for. " To-day, as we stand 
upon the threshold of this new era," declares 
the Phi Beta Kappa orator, " there must come 
to all of us a sense of joyous elation, a leaping 
of the blood, that it is given to us to live in 
such a country." Surely, in that spirit, if in 
any, is high-hearted literature produced. 


A PROSPECTIVE SERIES OF IMPORTANT ARTI- 
CLES is announced by the " Wisconsin Library 
Bulletin.' ' Believing that a lively interest in 
American public libraries exists throughout 
the library profession, together with a very 
prevalent ignorance on the same subject, the 
editors of the " Bulletin " are planning a suc- 
cession of ten papers from experts, to be 
published in its columns during the present 
year, dealing with leading American libraries. 
First, Mr. Walter M. Smith, librarian at Wis- 
consin University, is to enrich the January 
number with an account of Wisconsin libra- 
ries, including the activities of the library 
commission, the university library, the his- 
torical library, the college, normal school, and 
public library, as they are to-day performing 
their several functions in that State. Chi- 
cago libraries will next be handled by Miss

Louise B. Krause and Miss Renee Stern, after 
which will come an article on Greater New 
York libraries by Miss Josephine A. Rath- 
bone. The author of " The American Public

well-known librarian, has promised to write

BOOKS THAT MAY BUN THE BLOCKADE HOW 

maintained by the all-powerful British navy | 
against free commerce on the part of her ene- I 
mies are specified by Sir Richard Crawford, 
commercial adviser of the British Embassy, 
in a communication to the foreign-trade ad- 
viser of our Department of State. Books in ! 
German or other language, from the enemies 
of Great Britain, and of a philosophical, scien- 
tific, technical, or educational character, will j 
be allowed to pass if destined for universities, 
colleges, or public bodies. Applications for 
the transmission of such freight should be 
vouched for, in respect to the good faith of 
the applicants, by some official authority. 
The Librarian of Congress has volunteered to 
act as this authority, and applications from 
those institutions desiring to import books 
otherwise subject to detention should be sent I 
to him. After satisfying himself of the ] 
applicant's good faith, the Librarian of Con- 
gress will give his official voucher, the appli- j 
cation will be forwarded to the foreign-trade ; 
adviser of the State Department, who in turn i 
will send it to the British Embassy at Wash- 
ington with an unofficial request that a permit 
for the shipment of the books in question be 
issued; and after a sufficient interval the 
books may actually be received. Thus is war 
a fertile producer of red tape as well as of 
other negatively valuable things. 



THE EXPLOSION OF A PRETTILY PATHETIC 
MYTH sends its reverberations from France to 
our shores. Mr. Alvan F. Sanborn writes 
from Paris to the Boston " Transcript " that 
the late Henri Fabre, variously known as the 
insects' Homer, the Lucretius of Provence, 
and (with gentle humor) the Sherlock Holmes 
of the bugs, was very far from being desti- 
tute, or anywhere near it, in his latter days, j 
Prizes in some abundance had been awarded 
him by the French Academy and the Academy j 
of Sciences, and these prizes took the form of ' 
cash, sometimes to the amount of five thou- 
sand francs. His books, too, developed a 
ready sale as their author's fame spread, and 
his family connections included persons (such 



as a councillor of the court of Mines) who 
were able and willing to assure him a com- 
fortable old age. Consequently he was no 
little vexed by the report, spread abroad by 
a journalist who interpreted his simple mode 
of life as an evidence of poverty, that the ven- 
erable naturalist was suffering actual want. 
The display of obtrusive solicitude and vulgar 
curiosity caused by this and like reports was 
exceedingly disagreeable to their victim, who 
resorted to various devices for the avoidance 
of a hateful publicity. After all, there was 
pathos in his later experiences, but not the 
pathos of poverty. 

A POREIGNEB'S TRIBUTE TO OUR LIBRARY SYS- 
TEM is always gratifying, as tending to prove 
that not invariably do "they order this mat- 
ter better in France," or even in Germany. 
Such a testimonial is made public in a New 
York journal, in the form of a letter ad- 
dressed to its editor in these terms : " Sir : 
May I be permitted, as a stranger in a strange 
land, to offer through the medium of your 
hospitable columns a word of appreciation of 
the excellent service furnished by the New 
York Public Library? The attaches thereof 
know me not from Noah's niece ; yet on more 
than one occasion have I consulted them, even 
by telephone, regarding more or less recondite 
matters. Ever have my queries been an- 
swered with courtesy, with accuracy yea. 
with erudition. And it seems but meet that 
I should herein and hereby offer my acknowl- 
edgments. Emanuel Elzas." To Europeans, 
familiar with the deliberation of their own 
library officials, the American quickness of 
response must come as a delightful revelation. 


THE HISTORY OF THE FUTURE, if we are to 
believe Mr. Edgar R. Harlan, Curator of 
Iowa's Historical Department, will be re- 
corded very largely on cinematograph films. 
Mr. Harlan is said to have collected already 
more than fifty thousand feet of such films, 
on which are photographed local events of im- 
portance occurring within the last three years ; 
and these ten miles or more of graphic his- 
tory are to receive regular additions, so that 
the Iowa schoolboy or schoolgirl of the future 
will learn the recent history of that state by 
sitting in front of a screen and keeping his 
or her eyes open. Of course this is no new 
application of the cinematograph. We have 
all seen some late memorable events, including 
perhaps battle scenes in France or Flanders, 
pictured on the screen. Other studies besides 
history surgery, for instance are now ad- 
vantageously pursued with the aid of moving 
pictures.

COMMUNICATIONS. 

EYESTBAIN AND LITEEATUEE: AN ILLUS- 

TEATIVE CASE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

For nearly a score of years I have persistently 
directed the attention of literary and medical men 
to the fact that what oculists call eyestrain has two 
morbid effects upon literature: it paralyzes lit- 
erary creativeness and morbidizes what is created. 
But it seems that I have labored in vain, at least 
so far as concerns my most prized literary journal, 
THE DIAL. I have, I judge, shown that a large 
number of literary men have in the past been 
afflicted in this way. At last, in the case of John 
Hay, we had an instance of positive and convinc- 
ing clearness; but your reviewer of Mr. Thayer's 
"Life and Letters" (issue of November 11, 1915) 
not only makes no mention of this striking and 
pitiful fact, but traces Hay's " desertion " of lit- 
erature and his unproductivity to his " mood and 
not the want of inborn ability." 

In order to make clear that the cause of Hay's 
literary unproductivity was not due to inethical 
lapse and want of literary idealism, will you spare 
me one or two of your pages for some quotations 
which will show that your reviewer should at least 
have more than mentioned his biographer's oft 
repeated citation of the real cause? 

At college there are two reasons why such an 
intellectual and ambitious young man as Hay 
would illustrate industry and good scholarship. 
How was it? Let us consider these quotations 
from Mr. Thayer's book : 

" He was never seen ' digging,' or doing any other 
act or thing that could be construed into hard study." 

" Throughout the autumn and winter, Hay experi- 
enced that disenchantment with the world, etc. . . 
It coincided with one of his periodic fits of melan- 
cholia." 

" If my health returns I do not question but that I 
shall work out of these shadows." 

" I can bear but I am sure to die soon." 

" There seems no doubt that he suffered from poor 
health that winter." 

Throughout Hay's life, and throughout the lives 
of the great majority of those who read and write 
a great deal, there are constantly recurring demon- 
strations that such near use of the eyes produces 
not only diseases of the eyes, but more decided 
diseases of the brain, of the general nervous and 
nutritional systems. Witness a few quotations 
referring to the dozen or more years from the age 
of thirty-eight to that of fifty. Soon after taking 
up editorial charge of the " Tribune," he writes : 
" see with what eyes are left me, and write till 
the time of the stereotypes comes," etc. 

" When Hay's own health was impaired, by night 
work on The Tribune, his abandonment of journalism 
followed." 

" Loose the fierce band that binds my tired brain ; 
Give me the melting heart of other years." 

" In life's high noon 
Aimless I stand, my promised task undone, 



And raise my hot eyes to the angry sun, 
That will go down too soon." 

" During much of his stay in Vienna his health had 
been bad, a reason for his wishing to come home." 

" Serious trouble with his eyes caused him to forego 
writing for several months. He seems to have suf- 
fered from what later oculists diagnose as eyestrain, 
which caused headaches, nervous dyspepsia, and de- 
pression." 

" Health so seriously impaired that the doctor told 
him he must lie off all summer." 

" At Schlangenbad, took the baths and was assured 
by Dr. Bauman, who looked him over, that ' there 
was nothing serious.' At Sehwalbaeh, Dr. Carl Genth 
examined his eyes, and ' saw no organic trouble what- 
ever.' " 

" While travelling through England and the Conti- 
nent, he was more quiet than in Cleveland." For a 
month or so on his return to Cleveland he " imagined 
he felt better," but " the other day I had the most 
ridiculous attack I have ever had I thought I was 
dead for half an hour. The doctor said it was noth- 
ing at all serious simply the effect of a cold. But 
I feel rickety yet. I have been trying my best to get 
to work again, with very indifferent success." 

" I have only one aspiration in life, to get out of 
office and stop having the headache." 

" I am still not well, and the doctor tells me not to 
be worried if I take a month more to get well in." 

" Manitou Springs or Colorado Springs became 
henceforth his chosen resorts for recuperation." 

" I saw some doctors who told me without collusion 
that if I would stay in Paris 40 days and take douche 
baths I would be well. They were both great swells 
and the coincidence of their views rather struck me. 
I remembered also that it took exactly the same time 
in Noah's day to cure the world of most of its infirmi- 
ties by the same method; and so, like an ass, I gave 
up, or rather, postponed, my trip to the South and 
went through my douches, with, of course, no result 
whatever. I went back to my doctors, and reported. 
One said: Better stop your douches! Go to Cannes 
and amuse yourself! You will soon be all right. 
Forty francs! Thank you! Goodbye! 

"The other said: Eh bien! Instead of six weeks, 
take three months of douches. Take them in Cannes, 
if you like, or in Nice; and with that he gave me an 
entire change of drugs; forty francs! Thank you, 
bon voyage! There was nothing Noachian about 
three months, so I came away determined to do noth- 
ing he told me." 

" I have been so inert and lifeless since I came over 
here [Paris] that I have not written a letter except 
on the stimulus of receiving one. I have never been 
so idle in my life. It was of set purpose, and I think 
it has been wholesome." 

" I was still rather miserable and at last went to 
two doctors, W. B., an American Egyptian, and the 
famous C., the same day. They both advised the same 
thing, douche baths, tonics, and bromides." 

" At your age Carlyle suffered precisely as you do, 
deep, nervous depression, persistent indigestion and 
loss of sleep a general disaster and irritation of the 
entire nervous system. His misery seems to have been 
of the keenest character. Yet he lived to be 86 years 
of age, and the last 25 years of his life were com- 
paratively healthy and free from pain." 

" Like the fever patient who, on his recovery, finds 
the morphine habit fixed upon him." 

" I do not know that I have much hope of ever 
improving my health, but the doctors give me the 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



13 



usual futile assurance that I will be better out of 
Washington in the summer time." 

" I had even written a few pages when I was struck 
with partial blindness. I have had numerous doctors 
at me almost ever since . . . hope by taking it easy 
this summer to be well next fall." 

" My old foe, the headache, is lying in wait for me, ! 
but I hope to get free. I write with great labor and j 
difficulty my imagination is all gone a good rid- 
dance. I shall never write easily and fluently again." 

" I found myself breaking down with the nervous 
fatigue of writing and copying. I therefore hired a 
stenographer. It is a great gain." 

" I am sick abed but the Doctor thinks I am gain- 
ing on him and will be out of his hands this week." 

" I have lost 10 pounds since June. I want to get 
done with this work " i. e., the Lincoln History. 

"When Hay was driven to dictation the foe to ; 
durable writing he further depersonalized his style." 

" There are lots of pretty things in this rickety old 
planet, if we could only have the enterprise to look 
for them and the nerves to enjoy them. But eheu 
fugaces I ought to have done my enjoying while the 
day lasted." 

" I shall work, not because I feel like it, but because 
I hate it, and because I feel that my time is waning." 

From the age of fifty on, as all oculists know, 
the loss of accommodation, or the progress of 
presbyopia, causes greater suffering and a greater 
inability to write and read. The following quota- 
tions bear ample witness : 

" 1 am a worthless creature destitute of initiative." i 

" The doctor tells me I have thermal fever, the re- ; 
suit of the baths." 

" My fool of a doctor has discovered another mortal 
malady in me, which tickled him very much, and dis- 
gusted me." 

" I get up with the impression that I will drop to 
pieces during the day." 

" All I lack is a stomach to eat and drink withal, 
eyes to see withal." 

" 1 am filled to the lips with the amari aliquid of 
age and infirmities." 

" I feel as though I should not look at anything 
much longer. I am getting a very bad pair of eyes 
on me." 

" I have developed two or three more mortal dis- 
eases since I came here and am going to New York 
next week for Vivisection. . . There is nothing like 
being given up by the Doctors. It is a certificate of I 
longevity." 

" His health, never robust, became more and more 
precarious under the strain [of routine office work]. 
More than once he was on the verge of breaking 
down." i 

" His health did not permit him to return to Wash- 
ington until October, 1900." 

" My short remnant of life, of little use to my 
friends, and none to myself." 

" His gradually failing health." 

" His health visibly declined for several months 
showed such alarming symptoms that his physicians 
prescribed for him a complete rest from official duties 
and treatment at Nauheim." 

" I tried to walk this afternoon, but it was tough 
work. By going very slowly and stopping often I was 
able to cover about a mile but the pain does not 
pass away as it used. It continued all the way home." 
He went to take the cure at Xauheim. 



" All the Doctors tell me I am going to get well but 
that it will be a matter of some months yet." 

" My doctor is an austere Bavarian, and does not 
mince matters. I asked why Eixey and Osier never 
discovered the hole, or rather bump, in my heart. 
He said: 'Perhaps they did not want you to know 
it; or perhaps they could not find it. There are few 
men in the world so sure of their affair as I am.' " 

It is now known by many oculists, and by more 
patients, that scientific correction of the defects of 
shape and function of the eyes of literary work- 
ers would not only avoid a vast deal of their suffer- 
ings, but would insure a greater and better 
literature. In none is " the mood " at fault, nor 
" the want of inborn ability," but primarily the 
unhealth of the eyes, and following this the sick- 
ness of the nervous and general systems.

AN INTERESTING BIT OF FOLK POETRY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Folk literature is always attractive, but I have 
seldom come across a more pleasing bit of it than 
a Christmastide poem which was given to me orally 
and which, at least so far as I have been able to 
ascertain, has never been printed. The woman who 
furnished it to me learned it from her mother nearly 
half a century ago, and the mother in turn seems to 
have obtained it in England. It is evidently one 
variant of a rather ancient original, as a poem hav- 
ing similar structure and embodying some of the 
same images was used by a group of English singers 
in this country several years ago. The latter, I 
think, has likewise remained unpublished. 

The poem suggests, as will be observed, an 
English origin. The conception of the twelve days 
of Christmas belongs to northern Europe, this being 
due, of course, to the fact that the period from 
Christmas Day to the Epiphany in the Christian 
year was a substitute for a similar period observed 
in late pagan times in honor of Odin and Freyja. 
The vocabulary of the poem is thoroughly English, 
as are also the ideas, indicating that the work is not 
a translation from another Germanic language. 

The origin of the poem, I should say, was in mid- 
dle or lower class society probably the former 
rather than among the nobility. The line, 

" Eleven lords a-leaping," 

shows almost as naive a conception of the aristoc- 
racy as do the counting-house king and the bread- 
and-honey-eating queen of the Mother Goose rhyme. 
The other gifts enumerated suggest somewhat the 
mercantile magnificence of a Renaissance burgher. 

The poem runs as follows : 

" On the first day of Christmas 
My truelove sent to me 
A beautiful juniper tree. 

" On the second day of Christmas 
My truelove sent to me 
Two turtledoves, 
Sitting in a beautiful juniper tree. 

" On the third day of Christmas 
My truelove sent to me 
Three French hens.

WOMEN IN THE BOOKSTOEES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The book-buying season is over for a year. Not 
until another Christmas comes round will the Gen- 
eral Public, which depends on libraries and avidly 
devours the cheaper magazines, have any appre- 
ciable use for. the bookstores. Meanwhile, let us 
adjure publishers, booksellers, college women, and 
all others interested in the survival of the private 
library and the resuscitation of the book trade, to 
recall, re-read, and ponder upon Mr. Earl Barnes's 
article in the August " Atlantic Monthly," entitled 
" A New Profession for Women." The new pro- 
fession is the ownership and management of book- 
stores, to be run on a very limited capital, by 
means of a benevolent "on sale" arrangement, 
made possible by intelligent publishers' interest in 
increasing their terminal facilities. I have, to be 
sure, scant faith in the publishers' seeing with Mr. 
Barnes's eye in this matter. His main proposal 
strikes us as a fantastic piece of chivalry to 
woman, that would soon put all the present book 
men out of business and leave the matter in a 
sorrier mess than it is now. But the value of 
women as bookclerks intelligent women, if not 
college-trained is another matter. Incidentally 
I would suggest to Mr. Barnes that the best prac- 
tical training for an educated woman who contem- 
plates running a bookstore is to help run one. 
The popularization of the woman bookclerk is an 
innovation I strongly advocate. This Christmas 
I bought part of my books in a country bookstore, 
where the proprietor's daughter, a college gradu- 
ate, is the presiding genius. This woman knew 
what books she had. She could furnish intelligent 
information about what she had not. She was 
acquainted) with everybody in her town; and her 
suggestions to local buyers were valuable and val- 
ued. This woman loves books and people; she 
puts her personality into the business of book-

selling, in a fashion at once typically feminine and 
essential in a business that cannot be taken imper- 
sonally. Her eager, patient, ingenious service 
made that subsequently furnished by the men in a 
city store seem capable and willing, but very cold 
and stodgy, unsuggestive and unenterprising. 
" Why don't you have some woman here?" I asked 
the proprietor, a man known in the trade for his 
intelligent and successful management of his 
business. " Why, I do n't know," he returned 
indifferently. " We had one, one Christmas. She 
disliked climbing the ladder to the upper stock- 
shelves. We never tried another; it's contrary to 
tradition." Now most book-buyers are women. 
Naturally they will establish closer, more helpful 
relations with saleswomen than with men. Women 
read more than men; they are usually defter at 
" skimming." Women are enthusiastic, and enthu- 
siasm is contagious. Therefore we believe that the 
educated woman's ability to increase book-buying, 
by intelligent service in bookstores, is worthy 
serious consideration from all persons interested in 
the issue. MARGARET ARMSTRONG.

LITERARY HONORS IX JAPAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I am not sure, but I think that it was the late 
Senator Matt Quay, at any rate it was some old 
political "boss," who referred disrespectfully, 
ungrammatically, and even profanely to " them 
d d literary fellers." He meant certain lit- 
erary men who had taken an active part in politi- 
cal affairs in opposition to some of his pet schemes 
or favorite methods of political pull. Anyhow, he 
expressed most vigorously the idea that such men 
were not worthy of honor or even of respect. 

I am glad, however, to be able to call attention 
to the fact that, in Japan, " literary fellers " are 
considered worthy of the Imperial favor, even of 
Imperial honor. The scholar, whether in politics 
or out of politics, is one whom " the king delight- 
eth to honor." For example, it may be noted that 
many coronation honors were conferred upon 
scholars and educators. And a special provision 
of the Constitution enables the Emperor to ap- 
point men of erudition to membership in the House 
of Peers. 

Among scholars and educators recently honored 
with decorations by the Emperor, in connection 
with the Coronation ceremonies, we find Presidents 
Amano and Kamada of Waseda and Keio Univer- 
sities, Tokyo; Dr. T. Harada, President of Dosh- 
isha University (Christian), Kyoto, and author of 
" The Faith of Japan " : President Naruse, of the 
Woman's University, Tokyo; Hon. S. Ebara, head 
of Azabu Middle School, Tokyo; Dr. K. Ibuka 
(Presbyterian) and Dr. S. Motoda (Episcopa-

scientific scholar as Dr. Takamine, of New York

all, posthumous honor was conferred upon the 
late Koizumi Yakumo, who is no other than 
Lafcadio Hearn! Posthumous honors were also 
; conferred upon other literary celebrities, or educa- 
tionalists, like Dr. Neeshima, founder of the 
Doshisha University; Mr. Obata, a former presi- 
dent of Keio University; Mr. Fukuchi, a well- 
known journalist and playwright; Dr. Nakamura, 
; translator of Smiles's "Self Help"; and other 
lesser lights of literature. Moreover, although the 
list of peerage honors is not yet published, it is 
known that Dr. Yamakawa, President of the Impe- 
rial University, Tokyo, and Dr. Hozumi, emeritus 
i law professor of the same university, and author 
j of works in English on " Ancestor- Worship," will 
] be honored with the rank of Baron. This is by 
i no means a complete list; but it is sufficient to 
show that, in Japan, " them literary fellers " are 
not deemed unworthy of high Imperial honors.

of ingratitude cannot be laid at the door of the

STILL MORE ABOUT DIPHTHONGS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In connection with my letter printed in your 
issue of Dec. 9, and the reply appended thereto, 
may I ask your indulgence to say : 

(1) That a discussion on the use of ties, or liga- 
tures, on certain phonetic symbols, to bring out 
diphthongal characteristics, is not one of phonetic 
values, no matter how many reams of paper or 
columns of print Mr. Wallace Rice may use in try- 
ing to prove it so. 

(2) That tie alphabet recommended by the Com- 
mittee of the National Education Association, for 
use in dictionaries and reference books, in Febru- 
ary, 1911, is a very different thing from the 
Standard Phonetic Alphabet recommended by the 
American Philological Association and the Spelling 
Reform Association in July, 1877, but Mr. Wallace 
Rice ably confuses both. 

(3) That the practise of all the great dictionaries 
may be ascertained by consulting the keys to the 
symbols which they use to indicate pronunciation. 
This is to indicate the diphthongs to which I re- 
ferred by using symbols that show the diphthongal 
characteristics already mentioned by (a) plain let- 
ters in combination; (&.) dots and dashes and 
curves and curlicues above and below the letters; 
(e) especially designed, sjinbols or Anglo-Saxon 
letters, as the edh and thorn. Here permit me to 
say that more than two thousand years ago, Seneca 
taught that " Practise is better than precept" No 
matter what precepts Mr. Wallace Rice may draw 
from the work of Dr. Murray's assistants, the fact 
remains that the practise followed by Dr. Murray 
was to use symbols which indicate diphthongal 
characteristics. 

(4) That nowhere in my book do I individually 
say " most phoneticists analyze this sound as a com-

bination of t and sh," as Mr. Rice asserts. It is 
true that the words appear upon page 291 of the 
book, but there they are quoted from the edition of 
" Webster's International Dictionary/' copyrighted 
1900, and reissued as " Webster's Revised Un- 
abridged Dictionary," copyright 1913. 

(5) That in 1791, John Walker started a discus- 
sion on the meaning of the word diphthong. Now, 
one hundred and twenty-five years later, Mr. Rice 
digs the skeleton of this discussion out of its grave 
and tries, very clumsily, to clothe it with flesh. No 
matter what Mr. Rice may think this word means, 
the fact remains that it has been defined by men 
who know. 

(6) That, although challenged to "promptly 
withdraw " my " statement that ' one of the mean- 
ings of the word diphthong is a combination of two 
consonants in one syllable/ " because Mr. Rice says 
" at least, no such meaning attaches to the word in 
the New English, the New International, the Cen- 
tury, the Standard," and other dictionaries which 
he tells us " are all I have had time to consult," I 
most respectfully decline to do so, and rest my case 
upon the following facts : 

"The Standard," 1913, (p. 715, col. 3) says: 
" diphthong, n. 3. A combination, especially an 
intimate one, of two consonants in one syllable." 

Murray's "New English Dictionary," 1897, 
(vol. 3, p. 383, col. 3) says: "diphthong, sb. 
(d) Applied to a combination of two consonants 
in one syllable (consonantal diphthong], espe- 
cially . . . such intimate unions as those of ch 
and dg 

"Webster's New International Dictionary," 
1909, (p. 628, col. 3), says: "diphthong, n. 4. 
A combination of two consonants in one syllable, 
esp. when blending intimately, as ch in chop." 

(7) Pitiful as my position concerning th may 
seem to Mr. Wallace Rice, the fact remains that we 
use the letters t and h in combination to represent 
two sounds. This is one of the points which the 
N. E. A. Committee on Phonetics sought to distin- 
guish when it recommended the use of ligatured 
symbols. Two hundred and seventy years ago Ben 
Jonson, in his " English Grammar,' r drew attention 
to this double use. Said he, Th Hath a double and 
doubtful sound, which must be found out by use of 
speaking . . and in this consists the greatest diffi- 
culty of our alphabet, and true writing." 

(8) That notwithstanding Mr. Rice's assertion 
that Dr. Wm. T. Harris "was not a phonetician," 
the fact remains that Harris was teaching phonetics 
in St. Louis in 1858, one year before Mr. Rice was 
born, and employed a phonetic alphabet in doing 
so in the public schools of St. Louis in 1866, when 
Mr. Rice was barely out of kilts. 

(9) That Henry Sweet never wrote any book enti- 
tled "A Primer of English Sounds" and that, 
therefore, I can scarcely acquaint myself with its 
" earlier paragraphs." 

(10) That Henry Sweet ceased to be the "most 
eminent of living phoneticians in English " April 
30,1912! 

(11) That Mr. Wallace Rice is altogether too 
modest. 



(12) Finally, that having provided Mr. Wallace 
Rice with an argument, I do not feel that I should 
be further obliged to find him an understanding.

THE LAST OF THE BRYANT CONTROVERSY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I do not wish to strain your hospitality by 
demanding further space in the Bryant contro- 
versy. Mr. Hervey wanted facts: I gave them, 
and since he cannot controvert them, he takes up 
two or three of your columns in sarcastic ques- 
tioning of my motives, ability, etc. That is not my 
way of conducting a discussion. I do not question 
Mr. Hervey's ability, or his sincerity and disinter- 
estedness, in his defence of Bryant. But since he 
will not credit me with, if not ability, at least sin- 
cerity and disinterestedness, I must request you 
and your readers to believe that I have been actu- 
ated in this matter, not by an impious malignity 
against the "mighty dead," but by certain ideals 
of my own which even Mr. Hervey has no right to 
question. The case of Bryant seems to me not 
individual but typical. As a young poet wrote to 
me recently : " I now see that Bryant is a symbol 
of everything that we moderns must sweep aside." 
(To forestall Mr. Hervey's rage or laughter over 
this " we moderns " and " sweep aside," I must 
plead that youth should be allowed a little arro- 
gance, and that this particular young poet proves 
his idealism by sacrifices for his art which Bryant 
at his age, by Mr. Hervey's admission, did not 
make.) 

But if Mr. Hervey and I have arrived at an 
impasse about Bryant, I trust we may be more 
fortunate on the subject of Mr. T. S. Eliot's 
" plagiarism " in the October number of " Poetry." 
It happens that I was familiar with the Meredith 
sonnet whose final line so neatly pointed Mr. 
Eliot's brief satire. As the very point of its use 
was the fact that it was quoted, it never occurred 
to me and no doubt I speak also for the poet 
to risk a delicately humorous situation by attempt- 
ing to intrude therein anything so obvious as quo- 
tation marks.

Meticulosity is perhaps an over-rated virtue ; still,

issue of THE DIAL for Dec. 9, (p. 550), credits 
Samuel Butler with the memorable and side split- 
ting verses of which the refrain is " Oh God. Oh 
Montreal." 

In behalf of the dumb shade of the late William 
Henry Hurlbert, I reclaim for him the honor of its 
authorship.

WITH JOHN Mum rx THE 

FLOWERS AXD ICE. 



OF 



To call John Muir a naturalist is literally 
exact, but misleading ; to call him a literary 
man seems grotesque. This sane, fundamen- 
tally normal man defies classification, fitting 
into none of our artificial categories. He did 
not write for the sake of writing ; the greater 
part of his rich life remains unrecorded. He 
did not study nature as a scientist, with the 
principal purpose of adding new records to 
the accumulations of the past. Highly cul- 
tured, eminently civilized and modern in one 
sense, he nevertheless regarded the world so 
naively that he reminds us of some prehistoric 
being, endowed with every human faculty, 
but unhindered by custom and tradition. In 
his writings, he constantly describes natural 
phenomena as the work of God, and with 
simple pantheism identifies the contemplation 
of nature with communion with the Almighty. 
It is this directness, this reliance on immedi- 
ate experience, which gives so much charm to 
his descriptions, and removes him so far from 
the professional writer on the one hand, and 
the ordinary scientific man on the other. He 
rarely quotes other writers; the great white 
glaciers and the flowery meadows remind him 
neither of the classical poets nor of the trans- 
actions of learned societies; there is little to 
come between him and his experiences. 

There is a natural tendency for an ordinary 
scientific worker, such as the present writer, 
to feel a certain impatience with John Muir. 
Notwithstanding all his contributions to our 
knowledge of the glaciers, and his illuminating 
descriptions of northern life, he seems to fall 
short of making and recording a thousand 
little discoveries which lay ready to his hand. 
Passionately fond of plant life, having a good 
knowledge of botany, might he not have given 
us a mass of exact information on the distri- 
bution of plants in the far north, in regions 
which few botanists, if any, have visited? 
Alaska is so vast, there is so much work to be 
done, and every real contribution is precious. 

Criticism of this sort is really unreasonable, 
for a man cannot be all things at once. Muir 
developed his nature on its strongest side, and 
we may be more than content that he was able 
to see so keenly, to love nature so warmly, and 
to communicate some measure of his emotions 
to us. Less endowed than he. we nevertheless

respond to the appeal, and in some poor meas- 
ure attain his freedom to enjoy. 

So far as at present appears, " Travels in 
Alaska " is John Muir s last book ; indeed, he 
was not able to complete it before his death. 
If other manuscripts exist, the fact seems not 
to be known. The work consists of three 
parts, one dealing with his first trip, that of 
1879, the second with the trip of 1880, and the 
third, unfinished, describing the voyage of 

; 1890. The descriptions relate not only to the 
scenery and wild life, but also to the Indians, 

I for whom Muir had the most genuine regard. 
These simple folk are shown to be capable of 
great degradation, under the influence of 

! whiskey and other products of " civilization " ; 

i but at their best, they may be nothing less 
than heroic. Thus among the Stickeens the 
doctrine of the atonement, which seems remote 
and vague to most modern Christians, was 

: readily accepted as the most natural thing, 

; for they understood it as part of their lives. 

j Not many years before there had been a feud 
between the Sitkas and the Stickeens, and a 
situation arose not wholly unlike that now 
existing in Europe. A Stickeen chief shouted 
across the lines that he wished to parley with 
a Sitka chief, and when the latter appeared 

; he said : " My people are hungry. They dare 
not go to the salmon-streams or berry-fields 
for winter supplies, and if this war goes on 
much longer most of my people will die of 
hunger. We have fought long enough; let 

; us make peace. You brave Sitka warriors go 
home, and we will go home, and we will all 
set out to dry salmon and berries before it is 
too late." The Sitka chief replied: "You 
may well say let us stop fighting, when you 
have had the best of it. You have killed ten 
more of my tribe than we have killed of yours. 
Give us ten Stickeen men to balance our 
blood-account ; then, and not till then, will we 

i make peace and go home." "Very well," re- 
plied the Stickeen chief, " you know my rank. 
You know that I am worth ten common men 
and more. Take me and make peace." John 

; Muir adds : " This noble offer was promptly 

! accepted ; the Stickeen chief stepped forward 
and was shot down in sight of the fighting 
bands. Peace was thus established, and all 
made haste to their homes and ordinary work. 
That chief literally gave himself a sacrifice for 
his people." It may be that to stop the Euro- 
pean carnage it will be necessary to sacrifice, 

, not the lives, but the positions or political 
prestige of certain chiefs; but no one expects 
such sacrifices to be made without compulsion.

accompanied Muir on his first two Alaskan 
journeys, and who owned the little dog

" Stickeen," which Muir has immortalized. 
He now tells the story from his point of view, 
and the twice-told tale only gains in interest 
from repetition. Self -revealing as Muir's own 
narrative is, we gain something new from 
another, regarding him objectively. Even 
had there been no Muir, Dr. Young's book 
would have held its own as an excellent con- 
tribution to the literature of travel. Selecting 
a single quotation, we take his account of the 
death of Tow-a-att, a chief of the Stickeens: 
" The Hootz-noos, maddened by the fiery liquor 
that bore their name, came to Wrangell, and a pre- 
liminary skirmish led to an attack at daylight of 
that winter day upon the Stickeen village. Old 
Tow-a-att had stood for peace, and rather than 
have any bloodshed had offered all his blankets as 
a peace offering, although in no physical fear him- 
self; but when the Hootz-noos, encouraged by the 
seeming cowardice of the Stickeens, broke into 
their houses, and the Christianized tribe, provoked 
beyond endurance, came out with their guns, Tow- 
a-att came forth armed only with his old carved 
spear, the emblem of his position as chief, to see 
if he could not call his tribe back again. At my 
instance, as I stood with my hand on his shoulder, 
he lifted up his voice to recall his people to their 
houses, when, in an instant, the volley commenced 
on both sides, and this Christian man, one of the 
simplest and grandest souls I ever knew, fell dead 
at my feet, and the tribe was tumbled back into 
barbarism; and the white man, who had taught 
the Indians the art of making rum, and the white 
man's government, which afforded no safeguard 
against such scenes, were responsible." 

There is a good map in Dr. Young's book, 
but none whatever in Muir's, a lamentable 
omission. Both books contain excellent illus- 
trations from photographs.

AMERICA'S INCORRIGIBLE YOUTH.* 

The absorbing subject of world discussion 
for the next generation is bound to be inter- 
nationalism, and the dominant issue the 
familiar issue between master-morality and 
slave-morality. It will be the old question of 
whether to struggle with Carlyle for the 
apotheosis of government, or to dream with 
Emerson toward the golden age of universal 
self -fulfilment. Europe has long been ready for 
the discussion, because all over Europe the idea 
of statehood has been clearly, though variously 
conceived. America, on the other hand, dur- 
ing a half century of reckless security has 
drifted into a befogged calm in which the 
engines have been checked to quarter speed, 
while all the crew are listening to a confusion

York : B. W. Huebsch. 



of danger signals and wondering what they 
mean. This is a commonplace of the day. 
Emerson foreshadowed it ; Moody stated it 
fairly in " Gloucester Moors. ' ' In such a 
strait any book is welcome which promises a 
chart of the seas, or even a dead-reckoning of 
the recent course. So the reader who likes 
to consider himself thoughtful will snap up 
Mr. Van Wyck Brooks's ''America's Coming- 
of-Age." 

At the outset the book is exhilarating. The 
opening chapter on " ' Highbrow ' and ' Low- 
brow/ " based on a remote yet visible past, 
discusses the chasm between the cultured 
idealist and the man of action, expounds 
Jonathan Edwards and Benjamin Franklin 
as determinants of American character, "in 
their amazing purity of type, and in the 
apparent incompatibility of their aims," and 
fetches up with the conclusion that traditional 
American education has done so little to 
bridge the gap that the modern university 
man is forced to choose between futile ideal- 
ism and the sordidness of commerce. With 
this well generalized and measurably true 
dilemma before him, the reader, thoroughly 
interested, looks ahead to find the way out; 
but he never gets out, for the remaining chap- 
ters triumphantly lead up to the Q. E. D. 
" there is no escape. " 

With reference to " Our Poets," over whom 
he skims in the second chapter, Mr. Brooks 
speaks in the habitual American self-dis- 
paragement which he himself condemns in 
his concluding pages. Emerson, Thoreau, 
Poe, and Hawthorne are imperishable posses- 
sions; but they "have not had the power to 
move the soul of America from the accumula- 
tion of dollars." The exertion of such a 
power would, of course, have been a fine 
achievement; but the implication in the in- 
dictment is that some other men have exerted 
just this power over some other nations, 
that America has remained ignoble while 
other peoples have become ennobled. It is a 
low retort, but in reply to the typical Amer- 
ican comment it is hard not to ask who the 
fortunate nation is. If Emerson failed in 
America, did Carlyle succeed in England, or 
Nietzsche in Germany, or Taine or Hugo in 
France? It hardly seems so. 

By the time Walt Whitman has been 
reached in the third chapter a disqualifying 
formula has denied all hope to all other Amer- 
icans. " Those of our writers who possessed a 
vivid personal talent have been paralyzed by 
the want of a social background, while those 
who have possessed a vivid social talent have 
been equally unable to develop their person-

alities." One begins anew to test the neat 
generalizations, and to think back to preced- 
ing chapters as apparently Mr. Brooks did 
not do. So when he finds (p. 112) concerning 
Whitman that "in him the hitherto incom- 
patible extremes of the American tempera- 
ment were fused," the reader recalls that it 
has already been asserted (p. 80) of Emerson 
that " the upper and lower levels are fused in 
him." and he is surprised to find that Emer- 
son has degenerated in thirty-two pages into 
the inhabitant of a "fastidiously intellec- 
tual . . shadow world." 

From this point on, Mr. Brooks is no longer 
disturbing; but he continues to be interesting 
as the miles gloriosus of the comedy. He 
asserts that the writers of popular novels 
" immitigable trash " could make literature 
out of American life, even though no one else 
has finely succeeded. He shows his contempt 
for the clergyman and the professor, but yet 
greater contempt for the men who have aban- 
doned teaching and preaching. Because Re- 
form is only a corrective, he turns it to scorn 
with the dictum that its ideal is the attain- 
ment of zero. He scouts Emerson's American 
choice of "Representative Men," but he ap- 
plauds Carlyle's group of "Heroes" made 
in England. He even between dashes 
denies humor to Mark Twain. But he makes 
his best hit when he lays low the author of 
" Inspired Millionaires " for not being logical. 
Mr. Lee should be careful ; he is making hon- 
est thinking in America nearly impossible ; he 
thinks on three or four levels at once; he 
knows nothing about life. This is interesting 
because on reading the earlier chapters it had 
occurred to us that Mr. Lee might represent a 
new and commendably American point of 
view. Then suddenly the sin of Lee is laid 
bare. He is not a Socialist. 

Now we begin to understand why Mr. 
Brooks reduces all civilization to three men 
in a tub, and America's coming-of-age to the 
maudlin inebriety of a youth who is at once 
celebrating marriage and majority. We un- 
derstand, but we do not approve, for we feel 
that it would have been franker of Mr. 
Brooks to declare his thesis instead of exe- 
cuting a flank movement on civilization by 
disqualifying all non-Socialists from any title 
to intellectual respect. 

It is unfortunate that in the end his suc- 
cession of lyric utterances should be so in- 
effectual, for he has not only a gift of brilliant 
speech, but a real though unbridled power of 
generalization. We are reminded, as we blink 
before his pyrotechnic pages, of the profound 
utterance of Professor Kittredge whom he 
would rule out as a detached " highbrow " 



that a roman candle is a brilliant light but a 
poor thing to go to bed by. We are forced to 
apply to "America's Coming-of-Age " what 
its author says of Whitman's output, that in 
its latter part it is "increasingly marred by 
much pomposity and fatuousness." 

Yet this much should be said in valedictory 
comment on the admirable closing chapter: 
Mr. Brooks contends that an intelligent un- 
derstanding of American life can be acquired 
only by means of genuine discussion; that 
discussion can thrive only where there are 
real issues; and that clear issues can be de- 
fined only when there has been created " a 
resisting background " against which the 
thinker can project his ideas. Mr. Brooks 
presents an issue that the constructive lit- 
erature and philosophy of the "highbrow" 
must be based on a recognition of economic 
fact, the stamping-ground of the " lowbrow." 
He presents it vigorously enough to arouse 
opposition. If he can go on increasing his 
audience and his opposition he may pro- 
mote that conflict of ideas which will educate 
America toward the coming-of-age to which 
he now looks forward with so little confidence.

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD ix 
EUROPE.* 

One hundred years ago last June the Con- 
j gress of Vienna completed its work, closing 
j that extraordinary chapter in European his- 
| tory known as the French Revolution. Dur- 
! ing the twenty-five years that lay between the 
! opening of the States General in Versailles in 
j May, 1789, and the assembling of the Congress 
! of Vienna in October, 1814, the social institu- 
tions of France had been transformed and 
those of the surrounding peoples largely modi- 
fied as the result of the upheaval in France. 
The great significance of the French Revolu- 
tion, opening as it did a new period in Euro- 
pean history, a period of equality before the 
law, of nationality and constitutional govern- 
ment, was early recognized, and men busied 
themselves with recounting its history. To 
judge by the large number of works that 
crowd the shelves of our libraries, one would 
be justified in saying that the last word had 
been written on the subject, or should have 
been written. The truth is that only the sur- 
face of the subject has been scratched, and 
the scholarly investigation of the history of 
the French Revolution is a thing of our gen- 
eration. The explanation is not far to seek.

THE DIAL 



[ Jan. 6 



Until the present generation of historians, 
historical writing was largely dominated by 
the tradition that history is a branch of lit- 
erature. The older historians of the revolu- 
tion, Thiers, Michelet, Lamartine, Taine, 
were not scientifically trained specialists, but 
literary artists whose ambition was to paint a 
brilliant picture of the revolution as a whole. 
Their knowledge of the sources was limited, 
their use of them uncritical, and their exposi- 
tions superficial and untrustworthy. Their 
works attracted the general public, and were 
extremely popular ; their defects were known 
only to the few. It was the revolt of these 
few that was to open the path to sound his- 
torical writing. They realized that the busi- 
ness of the historian was to ascertain the 
truth concerning man's social evolution, and 
that this task of ascertaining and presenting 
the truth was a thing of such infinite diffi- 
culty that no human life was long enough to 
make possible a thorough scholarly investiga- 
tion of the whole period of the French Revo- 
lution. It became clear to them that a sound 
synthesis of the whole revolution must rest 
upon a continuous series of monographs, the 
work of scholars who aspired to do no more 
than could be done thoroughly and critically. 
Thus the historical work upon the revolution 
entered upon a new stage, that of the scien- 
tific monograph. The sound knowledge of the 
revolution thus acquired soon discredited the 
older histories, but did not give birth to any 
new and comprehensive expositions of the 
revolution as a whole. To the uninitiated, 
historical writing had entered upon a period 
of anarchy; the historian appeared to have 
lost his large vision, and seemed to be inter- 
ested only in microscopic research. This was, 
of course, not true, and from time to time a 
new synthesis has been attempted to mark the 
progress that has been made and to make 
accessible to the public the results of the spe- 
cial investigations. This is the justification 
of Professor Bourne's volume on " The Revo- 
lutionary Period in Europe." 

It is supposed to be a college text-book, but 
it is something more than that: it is without 
doubt the best brief account in the English 
language of the French Revolution and the 
Napoleonic period. That is not equivalent to 
saying that it contains the last word on the 
revolutionary period, and that it will not in 
time be outgrown as the monographic litera- 
ture on the period increases; but what we 
wish to say is that Professor Bourne's book, 
better than any other volume of the same size, 
acquaints us with the present state of sound 
historical knowledge on the period he treats. 
It is not primarily the work of a text-book 



maker. For something like a quarter of a 
century, Professor Bourne has been a close 
and critical student of the revolutionary 
period, and especially of the French phase of 
it; a good part of the scientific studies pub- 
lished in this country on the revolution has 
come from him. He is acquainted not only 
with the monographic work on the period, but 
with the sources on which these monographic 
works rest. The general reader, looking for 
an introduction to the revolutionary period, 
could find no more trustworthy guide than 
this volume. 

It was a large canvas that Professor Bourne 
undertook to fill, and he has filled it with 
unusual success. The limits of the period are 
the close of the Seven Years War and the 
Congress of Vienna. Within this period took 
place the greatest revolution in European 
history. In twenty-seven chapters, beginning 
with " The People and the Old Regime " and 
ending with " The Restoration in France and 
Europe," Professor Bourne describes the state 
of Europe on the eve of the revolution ; the 
course of the revolution in France, with the 
reconstruction of French institutions; the 
struggle between France and Europe, with 
the rise and fall of the Napoleonic empire. 
It is especially his treatment of the changes 
wrought by the revolution in France and in 
Europe that distinguishes Professor Bourne's 
volume from its forerunners. Chapters like 
those on "Revolutionary Reorganization," 
" The Finances and the Church," " Imperial- 
ism and Bankruptcy," and " The Continental 
System," revealing as they do the author's 
acquaintance with the best monographic work 
on the topics, are not to be found in other 
short works on this period. The chapters are 
not only new and fundamentally important, 
but they are well done. We do not mean to 
imply that the volume as a whole is beyond 
criticism ; Professor Bourne himself would be 
the last to claim that. He could not lean on 
monographic work where such work does not 
exist; and when such aid fails, the work of 
the scholar necessarily becomes superficial. It 
would not be difficult for the specialist to pick 
flaws in the part of the present work with 
which he is familiar ; it would be more diffi- 
cult for him to construct a sounder synthesis 
of the whole subject than Professor Bourne 
has given us. 

One of the best things in the volume is the 
bibliography, a sufficient proof of Professor 
Bourne's wide reading and excellent critical 
judgment. It is not a potpourri of all that 
has ever been printed on the subject, but a 
carefully selected list of the best monographs 
and the most important sources, such a list

as could be made only by the trained scholar 
who has familiarized himself with the litera- 
ture through long years of study. Some titles 
are missing, but on the whole it is incom- 
parably the best bibliography on the period 
of the revolution to be found in any single 
volume of the same size.

A PANEGYRIC OF Music.* 



The author of "Hermaia" considers music 
as the ultimate and comprehensive art; the 
other arts, architecture, sculpture, painting, 
and poetry, lead up to music, and find their 
consummation in it. Music is the latest art 
to appear in the progress of mankind, because 
it is the most complex, the most intimate, the 
most embracing. Mr. McAlpin gives to this 
art the precedence which he believes to be its 
right, and the major part of his book is de- 
voted to an explanation of its importance and 
position. This explanation is presented with 
a completeness and skill that leave little to be 
desired. 

The point of view which the author holds 
will be made clear by the following quota- 
tion: 

" ' The man is only half himself ; the other half 
is his expression.' So writes Emerson; and, need- 
less to say, we are here concerned solely with this 
other half of man. And that, moreover, in a very 
specific sense, since much of his expression is, 
strictly speaking, not necessarily of the artistic. 
Yet not only man, but nature also, both animate 
and inanimate, abounds with expression. And 
that too, quite apart from purposes of utility. It 
is beauty for its own sake. We conclude, there- 
fore, that this same initial and divine impulse, 
which cannot but create the beautiful, reappears 
in man as a spiritual necessity. Indeed, he alone, 
amongst sentient creatures, has built up for him- 
self a self-contained world of beauty. And within 
this universe of art we shall discover order and 
arrangement, such as is discoverable in any other 
department of existence where the principle of 
development has wrought it up into an indepen- 
dent activity. Thus with man art becomes expres- 
sion for its own sake." 

The " expression for expression's sake " 
theory of art is diametrically different from 
the " art for art's sake " theory. The empha- 
sis in the former is placed upon the content; 
in the latter it is placed upon the form. The 
former distinctly proceeds upon the assump- 
tion that all art has something to say; while 
the latter is entirely satisfied with outline and 
color and rhythm for the pure pleasure to be j

McAlpin. New York : E. P. Dutton & Co. 



found in them. The end of art in both cases 
lies within itself, and utilitarian considera- 
tions have nothing to do with it. 

In his chapter entitled " The World of 
Expression," Mr. McAlpin says: 

" Now, where there is expression, it is obvious 
that there must be something expressed. And the 
man of art, while obedient to the constitutional 
law of art itself, is free to draw upon entire ex- 
istence for his subject-material. Broadly speak- 
ing, all reality may become the artistic model for 
expression. . . Now since art, however creative, 
cannot but reflect reality, we shall find reality 
exercising a reflex influence upon the domain of 
art itself. Thus if we set the world of idealism 
and realism alongside of each other, we shall be 
able to read off the features of reality as reflected 
in the mirror of man's artistic consciousness. But 
since man is neither more nor less than his own 
consciousness, we may say that art is the ideal 
expression of real experience. Art, then, may .be 
said to be the reflection of total existence. We 
shall view, therefore, the world of art as one mas- 
sive, organic unity." 

This world of art, the idealization of ex- 
istence and experience, has its divisions, just 
as the realistic world of being and life has its 
divisions. These divisions are, of course, 
coordinate, and the divisions of art corre- 
spond to those of reality. 

" The world of art is total reality appearing in 
the imagination from plastic art, which reflects 
appearance, to music, which is the ideal reflection 
of that which underlies appearance. And if we 
consider how creation was built up from the 
inanimate to the animate, and how the realm of 
creativeness has been built up from the arts of 
plasticity to music, the progress from stones to 
souls in the real world will not appear greater 
than the progress made from the pictorial art, 
through poetry, up to the tuneful art, in the ideal 
world. . . Roughly speaking, painting expresses 
man's body, poetry his mind, while music is ex- 
pressive of his soul. They are, respectively, the 
physical, mental, and spiritual arts, material- 
ism, mentalism, and moralism in the language of 
beauty." 

It will be noted that there is here no men- 
tion of architecture or sculpture. These seem 
to be excluded from the author's considera- 
tion of art as art. He nowhere gives what 
may be regarded as sufficient reason for this 
remarkable omission. In one place he says : 

" Now, respecting the above [the world of art] , 
it need hardly be said that we treat of the main 
outstanding branches of beauty alone, such as 
automatically allot themselves to the major king- 
doms of reality, so we shall have nothing 1 to say 
about either decorative art, or even architecture in 
this connection. Plastic beauty, which, analogous 
to the manifold in material nature, covers sa wide 
an area, will be here represented by painting 
alone."

[ Jan. 6 



The exclusion of architecture and sculpture 
from " a study in comparative aesthetics " 
seems scarcely warranted, and appears to 
result from an over-appreciation of certain 
theoretical considerations which are, perhaps, 
susceptible of a larger and more inclusive 
interpretation. 

Accepting, however, what seems the author's 
rather needless circumscription of his theme, 
we find his triple differentiation of value and 
importance. He confines the plastic arts to 
painting, and he thus describes the field and 
function of the pictorial art : 

"Painting is, then, universal art in its infancy. 
It deals with the objective, and satisfies the early 
dawn of the artistic mind with palpable pictura- 
bility. It is, as we have already seen, the first 
mental act in art. First of all the outer world 
beats on our senses, and is followed by the awak- 
ening of the inner mind. The child attends pri- 
marily to the visibly external. And similarly the 
painter attends solely to the object, while later on 
the poet will be seen to think about it. The 
painter only imagines, while the poet both thinks 
and imagines." 

The second stage in the development of 
universal art, as our author sees it, is poetry. 

" In passing now from painting to poetry we 
pass in reality from visible things to invisible 
thoughts; from image to imagining and from 
symbol to sentiment; from similitude to simile, 
and from figures to figures of speech. Or again, 
if painting be assthetic perception, then poetry 
becomes literally aesthetic apperception. And in 
this translation of the beautiful, we are enabled 
to lay hold of, as material for art, that immeas- 
urable wealth of suggestion which arises from the 
artistic apprehension of apparent experience ex- 
ternal to ourselves. Indeed the poet can add his 
own personal consciousness or maybe his private 
experience to the artistic material of the painter. 
What, therefore, was merely suggestion in paint- 
ing, becomes now the actual matter of artistic 
expression. Poetry thus mediates between paint- 
ing and music: painting is the artistic reproduc- 
tion of external experience, music the artistic 
reproduction of internal experience; poetry the 
artistic reproduction of both in organic unity." 

Music, expressive of the supreme internal 
experience and ascending to heights which are 
inaccessible even to poetry in its best estate, 
is at once the final and all-comprehensive art. 
If it cannot idealize nature as painting does, 
it can give the sentiment of nature with end- 
less suggestions, as painting cannot do; if it 
cannot give human life in its infinite phases 
as poetry does, it can give the universal splen- 
dor in which both nature and man live and 
move and have their being, as poetry cannot. 

" Music is therefore the expression of our spir- 
itual consciousness. It breaks up at once that 
social segregation which is the cause of moral dis- 



cord. It reveals ideally the underlying oneness of 
all spirits. It does not speak so much of the per- 
sonal sense of self which limits and estranges, but 
rather of the higher impersonal sense of divinity 
within." 

The author's thesis is maintained through- 
out his large volume with unflagging vigor 
and insight. The whole realm of the know- 
able seems to have been put under contribu- 
tion to furnish arguments and illustrations. 
Music has never received an exposition loftier 
or more elaborate. Fully half the volume is 
given up to the supreme art, as is but just 
from Mr. McAlpin's view. The diction almost 
bewilders in its richness and profusion. The 
reader may not be willing fully to accept the 
author's conclusions, for poetry lies very close 
to most of our hearts. Mr. McAlpin acknowl- 
edges that poetry spans both the inner and 
outer spheres; and he calls the drama, ideal- 
ized with music, the chief achievement in art. 
But the sweep of the analysis, the movement 
of the thought, the cumulative force of the 
argument, bear on irresistibly to the conclu- 
sion. The book is a significant contribution 
to the subject of which it treats, and musi- 
cians will find in it justification for their 
highest claims. ^^ JAMES BLOCK> 



MADAME DE STAKI/S Cur/ruRAi, 
MISSION.* 



A book of unusual interest to the student 
of comparative literature is Professor Jaeck's 
"Madame de Stael and the Spread of Ger- 
man Literature." The author has traced the 
diffusion of German culture and letters in 
France, England, and America, as well as 
German influence upon the literatures of, 
these countries. Curiously enough, the book 
appears just a century after Mme. de Stael's 
"De 1'Allemagne," in times as war-like as 
those in which the latter was written. To the 
France of 1813, decadent in literature and 
lulled into a sense of superiority by the suc- 
cess of her arms abroad, the new Germany 
and German literature of "De I'Allemagne" 
was a revelation. Professor Jaeck's book not 
merely emphasizes anew the fundamental 
ideas of " De I'Allemagne," but also describes 
the effect of its message upon the world. It 
ought to be of peculiar interest at this time, 
and in a country where Germany is as little 
understood as it was in the France of 1813. 

After outlining briefly the state of the 
knowledge of German literature at the close 
of the eighteenth century, the author takes

up successively Mme. de StaeTs revolt against 
French classicism, her interest in German 
literature, and the genesis and writing of 
" De 1'Allemagne." The chapter on " Essen- 
tials of German Culture in 'De 1'Allemagne" 
is possibly the most noteworthy in the book. 
It takes on a special significance when we 
appreciate that the ideas it embodies were 
expressed by a Frenchwoman educated in the 
atmosphere and traditions of French classi- 
cism. Realizing the decadence toward which 
the intellectual and moral life of France was 
drifting. Mme. de Stael became one of the 
most penetrating and fearless critics of 
French civilization. In "De la Litterature 
considered dans ses Rapports avec les Institu- 
tions sociales." written as early as 1800, she 
had already pointed out the results of eight- 
eenth century materialism and rationalism 
upon the intellectual and social life of her 
country. French literature, in her opinion, 
was menaced not only by monotony, frigidity, 
and sterility, but by forces even more to be 
feared. irony and ridicule. All sentiments 
and actions were gauged by these criteria of 
the fashion; until love, enthusiasm, relig- 
ion, every sentiment except selfishness, 
was undermined. In this book, Mme. de 
Stael did not hesitate to maintain that such 
conditions were the result of a false philoso- 
phy of life. 

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
in the disappointment at the apparent fail- 
ure of the French Revolution, a feeling that 
humanity had arrived at a stage of senility 
was becoming general. Searching for the 
fountain of youth that might rejuvenate 
European civilization, which was in effect 
French. Mme. de Stael at length discovered 
it in the poetry and philosophy of Germany. 
" In the writings of the Germans." she re- 
marks in " De rAllemagne," " we seem to feel 
a new youth arising." In order to find the 
secret of the youthfulness of German litera- 
ture, she carefully analyses the new German 
culture which, unknown to the rest of the 
world, had developed during the eighteenth 
century and which culminated in a fresh 
ideal of man and a new attitude toward the 
world. The basic feature of this attitude, and 
of the German mind in general, is what she 
calls the latent and forceful enthusiasm of 
the German Gemiit. It is here that the imagi- 
nation, the idealism, and the religious feeling 
which characterize German literature and 
philosophy are rooted. With deep psycho- 
logical insight Mme. de Stael recognized that 
a rejuvenation of character and culture could 
come only if enthusiasm, imagination, feeling, 
morality like those of Germany became living 



forces in the French character. As her coun- 
try's need was pressing, she considered it her 
duty as a patriot to show France these quali- 
ties in Germany and its culture. She thus 
became not only the first great interpreter of 
the spirit of the new German culture, but 
she became also the inaugurator of a new 
cultural life. 

It is the second part of Professor Jaeck's 
book that offers the greatest amount of new 
material, especially in regard to the history 
of American literature. The author has set 
herself the task of pointing out how through 
"De rAllemagne" German literature, hith- 
erto unappreciated because of great tempera- 
mental differences, became an active force in 
the world. She has assembled as witnesses 
an imposing number of writers distinguished 
in their national literatures, Gautier, Mns- 
set, Sabatier. in France; Coleridge, Scott, 
Byron, Carlyle, in England; Ticknor, Ever- 
ett, Emerson, and Longfellow, in America. 
These and countless others have paid tribute 
to the inspiration they received from German 
literature. In American literature, particu- 
larly, from its earliest beginnings to the pres- 
ent time, scarcely a writer can be found who 
has not at some period of his career felt the 
force of the German spirit. Bancroft's words 
of seventy years ago have lost none of their 
force: "It cannot be denied that German 
literature has come to exercise a great influ- 
ence upon the intellectual character of Eu- 
rope and America. "We may lament over this 
fact or rejoice at it, according to our several 
points of view, but we cannot disguise from 
ourselves its existence." It is in recalling this 
to America, in a day when there is a tendency 
to reject all things German, that Professor 
Jaeck has done her greatest service. It would 
be unfortunate, indeed, were we, in the words 
of Mme. de Stael, to erect a Chinese wall 
around American literature in order to pre- 
vent the penetration of any ideas from with- 
out. As she well said, " In all countries the 
hospitality which welcomes foreign thoughts 
and sentiments brings good fortune to the 

host " M. GOEBEL. 



Dr. Theophilo Braga, ex-president of the Portu- 
guese Republic, has written a preface to an an- 
thology of Portuguese poems which will shortly 
be issued by the Oxford University Press under 
the title "Portugal." The translations into En- 
glish of the fifty selected poems have been made 
by Mr. George Young; the arrangement is chrono- 
logical, beginning with ballads of the Moorish 
occupation and ending with revolutionary songs 
of the present day.

RECENT POETRY.* 

The most distinguished name on our list of 
recent verse is that of Maeterlinck; but the 
poems are not new, save in their English 
form, being in fact translations of the con- 
tents of the early volume called " Serres 
Chaudes," it is annoying that Mr. Miall 
does not give us its exact date. They ante- 
date, therefore, all but the very earliest of the 
plays, and carry us back to the days when the 
beautifully colored but obscurely outlined 
symbolistic work of Maeterlinck was winning 
the attention of the world of letters. The 
"Hot Houses" will seem familiar enough to 
readers of " The Princess Maleine " and " The 
Seven Princesses," even though they may not 
have seen the poems in French. Here is the 
same stage-setting, of 

" flowers without a hue, 
Lilies that under the moonlight fade, 
Moonlight over the meadows laid, 
Fountains far on the sky-line blue ; " 

and the same succession of poignantly stirring 
but wholly mysterious occurrences: 

"All the lovely green rushes of the banks are in flames 
And a boat full of wounded men is tossing in the 

moonlight ! 
All the king's daughters are out in a boat in the 

storm ! 
And the princesses are dying in a field of hemlock! " 

The difference is chiefly that of form, and 
one is interested to note the effects accom- 
plished by English versions of the two chief 
metrical types used by the poet: the "In 
Memoriam " quatrain, and free rhythms 
which oddly employ the cumulative cata- 
loguing method of Walt Whitman for the 
fragile materials of Maeterlinck. Mr. Miall's 
translations leave almost nothing to be de- 
sired. He holds faithfully to the characteris- 
tic Maeterlinckian blend of simplicity and 
subtlety, of the colloquial and the elaborate; 
and he is also singularly happy in keeping to

English verse form while avoiding strongly 
marked rhythms which would be foreign to 
his material. It appears from a remark in 
the Preface that he is disposed to dislike the 
" In Memoriam " stanza in its iambic form, 
and to think it improved by an occasional 
change to trochaic cadences; and, though I 
cannot share his prejudice, I gladly admit 
that he has obtained some charming effects 
by the experiment. One example of these is, 
I think, the best of the lyrical versions in the 
collection; it is called "Heart's Foliage": 

" 'Neath the azure crystal bell 
Of my listless melancholy 
All my formless sorrows slowly 
Sink to rest, and all is well ; 

" Symbols all, the plants entwine : 

Water lilies, flowers of pleasure, 
Palms desirous, slow with leisure, 
Frigid mosses, pliant vine. 

" 'Mid them all a lily only, 

Pale and fragile and unbending, 
Imperceptibly ascending 
In that place of leafage lonely 

" Like a moon the prisoned air 

Fills with glimmering light wherethro' 
Eises to the crystal blue, 
White and mystical, its prayer." 

A second volume of translated verse is by 
Lord Curzon, in this case representing a 
variety of sources. The leading poems con- 
cern the present war, and are from the Bel- 
gian poet, Cammaerts; here one is likely to 
turn first to the dreadful New Year's Prayer 
better called a Curse addressed to the 
German army, which has already been widely 
reprinted, sometimes under the mistaken im- 
pression that it was original with the trans- 
lator. I do not find much significance in any 
of this group of versions; the style of the 
noble lord does not lend itself readily to the 
difficult union of fervor and directness of 
speech which is demanded for subjects of cur- 
rent public concern, and his rhythm and 
rhyme sometimes lead him from the straight 
and narrow way with unhappy results, as. 
when he renders 

" Et que vous erriez eperdus comme des betes" 

by 

" Fear drive you like brute beasts that squeal." 
More agreeable are the miscellaneous transla- 
tions forming the second part of the volume, 
which represent the age-long recreation of 
the cultivated Englishman the rendering of 
classical beauties in verse of his own tongue. 
Even here there are few specimens which I 
should not suppose could be paralleled in 
most of the vicarages of the kingdom. Per- 
haps because of pleasant memories of the ode 
in other days, I find most appealing Lord 
Curzon's rendering of Horace's 



1916] 



THE DIAL

" Diffugere nives, redeunt jam gramina campus," 
the alternating rhythms of which are not un- 
skilfully imitated in lines like these : 
" Who can tell if the gods will increase by the grant 

of to-morrow 

What has been counted to-day! 
Greedy thy heir, but of all thou hast given the self 

that thou lovest 
Nought can he carry away. 
Once thou art perished and gone, and, high on his 

stately tribunal, 
Minos has uttered thy doom, 
Eloquence, goodness, and birth, Torquatus, will not 

avail thee 
E'er to return from the tomb." 

Mr. Chesterton's new volume is opened by 
a portrait which gives real joy in its rep- 
resentation of the robust and whimsical 
personality of the author. For a current En- 
glish collection, the work of a journalist, it is 
rather noticeably lacking in matter that con- 
cerns the war. The greater portion is devoted 
to poems of love, religion, and the social and 
political themes which inspire Mr. Chester- 
ton's familiar editorials. This last group con- 
tains some trenchant satire such as one would 
hopefully look for the best of it worthy of 
a Dry den or a Canning. I have found chief 
joy in some lines addressed to the Rt. Hon. 
Walter Long, though I know nothing what- 
ever about the Right Honorable gentleman 
save that he once uttered some words on 
revolution which drew Mr. Chesterton's blade 
from its scabbard : 

" If I were wise and good and rich and strong 
Fond, impious thought, if I were Walter Long 
If I eould water sell like molten gold, 
And make grown people do as they are told, 
If over private fields and wastes as wide 
As a Greek city for which heroes died, 
I owned the houses and the men inside 
If all this hung on one thin thread of habit, 
I would not revolutionize a rabbit! 

" Walter, be wise ! avoid the wild and new. 
The Constitution is the game for you. 
Walter, beware ! scorn not the gathering throng. 
It suffers, yet it may not suffer wrong, 
It suffers, yet it cannot suffer Long! " 

But the surprises of the volume, to those who 
know Mr. Chesterton only as essayist wield- 
ing humor, satire, and paradox as his hourly 
weapons, and have not realized the roman- 
ticism and lyricism that underlie his nature, 
will be found in the poems on love and relig- 
ion. There is a Marriage Song, for example, 
in which paradox and hyperbole are satu- 
rated with passion : 

" Why should we reck of hours that rend 

While we two ride together? 
The heavens rent from end to end 

Would be but -windy weather; 
The strong stars shaken down in spate 

Would be a shower of spring. 
And we should list the trump of fate 
And hear a linnet sing." 



Most of the religious lyrics are Christmas 
carols; and they take us back to the ardent 
singing of Crashaw, though touched always 
with the consciousness of man's most recent 
struggles for and against his traditional 
faiths. 

" The child that played with moon and sun 
Is playing with a little hay," 

this is the old conceit of the Catholic lyrists; 
but a moment later comes the paradox of the 
modern Wise Men : 

" So very near the Manger lies 
That we may travel far." 

The finest of these carols is called " The House 
of Christmas/' and I am sorry that I can find 
space here for only the concluding stanzas: 
" This world is wild as an old wives' tale, 
And strange the plain things are, 
The earth is enough and the air is enough 
For our wonder and our war ; 
But our rest is as far as the fire-drake swings, 
And our peace is put in impossible things 
Where clashed and thundered unthinkable wings 
Round an incredible star. 

" To an open house in the evening 
Home shall men come, 
To an older place than Eden 
And a taller town than Rome; 
To the end of the way of the wandering star, 
To the things that cannot be and that are, 
To the place where God was homeless 
And all men are at home." 

Very different are the religious lyrics of 
Mr. William K. Fleming. In entering his little 
volume we pass from the region both of 
ardent passion and intellectual strife to one 
of mysticism and of peace. His Christmas 
carol is of the simple joy and faith of child- 
hood ; his deeper notes of the quiet hopes of 
the soul seeking its native country. Without 
salient achievement of any kind, his verse is 
saved from mere obviousness by the dignity 
of the personality it represents, and by an 
almost impeccable taste. That is, it main- 
tains the best traditions of the Anglican lyric 
of the spirit. A good example of its capacity 
to represent at once its writer's pleasure in 
the visible and the invisible world is found in 
the poem called " Essex in March " : 

" The long, lean hills of Essex, and the grey 
Salt marshes, and a wind that all the day, 

With chant of thousand tongues, 
Roared thro' the high elms on its coastward way. 

" And in my heart a voice that cried to me : 
' O'er thy trim fields of life, immune, unf ree, 

There peals the Song of songs, 
Of souls insurgent for their native sea.' " 

The same publisher who brings out Mr. 
Fleming's verses has initiated a series called 
"Little Books of Georgian Verse." under the 
editorship of Miss Gertrude Ford. One may 
suppose that it is intended in some sense as 
an answer or antidote to the series issued by

be more conventional and discreet in both 
form and content; and Miss Ford lays em- 
phasis (in her Introduction) on a desire to 
discover poets representing the continuity of 
the English tradition, the line of Milton 
and Wordsworth and Tennyson, as distin- 
guished from "iconoclasts with studied striv- 
ings after originality." To some of us this 
declaration of principles sounds wholly rea- 
sonable; yet of course, in considering how it 
works out, one is brought face to face again 
Avith the perennial problem of art, how to 
represent the sound tradition and at the same 
time make an individual offering worthy of 
distinct attention. I regret that Miss Ford 
should not have found verse of more distinc- 
tive intrinsic significance than that contained 
in the two opening issues of the series. One 
is by Lieutenant C. A. Macartney, of the 
" New Army," and we cannot avoid the suspi- 
cion that we are invited to look on his poems 
more sympathetically because he is a young 
hero of the hour; the other is announced as 
the work of a girl of sixteen, and again there 
is an inevitable disposition to judge it as re- 
markable under tine circumstances. In Lieu- 
tenant Macartney's verses I find little that 
leads me to do more than wish him well. The 
other collection, by Miss Mona Douglas, is 
decidedly more interesting. The author is a 
Manx girl, evidently of delicate sensibilities 
for all the aspects of nature, and with a more 
than ordinary gift for metrical expression. 
One hopes, of course, that her work will tell 
us something distinctive of her special en- 
vironment, and there are bits of Manx legend 
and Manx landscape which she has caught up 
with a true sense of their values ; in general, 
however, she has been learning from litera- 
ture rather than life, and this is quite as it 
should be in her 'prentice days. It is as 
promise and suggestion of more distinctive 
work hereafter that the little volume is to be 
valued. And perhaps Miss Ford purposes 
frankly to make use of this new series as 
seed-plot and testing-ground for poetry which 
is to be viewed as potentiality rather than 
achievement; if so, we can heartily approve 
it. I find the most attractive of the verse 
thus far given us to be in these stanzas from 
a lyric in Miss Douglas's collection, called 
"Moods": 
" Dawn on the hills, and a breeze across the heather, 

Lark-songs that fall from the solitudes of blue ; 
Haze on the bogs with their tufts of golden feather, 

And a light that makes the whole world new. 

" Dusk on the hills, and the shadows on the heather, 
Ripples of flame on the waters far away; 



Light on the crags, where the cattle roam together 
In the glory of the dying day." 

For American verse I turn first to the col- 
lection of Mrs. McGiffert's poems, opening 
with "A Florentine Cycle." To speak truly, 
it is a volume of the type which tends danger- 
ously to tempt the reviewer to shut his eyes 
to its many points of excellence. It is too 
long, to begin with: it is long without rea- 
son ; it might as well have been much longer, 
or more happily half as long; it im- 
presses one as containing all that the author 
has thought of committing to verse day by 
day for many, many days. She has travelled 
widely, and wherever she has gone a series of 
admirable quatrains has recorded her impres- 
sions; she has studied the history of the 
regions she has passed through, and been 
fascinated to find that all the proper names 
thus turned up can, with a little dexterity, 
be wrought into her quatrains. She has 
looked on the cherubs of della Robbia, on the 
Torso Belvedere, on a silver bowl of Cellini's, 
on an Alsatian village, and for each has had 
a pleasant thought which she has expressed in 
what may be truly if tritely called well- 
chosen words. As companion in travel, or 
correspondent, I should suppose her charm to 
be rather notable. But one seeks almost in 
vain for the lyrical intensity, the really pene- 
trating imaginative flash, which alone will 
justify beyond question the making of so 
much verse, or no, I do not mean the mak- 
ing of it, but the printing or the reading of 
it. Mrs. McGiffert thinks well clearly and 
firmly, as well as pleasantly, and there are 
epigrams and sonnets which are admirable 
for their outline and their definitiveness. 
For example: 

"A fleeting rose-bud crave eternal life, 
With its own loveliness unsatisfied? 
Is perfume of its passing not enough? 
Has one least rose-bud ever really died? " 

But even this quatrain suggests a notable 
defect of the writer's verse, considering that 
one is driven to look at it so largely from the 
standpoint of fine formal artistry: her pov- 
erty of rhymes. The greater portion of the 
collection is in quatrains, and I have not 
noted a poem in which she completes the 
rhyme in the odd-numbered lines. This is no 
trifle; for the whole story of our verse goes 
to show that, while you may use the imperfect 
abcb quatrain without harm in a loosely 
wrought, simple poem in ballad or similar 
style, if you seek the effect of closely wrought 
perfection, of cameo, etching, or epigram, you 
must not leave lines unrhymed as if through 
the mere negligence of completeness. Despite 
this imperfection of form, I choose as an

especially pleasing example of Mrs. McGif- 
fert's imaginative art this bit of interpretive 
fancy on " The Brook " : 

" A rush of twisted waters through the glen. 
Eager and valorous it delves and hews ; 
A Future City waits to flower its banks, 
So it must wisely choose! 

" It leaps, it dances on its dainty way ; 
That spot is for cathedral arch, and there 
Some day will rise great deathless marble heights, 
So must it have a care ! " 

Diametrically opposite in its effect is the 
collection of poems by Mr. W. S. Johnson. 
From the standpoint of the purist it is some- 
thing of a hodge-podge, bits of inspiration 
from Whitman, bits from Browning, bits of 
current science and sociology versified with 
zest but not with unerring taste, a jolly 
Parisian villanelle and a ballade or two, to- : 
gether with popular verses that move swiftly 
and cheaply in Kipling-like journalese. But 
there is the real stuff of poetry here: the : 
interpretation of vital experiences by an j 
eager imagination that transfigures them, for '. 
the moment, to something of widely appealing 
significance. The unity of the volume, so far 
as it may be found, lies in that type of relig- 
ious sense which is perhaps of closest kinship 
to poetry the Spinozistic conception of in- 
dividual experiences as bubbles on the surface 
of the divine firmament of waters. Mr. 
Johnson expresses this most eloquently and 
at the same time most definitely in the fine 
harangue of Lachesis in the poem called 
" Beyond Our War " : 

" For That which suffers is the Joy of God, 
Forever widening and quickening; 
And That which strives is but the Peace of God 
That passeth understanding. As bubbles they rise, 
The works and wars and wonders of the world ; 
And in the verity of the crystal sphere 
They show as worship. Mine are the Eyes of Life! 
I see it all and Life is worship only ! . . . . 

" The marble pants with art's immortal breath ; 
Ascetic vision hunger-dreams to death; 
The clutching talon and the rending claw 
Act the red ritual of evolving law : 
And each is worship only 

" I see the chestnut glaze its winter bud, 
Atom slay atom in the fevered blood, 
An earthworm draw a leaf beneath the sod, 
A poet love his failure up to God: 
And each is worship only. 

" And millions, throbbing with the throbbing drum, 
Hear the Great Call; and millions yet to come 
Shall follow by the charnel road of strife 
Through hate to love, through passionate death to 
life: 

And this is worship only." 

I cannot here do myself (and the reader) the 
pleasure to represent Mr. Johnson's lighter 
vein, but commend unreservedly the good- 



natured satire of the verses on the weather- 
cock Egoist a kind of new Chanticleer who 
believes he controls the winds and the 
dainty humorous philosophy of the address 
to a sparrow in the Luxembourg Gardens. 
The drawback is that the writer either can- 
not trust his taste or does not care to, and 
allows compositions to slip into the volume, 
and lines to slip into compositions, oddities 
of vocabulary and grotesque violences of 
imagery, like " Yggdrasil's pollen omnific " 
and "This pullulating spawn of man that 
fouls the rotting earth" together, as I have 
said, with some mere journalistic doggerel, 
all of which will make the judicious grieve. 
Perhaps Mr. Johnson does not care whether 
they grieve or not, so long as he says his 
vigorous say. I should add that the " Prayer 
for Peace." which gives title to the volume, is 
an exposition, in vivid imaginative form, of 
the notion that strife cannot be put away in 
a universe which is evolving through strife 
toward perfection. For this reason it has 
already won the approbation of Mr. Roose- 
velt, and may perhaps be made into a tract 
by the Navy League. 

The name of Mr. Shaemas O'Sheel invites 
us to look in his verse for a fine Irish zest and 
irresponsibility in the enjoyment of both 
beauty and action, and we are not disap- 
pointed. He calls Mr. Yeats his master, and 
at times, like him, seeks to catch and imprison 
the beauty of the " Rose of the World " ; but 
he has not his master's sureness of ear and 
of touch, so that his more delicate workman- 
ship, though not unappealing, can hardly be 
thought memorable. But I have taken real 
pleasure in a frankly American harvest song 
of "Thanksgiving for Our Task," and still 
more in the buoyant rhythm and garrulous 
feeling of this lyric called "A Night on the 
Hill " : 

" Once when the grey night held more of clouds than 

of stars, 
And the wind was swift and cold, and full of a 

troubling cry, 
I quenched my lamp and opened the door and 

dropped the bars 

And went forth into a meadow, past fields of shud- 
dering rye, 
And over a moor that ghastly lay under a ghastly 

sky, 
And I ran with a stumbling run that the wind might 

blow more bitter by. 
And I fell in weary delight by an old ash clenched 

with scars, 
And I trembled a-thrill with cold, and was content 

to lie. 

" And the glory of God's wild mirth was revealed to 

me, 

And I saw how the elements played at a game 
through space,

And the wind was mad with a vast impetuous glee, 
And a starry laughter broke on the sky's pale face ; 
White naked runners in the dark, the clouds a-race, 
And virginal snowy dancers veiled in lace; 
And an ancient laughter roared through the rocking 

tree, 
And ripples of youthful joy sang the flowers of that 

place. 

And I lay like the mossy rock on the side of the hill, 

And the spin of the rolling world was a dizzy thing, 

And I heard in a moment, when the winds were sud- 
denly still, 

The cheery and lusty song that the huge tongues 
sing 

The tongues of flame leagues deep in earth's hollow- 
ing; 

Far off I knew the great seas leaped in a ring ; 

And I rose with joy in my heart and peace on my 
will, 

And sought the fire on my hearth, and my home's 
enfolding wing." 

Mr. Arthur Guiterman has collected in 
"The Laughing Muse" many merry verses 
which have already been enjoyed in various 
periodicals. Of these the cleverest is that 
which opens the volume, " The Quest of the 
Riband," the account, in antique ballad form, 
of a shopping expedition undertaken by a 
mere man in a modern department store. 
Since this is quite too long to be represented 
here, and since our subject is contemporary 
poetry, I choose for an example of Mr. Guiter- 
man's not wholly thoughtless raillery this 
account of " The Young Celtic Poets " : 
" Their hearts are bowed with sorrow, 

They love to wail and croon ; 
They shed big tears when they sigh, ' Machree,' 

Floods when they sob, ' Aroon ! ' 

" For the Young Gaels of Ireland 

Are the lads that drive me mad ; 

For half their words need foot-notes, 

And half their rhymes are bad." 

The admirers of Mr. Arthur Davison Ficke's 
poetry, among whom I have often been glad 
to count myself, are likely to experience some 
disappointment in reading his latest volume. 
It contains some fine things, notably the Elegy 
on Swinburne, which attracted some attention 
at the time of its publication in a periodical ; 
but as a whole it cannot be said to mark prog- 
ress either in the matter or form of the writer's 
art. T!he two leading poems are in narra- 
tive blank verse of a kind of Wordsworthian 
cast, and, while here also there are exceed- 
ingly good lines, I do not find Mr. Ficke's 
blank verse sure-footed or persistently effec- 
tive. The title-poem, giving the story of a 
madman who crucified himself through a pas- 
sion to save the world, is certainly not unmov- 
ing, but it must be admitted to be the sort of 
tale which is legitimately moving only if 
known to be true, and hence not well fitted for 
poetic fiction. The other narrative, called 
"At St. Stephanos," disappoints in arriving 



at no real climax either of action or feeling. 
It depicts a somewhat mysterious monk in a 
mountain convent, who, after darkly hinting 
that he had that within him which he could 
not bring himself to reveal, at length found 
voice and (says the poet) 

" Poured forth such speech as from no other man 
I ever heard, nor like shall hear again." 

This promises much; but all that transpires 
is that the young monk had led a life which 
vacillated between the ideal of contemplation 
and that of action, and that now, being irre- 
trievably imprisoned in the monastery, he was 
dying of hopelessness because neither ideal 
had been fulfilled. One must think the poet 
to have been singularly unfortunate if he had 
never heard speech more remarkable, both in 
content and form, than this of Theodoras. 
What he feels that he has gained is a view of 

" Man's life, and its strange pitif ulness ; so sweet 
That memory makes the heart to overflow: 
So bitter that men turn from it, as turned 
This soul beside me, to the world of dreams: 
So fleeting, that the darkness hovers close 
Even while the seeker pauses to debate 
The better path, or turns to mourn in vain 
A choice regretted, and the days go by 
Bearing what still remains." 

And the languorous and purposeless disillu- 
sionment of this conclusion seems to animate 
(if that is not too vigorous a word) the great 
part of Mr. Ficke's volume. Sometimes he 
compares himself, with pride decorously 
veiled in a sweet sadness, with those who have 
settled down to a contented theory of life, 
who "have determined all that life should 
be"; sometimes he admits to being "weary 
of being bitter and weary of being wise"; 
sometimes he forecasts the late autumn when 
it will only remain for him to 

" clasp, with weak and thankful heart. 

Whatever faded blossom there apart 

Can ease my smart." 

All this is skilfully, much of it beautifully, 
done; and I am far from assuming that Mr. 
Ficke identifies himself with these various 
wise and bitter and weary and generally dis- 
illusioned and disillusionizing singers. But 
if he is to give us a collection of dramatic 
monologues, he should admit among his 
dramatis persona some of a more heartening 
sort. This I say, foreseeing that it will again 
be charged as has been done already that 
I count no poetry first-rate which does not 
teach sound doctrine ; and I cannot here pause 
to explain how it is that I mean something 
quite different, apart from doctrine alto- 
gether. But in leaving Mr. Ficke's volume, 
since I am unwilling to represent the Swin- 
burne elegy by a few lines only, and since in 
a review not long ago I quoted one of his 



1916]

admirable sonnets, I shall here set down this 
slight but hauntingly perfect lyric, called 
" The Three Sisters " : 

" Gone are those three, those sisters rare 
With wonder-lips and eyes ashine. 
One was wise and one was fair. 
And one was mine. 

" Ye mourners, weave for the sleeping hair 
Of only two your ivy vine. 
For one was wise and one was fair, 
But one was mine." 

I turn finally to a group of three little vol- 
umes of posthumous verse, all of distinctively 
personal character, whose interest and value 
are in some measure frankly dependent on the 
personal relation. The first is made up of 
verses written in his latter days by the late 
Mr. Bertram Dobell, the London bookseller, 
publisher, and literary amateur, whose per- 
sonality was familiar to many Americans; 
they are brought out for private circulation 
by his son. The theme of these poems is the 
end of life, and what it means for one to 
whom eager activity seems the one essential 
of living, and who feels no assurance that 
there is to be any continuance of such indi- 
vidual activity. Mr. Dobell's spirit was Stoic, 
and his poetic method somewhat coldly ex- 
pository, yet with a dignity and sincerity 
which caught something of the attractiveness 
that lies in the stern and sombre veracity of 
Blair's verse, or Dr. Johnson's. "Witness these 
quatrains, of the eighteenth century not 
merely in manner but in mode of thought, on 
the dread of senile decay : 

" A ruined castle of all life forlorn ; 

A temple by a barbarous host profaned; 
A Venice of its power and glory shorn ; 
A stony desert where abundance reigned; 

" Such sights as these are sad. yet not so sad 

As 'tis to see a noble mind's decay: 
A Marlborough doting, or a Swift grown mad; 
A fiery soul to ashes burnt away. 

" Strike me down rather in the flush of life. 

When hopes are high and every prospect fair ; 
The soldier slain in the fierce battle-strife 
Buys cheaply his release from pain and care." 

It happens that the next collection, made of 
the posthumous poems of Clifford Lanier, fur- 
nishes a strikingly contrasting treatment of 
the same theme of old age. viewed now by one 
who is both romanticist and man of faith : 

" Gold in the morn; silver shine at noon; 
Gold after noon : new soft lights beam, 
Whereof the heart of youth may merely dream: 
Pearl, amber, lucent sard are in yon gleam. 
In circles ever moveth life around. 
Without decline; eve puts no term nor bound; 
Age at old portals is await 
For that new scene beyond the gate. 
This little grain of life was sweet: how grand 
The planetary round of God's new land! " 



For these poems Mr. Edward Howard Griggs 
writes a brief memorial introduction, with an 
account of the friendship of the brothers Sid- 
ney and Clifford Lanier, and the sacrifice 
which the younger made for the older and 
more gifted, in yielding up his own hopes 
of a life devoted to letters. The opening 
sequence of sonnets is the monument to this 
friendship, of uneven excellence, wrought 
always with love and sometimes with skill. 
The finest of the sonnets, beginning, " Thou 
magic breather of the silver flute," which 
reproduces rather remarkably the Elizabethan 
flavor, has already won friends through 
periodical publication. 

Professor George Herbert Palmer has now 
followed up his notable memoir of his wife, 
after more than seven years, with a collection 
of the verses found in her desk. The greater 
portion of them were planned, he tells us. as 
parts of a "Marriage Cycle"; and he has 
sought to arrange and entitle them with a 
view to their place in this plan. The result 
is bound to impress us not so much as a work 
of art as a new view of the rich personality 
which was revealed and interpreted in one of 
the most remarkable of American biographies. 
The theme of the series of poems is best 
stated in Professor Palmer's own words, as 
"the significance of marriage, blended as it 
always was in her mind with religious expe- 
rience and the enjoyment of nature " : and 
its primary value lies in the veracious repre- 
sentation of this triune devotion. It cannot 
be claimed that the greater number of the 
poems would be certain to seem distinguished, 
apart from our knowledge of the writer ; for 
Alice Freeman Palmer did not have precisely 
the mind or the pen of an artist. She touched 
and expressed life with directness, rather than 
with imaginative interpretiveness if there 
be such a word. Yet this is only a question 
of degree; and there are compositions in 
this volume which beautifully show " emotion 
recollected in tranquillity " and committed to 
enduring form. Choice is difficult, but these 
stanzas from the poem called " The Glory of 
the "World" are true to the theme and the 
mood of the whole sequence : 

" O summer night beside the soundless sea, 

golden hour for my dear Love and me! 
The past, the future, are at one with thee ! 

" O witching world, with beauty never guessed ! 
Light of the east, dead splendors of the west. 

1 lock you fast forever in my breast. 

" I know your wondrous meaning; for one stands 
Beside me, at the touch of whose dear hands 
My whole heart leaps to life and understands."

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 6 



This is the normal simplicity of the writer's 
method. But now and then she turns to the 
more elaborate figuring of an experience, as 
in the perfect allegory of this poem, complete 
in six lines, whose art is reminiscent of 
George Herbert's : 

" I said to Pain, ' I will not have thee here ! 
The nights are weary and the days are drear 

In thy hard company.' 

He clasped me close and held me still so long 
I learned how deep his voice, how sweet his song, 
How far his eyes can see." 

The editor sums up his impression of the chief 
values of his wife's verses in a reference to 
the " art of transmuting our usual and neces- 
sary experiences into occasions of wonder, 
romance, and gladness." And this is not a bad 
word on which a critic or a reader of poetry 

may pause.

RECENT FICTION.* 



It is hard to avoid what the publishers say 
about a book, and the ingenuous mind would 
ask, Why do so? It would seem as though 
they ought to know better than most what the 
author is trying to do. In writing of " Lot & 
Company," the publishers speak of Mr. Will 
Levington Comfort as being " among the best 
writers of romance and adventure," and add : 
"Never has Mr. Comfort written a novel in 
which is heard so clearly the sound of the sea, 
man's love for woman, and the song of the 
joyous seeker, going on day after day to the 
wonder of new horizons." Now if those de- 
lightful things show the intention of the 
author, his book sends his readers off on a 
false track. The net impression of "Lot & 
Company" is not that of a tale of romance 
and adventure, in fact, there is not really 
very much romance and adventure in it, in 
the ordinary understanding of those words, 
but rather of a book in which a man had 
something very especial to say to the world. 
It is not specifically the story of the joy- 
ous seeker always coming on new horizons, 
again as one would normally understand the 
expression, but the story of a man who was 
applying himself very definitely to a search for 
something he was absolutely determined to 
find. There are horizons and adventures, it is 
true; but it is a pity to give the idea that 
they are the great thing, for then the reader 
will fancy he has a good example of something

which at its best is not one of the finest things 
of art, instead of an effort (successful or not) 
at one of those aims which have always been 
the mark of a great man of letters. 

I prefer the other view, even reckoning 
without Mr. Comfort himself, if that be neces- 
sary, and shall assume that he had (subcon- 
sciously, if you like) an idea, and that the 
power of his idea moulded his conception even 
of horizons and adventure. This idea is that 
there is a finer life than that of grabbing and 
getting, making money or at least taking it 
from others, or perhaps really only noting 
down in a book that you have done so, scour- 
ing sea and land to make an addition to the 
right side of the ledger. It may seem that 
this doctrine is nothing new, which is cer- 
tainly the case; still, it is interesting to see 
the form it will take in the mind of an adven- 
turer, a joyous seeker of wide-spread wonder 
of new horizons, a lover of women and the 
sound of the sea. We shall not tell just what 
form it does take; that is the story, and we 
think that in the hand of Mr. Comfort it 
makes an impression that will be remembered. 

Mr. Jack London's "The Star Rover ""is 
also a book founded upon an idea. As to just 
what that idea is, there may be difference of 
opinion. In fact, it may well be thought that 
Mr. London bodies forth in his imagination 
more than one "fundamental idea." If we 
turn once more to the publishers for informa- 
tion, we shall gather that the plot rests upon 
the conception of the " supremacy of mind 
over body." This idea is undoubtedly to be 
found in the book, and may be thought funda- 
mental, in that the full structure of the book 
is built upon it, or dominating, in that it 
controls the development of the story. The 
novel gives the experiences of Darrell Stand- 
ing, a man serving a life sentence in the Cali- 
fornia State prison at San Quentin. He 
proved incorrigible, and according to the 
mode of dealing with incorrigibles in that 
institution he was given not only solitary con- 
finement but in addition what was called " the 
jacket." Mr. London describes with his ac- 
customed vigor the horrible conditions which 
prevailed in the prison and the relentless 
vigor with which the officials quelled the 
slightest breaches of discipline. Laced in a 
straight-jacket, then, in solitary confinement, 
Darrell Standing is told that it is possible for 
one to release the mind from the prison of the 
body. He tries the experiment and succeeds. 
With his first success he vaults beyond prison 
roof and California sky, and is among the 
stars. In the shortest possible time he is away 
star-roving for long ages. Hence the name of

the book, and hence the view that in such free- 
dom of mind from body we have this funda- 
mental idea. But all this is but a beginning. 
As time goes on, another thought becomes 
more prominent. Darrell Standing ceases to 
rove among the stars, but when his spirit 
leaves the prison of the body it passes into the 
bodies of other men in whom we feel it had 
at one time previously lived. So he becomes, 
first, Count Guillaume de Sainte-Maure ; then 
Jesse, a boy who goes with the immigrant 
train which was ambushed by the Mormons 
at Mountain Meadow; then Adam Strang, 
who was shipwrecked in Korea, the lover and 
husband of the Lady Om. Then he is Ragnar 
Lodbrog, the northern legionary in the Roman 
garrison of Jerusalem at the time of Pilate; 
then he becomes Daniel Foss, a native of Elk- 
ton, who sailed for the Friendly Islands and 
was cast on a desolate island where he lived 
for many years. He becomes Ushu, the pre- 
historic man who takes for his mate Igar, the 
race mother. But always at some crucial time 
he returns to his "jacket," whence he passes 
by a natural series of events, until he finds 
himself finally in the death cell waiting for 
the day of execution, where he writes the book 
we read. It is this latter idea, the conception 
of the transmigration of souls, the idea that 
the living spirit inhabits first one body and 
then another, sometimes retaining a hazy 
recollection of earlier phases of existence, 
that seems to be the dominating conception 
of the book, rather than the more general 
notion, which perhaps includes it, of the 
supremacy of mind over body. 

Mr. Robert W. Chambers, in his novel enti- 
tled "Athalie," has also had thoughts that lie 
rather deep beneath the somewhat superficial 
life which the book otherwise portrays. A 
story "of a girl who was strangely clairvoy- 
ant," the volume is said to be (again by the 
publishers) ; and such it is, for Athalie Green- 
sleeve did possess the power which is com- 
monly called clairvoyance (whether it really 
exists or not), and indeed was thereby very 
fortunately enabled to earn her living at a 
time when she found herself unable to do so 
in any other way. But to speak of the idea 
of this book as clairvoyance, or of Athalie as 
a clairvoyant, gives one a false notion: for 
really it would seem that Mr. Chambers is not 
so much concerned with the experiences of a 
girl of marked or singular power as he is with 
the much greater matter of whether those 
who have passed out of physical life can and 
do still remain near the scenes of their former 
experience and with the persons of those 
whom they have loved. Whether or not a 
girl be a clairvoyant appears to us rather a 



minor matter, when compared with the great 
question we have just noticed; and Mr. 
Chambers seems absorbed in the greater ques- 
tion rather than the less. 

The general character of Mr. Chambers's 
ability is so well known that one need not do 
more than refer to it. He is undoubtedly able 
to present a picture of the gay and glittering, 
rather external and semi-public, life of New 
York at the present day, the life where 
home means an apartment, where dinner 
means a restaurant, where amusement means 
the theatre, and where business may or may 
not mean anything at all. Doubtless there are 
phases of existence in any large city more or 
less like the life which Mr. Chambers presents. 
I always take the liberty to doubt privately 
whether there are many young ladies of per- 
fectly correct and beautiful character who 
spend their evenings and sometimes their 
afternoons habitually with some high minded 
and fine natured young man of wealth and 
position without a thought of anything be- 
yond friendship. Whether there be such is 
not important just now; more to the point is 
it that Mr. Chambers, having in mind a fine 
idea and wishing to present it in his own 
way which is, of course, not the way of the 
Society for Psychical Research or any other 
such body, has rather unfortunately allowed 
his idea to be so overlaid with other things 
that few will get more than a suggestion of 
what it is. It does no injustice to Mr. Cham- 
bers to think that he has. a deep sympathy, if 
not perhaps a settled belief, in the thought 
which here and there rises in his pages. We 
must rather regret that he allows his unde- 
niable gift for the gay, the light, the spark- 
ling forms of existence to fill the mind so that 
the net impression of the book can hardly be 
to give one more than a slight idea of what 
seems really an important matter. Or if the 
subject be the serious one of the continued 
existence and relation of ourselves to those 
whom we have once loved and lost, why should 
it be advertised as something connected with 
crystal balls and announcements in the news- 
papers ? 

There may be those who will think it merely 
humorous to spend so much space in talking 
of ideas in connection with the work of these 
authors. If it be so. we believe that the fault 
(such as there may be) must lie with the 
authors and their publishers. If the " ideas " 
are not to be taken seriously, if mention of 
them be merely a device to make people fancy 
they are reading something worth while, if 
we have really something meant to stir the 
blood rather than to stimulate the thought, 
then why this allusion to. even insistence on.

the other thing? To tell the truth, we rather 
fancy that these able writers are only toying 
with ideas, thoughts, conceptions, or, as we 
might almost call them, whims, fancies, no- 
tions. Mr. Comfort doubtless has much at 
heart the conception of a finer life than that 
of America to-day, we wish he had sought 
to work out the positive side as definitely as 
he has the negative. Mr. London is obviously 
using his " fundamental idea " as a literary 
means. That he does not really believe the 
experiences of Darrell Standing are more 
than fancies, is clear at the very beginning. 
The star-rover in his first flight is impressed 
with the idea that he must touch each star 
with a glass wand; which shows, of course, 
that there was no reality in the flight, nor is 
there more reality in the later scenes. Of Mr. 
Chambers it need only be said that while he 
has treated his subject with delicacy and 
reserve, he has turned the real interest of Ms 
book (as far as we can see) in quite another 
direction. 

It is perhaps a tribute to the attractions of 
the intellectual life, or the spiritual, that such 
books should appear before the public as hav- 
ing something to say on "ideas." We hope 
that their readers who are doubtless people 
who enjoy the world of adventure or the 
world of gaiety or both will be attracted to 
that other world so different from that with 
which they are familiar, and yet so closely 
related to it. If they are so attracted, they 
will have no difficulty in finding competent

American 
literature, 
1870-1892. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The title of Professor Fred 
Lewis Pattee's latest book, "A 
History of American Literature 
since 1870" (Century Co.), seems to threaten 
a catalogue of story-writers and poets of 
to-day; but the preface reassures the reader 
with the promise that only writers who did 
distinctive work before 1892 will be included. 
The quarter-century following the Civil War 
is now far enough in the past to make possi- 
ble an evaluation of its literary output, and 
it is fortunate that the first attempt at such 
an evaluation has been made by a scholar with 
an established reputation for careful and 
thorough work in American literature. Not 
all students will agree with all of Professor 
Pattee's judgments. His critical standards 
may be inferred from some of his pet aver- 
sions the baneful influence of Keats, "Long- 
fellowism," " so conventional a thing as a 
sonnet," and indeed all carefully elaborated 



writing. It is not strange, therefore, that he 
finds much to praise in Artemus Ward, Whit- 
man, Mark Twain, and Joaquin Miller. 
"Ramona" is "an exquisite work of art," 
and gives its author " a place indeed with the 
two or three best writers of American ro- 
mance " ; and the stories of Kate Chopin a 
name possibly not known to every reader 
are " equal to the best that has been produced 
in France or even in America." On the other 
hand, he has little but judicially phrased con- 
tempt for Bayard Taylor and Aldrich and 
Mr. Henry James. Even those who dissent 
most sharply from his judgments will, how- 
ever, value his criticisms for their frankness 
and consistency. Some objection may be 
raised to the bringing in of authors whose 
distinctive work was done before the year so 
definitely set forth in the title. A student of 
the "Biglow Papers" and "The Fable for 
Critics" may be astounded to learn that 
" Lowell, so much of whose early heart 
and soul had been given to Europe, discov- 
ered America in this same Centennial year 
[1876] " ; and in view of the author's thesis 
that the distinctive characteristics of his 
period are traceable to the Civil War. it seems 
hardly fair to include Mrs. Stowe, Timrod, 
and others of their time, and even to devote a 
long section to Thoreau on the na'ive ground 
that "in spirit and influence . . he belongs 
to the period after 1870." A few vagaries 
like this stamp the author as just a little of 
a special pleader. The few noticeable slips, 
such as the statement that Marion Crawford 
wrote no short stories, come from a tendency 
to be sweepingly dogmatic. But on the whole, 
the work is scholarly, and granted the crit- 
ic's assumptions as to what American litera- 
ture ought to be logically sound. Full and 
sympathetic recognition is given to the work 
of the South since the War, and the sections 
dealing with Southern writers are especially 
well done. _

pointment in their subject matter, the reader j 
who likes to study his author more technically 
and to analyze and discuss his work, will be j 
better pleased. That is to say, although each 
of these volumes is introduced as "a biog- 
raphy and a critical estimate," the biography 
is in each instance negligible : eight pages in , 
the "Bennett," three in the "Wells." suffice; 
the real "vital facts," it is assumed, appear , 
in the more or less elaborate analysis of j 
each novelist's literary achievement as re- ! 
corded in subsequent pages. Of the two stud- ] 
ies, that of Mr. Bennett strikes us as the ! 
clearer and more satisfactory, although per- 
haps there is no good reason for such a con- 
trast. Mr. Darton identifies the subject of ! 
his study intimately with the spirit of that 
" domicile of origin," the Staffordshire district 
which this novelist has made familiar to the 
world. Mr. Bennett " is a Five Townsman 
keen, interested, exceedingly shrewd, very 
practical and efficient, limited in certain di- 
rections, rather coarse-fibred in others." He 
also declares that, like his fellow Five Towns- 
men. Mr. Bennett is "high strung," an 
epithet that the reader will find explained 
satisfactorily. The chapter on the Five j 
Towns, by the way, is one of the best in the 
book, and contains a capital description of the 
topography of Stoke-on-Trent, with a map for 
the complete identification of places men- 
tioned in the novels of the Five Towns. Natu- 
rally, Mr. Beresford can hardly perform a 
similar service for his hero he insists, far 
more strongly than Mr. Darton, that his ' 
hero is a hero; but rather confines his effort 
to asserting the normality of Mr. "Wells and 
of Mr. Wells's vision. He sees him as "re- 
garding all life from a reasonable distance." 
He maintains the superiority of the romances 
to those of Jules Verne, and regards Mr. Wells 
as second to none as a writer of romances 
of this type. He is less certain of Mr. Wells's 
position as a novelist, but feels no hesita- 
tion in the claim that he is one of the great 
writers; and that alone, among the novel- | 
ists of the day, he has used his perfected art 
for a definite end. He has pointed the possi- 
ble road of our endeavor. He has set up the 
ideal of a finer civilization. 



Records of 

" the glory that 

teat Greece." 



In view of the rapidly grow- 
ing responsibility of American 
scholarship, it is particularly 
pleasing to greet a volume of the ambitious 
series now being issued by the Columbia 
University Press under the general title of 
" Records of Civilization." The aim of the 
series is as praiseworthy as it is comprehen- 



sive. "In the first place, its intention is to 
make accessible those sources of the history 
of Europe and of the near East which are of 
prime importance for the understanding of 
Western civilization. In the second place, 
both by the treatment of these texts and by 
special studies it covers the work of modern 
scholars in these fields. It is, therefore, a 
guide both to the original documents and to 
recent criticism. The material, furthermore, 
is given in English translation, in order that 
it may be readily accessible to students and 
readers who do not have that knowledge of 
classical and other foreign languages which 
is essential for specialized research." Profes- 
sor James T. Shotwell of Columbia has been 
selected as general editor, and the history 
workers of America will feel that the choice 
has been felicitous. The volume before us, 
edited by Professors G. W. Botsford and 
E. G. Sihler, deals with "Hellenic Civiliza- 
tion"; and we have no doubt that it has 
proved a more difficult task than will any of 
its successors. It is the old story of an 
embarras de richesse, and Dr. Shotwell has 
forestalled the critic by writing : " The selec- 
tions have been made, not for specialists, but 
for those who are interested in general Hel- 
lenic culture. Nothing could be easier than 
to suggest the lengthening or shortening of 
passages and the addition or substitution of 
other selections. No two scholars could agree 
as to what is absolutely best for a volume of 
the kind; and those who have cooperated in 
its preparation can only hope that it may in 
some degree contribute to an understanding 
of the spirit of ancient Hellas and add to the 
interest in her culture." It remains to be 
said, however, that while the general level of 
translation is high, a few of the renderings 
are simply villainous from the side of ade- 
quate English. (Vide pp. 190, 191, et al.) 
The bibliographies, again, are generally ad- 
mirable; but any reviewer with a sense of 
humor will note with a kindly smile some of 
the inclusions and omissions. Professor Paul 
Shorey, apparently, has written nothing on 
Plato that is worthy of recording beside the 
contributions enumerated. The index is fair, 
but in a book of this nature it might well 
have been more extensive. If we may assume 
that " Hellenic Civilization " represents the 
material form of the series, we shall have a 
set of large and clearly printed books, run- 
ning to about seven hundred pages each. 
Eighteen volumes have been definitely listed 
as in preparation, and others will be an- 
nounced later. It is to be hoped that the 
general editor and his collaborators will not 
allow themselves to be hurried, and that this

versus recent contributions to the lit- 

MaanaCharta, era t ure of international law, 
renewed interest in which has been stimulated 
by the great war, is a volume entitled " War : 
Its Conduct and Legal Results" (Dutton), 
by two well known English scholars, Profes- 
sors Baty and Morgan. Their treatise is note- 
worthy in being perhaps the only work which 
undertakes to state the legal effect of war 
upon the local or municipal law in this 
case, upon the law of England. It does not 
pretend to be a study of the questions of in- 
ternational law to which the present war has 
given rise, although some of these are touched 
upon, notably where the provisions of the 
Hague Convention regarding the laws and 
customs of war are compared with those of 
the German war manual (which, by the way, 
Professor Morgan has recently translated into 
English). The present work is devoted 
mainly to an exposition of the effect of war 
upon contracts, the status of alien enemies, 
trade with the enemy, personal liberty, lib- 
erty of the press, and, in general, the status 
of the civil population as a whole throughout 
the realm. It is based largely on the decisions 
of the English and American courts ; but the 
treatment is non-technical and to a remarka- 
ble degree popular in character. There is a 
critical examination of all the important 
emergency war legislation enacted since the 
outbreak of the present conflict, and the text 
of this legislation is reprinted in an appen- 
dix of more than one hundred pages. While 
stating that " we are all united in the convic- 
tion that never was a cause more just or a 
war more righteous," the writers have sub- 
jected the measures of the government to a 
severe criticism, and applied to them the 
strict tests of legality in a way which it may 
safely be assumed would not be tolerated if 
it were attempted in Germany. Their criti- 
cism of the Defence of the Realm and Press 
Censorship Acts, and the regulations issued 
in pursuance thereof, is particularly severe. 
These drastic measures are declared to be un- 
precedented because they create new offences 
and make them punishable by a procedure 
unknown to the common law. The effect, we 
are told, is for some purposes " to deprive the 
whole civil population . . of the right to trial 
by jury and to enable a court-martial to sen- 
tence any one contravening those regulations to 
penal servitude for life." This, notwithstand- 



ing the fact that the King's Courts are still 
open and that his writs still run throughout 
the realm. Liberty of the press, it is affirmed, 
is " in a precarious condition it hangs by a 
thread." Never in the history of England, 
we are told, has the executive assumed such 
arbitrary power over the life, liberty, and 
property of British subjects. "The net of 
restriction is now so finely woven, so ingen- 
iously designed, that it enmeshes every activ- 
ity of the citizen. The military authorities 
can . deport the whole population of any 
town or village from one part of the country 
to another. They could totally close all the 
public houses throughout the United King- 
dom for every hour of the day for the whole 
period of the war. . . They can on mere sus- 
picion arrest any one without warrant and 
can equally without warrant enter any house 
by day or by night. They can punish with 
penal servitude for life any journalist who 
speculates as to the plan of campaign . . and 
with six months imprisonment if he criticizes 
the dietary or accommodation of the new 
recruits." They can stop any citizen, close 
any road, or compel the whole population to 
keep indoors. " We must leave the reader to 
judge for himself whether this 'parliamentary 
despotism' which recalls nothing so much as 
the kind of legislation hitherto exclusively re- 
served for uncivilized protectorates, is either 
necessary or wise." Such is the regime under 
which the English are living to-day; yet 
England, although "at war," is not in a 
"state of war," a distinction which the 
authors regard as sound and fundamental. 



impressionist* Mr - James Hunekcr has been 
studies in art fortunate in the title of his 
latest volume, " Ivory, Apes and 
Peacocks" (Scribner). Whether intended in 
an ironic sense or not, it suggests both the 
qualities and the limitations of the essays. 
Mr. Huneker continues, of course, to devote 
himself to the " modern " and " ultra-modern " 
European movements in music, literature, and 
art. The new volume discusses such men as 
Schoenberg, Matisse, Van Gogh, Gauguin, and 
the Italian Futurists, as well as Whitman, 
Dostoieffsky, Tolstoy, and Vermeer. As a 
critic, Mr. Huneker's distinction is his frank 
impressionism, his eagerness, in spite of ex- 
perience and sophistication, before every new 
work of art. " Critics," he says, " are like 
prize-fighters, they must keep in constant 
training else they go ' stale.' " His conception 
of art is that of Schopenhauer : "Art is ever 
on the quest, a quest, and a divine adven- 
ture ' ' ; and this conception he holds in com- 
mon with most of the men whom he writes

An outline of 
Japanese history. 



A text which may be considered 
an "irreducible minimum" is 
presented by Mr. Ernest Wilson 
Clement in his " Short History of Japan " 
(University of Chicago Press). In one hun- 
dred and fifty pages he has outlined fifteen 
hundred years of recorded history, and has 
found space for references to social condi- 
tions, literature, and art. As the more impor- 
tant authorities are cited, the reader may 
easily turn to the more extensive works. Half 
the volume deals with the period before 1603, 
and the remainder treats of the Tokugawa 
Shogunate and the Meiji Era. The appen- 
dices include an account of the physiography 
of the Empire, with lists of the provinces by 
circuits, the prefectures, the emperors and 
empresses, the shoguns, the regents, and the 
Japanese name periods. The volume also con- 
tains a map of present-day Japan. The work 
is well done when the limitations of space are 
considered. A few errors, however, should 
be corrected in a text which will have wide 
use. Hideyoshi's letter to the Governor of the 
Philippines was delivered (p. 78) ; Chinese 



about. Mr. Huneker is himself thoroughly 
"modern." He dislikes and fears (half- 
seriously) the music of Schoenberg, and he 
thinks that the Futurists "have mistaken 
their vocation. They should have been musi- 
cians or writers, or handle the more satisfac- 
tory, if less subtle, cinematograph." But he | 
refuses to reject either Futurism or Schoen- j 
berg. "I shouldn't be surprised if ten years 
hence Arnold Schoenberg proves quite as con- 
ventional a member of musical society" as 
Richard Strauss and Claude Debussy. He 
quotes approvingly Gauguin's remark that " a j 
painter is either a revolutionist or a plagia- 
rist." The masterpieces of the past produce ! 
in him a feeling of melancholy. " Other days, 
other plays. And that is the blight on all 
academic art." One wonders how long this 
quest and adventure can be kept up without 
exhaustion, without realizing that our " mod- 
ernists " are most of them living too much on 
their temperaments. What one misses in Mr. 
Huneker's criticism, and in the* modern move- 
ments in all the arts, is character, that con- 
cern for the permanent which meant so much 
to Goethe, himself a seasoned adventurer. 
Mr. Huneker's zest, however, is unfailing. 
And his style. clever and epigrammatic to a 
fault, often irresponsible (the composer of 
"The Rosecavalier " "always makes hay 
while the Strauss shines"), sensuous at times, 
with great power of evocation, serves ad- 
mirably a critic whose main interest is in the 
overtones of temperament. 



as well as Dutch were allowed to trade at 
Nagasaki (p. 94) ; the bombardment of for- 
eign ships by the Shimonoseki forts occurred, 
in 1863 (p. 104) ; the Satsuma indemnity 
was 25,000 (p, 104n.) ; Oyama appears as 
" Omaya " (p. 130) ; it is not correct to state 
that Great Britain agreed to the revision of 
the treaty in 1894 as the result of Japan's 
overwhelming defeat of China, for the treaty 
was signed before the war broke out (p. 132), 
nor can it be said that the treaties of 1911 
" included no limitations upon the commercial 
autonomy of Japan," for the conventional 
tariff in the British treaty must certainly be 
considered such (p. 146). These suggestions, 
few in number and of minor significance, 
really indicate with what care Mr. Clement 
has compiled this serviceable outline. 



Some notable 

bibliographies. 



Eight bibliographies, each mer- 
iting fuller notice than it is here 
possible to give, bear convincing 
evidence of the continued activity of those 
self-effacing scholars who scorn delights and 
live laborious days for the noble purpose of 
adding to a very necessary branch of refer- 
ence literature. Two members of the French 
department at Smith College, Dr. Albert 
Schinz and Dr. George A. Underwood, edit 
for use in this country M. Lucien Foulet's 
" Bibliography of Medieval French Literature 
for College Libraries" (Yale University 
Press), a pamphlet of thirty pages. Mr. J. 
Christian Bay has prepared for the Danish- 
American Association a bibliography entitled 
"Denmark in English and American Litera- 
ture," an octavo of nearly one hundred pages, 
published by the above-named society at 30 
N. Dearborn St., Chicago. Miss Grace Gard- 
ner Griffin is the compiler of "Writings on 
American History, 1913," being the eighth 
annual number of the series originated by her 
and now published by the Yale University 
Press. It is a work involving much research 
and a high degree of bibliographical skill. 
From the Boston Book Company comes an 
" Index to Fairy Tales, Myths, and Legends," 
compiled by Miss Mary Huse Eastman, of the 
Wilmington (Del.) Institute Free Library. 
It is a subject and title index, followed by a 
"list of books analyzed," arranged under the 
authors' names. The scope of the work may 
be inferred from the fact that this concluding 
list fills fifteen pages of fine print. To Mr. 
Frederick W. Ashley, Chief of the Order 
Division of the Library of Congress, we are 
indebted for a handsome quarto " Catalogue 
of the John Boyd Thacher Collection of Incu- 
nabula." This collection is intrusted by Mrs. 
Thacher to the custody of the Library of

Congress, and the present full and scholarly 
enumeration and description of its riches will 
greatly facilitate its intelligent use by those 
desiring access to it. An eleven-page biog- 
raphical sketch of Mr. Thacher is prefixed. 
The Government Printing Office issues the 
work. "A Brief Bibliography of Books in 
English, Spanish and Portuguese, Relating to 
the Republics Commonly Called Latin Amer- 
ican, with Comments" (Macmillan). by Mr. 
Peter H. Goldsmith, Director of the Pan- 
American Association for International Con- 
ciliation, is comprehensive without being 
exhaustive, briefly but intelligently annotated, 
and has the further merit of wasting no space 
on works hopelessly difficult of access. Noth- 
ing is included that will not be found in the 
libraries of New York. About three hundred 
titles are embraced in this well-selected list. 
From the H. W. Wilson Company we have 
two useful works for debaters. " Selected 
Articles on Prohibition of the Liquor Traffic," 
compiled by Dr. Lamar T. Beman, has abun- 
dant bibliographical references and a pre- 
liminary outline of both affirmative and nega- 
tive arguments. The bibliography fills thirty- 
four pages, the argumentative selections 
nearly five times as much space. The book 
forms one of the "Debaters' Handbook Se- 
ries." In the " University Debaters' Annual " 
for 1914-5 (the first of a promising series) are 
found arguments for and against the Monroe 
Doctrine, the increase of our army and navy, 
the minimum wage, government ownership of 
telegraph and telephone, the single tax, and 
socialistic control of the means of production 
and exchange. From college and university 
debates these arguments are taken, but they 
represent considerable scholarly application 
and are accompanied by sufficiently full bibli- 
ographies to enable the reader to pursue the 
subjects further if he so desires. 



Psychological In his volume entitled "The 
studies of three Criminal Imbecile" ( Macmillan ) , 
* e - Dr. Henry H. Goddard analyses 
three remarkable murder cases. The criminal 
is in each case a boy of low mentality, show- 
ing by test the development of about a ten or 
eleven year old child, in actual age, sixteen, 
nineteen, and twenty-four years. The aggres- 
sive sex-impulse enters, or the mere negative 
one of suggestibility under another's power. 
The first boy killed his school teacher; the 
plea of imbecility was admitted, mainly upon 
the basis of psychological tests. The second 
case was involved, and showed the hypnotic 
type of influence ; a verdict of murder in the 
first degree was rendered. In the third case 
the young man shot down a girl who refused 



his attentions, and is now in prison for life ; 
though twenty-four years of age, he has exer- 
cised for the last twelve years only the men- 
tality that he had developed at the time of his 
crime. The social menace of such cases is the 
theme of Dr. Goddard's monograph. The con- 
tribution is peculiarly valuable in showing 
how the recognition of abnormality is an ex- 
pert matter. To the layman the criminality is 
far more conspicuous and abhorrent than the 
imbecility. The different play of the "sex" 
factor is convincing. The masculine trend 
for action and the play of violent emotions 
shows itself in the pathological manifestations. 



How the 
" Lusitania ' 
went down. 



Strikingly at variance with the 
findings of the official inquiry 
are Mr. Charles E. Lauriat 's ob- 
servations on the occasion of the sinking of 
the " Lusitania." In fact, he himself says in 
his book, " The Lusitania's Last Voyage " 
(Houghton), that they "are as diametrically 
opposite from 'those of Lord Mersey's Court 
as they well could be." But it is evident to 
any impartial reader that Mr. Lauriat re- 
mained cool and calmly observant from the 
moment the torpedo struck the ship on which 
he was a passenger, to the end of that appal- 
ling catastrophe. As one proof of his remark- 
able freedom from anything like panic, the 
follower of his brief but clear narrative notes 
his allowing himself just enough time, as the 
vessel was rapidly listing to starboard, to go 
below to his stateroom, walking in the angle 
formed by the floor and side wall of the pas- 
sage, and secure certain personal belongings 
from his luggage. It is already known how 
intelligently and fearlessly helpful he was in 
saving other lives besides his own. Briefer 
than was Mr. Lawrence Beesley in narrating 
the tragedy of the " Titanic," Mr. Lauriat re- 
counts events of a similar but more startling 
nature, in which he himself figures, modestly 
enough, as an actor of some importance. The 
report of Lord Mersey's court of inquiry is 
added, and some significant extracts from the 
"Frankfurter Zeitung" of May 9 are given 
in both German and English. The whole con- 
stitutes not only a " document " of historic 
interest, but a thrilling narrative of the 
greatest disaster of its kind. 



The obvious purpose of Profes- 
i te * t -* >0 k t f sor Arthur L. Cross's "History 

Enghsh history. /.-n-ij j^i -r-r 

of England and Greater Brit- 
ain" (Macmillan) is to fit the demands of a 
text for advanced classes in colleges and uni- 
versities. For such a purpose the book fur- 
nishes a good basis. It is a fresh treatment 
of the subject in a large volume of over eleven 



1916] 



37 



hundred pages, supplied with very good maps 
and competent references to other works and 
sources. Professor Cross brings his narrative 
up to February, 1914, within six months of 
the beginning of the European war. The 
book comprehends the history of England, 
and its expansion into greater Britain, within 
fifty-seven chapters, and employs the topical 
method of presenting the subject-matter. It 
touches the political, social, and literary de- 
velopment of the country in due proportion. 
The paragraphs dealing with literary history, 
however, suggest a less confident acquain- 
tance with the sources than those dealing with 
political and industrial development. The 
book aims at the presentation of facts in the 
light of their significance and historical suc- 
cession, and makes slight attempt to appraise 
events or interpret the spirit and character of 
the English people. It is probably the most 
satisfactory text-book in its field for college 
courses thus far written by an American 
scholar. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The process of development of the honey bee 
from the egg through the larval stage is described 
with much technical detail in " The Embryology of 
the Honey Bee" (Princeton University Press), by 
Dr. J. A. Nelson, expert in bee culture investiga- 
tions in the Bureau of Entomology in the United 
States Department of Agriculture. The work is 
of value to scientific bee culturists, and will form a 
welcome addition to the libraries of colleges and 
universities, since it gives a very full and connected 
account of the development of a highly specialized 
representative of that most important group of 
animals, the insects, A full bibliography and an 
ample index, as well as abundant illustrations, add 
to the book's value as a work of reference. 

A second series of " Essays for College Men," 
under the editorship of Messrs. Norman Foerster, 
Frederick A. Manchester, and Karl Young, has 
been issued by Messrs. Holt. It maintains the high 
level reached in the preceding volume. " What Is 
a College ForT" by President Wilson, "Academic 
Leadership " by Mr. Paul Elmer More, and " The 
Religion of Humanity" by Hon. Arthur James 
Balfour are titles which indicate that many of the 
essays selected are admirably suited to the purpose 
of the series. But the wisdom of including such an 
essay as " The American Scholar " may be ques- 
tioned. That college men should know it will not 
be disputed; but it is so easily accessible already 
that one begrudges it space in a volume of this kind. 

Another useful reference book comes from the 
indefatigable pen of Mr. William S. Walsh, and 
this time it has to do with " Heroes and Heroines 
of Fiction, Classical, Mediaeval, Legendary " (Lip- 
pincott). Thus it forms a companion volume or 
supplement to his similarly entitled work dealing 
with modern fictitious names. Much industrv is 



shown in its compilation ; here and there, perhaps, 
excessive industry, as where he writes of Ahasuerus 
and Cartaphilos and the Wandering Jew, in three 
separate paragraphs, but with no cross references, 
no sending of the reader to the longest and best of 
the entries, that under " Wandering Jew." On the 
other hand, some defect of industry seems to be re- 
sponsible for the omission of the Seven Champions 
of Christendom, Emerson's " sacred Seven " which 
many a reader of " Brahma " has puzzled over. 
Not far from four hundred double-column, fine- 
print pages are given to Mr. Walsh's fruitful and 
interesting theme. 

Professor Henry Seidel Canby's " College Sons 
and College Fathers " (Harper) is a new and sane 
discussion of the much-mooted question of college 
education. Professor Canby looks at the question 
from the standpoint of the teacher, the student, and 
the student's parents, and he maintains a rare bal- 
ance between sympathy and detachment in his 
treatment of each of these classes. Everywhere he 
shows mature thought and insight, nowhere snap 
judgment or sensationalism. He is human through- 
out, and because he is human he deals with essen- 
tials. "The Undergraduate Background," "The 
Colleges and Mediocrity," and " Current Literature 
and the Colleges " are a few of the chapter-headings 
that provoke attention and suggest the importance 
of the matters discussed. 

Mr. John C. Wright, of Harbor Springs, Em- 
met County, Michigan, has industriously collected 
a score or more of the native legends of his 
neighborhood and published them under the title, 
" Stories of the Crooked Tree." This semi-mythi- 
cal tree, known in Jesuit missionary annals as 
" I'Arbre Croche," is supposed to have stood in or 
near what is now Middle Village, and has an 
interesting legend of its own to explain its crook- 
edness. Other characteristic Indian folklore is 
not wanting to fill out Mr. Wright's volume, and 
the author has added the necessary historical com- 
mentary, with an abundance of full-page illustra- 
tions from photographs. He has had previous 
experience in work of this sort, and his present 
book is a notable contribution to the legendary 
lore of our aborigines. (The Lakeside Press, Har- 
bor Springs, Michigan.) 

The Princeton idea, less to contribute to knowl- 
edge than to aid in its assimilation, finds notable 
expression in Mr. Clarence Ward's " Mediaeval 
Church Vaulting," lately added to the " Princeton 
Monographs on Art and Archaeology " (Princeton 
University Press). The few novel views are con- 
fessedly subordinate to the purpose of the work, 
which is " to give in a compact and systematic form 
a thorough resume of all the principal forms of 
vaulting employed in the middle ages." The study 
of origins and motives, however, is too attractive to 
permit the author to forego it, in spite of the limi- 
tations of his systematic formula ; and many of his 
most interesting observations deal with questions of 
such a character. In fulness and logic of presenta- 
tion the book adequately fulfils its purpose; while 
unhackneyed photographs, clear typography, and 
becoming form make it a pleasure to read.

Page & Co. will publish this month. 

" The First Hundred Thousand," by " Ian Hay " 
(Captain Ian Hay Beith) is announced for pub- 
lication this month by Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. 

Dr. C. Carroll Marden, for several years past 
the editor of "Modern Language Notes," has 
resigned that position in order to devote himself to 
his special field of Spanish studies. 

Two new war books announced by the Bobbs- 
Merrill Co. are Mr. Frederic William Wile's 
" The Assault " and Professor David Starr Jor- 
dan's " The Ways to Lasting Peace." 

Mr. E. Byrne Hackett, for the past six years 
director of the Yale University Press, has resigned 
that position to become manager of the Brick Row 
Print and Book Shop, of New Haven, Conn. 

" Industrial Leadership," by Mr. H. L. Gantt, 
one of the foremost exponents of the Taylor sys- 
tem of scientific management, is announced for 
January publication by the Yale University Press. 

" Some Elderly People and Their Young 
Friends," by Miss McNaughton, which Messrs. 
Dutton will have ready shortly, tells a story in 
which there are two groups of characters, of dif- 
ferent generations. 

A new edition, revised and enlarged and pre- 
sented in a single volume, instead of two as hereto- 
fore, of " The Development of European Nations, 
1870-1914," by Dr. J. Holland Rose, will soon be 
issued by Messrs. Putnam. 

" Traffic Control in Cities," a vital topic of ever- 
increasing importance, has a seven-page list of 
references devoted to it in the December issue of 
" Special Libraries," which also contains the cus- 
tomary amount of other interesting matter. 

" The Family as a Social and Educational Insti- 
tution," by Dr. Willystine Goodsell, which Messrs. 
Macmillan have ready for immediate publication, 
is a review of conditions and changes in the 
family from early Greek and Roman times until 
the present. 

" Modes of Research in Genetics," by Dr. Ray- 
mond Pearl, biologist of the Maine Agricultural 
Experiment Station, will appear at once with the 
Macmillan imprint. The author examines and 
evaluates current methods of attacking problems 
in heredity and breeding. 

"American Debate: A Critical History of 
Political Controversy in the United States, with 
Digests of Notable Debates," by Mr. Marion Mills 
Miller, will be issued in a few weeks by Messrs.

to political and the other to economic issues. 

In his forthcoming book entitled " Over the 
Front in an Aeroplane," Mr. Ralph Pulitzer will 
describe his trip from Paris to the fighting lines 
and back again in an army aeroplane, and also his 
experiences and impressions during other journeys 



by train or motor to the battle lines in France and 
Belgium. 

A timely and important biography is announced 
by Messrs. Dutton in " Eleutherios Venizelos, His 
Life and Work," by Dr. G. Kerofilos, to appear 
in a translation by Miss Beatrice Barstow. The 
author is said to be an intimate friend of his sub- 
ject, and has accompanied him upon some of his 
diplomatic missions. 

Appropriate to the Shakespeare Tercentenary, 
to be celebrated this year, is the announcement of 
a dramatization in five acts of Mr. John Bennett's 
" Master Skylark," a story of Shakespeare's youth 
which has been a prime favorite with juvenile 
readers for several years past. The Century Co. 
will publish the work. 

A most sensible and convincing statement of the 
anti-militarist position may be found in a pam- 
phlet just issued by the World Peace Foundation 
of Boston, under the title, " Preparedness for 
What?" Dr. Charles H. Levermore, president of 
Adelp'hi College, is the author. The pamphlet may 
be obtained free of charge from the publishers, and 
should have the widest possible circulation. 

A biography of the late Booker T. Washington 
by Messrs. Lyman Beecher Stowe and Emmett J. 
Scott, is announced by Messrs. Doubleday, Page 
& Co. The work was begun several months ago, 
and most of the material was gathered with Dr. 
Washington's authorization. Mr. Scott was his 
lieutenant at Tuskegee and his intimate friend. 
The same publishers also announce another inter- 
esting biographical work for early Spring, when, 
in conjunction with Messrs. Lea & Febinger, med- 
ical publishers, they will issue the autobiography 
of the late Dr. Edward L. Trudeau. 

" The Correspondence of Gray, Walpole, West, 
and Ashton (1734-1771)," edited by Dr. Paget 
Toynbee, in two volumes, which the Oxford Press 
is to publish immediately, will include, in addition 
to the new letters, a number of unpublished poems 
and translations by Gray and West. One of the 
two pieces by Gray, according to a pencil note 
by Walpole, was "written when he was very 
young " probably his earliest extant effort in 
verse' and is a translation (sixteen lines) from 
the "Thebaid" of Statius. The other piece is 
Gray's earliest extant original poem, consisting of 
an epistle in verse addressed to Walpole from 
Cambridge in a letter dated December 8, 1734. 

Labor and Socialism have a mass of literature 
far more considerable than is commonly sus- 
pected. Of periodicals alone there are not far 
from two hundred in this country dealing with 
phases of the labor question and the Socialist 
movement. At the Wisconsin State Historical 
Library there are regularly received about one 
hundred and sixty of these publications, and its 
collection of books, pamphlets, and other printed 
matter on these subjects is the largest in the coun- 
try. A bulletin descriptive of " Collections on 
Labor and Socialism in the Wisconsin State His- 
torical Library" has recently been prepared by 
Superintendent Milo M. Quaife and others, and is 
issued bv the Wisconsin Historical Society.

safeguard for the results desired." Public Libraries.

industry." Printer & Publisher. 

"We looked through the books very carefully with considerable 
interest and congratulate you on the excellent work you have

FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK 



46 THE DIAL [Jan. 20 



THE articles by Willard Huntington Wright, which appear each 
month in The Forum, are the first constructive, purely aesthetic 
art criticisms to appear in America. Mr. Wright's aesthetic 
rationale is neither personal nor merely scholastic; it is founded on 
definite knowledge of emotional apperceptions and reactions, and 
adheres to the facts recorded by the leading European scientists and 
psychologists who have made a profound study of subtle and complex 
problems of aesthetics. 

Mr. Wright's criticisms mean more than mere transient records and 
opinions. They possess a philosophic and educational appeal which is 
stimulating and interesting even to those not particularly concerned 
with painting. 

Mr. Wright is neither a teacher nor a detractor. You will not be 
concerned as to whether you personally agree or disagree with him. 
But you will be stimulated. You will be set thinking. You will find that 
there are more possibilities of aesthetic enjoyment than you are aware 
of. You will have new viewpoints opened up to you. 

Mr. Wright is accomplishing something new and highly important. 
He has lifted criticism out of its old rut of dogma and prejudice and 
sentimentalism, and has placed it on a solid foundation from which all 
art lovers no matter how divergent their tastes will gain a clearer 
and profounder vision. 

Dr. Christian Brinton says that Mr. Wright's art criticism u is a 
vindication of the metaphysical method as applied to aesthetic inter- 
pretation. It satisfies the intellect, and at the same time is not devoid 
of the requisite charm of statement." 

William Marion Reedy says: "Willard Huntington Wright comes 
nearer to revealing for us the anatomy of art and its spirit, too, than any 
writer I ever read." 

Andre Tridon calls Mr. Wright "America's first aesthetician," and 
adds: "A standard of criticism has been set, and this standard reposes 
on the most durable foundation, the animating purpose of all great 
creative expression." 

Every month he contributes a long article to The Forum dealing with 
the important current activities in the field of art. If you have not fol- 
lowed these articles you will find it to your interest and benefit to 
begin at once. A limited number of recent back issues containing Mr. 
Wright's criticism may still be obtained. 

The price is 25 cents a copy, $2.50 a year. A three months trial subscription for 50 cents.

"Picturesque and strong as drama, it is yet more remarkable for its literary

its general conception, in its imaginative, concise, expressive prose and occasional 
interludes of heroic or plaintive lyrical verse, some of which is exquisite. ... A 
striking drama. ... A notable work that will meet with the hearty appreciation 
of discerning readers." The Nation.

THE "DISTINCTION' 
LONGFELLOW: 



OF 



A few seasons ago, when a celebrated trans- 
Atlantic pianist returned to America for the 
first extended tour that he had undertaken 
here in a number of years, an Olympian critic 
bitterly complained because of his placing 
upon his programmes certain of the composi- 
tions of Mendelssohn. "An artist," the re- 
viewer wrote, "acclaimed the first of living 
pianists, owes it to his public to offer it some- 
thing of greater distinction than outmoded 
specimens of an invertebrate art which, in 
these days, should be consecrated to the young 
ladies' boarding-schools and not obtruded 
upon the mature musical intelligence," or 
words to that effect. But there was balm left 
in Gilead. For not long afterward another 
eminent trans-Atlantic virtuoso who visited 
these shores offered to the public a "tone- 
poem " in which a contemporary composer had 
endeavored to depict the emotions which the 
passage of a reverberant express-train over an 
evidently rudimentary railway had aroused 
within his breast. Tumultuous indeed was the 
resultant repercussion, and correspondingly 
surging was the enthusiasm of our critic, who 
asserted with conviction, almost with passion 
or as near passion as an Olympian critic 
may allow himself to betray, that the public 
(very obviously of "mature musical intelli- 
gence ") was vastly indebted to the executant 
for his interpretation of this distinguished 
example of the new art- forms with which mod- 
ern pianistic literature was being enriched. 

We can never sufficiently marvel, I think, at 
the critical capacity to take its artistic pleas- 
ures painfully. From modern art it seems, 
preferably, to demand a paralyzing punch 
upon the solar plexus, after which it most de- 
lights in being dragged by the heels to the top- 
most turret of the artist's ivory tower and 
violently precipitated therefrom. The critical 
anatomy being admittedly indestructible, it 
then, having gathered itself together and 
picked itself up, hastens off to blacken paper 
to the effect that it has been its privilege to 
assist at a most distinguished performance. 

" Distinguished ! " potent word ! " I think 
therefore I am," said Descartes. "It is dis- 



50

[Jan. 20 



tinguished therefore it is," says the Olym- 
pian critic of poem, painting, or polyphony 
of anything that aspires to consideration as an 
artistic achievement. "Y-e-e-s," feebly as- 
sents the bourgeois bystander (who, as we all 
know, forms the indispensable background of 
Olympian criticism) , shuddering lest he make 
a mistake, "but how am I to know what is 
distinguished from what is n't ? " " How in- 
deed ? " is the response. " To be frank, you 
cannot. But I am here to instruct you. Fol- 
low me, and possibility of error is eliminated. 
For instance ." And the next lesson ensues. 

I have just been studying one of these 
lessons, and I confess to a doubt to a doubt 
that swells to a suspicion of the infalli- 
bility of my Mentor; who, in this case, is 
discussing the poet Longfellow. To be par- 
ticular, he is offering what he terms a " Por- 
trait of Longfellow"; and, as the finishing 
touch thereof, he pronounces him to have 
been, as a poet, utterly destitute of "dis- 
tinction." Of Longfellow the man something 
different, he thinks, may be averred. One can 
even discern that he is rather pleased to be 
able to record that Longfellow was, humanly 
speaking, a truly distinguished gentleman; 
and he bestows on him various approving 
phrases which must, to his benignant shade in 
its serene place upon Parnassus, be indeed 
most comforting. But of Longfellow the 
poet ! Up go the Olympian eyebrows; the 
Olympian nostrils dilate, and very palpably 
they sniff; and the Olympian hand, with a 
weary gesture, altogether eliminates the au- 
thor of "My Lost Youth," "Palingenesis," 
and "A Psalm of Life " from his distinguished 
consideration. It is done with an assured 
inexorability that is final. But if the reader 
happens to have a portrait of Longfellow 
hanging upon his library wall (as some bour- 
geois readers who have not yet balanced them- 
selves upon the most vertiginous aiguilles of 
the New Parnassus possibly still have) he will 
raise his eyes to the pictured face and, as I 
have said, he will have his doubts, and his 
doubts will swell into suspicions. But not sus- 
picions of Longfellow, suspicions of the 
Olympian and oh, so distinguished, critic ! 

In my opening paragraph I alluded to a 
composer Mendelssohn; for, as I ponder 
his case and that of Longfellow, I find be- 
tween them a quite predicable parallelism: 
in their lives and works, the places which, in 



their respective pantheons, they occupy, and, 
above all, the "distinction" which, in Olym- 
pian estimation, they enjoy or, rather, lack ! 
It is not, necessarily, complete, for such par- 
allels never can be ; still, the seeker for simili- 
tude will not fail to discover it should he 
compare the music of Mendelssohn with the 
poetry of Longfellow. Both are character- 
ized by a spontaneous purity, sincerity, and 
sweetness, an exquisitely poignant emotional 
sensibility, an innate serenity and inimitable 
because quite unaffected grace ; by fineness of 
fibre, delicacy of timbre, and instinctive 
avoidance of things repulsive and repellent. 
Both poet and composer possessed effortless 
mastery of their technical resources, and are 
notable for the ease at which they sustained 
themselves at their own levels and the rarity 
with which, appreciably, they fell below them. 
Each is devoid of eroticism but instinct with 
love, as we contrast it with the implications of 
passion, though in this respect Longfellow's 
range is wider and his touch more vibrant. 
As their accomplishments were similar, so 
also were their limitations limitations from 
which they themselves would never have pre- 
sumed to claim exemption, for their unpre- 
tentiousness was complete, the " immodesty of 
genius " being foreign to their natures. Both 
also possessed extraordinary personal charm, 
and they remain incontestably among the best- 
beloved makers of music and poetry that yet 
have lived. If this correspondence has never 
before enforced itself, take down your Long- 
fellow and re-read " Voices of the Night " and 
others of those so familiar and so felicitous 
lyrics, and then once more scan the scores or 
harken to the audible music of " Songs with- 
out Words " ; turn again the leaves of " Evan- 
geline," "Hiawatha," "Tales of a Wayside 
Inn," or " The Golden Legend," and then re- 
call the harmonies of the " Midsummer Night's 
Dream " overture, " Fingal's Cave," " Sea- 
Calm and Happy Voyage," or " Elijah." 

It has become one of the established canons 
of Olympian criticism to depreciate both the 
poet and the composer. But this depreciation, 
while it may be "distinguished," cannot de- 
grade them ; because, happily enough, 'both 
Longfellow and Mendelssohn wrote, not for 
critics, but for lovers of poetry and music. It 
merely indicates, in the depreciators, a lack of 
sympathy, an insensibility, a delimitation, a 
sort of tone-deafness, for which they are, after 



1916]

all, most to be pitied. To the lover of Longfel- 
low and Mendelssohn, it may become rather 
tiresome at times, and rather sad; until 
he remembers that nowadays the beaker of art 
is not dipped, ordinarily, into the Castalian 
spring, but filled from a siphon or even 
from a beer-pump ! There is a great deal of 
fizz and foam at its brim and something 
(usually bitter) beneath, to be gulped down at 
a single swallow lest it gag the thirsting 
soul I was going to say, but perhaps throat 
would be more accurate. There is also a great 
deal of fizz and foam in what I may call the 
Xeo- or Beyond-Olympian criticism now flour- 
ishing; to one of whose oracles we owe the 
statement (in a brand-new volume of superior 
finality) that Longfellow's voice is that of 
" a barrel-organ " ! An example of tone-deaf- 
ness not so piteous as it is out of all whooping. 

The Olympian or, more correctly, the 
Brahminical critic is much given to fulmi- 
nating against those who discuss one of the 
arts in terms of another. To him music, let us 
say, is music, and poetry is poetry, and it is 
quite a monstrous thing to mix or mingle them 
in any way. But one making no pretensions 
to the critical estate, who began writing about 
a poet by referring to a musician, may be 
allowed to pursue his parallel between the two. 
It may be recalled, then, that Hans von 
Billow, who was, in his early career, one of the 
original Wagnerian propagandists, and. in his 
latter days, was among the first to hail with 
enthusiasm the compositions of Richard 
Strauss, pronounced Mendelssohn's "Songs 
without Words " as immortally classical as the 
lyrics of Goethe. Similarly, I chanced to read, 
not long ago, the verdict of a critic of like 
breadth and catholicity, who pronounced the 
lyrics and sonnets of Longfellow the most 
enduringly classical poetry to which America 
has yet given birth. 

I am well aware that the use of the adjective 
"classical" causes many people to see red, 
metaphorically speaking. That is, if I may 
be permitted a Celticism, they see something 
which they think ought to be red but from 
which, they imagine, all vestiges of color have 
carefully been removed and life replaced by 
petrifaction. Which is, indeed, most lamenta- 
ble, most melancholy. Because, on account of 
this unfortunate habit of mind they are miss- 
ing, in a literary sense, half their lives ! If 
thev onlv knew what a classic, a true classic. 



really is ! How infinitely precious, how peren- 
nially pleasure-giving, how perdurably, thril- 
lingly, sentiently alive! Why cannot they 
emulate Mr. Pennell, who finds first Pitts- 
burgh and then the Parthenon subjects that 
inspire him to the production of masterpieces ? 
In Longfellow's case it happens, as a fur- 
ther curious commentary, that this so purely 
and so surely " classical " poet has been, since 
first his voice was lifted, the chosen singer of 
youth. If you will turn to the newly pub- 
lished volumes of Lafcadio Hearn's "Inter- 
pretations of Literature" an unexpected 
retrieval of gold and gems from the grave 
you will there find a chapter on Longfellow 
which, coming as it does from a man recog- 
nized as the finest literary artist identified 
with modern American literature and one of 
the finest ever identified with any, should give 
some of the depreciators pause; so replete is 
it with reverence, with love, and with appre- 
ciation. In its course Hearn says that the boy 
who does not love Longfellow is, in a vital 
way, deficient in poetical sympathy ; and that 
a man who, having loved Longfellow in his 
youth, afterward depreciates and sneers at 
him, is defective in his organization. To be 
sure, this was written some fifteen years ago. 
which, as time goes nowadays in the Garden 
of Poesy, is a very long while. Would Hearn's 
rapport with Longfellow have found such 
unequivocal expression had it been granted 
him to survive another decade and witness 
what it has brought? Was it his misfortune 
to pass from the literary scene before its 
poetical structures began to be erected in the 
Perpendicular Style ; before the gargoyle had 
become greater than the cathedral, the mas- 
caron more than the vase; before the organ 
was supplanted by the steam-calliope and the 
harp by the horse-fiddle? Or was it rather 
incalculably his good fortune? I will not pre- 
tend to say. But of this I am sure, that 
youth, in its essence, is unchanging, immortal. 
What it has always loved, that it will always 
continue to love. And those of us who are so 
happy as to retain our youthfulness of spirit, 
our early sensitiveness and sympathy, to the 
" grand climacteric " and beyond, will con- 
tinue to cherish the poetry of Longfellow in 
our hearts, irrespective of the dicta of Olym- 
pian criticism. For what is the necessity of 
" distinction " to that which we love?

EXCESSES OP FRENCH NATIONALISM. THE AT- 
TACKS ON ROMAIN HOLLAND AND COMTE DE 
GrOBiNEAu. A FRENCH-AMERICAN POET, THE 
LATE STUART MERRILL. AN ANECDOTE OF 
JOHN HAT. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

One of the greatest misfortunes of the pres- 
ent war is the check which it has given to the 
expansion, so well under way, of a sane inter- 
nationalism and the consequent increased de- 
velopment which it has given to a narrow, 
excessive, unhealthy, military nationalism. 
Two striking examples of this evil present 
themselves at this moment in the world of 
French letters, I refer to the attacks on and 
defence of Romain Holland and Comte de 
Gobineau now going on, even beyond the boun- 
daries of France, in reviews, newspapers, and 
conversations. 

Perhaps it is not going too far to say that 
the person who has done most to make Romain 
Rolland known is Dr. Paul Seippel, a Swiss 
Protestant literary critic, born in Geneva but 
now professor at the Zurich Federal Poly- 
technic School, who has travelled in America 
and written a book on our country. It should 
be noted that " Jean-Christophe " is more 
appreciated in Switzerland than in France; 
and when some two years ago the French 
Academy awarded it the Literature Prize, Dr. 
Seippel published a triumphant article which 
did not have its equal in France. Now, Dr. 
Seippel is the author of another book which 
has made a certain noise, " Les Deux Frances," 
in which he shows that he neither understands 
nor values what he calls " la France noire," 
that is, catholic and traditionalist France, nor 
"la France rouge," that is, revolutionary 
and free-thinking France. So when Professor 
Seippel praises a French writer, one may con- 
clude that this writer represents an excep- 
tional France, which is neither "black" nor 
"red," a writer who cannot be completely 
liked or comprehended in the France of to-day 
and who, consequently, must feel himself 
rather out of place in his own country. So 
here may be found the cause of much of the 
criticism to which Romain Rolland is sub- 
jected at this moment, and the cause also of 
many of his own acts which have increased this 
tendency to find fault with him. 

Let me give some specimens of these criti- 
cisms, which I take from letters to me or from 
conversations, of course with the permission 
of the writers or speakers. M. Jean Finot, 
editor of " La Revue," says : 



" It does not suffice to be virtuous ; one must 
also act virtuously. But Romain Rolland has done 
everything to produce the contrary effect. At the 
beginning of the war, he could claim to be igno- 
rant of its causes and its authors. At that time 
he could write with serenity ' Au-dessus de la 
Melee.' But the invasion of Belgium and the 
divulging of the diplomatic documents should have 
made it impossible for him to remain any longer 
at Geneva, far from France which needed all her 
sons. His plain duty was to aid in creating the 
atmosphere of heroism necessary for the triumph 
of the cause of humanity. But he preferred to 
shut himself up in his ivory tower and sow doubts 
as to the beauty and the grandeur of the efforts of 
the Allies. I am quite ready to believe in his sin- 
cerity, but I deplore the way in which he shows it. 
If he is unable to discover the motives and the 
meaning of the grand international tragedy, he 
might at least keep still. But he is guilty, unin- 
tentionally, of the crime of demoralizing a group 
of youths who, influenced by his quasi-heroic atti- 
tude, show an unseeming indifference as to the con- 
sequences of the war, which in the end must be the 
triumph of good or evil, the saving or the loss of 
humanity." 

The only child of the late Pere Hyacinthe, 
Lieutenant Paul Hyacinthe Loyson, whose 
mother and wife were, by the way, both Amer- 
icans, and who is now an interpreter in the 
army, has been especially severe on Romain 
Rolland. His " Un Appel a Romain Rolland," 
in "La Revue" for November, is one of the 
strongest arraignments of Rolland that has 
appeared. Its spirit is summed up in these 
lines which I have just received from Le 
Havre, where Lieutenant Loyson is at present : 

" I have long loved and admired Romain Rol- 
land, and it is for this that I deplore more than 
most persons that the folly of pride has precipi- 
tated him into the absurd. By remaining outside 
of his native land during the war and by refusing 
in what he writes he alone, he absolutely alone, 
of all men of all parties to proclaim the good 
right of France, he has magnificently proved this 
right." 

Lieutenant Loyson is about to publish 
"Etes-vous Neutres devant le Crime?" 
(Paris: Berger-Levrault) , an answer to "Au- 
dessus de la Melee." At the head of the vol- 
ume will appear the following letter from 
Emile Verhaeren, which I am here able to 
make public for the first time and which shows 
plainly how this well-known Belgian poet 
stands in the Rolland controversy : 

" All that I wrote in ' La Belgique Sanglante ' 
shows how happy I am, in these dark days when 
right is sabered by the reiters and cuffed by the 
emperors, to offer you a proof of my esteem. The 
present war is a wicked war. It is aimed at the 
highest and the proudest ideals set up on this 
earth by men since they have thought and worked 
for the public weal. It should be hated; there

should be no tergiversation in the name of a cold 
and culpable neutrality. One's hands should not 
hold scales when the adversary holds a sword. I 
am consequently with you, and, notwithstanding 
all the friendship which I have for Remain Hol- 
land, I will not permit myself to take the side of 
his error." 

Some of his French critics have gone so far 
as to liken Holland's case to that of Dom 
Morin, a French priest now residing in Mu- 
nich, who has come out squarely for the Ger- 
mans. But this is very unfair to Holland, as 
Dom Morin's case is wholly different. He is 
one of those ecclesiastics who look upon the 
Church as their true country, superior to their 
terrestrial country; so, when the separation 
of Church and State came about in France, 
Dom Morin emigrated to Bavaria, one of the 
nations where the Catholics are best treated, 
and there he was when the war broke out. It 
would be much nearer the right to compare 
Holland's conduct with that of the German 
poet, Hermann Hesse, who at Berne is using 
his pen exactly as Romain Holland is using his 
at Geneva. 

And now let me give the opinion of two 
witnesses for the defence, which, like the fore- 
going statements on the other side, are here 
published for the first time. M. Alcide Ebray, 
long time foreign editor of the " Journal des 
Debats" and later French Consul General at 
New York, writes me : 

" I do not think that Romain Rolland can be 
justly accused of being anti-French. He appears 
to me rather to be one of those men, of whom 
there are not a few in France, who have a mixed 
or hybrid mentality. In ordinary times persons 
like Romain Rolland can manage to keep alive in 
them these two spirits; they can even use for 
good the bond uniting these two different mentali- 
ties. But in war times, their position becomes 
difficult. They try to play the part of conciliator, 
and be just and impartial, with the result that 
they please nobody. This is just what has hap- 
pened to Romain Rolland. In France he is treated 
as a German and in Germany he is considered to 
be too lukewarm for the German cause. His case, 
therefore, seems to me more interesting from the 
psychological than from the patriotic standpoint." 

It will be remembered that until rather 
recently Romain Rolland was professor of the 
history of music at the Sorbonne, which chair 
he filled with rare distinction until, run down 
by an automobile and gravely injured, he 
resigned the post to the great regret of the 
faculty. Here is the view taken of his present 
attitude by one of his former colleagues. Pro- 
fessor Henri Lichtenberger, who was last year 
exchange professor at Harvard : 

" I find that many people here in France are 
extremely unjust towards Romain Rolland, who is 



one of the noblest-minded men I know, and whose 
broad Europeanism and spirit of equity are ad- 
mirable to behold. It is permissible to entertain 
different views as to the wisdom of his decision to 
remain in Switzerland during the war and to try 
and place himself above the contending parties. 
But one should bear in mind that Romain Rolland 
has no military duties to perform, has no brother 
or son in the army, and is in bad health, and con- 
sequently in a much better position than most of 
us to assume this attitude." 

In the meanwhile Rolland has done nothing 
to defend himself. Comte Fitz-James, the 
French dramatic critic, who has just returned 
to Paris from a visit to Switzerland, where he 
met Rolland, tells me that the latter feels very 
keenly the way he has been treated in France, 
"where the incriminated articles have been 
published, when published at all, only in a 
garbled form," and the charge is repeated in 
the preface to the volume just out, which gives 
them exactly as they were originally printed 
in the " Journal de Geneve." "Au-dessus de la 
Melee" (Paris: Ollendorff, 2 francs) is now 
in its fifteenth edition, which would seem to 
indicate that commercially these attacks have 
not been bad for Rolland. I have just finished 
reading the book, one of the most interesting 
and notable that the war has produced, and 
I fail to find in it sufficient ground for the 
rough handling which the author has received 
from his own countrymen. Rolland was in 
Switzerland when the war began, " where he is 
now doing excellent work," Dr. Seippel writes 
me from Zurich, "in the "War Prisoners Bu- 
reau at Geneva." Furthermore, in these arti- 
cles, he has always made a marked distinction 
between Prussian militarism and the grand 
old Germany we all admired and loved. The 
first he condemns as severely as anybody, but 
the latter he refuses to deny ; and the justifica- 
tion of his course he finds in this " grand line 
from Emerson," which he gives in the original 
English : " Nothing is more rare in any man 
than an act of his own." But what M. Paul 
Souday said to me the other day seems to 
apply here. " I find fault with Romain Rol- 
land," says the literary editor of " Le Temps," 
"because he assimilates France to Germany. 
But the latter has attacked us and we have had 
to defend ourselves. Again, the mental state 
of our intellectuals should not be likened to 
that of those of Germany, where practically 
all approve the conduct of their government. 
But it is perfectly sure that if France had 
attacked Germany and violated the neutrality 
of Belgium, a large number of our intellec- 
tuals would have protested, the very oppo- 
site of what has happened in Germany." But 
that these articles and this book have exerted 
considerable influence for good is well proved 



54 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 20 



by an example which has come under my own 
eye. Comte Fitz-James said to me the other 
day : "I had finished a volume on the war- 
'Les Ennemis Interieurs' and was on the 
point of giving it to my publisher, when the 
reading of Romain Holland's book decided me 
to entirely remodel my manuscript. I still say 
what I said before, but with an attempt to 
attain the grandiose spirit of moderation set 
before the world by Romain Rolland." 

The attacks on Comte de Gobineau are of a 
still more virulent kind than those on Romain 
Rolland, are far less excusable, and offer a 
prime example of nationalism gone mad; for 
the man has been in his grave since 1882, and 
his crime of pro-Germanism dates from the 
early fifties, fifteen years before the war of 
1870, and sixty years before the present con- 
flict. But this does not prevent his being torn 
to pieces in the most savage and vulgar fash- 
ion by a certain category of Frenchmen. 

When the war came, the surviving members 
of the Gobineau family were quite prepared to 
see their father and grandfather severely 
taken to task for his now famous " Essai sur 
rinegalite de$ Races Humaines" (Paris: 
Didot, 1853-5, 4 vols. in 8) , where, in a word, 
the German race is placed at the head of civ- 
ilization. M. Jean Richepin led off with a dig 
in one of his newspaper articles, and was fol- 
lowed by a contribution which appeared in 
"Les Anales" from the pen of M. Herriot, 
mayor of Lyons, who accuses Gobineau of 
being the cause of the war! Thereupon, the 
eldest daughter of Gobineau, Baroness Gul- 
dencrone, who inherits much of her father's 
literary ability, rushed to his defence in the 
columns of " Le Temps," where she contended 
that his theory had been misunderstood, and 
that he really held that the true and purest 
Teutons are the Scandinavians and even the 
Anglo-Saxons, whereas the Germans of to-day 
are more or less strongly affected by Slavic 
infiltrations. But this questionable apology did 
not prevent M. Frederic Masson from coming 
to the rescue of the nationalist position with 
an extraordinary article which appeared at 
the head of the "Revue Hebdomadaire " of 
October 16, and which for a glaring instance 
of ultra-nationalism and general "cussed- 
ness" has seldom been equalled. Mme. Ser- 
peille, the youngest daughter of Gobineau, 
tells me that the manuscript as originally 
handed to the editor was even worse, and that 
M. Fernand Laudet toned it down considera- 
bly before giving it to the printer. But just 
as it stands it is a disgraceful piece of work, 
which does not reflect credit on the French 
Academy, of which the author is a member, 



or on the "Revue Hebdomadaire," which can- 
not be too severely censured for having per- 
mitted such an offence to the living and the 
dead. In the "Revue Hebdomadaire" of 
November 27 the grandson of Comte de 
Gobineau, M. Clement Serpeille, an intelligent 
young litterateur, publishes a brief and digni- 
fied reply to M. Masson, who follows with some 
comments which do not at all remove the stain 
of his first article. Here is the place to quote 
a remark made to me the other day by a 
French authority on things German, whose 
name, however, had better not be given: 
"Whatever Frederic Masson writes on Ger- 
man affairs is utterly without any value, for 
he is a Germanophobe, as unreasonable and as 
absurd, it seems to me, as the Gallophobia of 
the most ridiculous Pan-Germans. Every 
time I read an article by Masson or Louis Ber- 
trand, I am thrown into a state of exaspera- 
tion. They make us the laughing-stock of all 
neutrals." 

If one would know what intelligent and 
au courant Frenchmen think of Gobineau, one 
should read the three articles by M. Paul 
Souday, which appeared in " Le Temps " some 
two years ago ; " La Vie et les Propheties du 
Comte de Gobineau," by the young journalist 
of "Le Figaro," M. Robert Dreyfus, perhaps 
the best book to give one an idea of the per- 
sonality and the intellectuality of Gobineau, 
where the frontispiece, a portrait of him, de- 
picts a highly cultivated man with a good head 
and aristocratic features; and "La Philoso- 
phic de I'lmperialisme," by Baron Ernest 
Seilliere, member of the Institute, a substan- 
tial study of the philosophy of Gobineau's life 
and works. Then one will have a fair idea of 
this remarkable man and one will wonder still 
more at the impertinence of this Masson tirade 
and vulgarity. 

This spirit of excessive nationalism finds an 
efficient corrective in the presence among the 
contemporary writers of France of a small but 
brilliant and active element of foreign-born 
men of letters, who see well beyond the borders 
of their adopted country. One of the most 
admirable of this group has unfortunately 
just died. I refer to the American poet, Stuart 
Merrill. I knew his father, who, in the latter 
seventies, was the blind lawyer of our Amer- 
ican colony, a learned, gentle-spirited man; 
but I made the acquaintance of the talented 
son only when he had already become a recog- 
nized French poet. The last time we met was 
at a Washington's Birthday banquet here in 
Paris, when I, as toast-master, called upon 
Francis Viele-Griffin, our other French- 
American poet, to read an original ode in 



1916] 



THE DIAL

honor of the Father of his Country, while 
Stuart Merrill led in the applause. And it is 
Viele-Griffin who to-day sends me for THE 
DIAL this admirable estimate and eulogy of 
our old and common friend : 

" In the first letter I ever had from Stuart 
Merrill, dated New York, April 13, 1887, he ex- 
presses his aesthetic dream of the young poet : ' I 
am not the only American who is trying to endow 
the French alexandrine with a little of the enchant- 
ing music of English verse; for you are, are you 
not? a disciple of Swinburne. Ah! don't deny it, 
for you need not be ashamed to admit that you 
are the disciple of that incomparable master, just 
as you might avow your being the disciple of 
Wagner, without losing any of your own proper 
genius. To express the idea by words, to suggest 
emotion by the music of these words, such are, 
I think, the alpha and the omega of our doctrine.' 

" From the start, Stuart Merrill was, to use his 
own words, ' the poet of sonorities and splendors.' 
It is in his volume, 'Les Fastes,' that he merits 
this title. In the works which followed, he showed 
himself, without losing any of his verbal virtu- 
.osity, to be the landscapist of the horizons of | 
Fontainebleau, Grez, and Marlotte, where he often ! 
spent his summers. His gorgeous music lent itself 
to the sincerities of the popular song, and in ' Les 
Quatre Saisons' it is the triumph of life, at once 
calm and passionate, of the laborious poet whose 
window opens on the grand highway of France. 
Although Merrill had travelled much, he trans- 
lated, like the painters of Barbizon, like Manet 
and Corot, only the landscape and atmosphere of 
the valley of the Seine. He is a true French poet 

" The generosity and nobility of Merrill's nature 
necessarily inclined him towards human suffering, 
and he lived in the hope of seeing the dawn of ' 
justice and fraternity, when the horrible butchery 
of the present hour surprised him in the midst of 
his dream. He was suffering from heart-disease, 
and still hopeful, he died from the terrible emo- 
tions in the midst of which we are now living, his 
eye fixed on the victory of justice and right. In ; 
fine, one of the best poets of a time which is rich 
in grand lyric bards, Stuart Merrill has passed 
away surrounded with the affectionate admiration 
of his peers and the esteem of those who enjoyed 
his intimacy, for the man in him was as noble as 
the poet was delicate, and the kindness of his 
heart equalled the idealism of his thought." 

The fact that Merrill's wife was a Belgian 
and that he lived much of the year in the 
suburbs of Brussels strengthens Viele-Griffin's 
intimation, shared by us all, that the war 
hastened his end. 

Some twelve years ago while I was writing I 
a letter to John Hay. there was placed on my 
table a French periodical containing a critique 
by Merrill of Hay as a poet. I sent it to "Wash- 
ington by the same post as my letter, and 
in due season came a reply from the busy 
Secretary of State, which closed with this 
paragraph : 



" Curiously enough, the paper came just as I 
was translating, or at least trying to translate, 
into English verse one of Merrill's poems, which 
had struck my fancy. He is pretty hard on my 
so-called poetry, but I suppose it richly deserves 
all the censure which he bestows on it. I trust, 
however, that Stuart Merrill will find my transla- 
tion worthy of the original. Let me know if he 
does." 

How like John Hay this was ! And his for- 
giving generosity is all the more admirable 
when we recall what is brought out in Profes- 
sor Thayer's recent excellent biography of 
Hay, that it was one of the dreams of his early 
manhood to become above all things a great 

poet> THEODORE STANTON. 

Paris, Dec. 30, 1915. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

LINGUISTIC THEORY AND PRACTICE never quite 
harmonize even in the writings of the most 
painstaking. Some little verbal or gram- 
matical or syntactical defect will be found to 
mar the otherwise perfect page of the most 
careful purist. But if perfection were attain- 
able instead of being always just beyond our 
reach and seductively inviting pursuit, what 
zest would there be left in living? On the 
editorial page of an esteemed journal pub- 
lished in the cultured city of Boston there was 
recently printed an excellent plea for the 
preservation of our language in all its wealth 
of resources from innumerable fountains of 
supply, in all its fine distinctions and grada- 
tions, both verbal and grammatical. Espe- 
cially did the writer deplore the indiscriminate 
use as synonyms of words not synonymous, 
instancing " would " and " should " (but unac- 
countably making no mention of " will " and 
" shall ") . Always timely and never uncalled- 
for in a carelessly speaking and writing world 
are such reminders of our besetting sins of 
speech. Video meliora prorogue, deteriora 
sequor, is the shame-faced confession of even 
the best of us, including the excellent news- 
paper in question; for this same editorial 
section was disfigured by such looseness of 
expression as the following, referring to the 
term " preparedness " and the different mean- 
ings given to it by different authorities : " Mr. 
Roosevelt's definition is a more extreme one 
than most Americans of any other party." 
For a more violent ellipsis one might have to 
hunt far. In the same paragraph occurs " the 
proposition to nominate Mr. Roosevelt for 
President," wherein the use of " proposition " 
in the sense of "proposal" (a very frequent 
and even classic substitution) is to be noted 



56

with at least mild disapproval. Since we have 
the two words, why render our language so 
much the poorer by making them interchange- 
able? In America almost everything is now 
denotable by this much-abused term. For ex- 
ample, in " Wolfville Nights " we read : " He 
could call a coyote or a fox, or even so fitful 
an' nervous a prop'sition as a antelope." 



AUTHORSHIP IN AN ALIEN TONGUE, in a lan- 
guage acquired with more or less effort after 
childhood, is not often brilliantly successful; 
but there are not wanting a number of con- 
spicuous instances of such success. Marcus 
Aurelius, though born and bred in Rome, and 
speaking Latin as his mother tongue, wrote 
his "Meditations" in Greek. Blanco White 
(Jose Blanco was his name in his native 
Spain) did not emigrate to England until he 
was thirty-five years old ; yet, besides other 
writings in his adopted language, he gave to 
English literature one of its finest sonnets. 
Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen came to this coun- 
try from Norway at the age of twenty-one, 
and made English his chief medium of expres- 
sion as an author. The Dutch novelist known 
as " Maarten Maartens " wrote almost exclu- 
sively in his adopted tongue. Mr. Houston 
Stewart Chamberlain, famous on two conti- 
nents for his remarkable work, " The Founda- 
tions of the Nineteenth Century," is a Briton 
by birth and early training, being the son of 
a British admiral and the grandson of a Brit- 
ish naval captain, and apparently the last 
person to renounce his Briticism. But all the 
world knows, as he has taken pains to let it 
know, that he is now, and long has been, even 
more German than the Germans. Not only 
has he written chiefly in German, his master- 
piece above-named being in that tongue and 
translated into English by another hand, but 
he now turns against his native language, to- 
gether with all things English, in a fury of 
partisanship for German and Germany such 
as only a convert can show toward the per- 
versities and depravities of his unregenerate 
past. In an utterance addressed to the mis- 
guided people of his native land, and pub- 
lished in "The International Review," he 
glorifies the nation that has produced a 
Treitschke, a Nietzsche, and a Bernhardi, and 
heaps extravagant praise upon its language. 
" Germany alone, of all the nations," he as- 
sures his readers, "still guards a living treas- 
ure, one capable of development, unfathomable 
as is everything which comes from God. 
It is her language." That our own language 
has a quite contrary origin he all but tells us 
in so many words, and he evidently believes 



that not the least of the benevolent ends held 
in view by the belligerent Teutons is the sup- 
planting of that decadent tongue. All this is 
depressing, not to say humiliating, to an 
English-speaking person ; but we may still be 
thankful that our language is not yet incapa- 
ble of effective use in so eloquent and enter- 
taining an article as that with which Herr 
Chamberlain has favored us. 


THE FINEST PRIVATE LIBRARY IN THE WORLD, 

that of Mr. Henry E. Huntington of New 
York, has recently assured itself of this pre- 
eminence beyond doubt or cavil by a notable 
increase to its treasures through the addition 
of the collection hitherto owned by Mr. Fred- 
erick R. Halsey of the same city. About 
three-quarters of a million dollars is rumored 
to have been the price paid by Mr. Hunting- 
ton for the Halsey library, which itself is the 
fruit of thirty-five years of assiduous expert 
collecting in Americana, early English litera- 
ture, nineteenth-century first editions, rich 
bindings, and other precious rarities obtainable 
only by persons of wealth. Mr. Hunting- 
ton's rise to fame as a book-collector is com- 
paratively recent. It began with his purchase 
of the E. D wight Church library for a million 
and a quarter dollars, or some such fabulous 
amount of money; the next event was his 
securing of the Beverly Chew collection at a 
figure said to have been a round half-million; 
and soon afterward occurred the famous Hoe 
sale and Mr. Huntington's purchase of the 
first printed book, the Gutenberg Bible, at a 
price never before paid for a single work, 
fifty thousand dollars, with other rare works, 
all amounting to a quarter-million dollars. 
Judge Russell Benedict's fine collection of 
Revolutionary War books and other volumes 
of great value next fell a prey to Mr. Hunt- 
ington's collectomania ; and, finally, the Hal- 
sey library was secured. With no new Avorlds 
to conquer, so far as he can see for the pres- 
ent, this multimillionaire bibliophile will now 
have his entire library catalogued by Mr. 
George Watson Cole, whose bibliographic skill 
was notably shown in the Church catalogue, 
and then he ought to be entitled to a few 
weeks' vacation from collecting and railroad- 
ing in order to become acquainted with his 
books. 

THE GOVERNMENT AS PUBLISHER Seems to 

have undergone a change of heart. It is mend- 
ing its ways and stopping some of the waste 
that has in the past rendered it notorious as 
the most recklessly uneconomical of printing 
and distributing establishments. Though the 
congressmen are not yet all sufficiently self- 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



57 



restrained in placing their oratorical efforts 
before the eyes of their constituents, which 
means a lavish use of the franking privilege 
and the virtual waste of thousands of pages of 
printed matter, there has been considerable 
reform in the practice of sending out docu- 
ments with no assurance that they will be 
appreciated by the receivers, or even opened by 
them. The sale of such documents has been 
greatly increased, the charge being only 
enough to pay the cost of mechanical produc- 
tion, which is likewise enough to make them 
valued and put to a good use when they reach 
their destination. In a single decade the an- 
nual sales have mounted from five thousand 
dollars to forty times that amount. As a pub- 
lisher of periodicals that circulate on a busi- 
ness basis, the government has built up what 
would be considered, under private manage- 
ment, an immense trade. Nearly two-score 
regular publications of this sort are now 
issued, ranging in price from twenty-five cents 
a year, the modest subscription fee asked for 
" The National Weather and Crop Bulletin," 
to five dollars a year, the charge for the patent- 
office " Gazette," a large and fully illustrated 
weekly. Price-lists of its numerous and ever- 
increasing publications are circulated by the 
government, the post-office department aiding 
greatly in this work of publicity, and com- 
mendable effort is being made to bring: the 
particular pamphlet or book or periodical and 
the person whom it should interest and profit 
into contact with each other. Many valuable 
treatises, having each sixty or perhaps more 
pages of print, are obtainable at as low a cost 
as five cents apiece; but (and this should be 
carefully heeded) an enclosure of postage 
stamps will not secure any of these publica- 
tions. Uncle Sam does a cash business. 



A FAMILIAR THEME IN LIBRARY LITERATURE is 

"The Place of the Library in -." The 
blank may be variously filled in. but the gen- 
eral sense remains much the same. Sometimes 
it is " the community " that is considered in 
its relation to the library, at others "the 
public school system," or "the educational 
scheme," or it may be. with a wider scope, 
"modern life." Dr. Ernest C. Kichardson. 
Librarian of Princeton University, prepared 
a paper for presentation before the Interna- 
tional Conference of Librarians at Oxford, 
but the war upset the plans of that confer- 
ence, as it upset so many other plans, and 
there was no conference, consequently no 
paper read by Dr. Richardson or anyone else. 
However, the Princeton librarian's labors 
were not by any means to be thrown away; 



he has printed his essay in a twelve-page 
pamphlet; and the title has the good old 
familiar ring. It is this, " The Place of the 
Library in the University." The writer is 
known for his able and learned treatises on 
pre-historic libraries and other abstruse bibli- 
othecal subjects, and his systematic treatment 
of any theme engaging his attention is also 
known. Therefore one is prepared to find him 
ordering his present discourse under logically 
arranged headings, and clearing the ground 
with all needful (and perhaps some not 
strictly needful) definitions as he goes along. 
The university is defined, the various kinds of 
university students are enumerated, several 
pages are given to the methods of teaching; 
then the library is defined, the nature of the 
university library is considered and also its 
methods of imparting instruction, a section is 
devoted to "Systematic Staff Teaching: 
Book Arts and Library Schools," and, finally, 
the place of the library in the university 
which is what we started out to learn is 
specifically considered in a page and a half, 
with a brief " sum of the matter " as a wind- 
up. So scholarly a treatment of so scholarly 
a theme should give pleasure to all scholarly 

readers. 



CONCERNING PLOTS there has been some re- 
cent discussion aroused by Mr. Arnold Ben- 
nett's remarks on the subject in his book, " The 
Author's Craft." He says, for instance, that 
" the plot is good when you want to make sure 
what will happen next. Good plots set you 
anxiously guessing what will happen next." 
Cordial assent is given to this by most readers, 
while others as heartily dissent, maintaining 
that the best novels are those that hold the 
interest so completely from page to page that 
there never enters the reader's head any 
thought of what is going to happen next: and 
the disputants wax warm in support of their 
respective views, not suspecting that they may 
be arguing at cross purposes. There are, in 
respect to plots, two very obvious kinds of 
novels, those with plots and those without 
them. He whose chosen fiction is of the class 
well represented by " The Woman in White " 
finds his pleasure in being kept "anxiously 
guessing what will happen next." in wonder- 
ing what will be the next turn in the intricate 
maze of the plot, and will have but a poor 
opinion of any story that fails to pique his 
curiosity in this way. On the other hand, the 
novel-reader whose favorite book is "Don 
Quixote." with all its looseness of method, its 
inconsistencies and self-contradictions, its 
almost total lack of structural coherence, will 
get no satisfaction from the ingenious and 



58 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 20 



elaborate fabrications of Wilkie Collins. To 
him they are nothing but tiresome pieces of 
mechanism, mere machinery without a spark 
of life. The plotless novel, like "Wilhelm 
Meister " or " Jean-Christophe," and the novel 
with a plot, like " The Leavenworth Case " or 
" The Danvers Jewels," are so dissimilar in 
kind as to be hardly more comparable, one 
with the other, than an alligator and a tuning- 
fork. 



THE SHIFTING SANDS OF SIMPLIFIED SPELLING 

are almost as treacherous as the sliding banks 
of the Culebra Cut. When once the mania 
for re-making our written speech has seized a 
person, there is no certain limit to its rav- 
ages. Like other passions, the zeal for ortho- 
graphic reform grows with indulgence, and 
no two schools of reformers, scarcely any two 
individual reformers, can agree as to when 
the curb should be applied. The " Simplified 
Speling Sosieti" of England has very lately 
made a further advance in heterodoxy and 
become the " Simplifyd Speling Sosyeti," and 
its bi-monthly periodical, " The Pioneer ov 
Simplified Speling," has been transformed 
into "The Pyoneer ov Simplifyd Speling," 
which is no longer " publisht bi " said asso- 
ciation, but "publisht by" a curiously un- 
intentional return to partial sanity. Among 
the " distingwisht authorz " of the past whom 
it proudly and prominently mentions as sup- 
porters of the reform, it names James Russell 
Lowell, perhaps having in mind certain 
numerous passages in "The Biglow Papers," 
as for instance Birdofredom Sawin's declara- 
tion : " This goin' ware glory waits ye haint 
one agreeable feetur, an' ef it worn't fer 
wakin' snakes, I'd home agin short meter"; 
or Hosea Biglow's pronouncement that "ef 
any thin's foolisher and moor dicklus than 
militerry gloary it is milishy gloary." A short 
cut through the acknowledged irregularities 
and difficulties of our highly composite lan- 
guage may or may not be desirable; but, 
granted this desirability, where is the Colonel 
Goethals to engineer the work and safeguard 
the channel from landslides (if such safe- 
guarding be in any wise possible) ? On the 
whole, the old orthographic route around the 
other horn of our dilemma (forgive the mixed 
metaphor) is likely to prove the safer. 


BOOK-STANDARDIZATION, not in respect to 

inner content, but as to outer form, has long 
been the dream of librarians and others inter- 
ested in making a given amount of book-space 
hold a maximum number of books. With vol- 
umes of all sizes to provide with shelves, and 
with many sizes even in a single branch of lit- 



erature, the waste space in a large book-stack 
necessarily amounts to considerable ; and if a 
congested city library that is planning an 
extension to its stack has to pay several hun- 
dred dollars per square foot for the needed 
additional ground, it becomes a matter of 
practical economy to figure out a possible 
scheme whereby all the books on a particular 
subject may be made to dress their ranks with 
no marked irregularities of height in any one 
of those ranks. What is the most convenient 
and in every way desirable book-size for polite 
literature, for natural science, for art-works, 
and for the various other departments of 
printed matter, will probably never be deter- 
mined by any common agreement; and so 
there will always be a place in the reading 
world, especially in the library world, for 
such laborious treatises as that which has just 
come from the pens of the Herren Doctoren 
Rudolf and W. Angermann on "Normal 
Book-size and Normal Story-height" ("Nor- 
malbuchgrosse und Normalgeschosshohe"). 
The problems in least common multiple and 
greatest common divisor suggested by the mere 
title cannot here be discussed; but that the 
whole theme is eminently congenial to the 
German type of scholarship no one having any 
acquaintance with that scholarship will doubt. 
Little hope is there of practical results per- 
haps they are undesirable anyhow from 
such researches, but it may be well to have the 
theory of the matter worked out, once for all, 
with Teutonic thoroughness. Harrassowitz, 
of Leipzig, publishes the work. 



THE AUTHORITY OF SOCRATES, as a true 
patriot and eloquent advocate of patriotism, 
is invoked by " The Spectator " in an attempt 
to bring the " shirker ' ' to his sense of duty in 
this hour of his country's danger. It quotes 
from the " Crito " considerable portions of the 
dialogue between the Laws and the imprisoned 
sage of Athens. A few lines will illustrate 
the remarkable aptness of the citations for 
the present purposes of Lord Derby and the 
others associated with him in guiding the for- 
tunes of imperilled Albion. Here, in Jowett's 
translation, are one or two sentences uttered 
(if we may accept Plato's word for it) twenty- 
three centuries ago, the pronouns " she " and 
'' her " referring to one's country : "And 
when we are punished by her, whether with 
imprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to 
be endured in silence; and if she lead us to 
wounds or death in battle, thither we follow 
as is right; neither may anyone yield or re- 
treat or leave his rank, but whether in battle 
or in a court of law, or in any other place,

he must do what his city and his country 
order him; or he must change their view of 
what is just ; and if he may do no violence to 
his father or mother, much less may he do vio- 
lence to his country." Whether one side with 
Socrates (speaking here as the Laws) or with 
Mr. Jack London, in respect to a citizen's 
obligations in military matters, the undying 
vitality, the unfailing freshness or modern- 
ity, of the classics, find in the quoted passage 
another striking illustration. The master- 
pieces of literature are masterpieces chiefly 
because they never lose their present signifi- 
cance. 

THE POET'S OPPORTUNITY has come. One 
thousand dollars in gold will be paid " to the 
persons who write the best verse on Newark," 
announces the editor of " The Newarker," and 
he thus continues in characteristic vein : " I 
say persons and not poets, for everyone can 
try ; and I say verse and not poetry, for if no 
poetry is offered then verses will win the 
prizes. No good poetry on Newark has yet 
been written ; the field is quite clear, the bars 
are down; the grass is fresh and green, and ! 
if there is no Pierian spring, perhaps the 
prizes will make good the lack. . . . Consider 
also, O Poets, that in her 250 years Newark 
has not been idle, but has lived an active life, 
varied in a thousand ways, and filled with j 
incidents which need only to be touched by a 
man of vision to take on at once the dramatic 
air. Indeed, no city in the country, no mat- 
ter how romantic and full of color its history 
may seem to be, has a past more full of the 
episodes about which good poetry may be j 
woven ; a present more complex, more full of 
conflicting movements, more deeply touched 
by human passions: and a future more 
abounding in possibilities quite epic in their 
range than this same hitherto unsung Newark j 
on the Passaic. If any poet of foreign parts | 
does not believe what I say, let him come and j 
look and learn." Finally it is added: "We j 
have in the library several dictionaries of j 
rhymes and many good books on how to tell 
poetry when you see it : none, alas ! on how to 
write it." The prizes are offered by the Com- 
mittee of One Hundred on Newark's 250th 
Anniversary, 1666-1916. 

A FAVORITE PLAN WITH PUBLISHERS, and One 

that has its undeniable merits, is the issue of 
books in sets or series that sometimes are logi- | 
cally formed and hold together by a certain | 
natural and recognizable affinity, but at other | 
times have less excuse for their existence and 
are artificial in their structure. But there is 



always something impressive to the book- 
buyer in the name and uniform appearance of 
a set. The " Pigskin Library " or the " Five- 
foot Shelf" or the "Great Captains Series" 
looks so trim, so imposing even, in its entirety, 
that many a casual inquirer for a single num- 
ber is led into the purchase of the whole row, 
whether or not there is any likelihood of 
his ever reading the entire series. A new 
"library," in this special sense of the word, 
is about to appear in London and, presumably, 
in New York also, its name to be "The Museum 
Library," and its contents to embrace anno- 
tated selections from the chief works of the 
nineteen British authors whose names so con- 
spicuously show themselves to anyone entering 
the reading-room of the British Museum. On 
the circular walls of that famous resort of the 
studious are inscribed the names of the fol- 
lowing lights of English literature: Chaucer, 
Caxton, Tyndale, Spenser, Shakespeare. Ba- 
con, Milton, Locke, Addison, Swift, Pope, 
Gibbon, Wordsworth, Scott, Byron, Carlyle, 
Macaulay, Tennyson. Browning. To each of 
these will be devoted a volume containing a 
biographical study of the author in question, a 
bibliography of his works, and an annotated 
selection from his more important writings. A

ure, and will contain noted studies of all the

PSEUDONYMS THAT CLING, fitting so well 
that the real name is all but forgotten, are 
few in comparison with the many that have 
been assumed and then have fallen into dis- 
use. Such pen-names as George Eliot, Mark 
Twain, Pierre Loti, Anatole France, are of a 
permanence such that even the scrupulous 
cataloguer often consents to recognize them 
at the expense of the honestly inherited patro- 
nymic. On the other hand, who now would 
ever think or speak of Thackeray as " Michael 
Angelo Titmarsh," or even of Dickens as 
" Boz " ? Charlotte Bronte is known to thou- 
sands who would hardly recognize her as 
" Currer Bell," and Dr. J. G. Holland is now 
never referred to as " Timothy Titcomb." Of 
the foregoing pseudonyms there is one that 
most persons are inclined to regard as a real 
name, "Anatole France." Indeed, even the 
informed speak habitually of " Monsieur Ana- 
tole France," just as they speak occasionally 
of " Mr. Norman Angell." But the illustrious 
Frenchman's father was one Noel Thibault, a 
poor bookseller with a shop on the Quai Mala-

quais, close to the Seine and not far from the 
Pont Neuf, the Louvre, and Notre Dame. The 
elder Thibault was nicknamed " Pere France " 
by his regimental comrades, and the son 
turned the jest to account in the choice of a 
pseudonym that has become known around 
the world. In private life he is Jacques Ana- 
tole Thibault. An early desire to become 
famous, not as an author, but as a saint, is 
chronicled in the records of his childhood. 
Vying with St. Simeon Stylites in mortifica- 
tion of the flesh, he took up his station on top 
of the kitchen pump, only to be promptly 
deposed by an unsympathetic maid servant; 
and cutting open the seat of a chair to pro- 
cure himself the wherewithal for a hair shirt, 
he was ignominiously whipped and put to bed. 
It was fame of a less sanctified though of a 
not less enviable character that had marked 
him for her own. ... 

A YEAR'S PROGRESS IN EDUCATION finds its 
encouraging summing-up in Commissioner 
Claxton's annual report for our national De- 
partment of Education. While Europe has 
been busy undoing, so far as possible, the 
work of centuries of educational and indus- 
trial and other effort, this country has con- 
tinued its constructive labors in reclaiming as 
wide an area as might be of the barren do- 
main of ignorance. Among things achieved in 
this field Dr. Claxton enumerates the revival 
of interest in the kindergarten, greater care 
for the health of young pupils, longer terms 
of school activity, better pay for teachers, 
school-attendance laws in certain States hith- 
erto without them, the adoption of a larger 
unit of rural school administration in several 
States, a raising of the standard of prepara- 
tion required of teachers in some States and 
an extension of the means necessary for 
furnishing this preparation, and, finally, in- 
creased differentiation of work and adjust- 
ment of studies in schools of all grades, to 
rafet the needs of children of varying ability 
and the vocational life of the community con- 
cerned. This is a far better showing than 
many a European minister of education will 
be able to make for the year just closed. 


THE REPORT OF THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDA- 
TION is not exactly a literary production ; but 
there are times when literature must take a 
back seat. Two English noblemen once quar- 
relled as to which of them could write the best 
verses, and they agreed to refer the dispute to 
John Dryden. One of them dashed off a few 
lines on a piece of paper and handed it to 
Dryden, who immediately declared that he 
had won. "But," said the other, "you have 



not read my verses." "It is unnecessary," 
said Dryden, "you cannot beat this," and 
showed him a check for a hundred pounds. 
Seriously, the Rockefeller Foundation seems 
to be a most laudable and useful affair. Dur- 
ing the past year it contributed about a 
million dollars to Belgian Relief, and a mil- 
lion and a half to other objects. It has been 
regarded with a good deal of suspicion by 
Congress; but there does not seem to be any- 
thing in it to be frightened about. In the 
finances of nations, as they show to-day, even 
one hundred million dollars is a mere baga- 
telle. With the provisions against the ac- 
cumulation of funds, and practical national 
control of the governing board, there would 
not appear to be any danger to the State in 
the charity. It is well enough to look a gift 
horse in the mouth; but when the steed has 
proved its speed and bottom, skepticism ought 
to cease. The gratitude of the Belgian suffer- 
ers ought to weigh down any jealousy of this 

Fund. 



A NEW USE FOR DISCARDED LITERATURE. SUCh 

as old books, useless pamphlets, back numbers 
of magazines, stale newspapers, is predicted 
by a German scientist, a certain Professor 
Mehner, who gives utterance to some charac- 
teristically German advice in the columns of 
the " Hamburger Nachrichten." Not only, he 
urges, should all waste paper be saved as being 
excellent material for bedding cattle, thus re- 
leasing as fodder the straw commonly used for 
this purpose, but, more than that, processes 
may be discovered that will ere long make 
paper itself available for fodder ; and thus the 
very literature that has fed readers' minds in 
town and country will soon afterward feed 
their bodies in the form of beefsteak, roast 
beef, veal cutlets, milk, butter, and cheese, 
through the transmuting medium of paper-fed 
cattle. But why not turn the literature di- 
rectly into nutritious and appetizing food for 
the table? Surely, nothing is impossible to 
German efficiency under the present spur of 

necessity. 



MR. HENRY JAMES'S DECORATION, only a 
short half-year after his renunciation of 
American citizenship in favor of English,

It will be recalled that last July, when he 
decided to become a Briton, he explained his

her people. It was a frank and manly state- 
ment of his position, and the Order of Merit 
now given to him by an appreciative sover- 
eign will certainly not be begrudged him by 
any of his admirers. It is no small honor to 
wear a decoration that has adorned a Mere- 
dith in the past and is worn by a Morley, a 
Bryce, a Trevelyan, and a Hardy, in the pres- 
ent. Instituted as a mark of especial distinc- 
tion for military or naval service, or for 
notable contributions to art, literature, or 
science, the order includes at present but 
eleven civilian members, so that its bestowal 
on Mr. James ought to gratify him more than 
would an invitation to enter the far more 
crowded company of knights or baronets 
that is, of course, if he cares for such things 
at all ; and not to care for them is to be either 
more or less than human. 


AN INTERCOLLEGIATE MAGAZINE, with the 

peremptory title of "Challenge," is to make

leading universities and colleges throughout 
the country, and the magazine ought to find 
interested readers at almost every seat of 
learning and to promote intercollegiate good-

" Challenge " will make its purpose " to stimu- 
late the free expression of opinion among 
American students, to the end that each 
American college and university may become 
a conscious and informed intellectual democ- 
racy." Great things are evidently hoped for

COMMUNICATIONS. 



" WE MODEEXS " AND THE BROOM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

We are told in your columns of a young poet 
who says, " I now see that Bryant is a symbol of 
everything that we moderns must sweep aside." If 
the young " poet " who feels that way reads these 
columns, let him rest assured that the sooner he 
turns the broom to the more urgent task of sweep- 
ing aside his own conceit the better will be the 
chance that he will one day be an old poet. No 
great school of art, literary or otherwise, has ever 
yet begun by sweeping away that which has once 
gained a vital hold on the affections of the people. 

Asinius Pollio, a would-be " modern " of the 
expiring Roman Republic and early Empire, tried 



the broom on the prose style of Cicero. To-day, so 
far as we know with certainty, we have but a 
handful of scattered fragments of Pollio's prose, 
together with three words of his poetry cited by a 
Roman grammarian, while the prose of Cicero re- 
mains an influence of enormous power in the style 
of all the great literary tongues of the modern 
Indo-European language family. One does not 
want to be harsh, and yet it needs to be said that 
all talk of " sweeping away " the art of the past 
in order to make room for the new is merely the 
whine of incompetence. Whence does the new 
artist propose to sweep the art of the old? Not 
out of his own system, for it most assuredly is not 
there to be swept. Not out of the affections of the 
rest of us, for the door of our hearts and minds is 
not open to the self-appointed literary sweep who 
comes on that errand. Whether the " We Mod- 
erns" school has any real message to the present 
age remains to be seen, but if so, let it rest assured 
that the present age has aesthetic and intellectual 
capacity entirely sufficient to absorb that message 
without any necessity of emptying out the treas- 
ures of the past. The sensible course for the artist 
who feels himself an innovator is to offer his goods 
at their face value and take his chances, but if it 
has to be one or the other, he will consult his own 
interests by coming with an apology rather than 
a broom. 

The very idea of " sweeping away " any of 
the old time classics is puerile. They became 
" classics " by going down with their art into the 
deeper regions of the human soul and attaching 
themselves to that in man which is not of the 
moment but of the ages. Men and women who 
occasionally go down into similar depths will meet 
them there, now one and now another, and hold 
delightful and profitable converse with them. Out 
of that depth they will never be swept, for into 
that depth the militant with the broom on his 

shoulder will never enter.

THE COLLEGES AND AMERICAN 

MEDIOCRITY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A great deal is being written at present upon 
the nurturing of mediocrity in college, and it has 
been suggested that much better results might be 
attained if the conscientious college professor did 
not centre his attention so exclusively upon knock- 
ing into shape the vast majority of the not 
especially endowed, but would direct his energies 
more particularly upon those who show unusual 
talent or genius, that is, if we are to get any- 
where that is really worth while in the world of 
letters and thought. 

That America as a whole is deplorably mediocre, 
not to say degenerate, in matters of taste in litera- 
ture, music, and art, goes without saying. It is, 
indeed, an age of " successful mediocrity." But 
just how the devoting of especial attention to tal- 
ent and genius in college is going to right the 
matter, the present writer fails to see. 



62 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 20 



In the first place, those who are peculiarly 
endowed do not require, as a rule, the special 
guidance of a professor, who is as likely as not 
to be as mediocre in his tastes as any of the mass 
of individuals outside of college. I remember, not 
long ago, to have heard of a professor who told 
his students that "Milton wasn't in it with the 
' Faithful Shepherdess ' " ; and of another who held 
that " Robert Browning never said anything 1 that 
Lord Tennyson had not said and said better." 
The bad taste in this latter statement is in not 
being able to appreciate each of these poets for 
his own especial gift of personality, instead of 
slighting one because he is not exactly like the 
other. Bad taste of this sort, implying narrow- 
ness of judgment, is just as prevalent among col- 
lege professors as it is among those outside of 
college, if not more so. Furthermore, such snap 
judgments help to make the mass outside mediocre, 
while no student of genuine talent or genius would 
be in the least affected by them. 

But admitting these instances to be exceptional, 
and that perfect judgment in matters of taste 
exists among the majority of college professors, 
the problematical genius could at best only be 
saved some wearisome journeys in barren regions 
of literature or art by the wise warnings of these 
Elders in the halls of learning. It is difficult to 
see how any amount of special training could 
increase the genuine creative faculty or the innate 
good taste of genius, for these are the things with 
which genius is born, and they grow by their own 
impetus. Did any college professor instruct Keats 
that it was the proper thing to admire Greek 
mythology? On the contrary, the learned critics 
of the day facetiously spoke of his having -versi- 
fied Lempriere's Dictionary. It is hard to say 
where in this worthy dictionary Keats could have 
found the masterly interpretation of Greek myth 
which he has put into " Hyperion." 

What talent or genius really needs is apprecia- 
tion and support after it has left the protecting 
arms of the Alma Mater. 

Where will it find such appreciation and sup- 
port now? The publishers are not at all inter- 
ested in whether a writer is a genius or not. They 
want something that will sell; and having a 
mediocre public to deal with, and being also medi- 
ocre themselves, every trained mediocrity that 
comes out of college stands a better chance of 
being heard than the one genius. Music publish- 
ers will even refuse to look at compositions which 
they are told show unusual originality. 

Again, if the newspaper or magazine editor 
wants a critic, he asks the candidate, not if he is 
capable of forming luminous and broad-minded 
judgments upon the books he is to review, but~if 
he is a trained college man. Therefore, criticism 
in this country is for the most part a farce, for 
the trained young college man, who is only that 
and nothing more, has neither had sufficient expe- 
rience of life nor done enough individual reading 
to form sound judgments. He starts in with a 
handful of courses in literature, in each of which 
he has read selected masterpieces, perhaps having 
specialized in one man for a degree, and with a 



few rules about style; then tries to size up every- 
body according to the standards he has been 
taught. The only criticism worth anything is that 
which can perceive the power and beauty of the 
forward-looking which transcends past standards, 
and this requires a genius for criticism or appre- 
ciation. 

Woe to the genius who falls into the clutches of 
this young critic! If the genius happens to be so 
lucky ad to find a publisher with the strength of 
mind to publish anything which is not exactly like 
everything else published by everybody else, 
that is, which is not in the prevailing style, he 
will find himself doomed by the trained young 
critic, who will probably confess with pride and 
exaltation that he finds this new writer " obscure." 
Nothing seals the fate of a genius so effectually as 
to have mediocrity say it cannot understand him. 

Suppose, by any possible chance the publisher 
or the editor gets hold of a genius in critical work, 
and this benighted genius flatters himself that 
after a few years of experience he will be able to 
command a better price for his labors. He will 
eventually learn his mistake, for he will find him- 
self dismissed in favor of the cheap young trained 
college man. So the college training plays into the 
hands of the mercenary publisher. The training 
counts for everything, genius and experience for 
nothing. 

Perhaps it is a temperamental weakness in us 
Americans that we seem to take the utmost pride 
in writing ourselves down stupid. Noble and 
beautiful music we call " heavy " ; psychological 
drama, in which gripping problems are powerfully 
portrayed, we call " high-browed." We must have 
something simply amusing. Philosophy, or poetry 
enriched by philosophical truth, is quite too pro- 
found for our mean little brains to grasp. And 
we are proud of it, and anyone who says he likes 
these things is either a bogie or a poseur. 

It sometimes looks as if stories written in slang 
phraseology, moving pictures, and Victrola per- 
formances would run out all other forms of litera- 
ture, drama, and music. We must have things to 
read in which we need not be seriously interested. 
We must have " shows " that do not appeal to our 
sense of the artistic, but to our delight in perfectly 
obvious mechanical contrivances. We must have 
twice-baked music in bits because we get fidgety 
if we are obliged to sit through a whole concert or 
opera. 

The real problem, then, with which the college 
professor has to deal is how to educate mediocrity 
so that, instead of being so desperately in love with 
itself, it will aspire to an appreciation of some- 
thing better than itself, or, at least, different 
from itself. 

The genius, if he is to thrive, must have his 
appreciators ; but the question is, how in an age 
where a premium is put upon training as against 
innate intellectual superiority can he find them? 
for it is a condition of things in which he is more 
likely to be scorned as a freak than appreciated. 

It is not for me to suggest to college professors 
how this problem is to be met. I suspect it is 
more of a social or moral problem than a purely 
intellectual one. 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



63 



It is certainly mixed up with the ideal of democ- 
racy, which revolts against the idea of innate 
superiority, and welcomes the paramountcy of 
training, because it posits equal capabilities in 
everyone. Once arriving at this point, it is an 
easy step for mediocrity to regard itself as the 
superior of genius. Can it be that we like to read 
stories in which we cannot be seriously interested 
because we like to feel superior to the writer ; that 
we like " movies " because enthusiasm for the 
actors and the author are put on an impersonal 
plane, and we as persons can thus feel superior? 
The same with the Victrola, our superiority is 
safely isolated by the mechanical contrivances. 

And how much we feel like super-men and 
super-women, when we candidly admit we do not 
enjoy " heavy " (that is grand and noble) music, 
or " high brow " plays ! In fact, I think Nietzsche 
somewhere expresses approval of such an attitude 
of mind. Perhaps it will dawn upon a democratic 
world some day that there is no greater joy possi- 
ble than that of the appreciation and enthusiasm 
for great and beautiful and nobly powerful things. 
The two highest functions of the human mind are 
the one which is capable of creating beauty and 
the one which is capable of appreciating beauty. 
Every human being has the power innate within 
him to create beauty in some form, not neces- 
sarily art. It may be moral beauty, a beauty of 
service, mechanical beauty, etc. In this sense there 
is no mediocrity. 

Every human being has also latent within him 
the power to appreciate beauty. Developed to its 
highest capacity this power is almost a more won- 
derful gift than genius itself, or rather, it be- 
comes a genius for sympathy and enthusiasm for 
all that is great in art, noble in thought, ideal in 
morals, marvellous in science. Its kingdom is 
wider than that of genius. There comes with it a 
joy which is perhaps quite equal to the ecstasy of 
the creator in art. 

So-called mediocrity, then, when it leaves col- 
lege should be able to look forward to a time when 
it can say, like Cleon, 

" I have not chanted verse like Homer, no 
Xor swept string like Terpander, no nor carved 
And painted men like Phidias and his friend: 
I am not great as they are point by point. 
But I have entered into sympathy 
With these four, running these into one soul, 
Who, separate, ignored each other's art. 
Say, is it nothing that I know them all! " 

To which might be replied : " Yea, verily, so 
well hast thou done that thou shalt sit with Homer 
and Terpander and Phidias on the slopes of 
Parnassus." 

On the other hand, the genius must be modest. 
His superiority is only in one direction. He cre- 
ates, it is true, a beauty of the imagination; but 
there are others who create a beauty of the mind, 
or a beauty of the spirit. And above all, there are 
those, his greatest need, who dwell in the land of 
sympathy and appreciation. 

But this is unnecessary advice to the true genius 
in any department of effort, for it is only success- 
fully trained mediocrity, as at present constituted, 
which is unbearablv conceited. 



If the college professor is able to convince his 
students that what the world, and America in par- 
ticular, needs is a fine frenzy of enthusiasm, that 
such appreciation is as much to be honored as 
genius itself; and also if he can convince them of 
the silliness of congratulating themselves upon 
their own weak brain power often the result of 
sheer laziness or lack of aspiration, he will be 
paving the way for the transformation of medioc- 
rity into a genius for the highest appreciation in 
relation to the creators of distinguished beauty. 

Ages of development have gone to the evolution 
of the human brain. It is true that intuition and 
emotion have probably remained almost pristinely 
embryonic during this process, and it is time to 
pay attention to these other faculties of the human 
spirit. 

Perhaps by dancing we may be bringing our 
emotions to a point where they may begin a 
healthy development. Perhaps psychology will 
open out the' way whereby our intuitions may 
grow; but we must not let our last gain make our 
first gain futile, for we are creatures of mind as 
well as of heart and soul. ZELIA.

THE WORD "UXTEXTED" IN "KING LEAR." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the generally accepted interpretation of a pas- 
sage in "King Lear" (I, 4,307, Rolfe's edition), 
there is a striking instance of what Professor Lid- 
dell has well called "botching Shakspere." Lear, 
in cursing Goneril, says : " Th' untented wound- 
ings of a father's curse Pierce every sense about 
thee ! " The word " untented," as here used, has 
never been satisfactorily explained by either com- 
mentator or lexicographer. Schmidt and almost all 
editors of this play say that a " tent " is " a probe 
for searching a wound " and that "untented " means 
" not to be probed by a tent ; incurable." Some 
editors go a little further and say a tent is " a roll 
of lint, or other material, used in searching a 
wound." Dyce says that "untented woundings" 
are " wounds not yet treated or so severe and 
deep that they will not admit of being treated by 
the insertion of the surgeon's tent," and that " to 
tent " means " to search with a tent, to probe." 
Phin adds "unsearchable" to the other definitions 
of " untented " ; and Hudson's gloss is : " too deep 
to be probed." 

The dictionaries are no nearer the truth than the 
commentators. Worcester defines the word as " not 
tented, not having a tent applied " ; Ogilvie's Impe- 
rial Dictionary as " not having a medical tent 
applied ; hence, not having the pain lessened " ; 
Johnson's as " having no medicaments applied " ; 
the Encyclopedic Dictionary adds " not dressed " to 
the other definitions; and so on. The medical 
knowledge of Skeat's Etymological Dictionary is no 
better, for there we find : " Tent, a roll of lint used 
to dilate a wound. See Nares. Properly a probe ; 
the verb to tent is used for to probe." 

The eighteenth century editors also found the 
passage difficult of explanation. Pope changed 
" untented " to " untender," thus following one of 
the Quartos. Theobald, quoted by Furness, said it 



64 



THE DIAL 



[ Jan. 20 



meant " a wounding of such a sharp, inveterate 
nature that nothing shall be able to tent it, i. e. 
search the bottom, and help in the cure of it." 
Steevens, also quoted by Furness, missing the sig- 
nificance of Theobald's explanation, says that " un- 
tented woundings may possibly signify such wounds 
as will not admit of having a tent put into them." 

W. J. Craig, in his excellent edition of the play, 
after a careful consideration of the passage in 
question, accepts Nares's explanation : " Unap- 
peased, not put into a way of cure as a wound is, 
when a surgeon has put a tent into it." The most 
surprising explanation of all, as coming from a 
physician, is that of Dr. Bucknill, who says: 
" Untented appears to mean, ' not to be tented,' 
wounds the bottom of which is not to be reached." 
All these interpreters have forgotten that the term 
" tent " was applied not only to a probe, for the 
purpose of searching a wound, but also to a piece 
of some medicated material, lint or sponge, intro- 
duced into an abscess cavity for the purpose of 
stimulating healing; to stimulating ointments 
used in the healing of wounds ; and to a cylindrical 
roll of some absorbent material, usually of lint, in- 
troduced into wounds and retained there for the 
purpose of absorbing the acrid and purulent dis- 
charges of the abscess or fistula. In other words, a 
tent is what is now commonly called a drain, and 
" untented " in accordance with a common Eliza- 
bethan usage means " undrainable, not capable 
of being emptied of its purulent contents, not ceas- 
ing to discharge pus." Stated medically, Lear is 
cursing Goneril with chronic purulent ulcers affect- 
ing all her organs of feeling. This is certainly far 
more vivid than wounds that are too small or too 
deep or too sharp to admit of the introduction of a 
probe or tent or medicament. Besides, such wounds 
do not exist. Even a superficial examination of 
any medical work of the sixteenth or seventeenth 
centuries will suffice to confirm our definition. The 
curious reader may consult Clowes's " Treatise on 
Gunshot Wounds," 1596, (passim, referred to by 
Craig), any translation of the works of Hippo- 
crates, or the book entitled " Natura Exenterata ; 
or Nature Unbowelled," London, 1655. We cannot, 
in concluding, refrain from quoting a very inter- 
esting passage, illustrating the use of the word 
" tent," in " The Muse's Looking Glass," a play by 
Randolph (1638) : " The land wants such As dare 
with vigour execute her laws; Her fester'd mem- 
bers must be lanc'd and tented."

SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMATIC DIRECTNESS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I am one who did notice the point of fact your 
correspondent in a recent number of THE DIAL 
brings forward as one usually ignored by editors, 
concerning the minor incident in Plutarch used by 
Shakespeare with his transfiguring touch in 
" Coriolanus," I, ix, 94ff. 

To make Coriolanus forget the name while 
remembering the deed of a benefactor, at a time 
when most men would be full only of themselves, 



is one of those multitudinous trifles of invention 
that speak eloquently of the characterizing and 
humanizing genius of Shakespeare. 

In my brief notes on the " cunning " of " Shake- 
speare's little changes " and his " human touch, 
quite beyond Plutarch" in this passage ("First 
Folio Edition" of "Coriolanus," pp. 174-5, 178-9), 
I also brought to bear upon these changes another 
little fact not noticed by your correspondent, the 
fact that the poet keeps back until now the faint- 
ness mentioned by Plutarch, earlier, before the 
close of the battle : " Then they prayed Martius 
that he would retire to the campe, because they 
sawe he was able to doe no more, he was alreadie 
so wearied with the great woundes he had upon 
him." 

Shakespeare dramatizes here at one clear and 
rapid stroke the historical, physical, and psycho- 
logical facts upon which he builds the climax of 
this scene and the stage mechanics of its exeunt. 
The Roman general, instantly granting the boon 
just asked for the benefactor, gives the order 
" deliver him, Titus." To carry out the order, 
Titus asks "Martius, his name?" This question 
brings out the reply : " By Jupiter, forgot : I am 
wearie, yea, my Memorie is tyr'd: Have we no 
wine here ? " His general's comment is clear and 
direct. It reinforces this explanation by Corio- 
lanus that he forgot because his very capacity to 
remember within his wounded head was faint for 
loss of blood. Cominius notices that the blood has 
ceased to flow, is drying, a token of its exhaustion 
implying the need of care and nourishment. So he 
says, " The bloud upon your Visage dryes, 'tis 
time It should be lookt too: come." And thus 
they go off stage. 

The trouble with a more involved and round- 
about explanation of the dramatic fitness of this 
climax and this exeunt is that it falsifies them. It 
is against the dramatic sincerity of the scene and 
the characters and the direct and sufficient explana- 
tion elaborately to suppose that Coriolanus forgot, 
as your correspondent puts it, because he scorned 
to remember a name that " would have suggested " 
his benefactor's " plebeian origin." 

If this were designed by Shakespeare he had 
the skill to make it plain. Why did he take pains 
rather to reinforce the explanation offered? Why 
should a dramatist who is sure of touch and master 
of his purpose go about to make it dark and 
double? 

Remember, too, that he prepared earlier for a 
special loss of blood in the head. This dauntless 
hero took his wounds headlong, confronting the 
foe. His face was scarcely recognizable in I, vi. 
It appears as if it were flayed. It needs to be 
verified as his by the sound of his voice. In the 
present scene, he says that when he has washed 
and his " face is f aire " those about him may be 
enabled to perceive whether he blushes at their 
praise or no. 

The assertion remains to be proved, moreover, 
that merely because the benefactor is poor he is 
therefore a plebeian. 

What sequitur is there in that for an audience? 
What sequitur is there in that for a patrician soul

like that of Coriolanus, who is so un-American, 
shall we say? at least so not at all up to date as 
in this very scene to despise a mercenary measure- 
ment of his own worth ? 

The idealistic scorn of the material coming out 
in the hero's characteristic refusal to " take a 
Bribe to pay my Sword " shines rather in an inten- 
tionally enhancing light because the Volscian bene- 
factor whom he remembers is poor of purse and 
noble of nature. There was nothing to be got by 
the request he makes for him. Shakespeare selects 
from Plutarch for special mention here only those 
facts about him that suit and serve the scene. The 
other details, that he had been rich (therefore was 
not a plebeian we could with more reason suppose 
if it were worth while to go into that irrelevancy) 
and was now a slave of war all these details 
were simply needless or inconspicuously implied in 
the statement of Coriolanus that he once lay at his 
house, " He us'd me kindly, He cry'd to me : 
I saw him Prisoner; But then Aufidius was 
within my view, And wrath o'rewhelm'd my pittie : 
I request you to give my poore Host freedome." 

In this scene, evidently, sympathy with the 
nobleness of the hero is all Shakespeare wants 
from his audience. Later, when he sits in gold 
and when his friendliness with Volscians against 
his country is to his discredit, there is there as 
here no taint of mere money return suffered to 

blacken him.

A BACONIAN TO THE DEFENCE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The authorship of the Shakespeare plays is 
undoubtedly the greatest of literary problems, and 
it cannot be belittled by an article such as the 
review in your columns by Mr. Samuel A. Tannen- 
baum, of Mr. James P. Baxter's solid work on the 
question. 

The reviewer seems to have made a special study 
of the facts connected with Shakespeare's applica- 
tion for a coat of arms, and he is enabled to 
correct Mr. Baxter on one or two minor points 
regarding the application. His triumphant manner 
of doing this might lead anyone to suppose that he 
believed he had thereby established his hero's claim 
to the authorship of the plays. Another point on 
which Mr. Tannenbaum lays special stress is the 
praise of the Shakespeare works by various con- 
temporary writers. In using this argument he 
quite ignores the fact that none of these writers, 
with possibly one exception, identifies the author 
with the Stratford actor, and this possible excep- 
tion is by no means a clear exception. The phrase 
" our English Terence " suggests a pseudonym, if 
the Terence plays were the work of Caius Laelius. 
Mr. Tannenbaum's reasoning would be paralleled 
by stringing together a number of passages in 
praise of George Eliot's novels, and proceeding to 
argue that the author of the novels must have 
been a man of that name. 

Dr. Charles William Wallace, who some few 
years ago discovered in the Record Office in Lon- 



don the document containing Shakespeare's An- 
swer to : Interrogatories in a petty lawsuit in 
which he was a witness, unwittingly proved con- 
clusively that the actor was unable to write, be- 
cause his name is written by a law clerk in law 
script, and the deponent made his mark beneath 
the signature. 

Mr. Tannenbaum is greatly displeased with 
Mr. Baxter for distinguishing between the actor's 
name, Shakspere, and the author's pseudonym, 
Shakespeare or Shake-speare ; but Mr. Tannen- 
baum's displeasure does not alter the fact that the 
difference does exist, and it exists quite as clearly 
as the difference between Tannenbaum and Rosen- 
baum. 

The article contains the usual sneering sugges- 
tion that all Baconians are insane, though it is 
doubtful whether Mr. Tannenbaum would have 
dared to say this of von Bismarck if he had been 
in Germany during the heyday of the Chancellor's

A FESTAL WORD ABOUT DIPHTHONGS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Always, when the follower of Schopenhauer's 
"Art of Controversy " finds himself with no hole 
to hide in, his procedure is that of the cuttle- 
fish the beclouding of clear water with much 
ink. So far has Dr. Vizetelly carried the process 
that it is needful to restate the issues he has so 
confused. These are: 

" Our present letters do not show the diphthon- 
gal characters of ch, sh, ng, th and zh." (" Essen- 
tials of English Speech," by Frank H. Vizetelly, 
page 290.) I take it this means that the sounds 
indicated by the italicized letters were diphthongal 
in Dr. Vizetelly's best understanding of the subject 
at the time the book was written. 

" Every one of the great dictionaries has decided 
that the sound of these letters [those italicized 
above] is diphthongal." (Ibid, page 291.) This 
seems to state in plain language that all the great 
dictionaries actually set forth that the sound of 
these letters is diphthongal. 

These are the points at issue, these and these 
alone. In contradiction of Dr. Vizetelly's state- 
ments I arrayed against him every dictionary. 
Not daring and he dares much to deny their 
authority, he preserves a brilliant silence on both 
the points at issue, which must be taken as a tacit 
confession that he is wrong. This settles the con- 
troversy. It only remains for him to correct his 
book, quite useful in several other respects, in the 
light of the understanding that, I am sure, once 
imparted, will slowly dawn upon him surely, 
but slowly. 

His letter to THE DIAL of Dec. 9, 1915, Dr. 
Vizetelly opened by observing of his book that his 
"remarks . . were written to bring out the fact 
that . . the diphthongal characters of the digraphs 
ch, ng, sh, th, and zh, would be better indicated by 
ligatured symbols than by plain letters." Having 
arrayed against this restatement of the diphthongal 
characters of all these digraphs, except ch, every 



66 



[Jan. 20 



phonetic authority, quoting volume and page, it 
pleases me to find him citing not one authority 
against that array in his letter of Jan. 6, 1916, 
not one. As he has cited pretty nearly everything 
else he could think of which does not bear directly 
upon this point, I take it that he is on his dilatory 
way to conviction that he is wrong. And he is 
grotesquely wrong. For he has chosen the use of 
digraphs to represent elementary sounds as an 
excellence of the alphabet he is apologizing for, 
when it is a weakness. It may well pray to be 
defended from such a friend. This, too, will 
eventually come to him. 

A paragraph, "(4)," in his latest letter requires 
attention as bearing upon the main question and 
not upon matter wholly extraneous. In it Dr. 
Vizetelly says : " nowhere in my book do I indi- 
vidually say ' most phoneticists analyze this sound 
[that of ch] as a combination of t and sh,' as Mr. 
Rice asserts. It is true that the words appear 
upon page 291 of the book, but there they are 
quoted from the edition of ' Webster's Interna- 
tional Dictionary.' " The italics are the good 
Doctor's; as usual when he italicizes, it is to shout 
something that he ought not to whisper. Here the 
book follows the quotation from Webster with a 
sentence of his own, " This being the case, let us 
be guided by the expert phonetist." " This being 
the case," it might seem to those with under- 
standing, can mean only that Dr. Vizetelly does 
individually say what his letter with equal explicit- 
ness denies he has said individually, while the 
words " expert phonetist " mean nothing more or 
less than that the authority quoted is, in his indi- 
vidual opinion, an authority which has his indi- 
vidual endorsement. Possibly, however, judging 
by other positions he has taken, his categorical 
statement that the case is " this " signifies that he 
individually believes it different. What his per- 
sonal views on the subject of ch chance to be at 
this moment, provided he has any, is a matter for 
smiling conjecture. 

Only less confusing are Dr. Vizetelly's partial 
quotations from three dictionaries, ignoring five 
others, regarding the meaning of the single word 
diphthong. No one doubts that the words conso- 
nantal diphthong mean " a blending of two conso- 
nants in one syllable." That is not the point in 
issue; the noun without its modifying adjective 
means only " a blending of two vowels in one 
syllable." The use of the noun and adjective in 
the definition from the " New English Dictionary," 
quoted in parenthesis, emphasizes the point; so 
do the two instances of use brought forward to 
support it. This is no less true of the citations 
from the other two dictionaries. If Dr. Vizetelly 
had quoted the instances of use or had allowed 
their weight to enter his understanding, he might 
have admitted the correctness of my position. He 
might, I say; there is nothing in his controversial 
method to make me think he would. 

As for the rest, it is without the issues. Where 
I have been corrected in errors 'of fact when the 
haste of an instant reply compelled my reliance 
upon impressions rather than demonstrable facts, 
I am thankful, as I have been for correction 



throughout life; these errors, however minor, I 
shall not have to repeat or ignore by way of prov- 
ing my possession of understanding.

VAEIANTS IN A CHRISTMAS FOLK-SONG. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In the January 6 number of THE DIAL one of 
your correspondents, Mr. Crawford, quotes " The 
Twelve Days of Christmas " at length. He says 
the version was given him orally and that he has 
never seen it in print. By a curious coincidence 
these verses were published as a children's game by 
Mr. George E. Johnson in the December (1915) 
number of " Something to Do," an excellent new 
juvenile magazine. 

Mr. Johnson gives a slightly varying version 
which it is interesting to compare with Mr. Craw- 
ford's. His final stanza is : 
" The twelfth day of Christmas, my true love sent to 

me, 
Twelve lords a-leaping, eleven ladies dancing, ten 

pipers piping, 
Nine drummers drumming, eight maids a-milking, 

seven swans a-swimming, 
Six geese a-laying, five gold rings, four colly birds, 

three French hens, 
Two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree." 

Mr. Johnson's " twelve lords a-leaping " are not 
so absurd with " eleven ladies dancing, ten pipers 
piping, and nine drummers drumming." Indeed, 
it seems quite natural behavior under the circum- 
stances ! 

It is amusing to note how the oral transmission 
has changed the " four colly birds " of the one 
verse into the " four colored balls " of Mr. Craw- 
ford's, and even the " six geese a-laying " into 
" six chests of linen."

A WORD FROM THE PUBLISHER, 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have been interested in reading the review, in 
your issue of Dec. 9, ef Mr. Lewis's book, " Sport, 
Travel, and Adventure." If anyone is to blame for 
not including stories and adventures of every trav- 
eller, it is the Publisher! Mr. Lewis, a member of 
my staff, had the opportunity of quoting from over 
one hundred and fifty volumes published by this 
house, and therefore all the books from which he 
has quoted bear my imprint. If you will refer to 
the Bibliography, you will note that the Editor has 
quoted from fifty-four books. In several instances 
the books are by American authors for whom I 
have published in England.

THE VERSE OF THK BROXTE SISTERS.* 

There was a time in Victorian days when 
readers slaked their thirst for an innocent 
melodrama with the novels of Charlotte 
Bronte, when her hysterical rhetoric, the 
plaintive heroines, and their black-browed 
suitors (of mysterious past) moved readers to 
strange and deep emotions. Those days are 
gone, and with them the peculiar thrill. The 
demoniac laughter of " Jane Eyre " and the 
nun-like spectre of "Villette" stir us no 
longer, or, at most, move us to irreverent 
though indulgent mirth. And yet, despite 
the changes of literary fashion, there has been 
no decline in the Bronte' stock. The age which 
allows George Eliot to moulder on forgotten 
shelf has preserved the fame of Charlotte and 
practically created the fame of Emily Bronte. 
Volume after volume about them issues from 
the press. Their works are published in 
sumptuous " library editions " ; their lives are 
written by Mr. Shorter, M. Dimnet. and Miss 
Sinclair ; there is a " Bronte Society," with its 
own series of publications: the microscopic 
romances, in the fabrication of which the sis- 
ters passed away a lonely hour of girlhood, 
fetch magnificent sums in auction-rooms; the 
moors of Yorkshire have become " the Bronte 
country"; and now Mr. Benson, gathering up 
all their verse, puts forth a volume entitled 
" The Bronte Poems." 

The Brontes, in a word, have become a fad. 
They have entered a sphere with Chatterton, 
Blake, and Byron, where interest in an au- 
thor's literary work merges into a larger but 
perhaps less legitimate interest in his whole 
story, his life and environment, and mere 
literature is viewed in the light of the whole. 
The explanation is simple enough. The 
Bronte story challenges the imagination. It 
is as though the spirit of Byron had mingled 
with that of Miss Alcott, and then projected 
itself against the bleak background of the 
northern moorland. There is a bitter realism 
in the story at times, suggestive of Balzac or 
even of Zola, but the whole is softened by the 
spirit of girlhood and is solemnized by the 
atmosphere of a brooding fate. To much of 
this Emily Bronte' gave enduring expression 
in ""Wuthering Heights" crudely, to be 
sure, but with amazing power. Charlotte 
Bronte, forgetting her pedagogic primness, 
expresses it at moments, but never fully. For

Emily, Anne, and Branwell Bronte. Edited, with Introduction,

nam's Sons. 



the complete revelation of it, you must know 
the Bronte story. 

Now it is for its connection with this story 
that most readers will open Mr. A. C. Benson's 
reissue of the poems. They are by no means 
new to the world. The sisters as every one 
knows put forth their first volume of verse 
in 1846 ; the verse has been reissued in various 
forms, and additions to it have appeared at 
various times. Mr. Benson, who has had 
access to the Bronte papers, can add but little 
that is new: six poems by Charlotte, two by 
Emily, and five by Anne. This is hardly an 
event in literary history, for the poems now 
first published contain nothing particularly 
significant, and a perusal of the entire volume 
will but remind the average reader that the 
Brontes have become very old-fashioned. The 
poems, with one or two notable exceptions, 
derive their interest not so much from their 
intrinsic merits as from the significance lent 
them by the circumstances out of which they 
spring. 

The Brontes were all, by common inheri- 
tance, versifiers; none of them was a poet, 
though Emily and, at times, Anne produced 
poems. The lack which is felt throughout the 
work of them all is that of discipline. There 
is surely some subtle hereditary relation be- 
tween the vice of BranwelTs life and the vice 
of Charlotte's style. In the poems, as in the 
novels, emotion is everywhere astir, but it 
is crude, frequently callow, self-conscious, 
wholly uncontrolled, and always plunging 
into language, wreaking itself upon expres- 
sion, set down hurriedly in all its rawness, 
never, by any chance, recollected in tranquil- 
lity. With the Brontes, to experience an emo- 
tion is to express it. They consume no smoke, 
and therefore a collection of their verse must 
always remain a somewhat murky record of 
their riot of emotionalism. After reading 
them for a while one longs for the profes- 
sional touch again, and turns to Landor or to 
Mr. Bridges, to Hellenism and discipline and 
an experienced artist's control of technique. 
The atmosphere may be colder, but it is 
clearer. The nocturnes and etudes of the 
Brontes are passionate and moving, but the 
performer is for ever striking a false note. 
Emily, for example, can write about the stars 
in a really beautiful and affecting way: 

" I turned me to the pillow then 

To call back night, and see 
Your worlds of solemn light again 
Throb with my heart and me." 

She could write that, and then she could add : 

" The curtains swayed, the wakened flies 
Were murmuring round my room,

Imprisoned there till I should rise, 
And give them leave to roam." 

The same slovenliness of technique, the same 
passion spoiled by rawness, appear in the 
poems of Charlotte. Her lyric, " He Saw My 
Heart's Woe," now printed for the first time, 
might come straight from the most lurid pages 
of " Jane Eyre " : 

" Idolater I kneeled to an idol cut in rock, 

I might have slashed my flesh and drawn my 

heart's best blood, 
The Granite God had felt no tenderness, no 

shock, 

My Baal had not seen nor heard nor under- 
stood." 

There are the diction and the emotions with 
which the pen of Jane once acquainted us; 
you may find it in your heart to wish the pas- 
sage tempered down, but you cannot deny its 
passion and then, suddenly, all sinks into 
prose and bathos : 

" Now Heaven heal the wound which I still deeply 

feel; 
Thy glorious hosts look not in scorn on our 

poor race ; 

Thy King eternal doth not iron judgment deal 
On suffering worms who seek forgiveness, 
comfort, grace." 

Of all the Bronte group the one who came 
nearest to self-restraint was Anne. She, the 
gentlest of them all, craves direction and con- 
trol, finds it in her Christian faith, and sub- 
mits herself to the higher power. Her verse 
is prevailingly religious, her moods less 
stormy than Emily's, her notes few and sim- 
ple, reminiscent of eighteenth century hym- 
nals and, in particular, of the poetry of 
William Cowper. Her verses to the memory 
of that poet are something more than a young 
girl's sweet tribute to a favorite; they are 
instinct with the very spirit which she ad- 
mires in her master, and it is pleasant to feel 
that among all the verses written in his honor 
none would have gratified the recluse of Olney 
more than these. It is the spirit of Cowper, 
moreover, that moves in what is almost cer- 
tainly the best poem she ever wrote, the 
" Prayer," which ends, 

" I cannot say my faith is strong, 

I dare not hope my love is great ; 
But strength and love to thee belong ; 
Oh, do not leave me desolate. 

" I know I owe my all to thee ; 

Oh, take the heart I cannot give! 
Do thou my strength my Saviour be, 
And make me to thy glory live ! " 

If the name of Anne Bronte is to live in 
verse, it must, as she foresaw, be in some such 
simple way as this. 



For verses such as Anne Bronte's our free- 
thinking times will have but little use; they 
will prefer those of Emily, for there is more 
resistance in her and therefore more passion. 
The abiding gloom of her poetry will seem 
natural enough to those who know her life- 
history; but it is always to be remembered 
that the despair which broods over poems 
springs not so much from the fear of physical 
suffering, which was hers in large measure, as 
from a certain horror at the misery of the 
general human lot. In her powerful lyric, 
" How Clear She Shines," she says : 

" The world is going ; dark world, adieu ! 
Grim world, conceal thee till the day ; 
The heart thou canst not all subdue 
Must still resist, if thou delay ! 

" While gazing on the stars that glow 

Above me in that stormless sea, 
I long to hope that all the woe 
Creation knows is held in thee ! " 

This is the essential mood in her verse, this 
rather than the more pagan tone of the fol- 
lowing poem (given in its entirety) : 
" One pause upon the brink of life, 
Before it breaks in headlong strife, 

Upon its downward road; 
One insight through the waters clear, 
Before their pictures disappear 
In the fierce foaming flood." 

But there was one experience which shat- 
tered Emily's life-long sadness, and lifted her 
to a plane of solemn joy, and that experience 
was death. In her last lines, "No Coward 
Soul Is Mine," she transcended herself, and 
lifted her dying voice in a paean of faith 
from which the note of desperation has been 
banished by the calmness of eternity; and, 
though the verses have been hackneyed in 
every anthology and in every essay on her 
work, they must be quoted once again as a 
measure of all that was best in her and as 
gathering into one piercing ray all the broken 
lights of her earlier verse. The last two 
stanzas of this poem are these : 
" Though earth and man were gone, 
And suns and universes ceased to be, 

And Thou wert left alone, 

Every existence would exist in Thee. 

" There is not room for Death, 

Nor atom that his might could render void : 
Thou Thou art being and breath, 

And what Thou art may never be destroyed." 

That is an utterance destined to survive. In 
the opinion of the present writer it is even 
destined to survive that popular creed of the 
present hour in which it is asserted, with 
more force than conviction, that man is the 
master of his fate and the captain of his soul.

Thus the poetry of the Brontes is prevail- 
ingly meditative. Their function is contem- 
plation, not creation. To them the poet is not 
a maker of images, a teller of tales, a dreamer 
of dreams, or even the idle singer of an 
empty day. Their concern is ever with the 
commonplaces of the human heart, its fears, 
its faith, its sorrows and its plaintive hopes. 
None of the Brontes ever escapes from the 
prison-house of self, and the constant recur- 
rence of such words as " dungeon " and 
" thrall " is significant of a profound defect 
in their poetry, self -absorption. This lack is 
the more remarkable in three poets who were 
also novelists. You will search their volume 
in vain for any evidence of that shaping 
power of the imagination which conceived the 
fabric of " Wuthering Heights " or for any of 
that dramatic vision which created Paulina 
or Adele. And because of this lack of imagi- 
nation for such in a very profound sense it 
is the poetry of the Brontes will always be 
the possession of a very few, and will remain 
a body of verse interesting chiefly as a lyric 
commentary on a group of lives, which, in 
their sadness, their isolation, and their sense 
of powers half-realized, mingle the gentle 
with the heroic and bring, at times, the actual 
very near to the high levels of tragedy.

RECONCILING GOVERNMENT WITH 
LIBERTY.* 



Many histories of human government have 
been written, and several histories of human 
liberty. It has remained for an American 
scholar to attempt a history of the age-long 
efforts of men to reconcile government with 
liberty. It may be doubted whether any j 
American is more adequately equipped for 
the performance of such a task than is Pro- j 
fessor Burgess. To a full knowledge of com- 
parative government, accumulated through a 
long life of study and teaching, he adds a 
notably independent spirit and an exception- 
ally keen judgment. Whether or not the in- 
terpretation of men and events which he gives 
appeals to one as valid or final, one may rest 
assured that it is based upon carefully ascer- 
tained facts and conscientiously framed con- 
clusions. 

The sweep of Professor Burgess's book is 
almost as broad as the recorded history of the 
race. The volume opens with a survey of the 
effort of Asia and of Africa to "solve the 
problem," advances to a comprehensive ap-

Scribner's Sons. 



praisal of the efforts of sundry European 
peoples in the same direction, and concludes 
with a sketch of the experiments of the kind 
which have been, and are being, made in 
North and South America. So far as geo- 
graphical range is concerned, the one striking 
omission appears to be the English self- 
governing colonies. It would seem that in 
any account of the evolution of liberty under 
law the constitutional systems of Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa 
should be accorded a not inconspicuous place. 
No one of these names, however, even appears 
in the index of the present volume, although 
practically every Latin American country is 
there mentioned. 

It was to be expected that the history of the 
relations of government and liberty in Asia 
and Africa would be recorded quickly. The 
two chapters devoted to the subject comprise 
less than one-eleventh of the book, and are 
taken up chiefly with summaries of recent 
political movements in Japan, China, Persia, 
and Turkey. It is the author's opinion that 
in the two continents mentioned the best 
efforts to harmonize government and liberty 
are those which have been made in the Moham- 
medan states, and that "had the subjects of 
these states been wholly Mohammedans by 
their own choice and conviction it is not im- 
possible that these states might have gone 
much farther in this great work than they 
have." The hope is expressed that the Turks 
may yet attain the desired reconciliation. 

In describing the efforts of Europe to har- 
monize government and liberty, the author 
naturally follows the order of chronology, 
beginning with the Greeks and the Romans 
and moving on to the establishment of the 
constitutional systems at present operative in 
the various states. Of the Greeks he is 
obliged to say that, on account of their con- 
founding the state with government and 
their recognition of no sphere of individual 
immunity against governmental power, they 
did not even perceive with any degree of 
clearness that there was a problem of the 
kind here being considered. "With regard to 
the Romans, it is pointed out that very early, 
in the drawing up of the Twelve Tables, there 
was the most complete solution of the prob- 
lem of reconciliation which the world to that 
time had produced, but that in the subsequent 
history of the Republic, and especially of the 
Empire, the good beginning that had been 
made was not followed up. It is maintained 
that, contrary to a widely prevalent impres-

[Jan. 20 



problem, and that in the Germanic states of 
the earlier Middle Ages there was scarcely 
more approach to it, save in Anglo-Saxon 
Britain, and there only in the earliest days. 
A detailed review of the history of the 
Middle Ages fails to disclose the condition 
sought; and a chapter on the growth of the 
national monarchies in the fifteenth, six- 
teenth, and seventeenth centuries demon- 
strates that in this great era liberty, even 
more completely than formerly, was sacri- 
ficed to government. In a somewhat prolonged, 
survey of "the Revolutions" beginning 
with the English Civil War in the seven- 
teenth century and closing with the inaugu- 
ration of constitutionalism in Russia a decade 
ago it is maintained that, while in this 
period fairly adequate safeguards of the indi- 
vidual were established as against the execu- 
tive, none of consequence were created as 
against the legislature. And the author 
pauses to expound the idea that a legislature 
may be just as despotic and as oppressive as 
a monarch can ever be. A legislature, he 
says, can be depended on to protect the indi- 
vidual 

"only where the suffrage is limited to men of 
intelligence, character, and means, and eligibility 
to a seat in the legislative body is conditioned 
upon the same qualities. Where universal suf- 
frage is the source of legislative mandate the 
legislative authority is a far more consummate 
despot than any king or prince has ever shown 
himself to be. Against such a legislature the indi- 
vidual is in the most helpless condition possible. 
It has rarely any sense of justice and is almost 
never influenced by considerations of mercy. It 
readily becomes the instrument through which 
brute force tyrannizes over intelligence and thrift, 
and seeks to bring society to an artificial dead 
level. Until a political system shall have provided 
the means for protecting the individual in his con- 
stitutional immunities against this most ruthless 
organ of government, it will not have solved our 
great problem. It will, even, in its transfer of the 
balance of governmental power from the executive 
to the legislature, have placed a more formidable 
obstacle in the way of its solution." 

In the constitutions at present operative in 
Europe, Professor Burgess finds little ap- 
proach to a solution of the problem in hand. 
Upon all sides he seeks evidence of the ex- 
istence of a sovereign power, " organized back 
of both Government and Liberty, indepen- 
dent of both, supreme over both, the origina- 
tor of both and the determiner of their 
relations to each other." Without some such 
primal and perpetual authority, we are told, 
there can be, at best, only a truce in the con- 
flict between Government and Liberty. The 
results are not flattering. Every European 



constitution save the Swiss, it is asserted. 
" confounds the sovereign body with the Gov- 
ernment or some part thereof in such a way 
as to leave no sphere for Liberty into which 
the Government may not, in some manner and 
degree, intrude." Furthermore, the indis- 
criminate extension of the suffrage in the 
various countries has been adding steadily to 
the tyrannical character of the legislative 
bodies; and the universal exaltation of the 
popular branch of the legislature, by intro- 
ducing in effect the unicameral principle, is 
accentuating the tendency. 

" In a single sentence, the unicameral Legisla- 
ture with the existing electorate moves along 
towards the socialistic state and the socialistic 
state does not recognize any sphere of Individual 
Immunity defined and guaranteed by the Constitu- 
tion against the powers of Government. I cannot, 
therefore, consider the present constitutions of the 
European states as offering any satisfactory solu- 
tion of the great problem of the reconciliation of 
Government with Liberty. Liberty is sacrificed to 
Government in them all." 

In his closing chapters the author turns to 
"the effort of America." So far as the 
United States is concerned, it is shown that, 
until recently, at any rate, the country ex- 
hibited a fuller measure of reconciliation of 
government and liberty than does any other 
State in the world. The completest harmo- 
nizing of the two great interests would have 
required some readjustments, but no radical 
or revolutionary changes. But, unfortunately, 
upwards of twenty years ago there set in a 
change, and since that time the trend has 
been rather steadily in the wrong direction. 
This shift came in consequence of the adop- 
tion of an imperial policy abroad (incident to 
the Spanish War) and of a paternal pro- 
gramme at home. Evidences of it which the 
author cites include both of the recently 
adopted amendments of the Constitution : the 
Sixteenth, which liberates Congress from all 
limitations in dealing with the property of 
the individual, and the Seventeenth, which 
removes the safeguards arising from the 'con- 
servative structure of the Senate. " It is 
high time," Professor Burgess declares, " for 
us to call a halt in our present course of 
increasing the sphere of Government and de- 
creasing that of Liberty." In Latin America 
the situation is found to be distinctly favora- 
ble. Six states Argentina, Brazil, Colom- 
bia, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela have 
made the declaration of individual immuni- 
ties against governmental power a most im- 
portant part of their constitutional law, and 
have vested in judicial tribunals power to 
protect the realm of individual immunity

against encroachment by any branch of gov- 
ernment. In the reconciliation of government 
with liberty these six states have gone well 
beyond Europe. If their political civilization 
is backward, it is because of the character of 
their populations, not because of the theory 
of their public law. Argentina, it is declared, 
contains all of the factors necessary for a sat- 
isfactory solution of the problem of recon- 
ciliation.

THE 



CLASSICS.* 



If Mr. Albert Mordell had come ten years 
earlier with his book on " Dante and Other 
Waning Classics," we might have praised him 
for having the courage of his conviction; we 
might have wondered at his audacity in try- 
ing to displace a mountain range with the 
push of his single shoulder. But opinion has 
moved rapidly of late. It is now pretty 
well understood that every new Novelist or 
Dramatist of the Dismal is superior to Shake- 
speare ; and that all the Illuminati of Irregular 
Verse are better poets than Milton. The real 
heroes of criticism are those who cover the 
retreat of the disgraced classics. 

Why cannot the modernists live and let 
live? Do they think that by eating their 
grandfathers they will acquire all their virtue 
and reputation? It was not always so. Lit- 
erature presents the spectacle of a long pro- 
cession of great writers holding by each 
others' robes, and, incidentally, with their 
hands in each others' pockets. Virgil pays 
Homer the flattery of continuous imitation. 
To Dante, Virgil is the highest type of human 
reason. Milton bows to " blind Thamyris 
and blind Ma?onides." Even the leaders of a 
rival school, the earlier rationalists and real- 
ists, were true to their forbears. Voltaire 
held by the Greek tragedians. Pope and Dr. 
Johnson edited Shakespeare and praised him 
nobly. The great writers of the last centn ry, 
Goethe, Hugo, Scott, Tennyson, prostrated 
themselves before their predecessors. Thacke- 
ray wanted to black Shakespeare's boots. In 
general, every one who has become an idol has 
been an idolater. 

It is mainly the ideas of the writers whom 
Mr. Mordell attacks, their views of life, the 
cosmogonies and religious ideals which they 
embody, which he thinks effete, foolish, unfit 
for contemporary consumption. We do not 
believe that any great thought or speculation 
which has entered the world can die. It may 
be driven aside, and compelled to lead a sub-

terranean existence for a time ; but it almost 
certainly comes back or up. There must al- 
ways be changes of opinion, revolutions. But 
the business of a revolution is to revolve, and 
it generally finds itself back in the same 
place. Take the ideal of feudalism, which 
Mr. Mordell thinks particularly obsolete. Two 
years ago it did seem to be comfortably bur- 
ied. But it has pushed aside " the ponder- 
ous and marble jaws wherein we saw it quietly 
inurned," and has made a great struggle for 
existence. We all hope that it will be driven 
back into the tomb ; but of its present vitality 
there cannot be a doubt. It is the same with 
religious ideas, Catholic or Protestant. The 
booming of the cannon seems to have deepened 
the notes of the church bells all over Europe. 
And occultism, supernaturalism ! If a flood 
of books on such subjects is any indication, 
these dreams or illusions of man are coming 
back with a rush. It is quite possible that 
some of us may live to see witches burned 
again on Boston Common. 

Even, however, if ideas can be permanently 
pushed aside, execution, the projection of 
great figures, the painting of wonderful 
scenes, the mighty or mysterious use of lan- 
guage, must retain their hold on the human 
mind. If we have no other use for the great 
writers of the past, we must go to them to 
learn how to write. With the possible excep- 
tion of aKempis, all those on Mr. MordelTs 
catalogue of incorrigibles were great execu- 
tants. He allows Dante two great episodes 
and a few minor passages, and dismisses the 
rest of his poem as useless lumber. Well, 
Alfred de Musset said the same thing, and 
Landor and Leigh Hunt turned from the 
Florentine in sheer disgust. Such antipathies 
must always occur. But by the great and 
continually increasing voice of criticism. 
Dante is hailed as the man who has said more 
profound things, painted more vivid pictures, 
than any one else has ever done in an equal 
space. To object to the horror, the painful- 
ness, of many of these pictures seems illogical 
in a writer who thinks so well of the work of 
Zola and Dostoieffsky. These later tragedians 
placed their infernos on the earth, whereas 
Dante concentrated his in a region of their 
own. Their effect on our feelings, we should 
think, would be the same in either case. Mil- 
ton is another poet who condenses human 
experience and vision. There is probably 
more picture and music to the page in him 
than in any one since. Mr. Mordell objects 
to the figures of Sin and Death. To us they 
seem almost unparalleled in imaginative vigor. 
Even in the long later stretches of " Paradise 
Lost." which because of a lack of interesting 



72

[Jan. 20 



matter are tiresome, there is always the high 
level of diction, the movement of a great tide 
of verse. Mr. Mordell does not find any mes- 
sage of importance in Pascal's " Thoughts.' 
They do not pretend to be a system, they 
are only scattered sparks, many of which, 
however, have kept alight to the present day. 
The great Pascal is the Pascal of the ' ' Provin- 
cial Letters," who ought to appeal to Mr. 
Mordell because he was a liberalizer, a revo- 
lutionist, a miniature Luther. Indeed, he 
dealt a deadlier blow to Jesuitism than 
Luther did to Catholicism. Is Bunyan negli- 
gible ? Is the man who stamped a number of 
images or visions, the Slough of Despond, 
the Giant Pape in his Cave, Vanity Fair, the 
Delectable Mountains, so firmly on the mind 
of his race that literature and art have been 
incessantly repeating them ever since, is 
such a writer a nobody? We do not believe 
it. And St. Augustine ! The Catholic Church 
is largely founded upon him, and the Catholic 
Church is surely a present verity. Besides, 
the very germ of all modern philosophy, 
Descartes's "I think, therefore I am," is in 
St. Augustine. This alone would make him 
important. 

Mr. Mordell has the real reading which 
makes a full mind; he has a trenchant style 
and a lawyer-like expertness in putting his 
case. It is unpleasant to have to differ so 
totally from him. But what would he have? 
If, like Prospero, we must bury the Book of 
the Magic of the Past, and accept the mod- 
ernists at their own valuation, what guaran- 
tee have we that to-morrow there will not be 
a crop of neo-modernists who will declare the 
others antiquated. If we regard what is tak- 
ing place in art to-day, this is exactly what 
will happen. Novelists will be as soon out of 
date as newspapers, and poets will hardly 
outlast the full moon that inspires them. Per- 
manence of fame, what we are accustomed to 
call literary immortality, will be a jest. We 
presume the modernists are out for perma- 
nent fame. Criticism ought to, and mainly 
does, concern itself with contemporary pro- 
duction; but it ought also to hold fast by 
what it knows to be abiding.

BELGIUM'S AGOXY.* 

Neutrals are constantly finding ground for 
optimism in the fact that all the belligerent 
nations in the present war are exceedingly 
anxious to justify themselves before the su- 
preme court of public opinion. Frankly, any- 
one condemned to read much of the polemic 
that has been raging since the war began has 
need of keeping this consolation before his 
eyes. To the neutral American mind the ver- 
dict in the case of the violation of Belgium 
has never hung in the balance. We accepted 
the first statement of the German chancellor, 
and have seen no reason to change our deci- 
sion. Yet both sides continue to thunder 
diatribe and recrimination. Both sides quote 
Goethe's words : " Truth must constantly be 
re-stated, for falsehood never ceases to whis- 
per in our ears." As applied to much of the 
"literature" (with apologies to that noble 
word) on the subject, this citation seems al- 
most blasphemous. It is probably impossible 
at this time for any of the belligerents, at 
least, to utter that truth of which Goethe 
spoke. A rapid survey of a few of the recent 
discussions of the Belgian case must suffice 
here. 

Not long after the outbreak of the war the 
Belgian government appointed a commission 
to investigate the alleged violation of the 
rights of non-combatants. The reports of this 
commission, sifted from the testimony of eye- 
witnesses under cross-examination, are heart- 
rending; evidence can be found in them to 
substantiate all the atrocities with which we 
are only too familiar. Let us hope that they 
are greatly exaggerated; but the proclama- 
tions of the German General Staff are hardly 
reassuring. For instance : " In future the 
localities nearest to the place where similar 
acts [the destruction of a railway line and 
telegraph wires] take place will be punished 
without pity: it matters little if they are 
accomplices or not." Louvain and Belgian 
villages in ashes are a terrible commentary on 
this pitiless punishment.

THE DIAL 



73 



Last December M. Emile Waxweiler wrote 
from Switzerland a book which, published 
simultaneously in French and German, has 
been widely read in Europe. The title of the 
American edition, "Belgium. Neutral and 
Loyal," gives a fair idea of the contents. 
There is nothing really new in the book ; but 
at least the author is to be congratulated for 
having maintained, nearly always, a tone of 
moderation. Even in the concluding chap- 
ter. a discussion of the German methods of 
war. he deliberately refrains from citing the 
testimony of eye-witnesses, which, he realizes, 
may often be exaggerated; he confines him- 
self instead to a discussion of the German 
military manual and its remorseless applica- 
tion to Belgium. 

Herr Richard Grasshoff's " The Tragedy of 
Belgium " is more painful reading. It is an 
abusive answer to M. Waxweiler, and falls by 
its own violence. The book attempts to prove 
that the Belgian government has only its own 
treacherous machinations to thank for the 
national calamity. The government is accused 
of having deliberately encouraged a guerrilla 
warfare which obliged the pacifically disposed 
Germans to stern measures of repression. The 
object of the government is stated as having 
probably been to supply to its official commis- 
sion material for fabrications in regard to out- 
rages committed by German soldiers. The 
reader wonders, on finishing the tirade, what 
connection the contents have with the title. 
There is nothing to indicate that the book is 
a translation: if. as one suspects, it is the 
same authors "Belgien's Schuld" in English 
dress, the new title, apparently meant to 
sweeten the pill for American readers, will 
scarcely tend to increase our confidence in the 
argument. 

Mr. Alexander Fuehr's " The Neutrality of 
Belgium " has at least the merit of being writ- 
ten in judicial tone. The book attempts to 
prove, first, that England has always been the 
power behind the Belgian nationality, that she 
has unscrupulously used the smaller nation 
for her own ends, and that, before the out- 
break of the war, Germany had sufficient evi- 
dence that Belgian neutrality had become a 
dead letter. (For which, see the Brussels 
documents.) Second, that the treaties pro- 
viding for Belgium's neutrality have, by the 
law of nations, been void for many years, and 
have been so considered by England: third, 
that even had any treaty been in force, Ger- 
many would have been justified in invading 
Belgium under the particular circumstances. 
The particular circumstances are, of course, 
the famous German necessity. The author, a 
doctor of law, supports his position by cita- 



tions from English and American jurists. His 
arguments seem scarcely disingenuous to the 
lay reader, who is inclined to hope that the 
jurists concerned would disavow this applica- 
tion of their thought, and observe that the 
devil, under stress of necessity, can quote 
Scripture. 

It is pleasant to turn from these contro- 
versial volumes to one or two books which 
have value as human documents. In her 
"Journal of Impressions in Belgium," Miss 
May Sinclair tells with no little humor the 
experiences of a British Red Cross Corps in 
its infancy. It was given to her to see little 
or nothing of the actual fighting, and she 
relates only what she has seen or felt. Her 
account holds the reader by the lively por- 
trayal of the members of the Corps, and the 
reaction on them of the scenes behind the 
firing lines. When one lays down the book, 
one knows the whole staff as thoroughly as one 
knows any of the characters of Miss Sinclair's 
novels-, and they are people whose acquain- 
tance is even better worth making. 

In "The Log of a Non-Combatant," Mr. 
' Horace Green gives a vivid account of the 
adventures of a newspaper correspondent in 
the midst of the fighting and in Germany. 
He came into intimate relations with Belgian, 
| British, Dutch, and German soldiers, and 
I later with the German people. His anecdotes 
' are keenly interesting in themselves, and illus- 
trate national and personal characteristics 
that stand out even in the stress of war. As 
he was bent on missing nothing, and was not 
always provided with all the necessary cre- 
dentials, time never hung heavy on his hands 
for lack of excitement. In an appendix he 
discusses briefly the " atrocities," and is in- 
clined to believe that the reports of unpro- 
voked personal outrages have been greatly 
exaggerated. 

In reviewing Zweig's study of Yerhaeren 
for THE DIAL some weeks ago, I wrote of the 
poet's last works : " This singer of force, of 
universal energy working with common inter- 
est toward cosmic progress, finds a higher 
ideal still the union of humanity by uni- 
versal love and admiration which joins men 
in their common purpose and musters indi- 
viduals and nations into a common cause 
the striving for the onward march of life. . . 
I We need not wonder if his bitterness knows 
no bounds to-day." The volume entitled 
" Belgium's Agony " is the first expression of 
his feeling to reach America. The English 
version, well executed in spite of occasional 
slips, contains a short notice of M. Ver- 
haeren's earlier work, and three war poems 



74 



[Jan. 20 



not yet translated. The first and best of 
these poems, "La Belgique Sanglante," is 
filled with the spirit of his last ante bellum 
verse, and foreshadows his great disillusion. 
It strikes poignantly the key-note of the book, 
which, with its brief but loving sketches of 
Belgian landscape and homes before they were 
laid waste, throws over the present horror a 
lurid light that no official report could give. 
From the devastation two sentiments arise in 
Belgian hearts : first, pride in their country's 
heroism and the firm faith that she will 
emerge with a strengthened ideal; second, a 
bitter hatred of the ruthless invader. 

The last chapters form a terrible indict- 
ment of that invader. In M. Verhaeren's 
view, Germany has a barrack-bred culture but 
no civilization, for civilization means a sense 
of honor that outbalances egotistical interest, 
a spiritual force which is the negation of 
brute force. Germany's awful and sinister 
mission is to let loose her hordes upon Europe, 
whose ideals have left her far behind. For 
the sake of world-domination she must crush 
the individual life of other nations, and de- 
stroy all art, past and present, that is not 
her own. She would mould genius itself in 
her own image. She believes her organized 
culture to be the last word of modernism, and 
forgets that the religious tyrants of the dark 
ages tried to impose it by not dissimilar meth- 
ods. At bottom the only difference is that the 
one tyranny was religious, the other is civil. 
As Spain of the sixteenth century, imbued 
with the spirit of Africa, sowed in each of her 
soldiers the lessons of cruelty, so Germany 
to-day, imbued with the spirit of prehistoric 
Asia, inculcates terrorism as a potential offen- 
sive weapon. There is no more honor or 
chivalry; but only treachery, cruelty, and 
lies; the enemy's every action is known to 
cloak a crime. Germany's utter indifference 
to ideals is revealed in the attitude of her 
statesmen toward international relations. 
Even when she presented her ultimatum to 
Belgium, she came prepared for huckstering, 
talking of profit and loss as on the stock 
exchange. Finally Germany's effort to spread 
her culture/born of the past, is diametrically 
opposed to "the spirit of to-day, wrought of 
pride and liberty, wrought of human reason 
and human idealism, wrought of an emotion 
infectious and splendidly dangerous, which is 
little more than a hundred years old, and the 
strength and brilliance of which time has not 
yet brought fully to light." Such, in sub- 
stance, is M. Verhaeren's bitter indictment of 
the invaders of his country. 

Lovers of poetry should welcome an intro- 
duction to another Belgian bard; and the 



slender volume of "Belgian Poems" by M. 
Emile Cammaerts will not, we trust, pass un- 
noticed in the hurly-burly of war books. The 
poems are published in French, with transla- 
tions of varying success on the opposite page. 
It is to be hoped that translators of foreign 
poets will more generally adopt this form of 
presentation, which has long been used in 
France for the classics. Most of the English 
versions are due to Madame Cammaerts. The 
collection contains war songs, Christmas 
carols, and poems of love and domestic 
felicity. Perhaps the most striking feature of 
them all is their directness and simplicity. 
The poet feels this quality, and says, as he 
explains the purpose of the book (the proceeds, 
are to purchase tobacco for the Belgian sol- 
diers) : 

" J'ai mis ici des naivetes 
Dont les moqueurs se gausseront. 
Ma lyre tinte d'une corde, mon vers cloche d'urt 

pied 
Et je n'ai guere d'inspiration. 

J'ai mis ici mon coeur tout nu 

Que m'importe qu' on raille! 
Pourvu qu' Us fument une pipe de plus 

Sous la mitraille." 

The spirit of the war poems is that robust 
joy in the consciousness of moral strength 
that rings through M. Verhaeren's work. 
Here is a stanza from a stirring marching 
song, " Le Drapeau Beige " : 

" Rouge pour la pourpre heroi'que 

Noir, jaune et rouge 
Noir pour le voile des veuves 

Noir, jaune et rouge 

Et jaune pour 1'orgueil epique 
Et le triomphe apres 1'epreuve." 
One of the most striking of the patriotic 

pieces is the following, entitled " Les Renforts. 

delaMort": 

" II est une armee mysterieuse 

Qui ne saurait perir, 
, Et dont les ombres silencieuses 
Hantent notre souvenir. 

C'est 1'armee de ceux qui sont morts 
En maudissant les Allemands, 
Et dont les irivincibles renforts 
Vengeront le sang innocent." 
Those who would turn aside from the horror 
and hatred of war will prefer the last two- 
thirds of the volume. For them let us cite in 
closing this stanza from " L'Enf ant " : 

" 0, mystere, mystere de ton ame d'enf ant ! 
Combien j'ai honte de si mal deviner, 
Combien je rougis d'etre grand 
Aupres de mon bebe ! "

BECEXT ROMANTIC PLAYS.* 

Perhaps the most conspicuous trait of re- 
cent drama, viewed as a whole, is the ten- 
dency toward wide experimentation. In this 
respect our time resembles the latter part of 
the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Then, as now, 
there was a keen and rapidly growing popular 
interest in the theatre, which drew writers of 
all sorts, including some whose natural gift 
was far from dramatic, into playwriting. 
Novelists like Lyly and Greene, lyric poets 
like Peele, satirists like Nash, moralists and 
classical scholars like Jonson and Chapman, 
were all driven into dramaturgy. Then, as 
now, determined attempts were being made 
to use the drama for educational and moral 
purposes. Many of the experiments were 
abortive, but all were more or less instructive 
as to what can and what cannot be done in 
a play. Nothing could furnish better evi- 
dence than this wide experimentation that the 
drama to-day is intensely alive. Our poets, 
novelists, reformers, and social philosophers 
would not be trying to reach or move the 
world through an art which was in a mori- 
bund or decadent state. It seems reasonable 
to hope that the present rather chaotic condi- 
tion of the drama may issue in some great 
and permanent achievement. The strongest 
current is undoubtedly in the direction of 
realism; but there are eddies and cross- 
currents worth taking into account. What- 
ever the triumph of realism, it will always be 
one of the functions of the theatre to take us 
away from the commonplace world into some 
land of enchantment. It is perhaps rather 
significant that Mr. John Masefield and Mr. 
Edward Sheldon, both of whom started out as 
realists, have turned in their latest plays to 
romance. 

Mr. Sheldon, indeed, has gone or tried to 
go all the way to fairy-land. " The Garden 
of Paradise " is a much amplified dramatic 
version of Hans Christian Andersen's story 
of " The Little Mermaid." Its prose is grace- 
ful, but a little too everydayish; the story 
cries out for the diction and harmony of 
verse or else for a prose which, like Ander-

sen's, has simplicite, and not, like Mr. Shel- 
don's, simplesse. Mr. Sheldon's simplicity, as 
well as his plot, is over-elaborated. The charm 
of such a story is a delicate and evanescent 
thing, 

" Frail as are the wings that grace 
Thistledown or butterfly." 

Even great literary talent, combined with the 
best will in the world, cannot catch it and 
magnify it and embody it for us on the stage. 
Only a master of what Addison called "the 
fairy way of writing" could hope to touch it 
without losing something of its secret. Of 
living dramatists, Hauptmann alone, perhaps, 
could succeed in the task. It is no mean 
praise of Mr. Sheldon to say that he has not 
entirely failed, that though he has loaded 
his story with details, he has contrived to keep 
a little of its wistful charm. But he is not at 
his best in this kind of writing ; he is inclined 
to make his mermen and mermaids talk, as 
Addison says, " like people of his own species, 
and not like other beings, who . . think and 
talk in a different manner from that of 
mankind." 

Mr. William Lindsey's "Red Wine of 
Roussillon " takes us back to the twelfth 
century in Provence, the time of trouba- 
dour and crusader. Raimon, Count of Rous- 
sillon, has for two years been absent in the 
Holy Land, and is reported to have fallen in 
battle. He was sent thither to do penance 
for a deed of violence; in love with Sere- 
monda, he had slain her bridegroom at the 
altar, and forcibly married her. In his 
absence she has fallen in love with his young 
friend Guilhem, a nobleman and a trouba- 
dour; but Guilhem declares his love only 
after they have received apparently certain 
news of Raimon's death. At the very moment 
of his declaration, Raimon has arrived in the 
village, and is on his way to the castle. Sere- 
monda begs Guilhem to flee with her, but 
because of his friendship with Raimon he 
refuses ; and to save the situation, it is agreed 
that Guilhem shall pretend to be in love with 
her sister Guida. But the jealousy of Sere- 
monda, who perceives that Guida really loves 
Guilhem, is aroused; and when the trouba- 
dours are entertaining the household after 
dinner, by a preconcerted signal she com- 
mands Guilhem to declare in his song his love 
for her. The catastrophe is only postponed 
by the intervention of the priest Aimar; it 
finally involves the death of the lovers and of 
the madly jealous count. Except for a little 
slowness in the exposition, Mr. Lindsey has 
handled his plot well, making the most of its 
strong dramatic moments. The crisis scene,

THE DIAL 



[ Jan. 20 



in which Seremonda, by the sign of suddenly 
breaking her fan, forces her lover to a public 
declaration, would be impressive on the stage ; 
and others, such as the return of the count, 
and his appearance at the castle after slaying 
Guilhem, are almost equally strong. The 
play is written in blank verse, which though 
it falls short of greatness is vigorous, flexible, 
and free from affectation of archaism, a 
far better medium than prose for a story of 
this kind. The characters, even the minor 
ones, are distinct and individual. Yet in 
spite of these great merits, the play somehow 
leaves one a little cool. The reason, I think, 
is that the interest is not sharply focussed; 
the emphasis is divided too evenly among the 
principal characters, with the result that 
though we sympathize with them all, we do 
not sympathize intimately or passionately 
with any of them. The most attractive figure 
is that of Guilhem, but he is presented to us 
less fully than either of the others. 

Verse far more sensitive, and exquisitely 
adapted to its purpose, is that of Miss Con- 
stance D'Arcy Mackay in " The Beau of Bath, 
and Other One-Act Plays." This little vol- 
ume contains six short dramatic sketches, 
written in rhymed couplets of exceptional fin- 
ish and charm. They present incidents, real 
or fancied, in the lives of famous eighteenth 
century people. Beau Nash, old and broken, 
is playing solitaire beside the grate on Christ- 
mas Eve; he falls asleep, and in his dream 
the Lady of the Portrait comes down and 
talks with him of their old unspoken love. 
Fanny Burney is caught by her uncle revis- 
ing the manuscript of " Evelina," after he 
has been telling her of the success of the 
book, and has promised that she may read 
it if he thinks it proper for her. Avis Linley, 
years ago disappointed in love through the 
interference of her brother, helps her niece 
to elope with Richard Brinsley Sheridan. All 
of these situations are lightly and charm- 
ingly sketched, with a keen sense of dramatic 
values ; but the best of the pieces are the last 
two, " Counsel Retained " and " The Prince 
of Court Painters." In the former Peg 
Woffington takes refuge from her admirers in 
an open casement, and finds herself in the 
shabby chambers of Edmund Burke, then poor 
and unknown. In the second, George Rom- 
ney, broken, ill, and forsaken by his court 
friends, asks for charity at a cottage door in 
the country, where lives the deserted wife of 
his youth, still proud of his fame and faithful 
to his memory. Neither at first knows the 
other; and their gradual recognition is pre- 
sented with extraordinary delicacy and dra- 
matic skill. The plays are intended primarily 



for amateurs, but they would furnish oppor- 
tunity for the most finished professional 
acting. 

The convenient and inexpensive series of 
"The World's Best Plays," edited by Dr. 
Barrett H. Clark, includes translations by the 
editor of two French plays which trifle agree- 
ably with romantic motives, Rostand's " The 
Romancers" and Octave Feuillet's "The 
Fairy." The former is so well known in 
America as to need no comment here. The 
latter is a graceful one-act piece the scene of 
which is a cottage on the boarder of the 
enchanted forest of Broceliande. The fairy, 
one rather regrets to say, turns out to be an 
ingenious young lady who wins her lover by 
means of very natural magic. 

Mr. Percy MacKaye's lyric drama, " The 
Immigrants," is the libretto of an opera, the 
music for which has been written by Mr. Fred- 
eric S. Converse. The theme is strikingly 
expressed in the speech of Noel, an American 
artist, as the immigrant ship enters New 
York harbor: 

" America, dear motherland of men, 
Age after age lodestar of immigrants, 
Hark to these peoples crying in the mist ! 
Here where you loose your cities on the sea, 
Leviathans of lightning spire on spire, 
Palace and hanging garden of the waves, 
Whose spacious splendors house the lords of 

life- 

Here, under all, cramped in their vitals, swarm 
The seekers after life the slaves of toil, 
With hearts of yearning. remember these 
And feed the awful hunger of their hearts ! " 

A group of Italian peasants, gay and poor, 
are beguiled by a commercial agent, who uses 
a moving-picture show as bait, to leave their 
homes and seek better things in America. 
They are helped by the young artist, and ex- 
ploited by the agent, a beast who attempts 
to seduce the girls. They find sweatshop 
labor, wretched food and quarters, and at last 
imprisonment and death. Mr. MacKaye is 
necessarily handicapped somewhat in treating 
the theme by the requirements of the operatic 
form. Scammon, for instance, the agent, loses 
reality when he begins to sing in lilting meas- 
ures, a strange siren ! But though the piece 
does not represent the author at his best, it 
contains eloquent verse and a number of 
attractive lyrics. 

The recent death of Stephen Phillips lends 
a melancholy interest to what is probably his 
last play. On the whole, in treating of war, 
the realists have the better of it. "Armaged- 
don " is a strange and sad fulfilment of the 
fears expressed in "A Poet's Prayer" (pub- 
lished in "New Poems," 1907) :

" Desert me not, when from my flagging sails 
Thy breathing dies away, and virtue fails, 

And I, from splendour thrown, and dashed from 

dream, 
Into the flare pursue the former gleam. 

Else shall thy dreadful gift still people Hell, 
And men not measure from what height I fell." 

No criticism of "Armageddon " could be more 
exact or more severe than this prophecy. 
Even to the letter it has been realized. Mr. 
Phillips still had vigorous rhetoric at his com- 
mand; he was visited still by intermittent 
gleams of poetry. But in this play he has 
"peopled Hell" (the scene of the prologue 
and epilogue) with demons who speak not in 
the large accents of his Prometheus, but in 
the rant of Tamburlaine. 

" Arise now, Massacre ! Thou favorite daughter, 
Got in adultery 'neath a moody moon, 
Awaken to the smell of infant blood ! " 

"Into the flare" with a vengeance! The 
scenes which represent Germany at war are 
sorry caricatures. The best part of the play 
is the scene in which the French; Belgian, 
and British generals express their national 
points of view ; and even here the inspiration 
flags, and drama is sacrificed to rhetoric. 

Against a background of early eighteenth 
century Japan, Mr. Masefield's " The Faith- 
ful " tells a story of cruel wrong and revenge. 
Asano, a noble and enlightened Daimyo who 
has devoted himself to his people, has strug- 
gled long against the aggressions of his 
enemy Kira, an upstart lord who has grown 
rich and powerful at the expense of his neigh- 
bors. By coldly calculated treachery, Kira 
provokes him to an act of violence which 
brings upon him the condemnation of the 
Emperor's envoy, and death. Asano's friend 
Kurano is prevented by a device of his wife's 
from being present at the fatal meeting. On 
hearing of it, he devotes himself, his son. and 
a handful of Asano's followers to the sacred 
duty of revenge. He puts away his wife, who 
might hinder him in his purpose, and to 
blind suspicion he feigns madness. The 
wives and children of his followers slay them- 
selves to leave their lords unhampered in the 
great design. All Asano's friends are driven 
into outlawry. At last the moment arrives. 
Kira is once more visited by the Emperor's 
envoy; and confident in the sanctity which 
the Presence gives to his palace, sends away 
his guards. Kurano and his followers sur- 
prise him as he is dallying with a woman, and 
magnificently courteous, request him to kill 
himself with the dagger of Asano. Kira's 



courage fails him, and he dies on the sword of 
Kurano. Then, over the grave of Asano, the 
faithful receive and execute the Emperor's 
sentence upon themselves. In its motives of 
revenge, pretended madness, and the rejection 
of love through consecration to a terrible 
duty, the play obviously recalls " Hamlet." 
But Kurano is troubled by no doubt or hesi- 
tation; he waits only till the moment of 
opportunity, then swift as meditation or the 
thoughts of love he sweeps to his revenge. In 
style and feeling, the play is closer to classic 
tragedy than to romance. No death takes 
place on the stage. There are only two scenes, 
between which the action alternates : the open 
country near Asano's castle, and a room in 
the palace of Kira. The atmosphere through- 
out is one of gloom, unrelieved except by the 
triumphant fulfilment of vengeance. The 
play is written in grave and quiet prose, aus- 
terely simple; yet through it there swells a 
mighty and restrained rhythm, as of a distant 
and muffled drum-beat, breaking at the end 
into the trumpet-call of the Herald who 
brings to Kurano and his warriors the mes- 
sage of death. Only a great poet could create 
a prose like this, sonorous in its very plain- 
ness, charged with profound feeling, and 
accurately right in its reticences and its over- 
tones. The fragments of grave and medita- 
tive song which are scattered through the play 
are woven into the very texture of the style. 
They are not external ornaments: they fre- 
quently express the deepest emotions of the 
singer. Thus Chikara, son of Kurano, after 
he and his father have resolved that the hour 
of vengeance has come, sings : 

" Sometimes, when guests have gone, the host 

remembers 

Sweet courteous things unsaid. 
We two have talked our hearts out to the embers, 
And now go hand in hand down to the dead." 

The theme of the play is best expressed in 
Kurano's "death-poem," which is a single 
sentence : " Evil is very strong, but men who 
will give their lives are stronger." Revenge 
to Kurano is not merely a personal matter; 
it is the redressing of a great wrong. It is 
the Dark Tower of Childe Roland's quest ; to 
which the way leads through a desolate and 
cruel region ; for which, though it is ugly in 
itself, all human bonds must be lightly sun- 
dered, and life itself is a trivial price, to be 
paid exultantly. Dark as is the tragedy of 
the story, therefore, its total effect is not de- 
pressing, but. like that of all great tragedy, 
uplifting. Mr. Masefield has written admira- 
ble poems, but none finer than this dramatic 

poem in prose.

FICTION.* 



Ever since the immense popularity of 
"Waverley," the historical novel has had a 
sort of prescriptive right to be. Scott showed 
clearly how delightful it was to read, and the 
novelists soon found out how delightful it 
was to write. I believe it was Gibbon who 
pointed out that any honest gentleman who 
wanted to write a book could write a history, 
for there was the subject matter all ready to 
hand. In like manner, anyone who wanted to 
write a novel had at once some sort of interest 
ready-made in the charm and color of some 
bygone time. It is true that ideas conven- 
tionalized a good deal, especially in the mat- 
ter of medievalism ; knights, ladies, squires, 
pages, outlaws, friars got to be stock charac- 
ters which became wearisome, while the imita- 
tion of medieval language became an imbecile 
jargon which even Stevenson called "tush- 
ery." Into this placid convention Mr. Mau- 
rice Hewlett tossed "Richard Yea-and-Nay," 
which surprised and delighted people with the 
idea that life in the Middle Ages was as real 
as at any other period. 

Miss Johnston's " Fortunes of Garin " is a 
novel of the later type. It is not lacking in 
romance, but it has reality as well. Reality, 
in this case, is not a question of historic accu- 
racy, though general accuracy is good, prob- 
ably necessary; it is a question of vitality. 
One must conceive of the thing in terms of 
life, which doubtless demands knowledge. So 
Miss Johnston realizes her setting and her 
characters, the great cathedral, the feudal 
castle; the squire and the jongleur, and all 
the rest of the stately pageant or panorama 
which passes before us. They must be real 
places and people, and not vague conventional 
forms and figures coming from an imagination 
stimulated by readings and dreamings. Miss 
Johnston has been most successful ; from the 
very beginning one feels that here is a ro- 
mance that might be of our own day, except 
for the strange and curious garment of the 
body and the soul of the men and women 
therein. Yet it is not absolute realism. Such 
a book probably must be always somewhat 
decorative, conventionalized though not con- 
ventional. We can hardly know that life so 
well as to permit the utterly true truth. It 
must always be rather like a fine tapestry than 
like an absolute picture. 

Such a book is a real achievement. This 
one is the story of the poor squire and the

great lady; of the troubadour, Garin of the 
Golden Isle, and the Princess of the Fair 
Goal ; also of a man and a woman living in 
far away Provence during the Crusades, when 
life was far more broken up and mixed than 
we think who view it through the simplifying 
media of history and recollection of history. 
It is a well-written book; like "The Witch," 
it has less of the semi-lyric note than some of 
Miss Johnston's books, and therefore (we 
would say) more of a definite matured char- 
acter. It is a fine book, and not to be vaguely 
undiscriminating we add that it is not one of 
the few finest. It may be that Miss Johnston 
lacks the intensity of imagination necessary 
to fuse everything in one great impression. 
She often appears to us a little too medita- 
tive, contemplative, for a great novelist, 
more like an essayist on the one hand, or a 
lyric poet on the other. 

If Miss Johnston's book is a fair try at the 
best that an historical novel can be, Mr. Far- 
nol's " Beltane the Smith " is a very different 
matter. It may be that the author would not 
wish to have his book thought of as an histori- 
cal novel, and it is certainly true that it is 
nothing of the kind. But just as surely as 
" The Fortunes of Garin " derives from the 
sound and fine idea in " Ivanhoe " and "Quen- 
tin Durward," so does "Beltane the Smith" 
derive from what in itself was (and still is) 
good in the hand of a master and an original 
mind, and yet slight and childish in the hand 
of one who handles it merely as one would 
handle the puppets of a marionette show. It 
is no harm (and indeed it is most delightful) 
for a child to be enthralled at the first imagin- 
ings of knights and outlaws, tournaments and 
greenwoods; but it is hardly worthy the time 
of an adult reader to continue through pages 
of imaginings suggested thereby. 

That there is something more in "Beltane 
the Smith " is undeniable, but that something 
is a hindrance rather than a help. It con- 
cerns the serious side of the book, however 
foolish it may seem to anyone to imagine that 
there is one. Nobody need bother to run a 
tilt with a man who really tries to present the 
labors of a young fellow who devotes his life 
to making a bad world good. Such people 
are too rare in life, and it is good to read of 
them. But the trouble with "Beltane the 
Smith " is that it is not genuine; it is a mere 
sham. Beltane is not a young man " versed in 
woodcraft and ancient philosophies"; there 
is not a single line in the book which shows 
any woodcraft or philosophy on his part or 
the part of the author. He is not a young 
man who goes forth in the service of Jesus 
Christ with the (mistaken) notion that the

main thing in His message was " that He 
came ' not to bring peace on this earth but a 
sword.' For good cannot outface evil, but 
strife must needs follow." He is but a blun- 
dering young fellow of the type of hero 
brought into painful prominence twenty-five 
years ago by Mr. Stanley Weyman. He is no 
more genuine than the jargon in which his 
story is told. Nor does the author take his 
own figures seriously ; he knows there is noth- 
ing to them, and makes no attempt to realize 
any of the superficial sentiment that occa- 
sionally occurs to him. or even the various 
situations which he imagines. Helen, Duchess 
of Mortain, goes out at night into the wood to 
seek the young smith whom she had kissed 
that afternoon in a little visit she had made 
to the greenwood for that purpose. A good 
while afterward. Beltane, who has been wan- 
dering about with the same Helen under the 
disguise of a young knight, finds out who she 
is on seeing her as she comes out of a wood- 
land pool and lets down her hair. In neither 
case does Mr. Farnol give us any idea that 
we have more than one of the ordinary events 
of life, in "that period when Love and Valor 
were life's mainspring." 

It might seem that much the same sort of 
thing should be said of Sir Henry Newbolt's 
*' Aladore." But among many differences be- 
tween the two books, there is this one, which 
would be enough were there no others: in 
"Aladore" the author has really in mind as 
the chief thing the spiritual quest of his hero, 
and takes the imaginative form which he does 
take merely as a form: while with Mr. Far- 
nol's book the reverse is the case, he takes 
the form and mentions a spiritual quest as a 
substance which he now and then feels is 
needed to give reality, and the result is. that 
while in " Beltane the Smith " we have much 
conventional bashing and blundering with no 
significance at all. in "Aladore ' ' we have some 
very singular pregnant conceptions in the 
form of imaginative though sometimes whim- 
sical action. Beltane going forth to right the 
wrongs of Pentavalon at the behest of his 
father turned hermit is a figure of no real 
significance. But when Twain goes forth 
from his estate with the child, it gradually 
dawns on us that in his search for something 
more satisfying than wealth and power he is 
really guided by the freshness and sincerity 
of his own youth. 

The thing shows even in language. It is 
not necessary to say that "Aladore " is written 
in any form of the English language that ever 
was actually spoken or written. But even if 
not. Sir Henry's dialect is a dialect of his own 
(like William Morris's), the result of actual 



familiarity with old forms and old literatures. 
"We may not like it: when he says that the 
hermit threw his crumbs out to " dunnocks 
and finches " we may prefer some other 
names for the birds, dyke-snowier, for in- 
stance, or the more familiar hedge sparrow. 
The words or phrases may not be really 
archaic: "cot and lot, barn and balk." says 
the book; we never heard the latter phrase, 
but if not remembered it is a good imagina- 
tion. If the book says " laylock bushes " it is 
a pleasure to remember that current Ameri- 
canisms are often descended from English 
dialects. So all the way from the idea at the 
very core to the language on the very out- 
side, one may test the book and find it ring 
true; one may find something that actually 
arose in the mind of the poet and therefore 
makes the mysterious effect upon our own 
minds. 

So much, though it leaves out all but inner- 
most kernel and outer shell, should be enough 
to send to the book most of those who would be 
likely to enjoy it. Sir Henry Newbolt is best 
known to us as a poet; everyone knows his 
"Admirals All." His poetic romances are not 
so well known, but they are equally well 
grounded in an intuitive perception of some 
of the things that are great in life. We 
ought to mention, also, the drawings of his 
sometime co-worker, the Lady Hylton (with 
apologies for our own affectations of lan- 
guage) , which are very much in the spirit of 
the romance. EDWARD E. HALE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

" How Diplomats Make War" 
of secret (Huebsch) is the title of a book 

diploma**. recently published which many 
of its readers will feel has appeared at the 
moment when it was most required. Amidst 
the high pressure of emotionalism in which 
sane judgments are at a premium, and 
strong opinions on one side or another are 
regarded as. inevitable, it is well to be re- 
minded that quarrels between nations, as 
between individuals, are usually due to 
"faults on both sides." The "British states- 
man " who is the anonymous author of this 
book has collected a mass of evidence drawn 
from the various manifestos of the warring 
countries as well as from the parliamentary 
reports of questions addressed by British 
members to the Prime Minister and foreign 
secretary; all going to show that undue 
secrecy as to the commitments of the govern- 
ment had been preserved during the half- 
dozen years preceding the outbreak of the

war. The indictment is indeed a serious one. 
The whole principle of democracy is involved 
in the question as to whether it should be 
possible for the government of a country to 
commit its people to ententes and alliances 
that may lead to international conflict, with- 
out the full knowledge and consent of the 
representatives of the people. To admit the 
legitimacy of such irresponsible action is to 
throw away the only guarantee we possess 
against the evil of autocracy and to abandon 
the entrenchments of popular liberty that 
have been laboriously erected during the last 
hundred years. The chief service which this 
book renders to those who wish to see all 
round the problem of the original causes of 
the war, lies in its suggestion that there is a 
case for Germany as well as for Britain and 
her Allies. The author supplies statistics 
with a liberal hand, going to prove that the 
estimates for army and naval enlargement 
and construction on the part of the Allies 
during the past few years have been consid- 
erably in excess of Germany's, and that Mr. 
Churchill's proposal for " a naval holiday " as 
between Germany and Britain, while France 
and Russia were increasing their armaments, 
was one that Germany must necessarily have 
declined. If it is true that, without the knowl- 
edge of the people's elected representatives 
and in spite of questions repeatedly asked and 
answered in the negative, the Cabinet com- 
mitted themselves to certain courses of action 
that could only be interpreted by Germany 
as a policy of isolation and unfriendliness, 
then the British people should know of it, 
and decide once for all whether their parlia- 
mentary institutions are for the future to be 
made secure against the recurrence of such 
violations of the first principles of constitu- 
tional government. Believers in the laws of 
causation cannot regard the hatred in which 
Britain is held by Germany as without ade- 
quate foundation, and an attitude of diligent 
heart-searching would undoubtedly be the 
most becoming one for the people of the 
United Kingdom. The time has come when 
nations, like individuals, must learn that not 
only is honesty the best policy, but that open- 
ness and sincerity and friendliness produce 
like feelings in other nations, and that day- 
light is the one sanative influence under 
which the germs of suspicion and distrust and 
hatred will never develop. 

The psychology Doubtless the most widespread 
of individual psychological interest is that 
shown in the observation and 
comparison of the widely differing traits of 
individuals. From it have sprung the doctrine 



of temperaments, and the pseudo-sciences of 
phrenology, physiognomy, and palmistry, not 
to mention the older astrological speculations. 
Recently it is manifest once more in the 
numerous attempts, by a "mental diagnosis," 
to predict for the individual the pursuit for 
which his talents best fit him. These attempts 
very largely ignore the plasticity of the mind, 
and the consequent adaptability of the indi- 
vidual to a varying environment. They as- 
sume at the outset that the mind is a rather 
rigid mechanism, and that the individual must 
fail unless he promptly finds his particular 
niche in the social and business worlds. These 
attempts all masquerade under the title of 
" efficiency," a term which, as someone has 
said, " should no longer be permitted in polite 
society without a chaperon." Of recent books 
on the psychology of individual differences, 
one of the best is Professor Joseph Jastrow's 
"Character and Temperament" (Appleton). 
It will convince the reader that there is not as 
yet any trustworthy short cut from theory to 
practice. General psychology gives a good 
outline map of the main features of the human 
mind. This must be filled in with numerous 
details in order to afford an account of the 
human diversities included in the terms " char- 
acter " and " temperament." Of these Profes- 
sor Jastrow gives a qualitative account. In 
the babe a functional trait is little more than 
the strength and direction of an instinct. This 
remains as its foundation, but it later develops 
into a generic reactive tendency or a factor 
modifying such a tendency. At this higher 
level of development, human traits are de- 
scribed in the text, though brief mention is 
made of the instinctive root of each one, 
except perhaps in the intellectual traits such 
as the sense of detail, aptitude for construc- 
tion, power of abstraction, " gift " in language 
or mathematics, originality, shrewdness, "com- 
mon sense," etc. The conclusion is drawn that 
the differences in traits between men and 
women, and between white, black, or red races, 
are comparatively small and overlap. The 
widest differences are individual ones. Indi- 
vidual white men of similar ancestry and 
environment differ from each other in any one 
ability more, for example, than the average 
difference in that trait between men and 
women. Yet differences small in amount may 
be large in effect. What factors or elements 
of a trait are due to heredity and what to 
environment or training? In answer to this 
question some physical "unit characters" are 
named; but it is thought "hardly plausible 
though not impossible that musical ability, like 
eye color, is a factor absent or present, through 
the absence or presence of a factor in the germ.

With even more complex traits, such as math- 
ematical ability or a keen moral sense, the 
probability grows still less." While deferring 
somewhat to the extreme opinion that there is 
no such thing as general intelligence, Profes- 
sor Jastrow inclines to the view that there is a 
Common aptitude for different types of mental 
work, and a common fund of energy at whose 
expense mental work is done. The tests of the 
laboratory are not, perhaps, so successful as 
those of life in determining individual differ- 
ences, yet the former tests give us hope of 
eventual success. Possibly the greatest dif- 
ference among men is that of energy and its 
emotional counterpart, courage. The differ- 
ing mental traits of the sexes are discussed at 
length, and also the relation of character to 
the environment. The attentive reader will 
find that the book supplements the outline 
of general psychology in many important 
respects. 



A book of 

reminiscent 

gossip. 



So sound a critic as E. C. Sted- 
man pronounced one of Miss 
Kate Sanborn's books " breezy 
and fascinating," and perhaps he was not ex- 
travagant. But one wonders what he would 
have said of her " Memories and Anecdotes " 
(Putnam). Certainly it is breezy; but more 
than that cannot be said for it. It is the 
thinnest of gossip, so thin that even large 
type, and illustrations, and gratuitous quota- 
tion do not succeed in impressing the reader. 
It might serve as a substitute for an idle hour 
of reminiscence with a garrulous and egotis- 
tic old friend; but it hardly deserves to be 
called a book. These are hard words; yet 
softer ones are not easy to find. Referring to 
the criticism offered by a professor at Dart- 
mouth, Miss Sanborn writes : " I needed his 
precautions about spreading myself too thin, 
about being less flamboyantly loquacious, and 
subduing my excessive enthusiasm and emo- 
tional prodigality." Yes, and this popular 
lecturer and writer of books needs his precau- 
tions, at this late day, more than ever. Her 
language is shabby in an age when all writing 
tends to the journalistic ; she tells mere noth- 
insrs with infinite and wearisome " breeziness " 
("gusto" would not serve for her flitting 
mood) : she has not even mastered English 
grammar (witness, for example, the confu- 
sion of "who" and "whom" on pp. 65 and 
145). In her favor is the wide experience 
she has had in her work, in many States of the 
Union. She has seen, not without shrewd- 
ness, one or two of the greater and many of 
the lesser lights of her day. Here is Bryant : 
" What an impressive personality : erect, with 
white hair and long beard: his eyebrows 



looked as if snow had fallen on them." Here 
is Alcott: "Alcott made some most remark- 
able statements, as: 'We each can decide 
when we will ascend.' Then he would look 
around as if to question all, and add : ' Is it 
not so ? Is it not so ? ' I remember another of 
his mystic utterances: 'When the mind is 
izzing, it is thinking things. Is it not so? Is 
it not so ? " Whitman discusses, in his own 
way, and in the presence of Frances E. Wil- 
lard, the subject of temperance : " He declared 
that all this total abstinence was absolute rot 
and of no earthly use, and that he hated the. 
sight of these women who went out of their 
way to be crusading temperance fanatics. 
After this outburst he left the room. Miss 
Willard never alluded to his fiery criticism, 
didn't seem to know she had been hit, but 
chatted on as if nothing unpleasant had oc- 
curred. In half an hour he returned; and 
with a smiling face made a manly apology, 
and asked to be forgiven for his too severe 
remarks." There are too or three other pas- 
sages of equal interest, but all too few. 



Mr. Elliott O'Donnell's "The 
iri,h emigrant, jngh Abroad "( Dutton ) is an 

in many lands. ' 

extended account of what the 
sons of Erin are doing in various parts of the 
world, with an introductory chapter on the 
conditions which forced the Irish to seek 
homes in foreign lands. The author finds his 
countrymen almost everywhere; but the 
greater number of Irish emigrants appear to 
have settled in English-speaking countries, 
America, Great Britain, and the self-governing 
British colonies. In the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries, the many rebellions 
against English rule in Ireland led to a con- 
siderable migration to the Continent, espe- 
cially to France, in the armies of which Irish 
exiles, in thousands, found service; to the 
history of this interesting movement, and to 
the achievements of the Irish in France, the 
author gives several chapters. Mr. O'Donnell's 
work is somewhat encyclopaedic in character, 
and contains a great mass of important infor- 
mation ; but, unfortunately, he has not always 
been careful to verify his statements, and con- 
sequently many errors have found their way 
into the book, particularly into the chapters 
that deal with the Irish in our own country. 
We are told, for instance, that Irish settlers 
came to America " in the seventeenth century, 
when about a thousand, mostly Puritans from 
all parts of Ireland, went to Maryland under 
the leadership of John Winthrop, and, in 
1630, founded Boston, which has been Irish in 
the main ever since." It may be true that 
eighty per cent of the American Revolution- 



82 



[Jan. 20 



ary army in 1782 was composed of Irish- 
Americans, but we should like to see the 
evidence. With the statement that " there are 
few names in history deserving of more 
praise" than that of Andrew Jackson, we do 
not wish to quarrel, though it seems an exag- 
geration. But it really does startle one to read 
that Mr. Bryan ran for president as the " ad- 
vocate of monometallism as opposed to the 
present system of bimetallism." It is also 
interesting to note that the story of the Irish 
in South America is made part of a chapter on 
"famous Irishmen in the United States of 
America." Americans of Irish ancestry will 
be interested in Mr. O'Donnell's book ; but it 
is possible that some of them will object to his 
statements that when the Irish parliament 
becomes a reality, Ireland will " bury the 
hatchet for good," and that "in the present 
crisis the Great European War the sym- 
pathy of every true-born/ Irishman in the 
United States is entirely with England and 
her Allies." _ 



Two fresh 

introductions 

to Browning. 



When Robert Browning died, 
twenty-six years ago, the ques- 

^ j^^ ^^ f requently and 

discussed most hotly in literary circles was 
this: Will Browning's poetry live, will the 
next generation give him as high rank as is 
given him to-day? There were those who 
were ready to assert that it was the Browning 
societies that had made Browning's reputa- 
tion, an opinion worthy to stand by the side 
of the statement of the Stratford coach-driver 
who said to the present reviewer : " We do n't 
think much of Shakespeare in this town ; it's 
the Americans that have made Shakespeare." 
Time has settled the old doubts; and how- 
ever much lovers of poetry may differ as to 
"favorite poets," few indeed will deny that 
the world's verdict writes Browning's name 
very near the top of the list. But this is not 
to say that he is as easy to read as some 
others; it makes considerable difference 
through what poems of his you approach him, 
a fact which has been recognized by numer- 
ous writers of "Introductions to Browning" 
during the past quarter-century. Two excel- 
lent guides have lately appeared, Professor 
William Lyon Phelps's " Browning : How to 
Know Him" (Bobbs-Merrill Co.), and Pro- 
fessor Vernon C. Harrington's "Browning 
Studies" (Badger). Although the two books 
have the same purpose, they are quite different 
in type. To the general reader, Dr. Phelps's 
volume is the more interesting. Though 
scholarly, it is not pedantic : foot-notes there 
are none. Fifty well-chosen poems are pub- 
lished entire, to furnish material for discus- 



sing Browning's theory of poetry, his aim and 
method, his leading ideas, his fondness for 
paradox, and the nature and basis of his 
optimism. Hence it is an agreeable, as well 
as an instructive, volume for the general 
reader as far as it goes. But, since the pur- 
pose seems to have been to include only such 
poems as could be given entire, we have noth- 
ing of " The Ring and the Book," almost 
nothing from the dramas, and nothing of 
" Paracelsus " except some of its lyrics. To find 
fault with a writer of so much humor, charm, 
and knowledge as Dr. Phelps is somewhat 
ungracious; nevertheless the question arises: 
Can anyone really " know " a poet without 
considering his masterpieces? Are these not 
needed to justify Dr. Phelps's own statement : 
"With the exception of Shakespeare, any 
other English poet could now be spared more 
easily than Browning"? Professor Har- 
rington's book is derived from lecture courses 
given to college students. It is frankly 
academic in type, bristles with foot-notes, is 
divided into almost endless heads and sub- 
heads. Consequently it is a book for the stu- 
dent, rather than for the general reader, a 
reference book for the library shelf, rather 
than a volume for consecutive reading. For 
the purposes indicated, it is admirable. For 
example, it would be difficult to find a more 
helpful discussion of " The Ring and the 
Book " than in the fifty pages given to it here. 
Professor Harrington calls this work "the 
most soul-satisfying piece of literature I have 
ever read. In spite of all its defects . . by 
its passion, beauty, and wealth of color, and 
in its marvellous grasp of human nature, it 
can be compared only with the great operas." 



The expulsion of the Germans 

The fall of a r 

German outpost trom Shantung by the Japanese, 
though insignificant in compari- 
son with many of the other operations of the 
Great War, may prove to be one of the most 
important in its after-effects. Mr. Jeffer- 
son Jones, the only American civilian eye- 
witness, who accompanied the Anglo-Japanese 
force, has described the episode in " The Fall 
of Tsingtau" (Houghton Mifflin Co.). The 
story is not a very thrilling one. The garrison 
of forty-five hundred was doomed from the 
first, and the delay in forcing the issue was 
due to a desire to save life or, we are told, to 
political conditions in Tokyo. Yet one must 
regret that lives were sacrificed, and that the 
attractive German outpost in China had to be 
demolished by friend and foe. More interest- 
ing than the account of the military operations 
are the comments of the author on the viola- 



1916]

tion of Chinese neutrality by the Japanese, on 
the subordinate position of the British con- 
tingent, and on the lack of sanitation and dis- 
cipline in the Japanese force. A considerable 
portion of the volume is devoted to the general 
situation in the Far East, especially as regards 
the recent Sino-Japanese treaties. Mr. Jones 
is a severe critic of the late Japanese diplo- 
macy, and he apparently must be numbered 
among the journalists who have adopted a pes- 
simistic view of China's future. One of his 
chapters is entitled " The Passing of China as 
a Sovereign Power," and he is of opinion that 
" at half-past 1 o'clock on the morning of Sun- 
day, May 9, China, the oldest nation in the 
world, passed under the virtual domination of 
Japan." But in the last chapter we learn that 
" New China . . gains strength day by day." 
Mr. Jones also believes that the real issue 
between Japan and the United States is not 
immigration but the attitude of the two gov- 
ernments toward China; but happily "there 
is no real ground for apprehension, no real 
cause for alarm in the relations existing be- 
tween the United States and Japan." If 
"The Fall of Tsingtau" runs into a second 
edition it is to be hoped that the publishers 
will include a map, for surely there are some 
readers who canpot easily turn to a large- 
scale map of the Shantung Peninsula. 



The relation 
of insects 
to disease. 



The growth of knowledge re- 
garding the relations of insects 
to many forms of disease has 
been so great in the past fifteen years that 
earlier entomological treatises are wholly in- 
adequate in their presentation of this aspect 
of the relations of the arthropods, the greatest 
of the groups of animals, to human health and 
welfare. Indeed, the available material in 
this field is now so abundant and so varied 
that the merest presentation of the impor- 
tant principles involved in these relationships, 
of the more salient facts, and of the most 
striking illustrations, will in itself make a 
book of considerable size. It is in the selec- 
tion and condensation of such material that 
the "Handbook of Medical Entomology" 
(Comstock Publishing Co.), written by Pro- 
fessors W. A. Riley and 0. A. Johannsen of 
Cornell University, notably excels. The per- 
spective of relative values so difficult to estab- 
lish in the infancy of most great advances in 
knowledge is here not only adequately deter- 
mined but also well maintained throughout 
the work. The author discusses the growth of 
knowledge of insect transmission of disease, 
rather too briefly in the matters of recent 
history, and then proceeds to the systematic 
discussion of the several types of relationships 



which insects bear to disease in man. The 
first of these, often omitted in treatises of this 
kind, deals with arthropods which are directly 
poisonous, including the biting, stinging, net- 
tling, and vesicating insects, mites, and spi- 
ders. Then the truly parasitic mites, ticks, 
lice, bugs, flies, mosquitoes, midges, fleas, and 
chiggers are discussed, as well as those which 
occasionally temporarily adapt themselves to 
life on or in the human body. The most 
important chapters are those which deal with 
flies as carriers of typhoid fever, fleas of the 
plague or "black death," and mosquitoes of 
malaria and yellow fever, ticks of Texas cattle 
fever and relapsing fever and the fatal spot- 
ted fever of man, lice of typhus, and the 
tsetse fly and fleas of the widely spreading 
sleeping sicknesses of man and other mam- 
mals. Possible but not proved relations of 
insect agency for the transmission of infantile 
paralysis, leprosy, pellagra, and cancer are 
discussed but not accepted. There is a synop- 
tic key for the determination of the insects 
concerned, a helpful chapter on household 
fumigation, and an extensive bibliography 
which omits some of the more important 
memoirs and includes others of slight conse- 
quence. The illustrations are well chosen, and 
I generally well executed. The book deserves 
i wide distribution as a concise and comprehen- 
sive manual of medical entomology suitable 
alike for the physician, the school, the general 
library, and as a text-book for university 
classes. 

The historical novel crops out 
aJZieZtEnrpt. ^ our thousand years ago on 

papyri bearing the tale of an 
| Egyptian courtier, Sinuhe, who had adven- 
tures in Palestine long before the Hebrew 
nation existed. The eastern Mediterranean 
situation a thousand years later appears in the 
ostensible (or actual?) report of an Egyptian 
priest, Wenamon, who had been sent to the 
Lebanon to procure cedar for a sacred barge. 
Half way between these in time, Thutiy, a 
general of the pharaoh Thutmose III, is pic- 
tured as capturing Joppa by a stratagem sug- 
gestive of Ali Baba and the forty thieves. 
These and other types of Egyptian tales a 
marvellous sea yarn, talking mummies, prodi- 
gies worked by magicians are assembled in 
M. Maspero's "Popular Stories of Ancient 
Egypt" (Putnam). This volume, translated 
by Mrs. C. H. W. Johns from a revision of the 
fourth French edition of 1911, furnishes the 
most complete treatment of the subject now 
available. Even stories preserved only piece- 
meal and at second hand by Herodotus and 
later writers are included. M. Maspero, in a 



84 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 20 



very readable Introduction, establishes con- 
nections between the composite plots of these 
earliest known tales and more familiar epi- 
sodes in the Old Testament stories, the Arabian 
Nights, and elsewhere, at the same time show- 
ing that their atmosphere and setting here are 
thoroughly Egyptian. The " revision " of the 
French edition is almost imperceptible, except 
that two useful indexes (lacking in the 
French) have been added. Each story is 
accompanied by an apparently complete bibli- 
ography; but some important additions since 
1911 remain unmentioned, among them Vogel- 
sang's voluminous commentary on " The 
Lamentations of the Fellah." This same tale, 
to M. Maspero apparently a mere "take-off" 
on the sorrows and volubility of the Egyptian 
peasant, has been well interpreted by Profes- 
sor Breasted in his unnoted " Development of 
Keligion and Thought in Ancient Egypt" 
(1912) as a social tractate in disguise appeal- 
ing for a more just officialdom. The transla- 
tions of the tales from the Egyptian depend 
rather on M. Maspero's keen intuition, his own 
extensive studies, and his familiarity with 
modern Egypt, than on the grammatical prin- 
ciples which have been worked out, chiefly by 
German scholars, in the last decades. Occa- 
sional loss of coherence and of accuracy in 
detail results. Some points for example, 
the name and location of the vale to which 
Bata fled (in the " Story of the Two Brothers," 
p. 9), the nature of the ka, and the meaning of 
the epithet " true of voice " applied to the dead 
(p. 84) are better explained in other ways 
than those here adopted. Inconspicuous foot- 
notes seem inadequate for distinguishing the 
actually surviving portions of the tales from 
skilfully paraphrased restorations of lost frag- 
ments. Any translation will involve some 
slips or misunderstandings. Mrs. Johns has, 
however, as in her previous translations of 
other worth-while books, well reproduced the 
spirit of M. Maspero's suggestive volume. 

Mr. Beiioc' s war Mr - Hilaire Belloc is known to 
history.- the the American public as an essay- 

first phase. , *-*_ -, .-, , , 

ist, an historian, and the bril- 
liant mentor of the still more brilliant Mr. 
G. K. Chesterton. It may not be so well 
known that he is a military critic of some 
repute, with a respectable term of service 
in the French army behind him. He has 
projected a history of the present European 
conflict in six volumes, collectively entitled 
" The Elements of the Great War," of which 
we now have "The First Phase" (Hearst's 
International Library). The book is one of 
unusual interest, for the author's lucid and 
logical mind, more French than English in its 



texture, brings out in sharp relief the salient 
features of a very complex situation. Indeed, 
the judicious reader may sometimes wonder 
if the whole matter is not being made too clear 
and easy for his readier comprehension. Mr. 
Belloc passes over the preliminaries of the 
war with a few pungent, slightly dogmatic, 
statements. Like many another, he is con- 
vinced that while Germany's military prepa- 
ration had been continuous in a general way 
since the establishment of the Empire, she 
had been making specific preparations for the 
present war three years beforehand. The 
bulk of the book deals with the military move- 
ments down to Sept. 5, 1914, the eve of the 
battle of the Marne. The author's specialties 
are statistics and strategy. He has much to 
say about the relative sizes of the opposing 
armies, and believes that the Germanic forces 
greatly outnumbered the Allies in the early 
stages of the war. In the matter of grand 
strategy, the fight on the western front 
hinged on the efficacy of the French forma- 
tion known as "the open strategic square," 
against the German long line with its envel- 
oping process. This somewhat technical mat- 
ter is delightfully elucidated with the aid of 
diagrams. Those who read " The First 
Phase " will await eagerly the forthcoming 
volumes of Mr. Belloc's work. 



The story 
of Vasaar. 



The most recent volume in the 
"American Colleges and Univer- 
sities Series" (Oxford Press) is 
a history of Vassar by President Emeritus 
Taylor and Associate Professor Haight. The 
authors present their facts from a point of 
view distinctly that of administrators: stu- 
dent activities are not omitted from the story, 
but they are somewhat slighted, and less atten- 
tion is given to the influence of student and 
alumnae criticism on the college development 
than strict fairness demands. Nevertheless, 
the book is interesting as giving an account of 
early days at the pioneer among American 
colleges for women, days that have just been 
so enthusiastically recalled in the celebration 
of the fiftieth anniversary of its founding. 
Feminists, educators, students, and the gen- 
eral public will all find matter for thought in 
this condensed history of yesterday's phase in 
the great struggle for women's freedom. Fifty 
years ago the founders of Vassar (Matthew 
Vassar was but one of a group of far-sighted 
enthusiasts) established a broad and sound 
basis for " female " development ; they empha- 
sized the need for physical training, horse- 
back riding and dancing, as well as walks and 
calisthenics ; they insisted on " aesthetics," and 
a broadly conceived study of music and paint-

ing ; they cried out upon all forms of superfi- 
ciality; they pled with more conservative 
teachers and parents for the right of the 
Young Person to know the larger world ; they 
stood unswervingly for non-sectarianism, and 
for a genuine democracy in the college life 
that in some of the later days of Vassar has 
been in danger of being forgotten. The strug- 
gles and inspirations of the sixties, the hard- 
ships and depressions of the seventies and 
eighties, the triumphant growth of the nineties 
and of the first decade of this century, are 
faithfully recounted, though, as has been 
said, not quite fully. Nothing is made, for 
instance, of the awakening spirit among the 
students of some eight years ago, or of the still 
more recent developments in faculty organiza- 
tion that bid fair to put the college among 
fearless modern experimenters with the best 
of new scientific methods in education, a posi- 
tion which she certainly held at the beginning 
of her career and which she should as cer- 
tainly, after the middle years of consolidation 
and organization, not hesitate to seize upon 
again. To an alumna who reads between the 
lines of the book, it is this unspoken hope for 
the future that remains as the clearest mean- 
ing to be drawn from the account of what has 
been accomplished in the past by unquestion- 
ing faith in woman's potentialities for a large 
and free self-realization. 



Wagner a* 
a dramatist. 



"The Wagnerian Drama" 
(Lane), by Mr. Houston Stew- 
art Chamberlain, is a translation 
of the writer's first book, " Das Drama Rich- 
ard "Wagners," which was published in 1892. 
There is nothing on the title-page to show that 
it is not a new book ; the only indication that 
it is a translation is a note on page 94 signed 
" The Translator." Yet if the reader does not 
realize that the book dates back nearly a quar- 
ter of a century, he must inevitably wonder 
why the author says an undisputed thing in 
such a solemn way. Mr. Chamberlain's main 
thesis, so tediously reiterated, is that Wagner 
was not the reformer of the opera but the 
creator of the "Word-Tone-Drama" (sic). 
That Wagner attempted to fuse drama and 
music is now a commonplace of knowledge; 
that he succeeded as a dramatist to anything 
like the degree that Mr. Chamberlain claims, 
few will be willing to concede. " Die Meister- 
singer von Xiirnberg " is the only work of his 
which could maintain itself as a drama alone ; 
it assuredly ranks among the best of German 
comedies. Mr. Chamberlain has in recent 
years married a daughter of Wagner, and has 
taken up his residence at Bayreuth. It may 
be presumed, therefore, that he is still in the 



attitude of adoring discipleship to the great 
master. But there would seem to be no ade- 
quate reason why this early work, never very 
perspicacious and now hopelessly out of date, 
should be offered at this time to the English- 
speaking world. The translation, moreover, is 
turgid and Teutonic, and gives one a most 
unfair impression of the author's really ad- 
mirable gifts, which he has revealed elsewhere, 
as a German stylist. 



Militarism in 
America. 



President Hibben, in his In- 
troduction to Major-General 
Wood's "The Military Obliga- 
tion of Citizenship" (Princeton University 
Press), assures us that General Wood pos- 
sesses expert knowledge and that it is availa- 
ble in this volume. However, the book is 
neither original nor profound: its chief au- 
thorities are General Upton and Old Light- 
Horse Harry Lee; its argument for pre- 
paredness is not different from that of the 
innumerable inexpert communications on the 
subject in our daily press. General Wood 
wants an army " sufficient for the peace needs 
of the nation," an adequate navy, adequate 
reserves, a good militia, and trained volun- 
teers or citizen soldiers. He believes in uni- 
versal compulsory service similar to that in 
Switzerland or Australia. But he does not 
approve of "militarism," and he defines that 
much-used and little-understood word as fol- 
lows: "Militarism . . means the condition 
under which the military forces of a nation 
demand and secure special recognition, both 
socially and officially, and exercise an undue 
influence in the conduct of the civil affairs of 
the government, both at home and abroad.'' 
What is " undue influence " to an expert ? 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

In an attractive little book entitled " Protective 
Ornament" (Rochester: The Manas Press), Mr. 
Claude Bragdon, the architect, suggests a new 
" form language " for the decorative arts, to be 
developed from geometry. He maintains his thesis 
more successfully by means of illustrations than by 
his text. This volume, added to Mr. Bragdon's 
" Primer of Higher Space," and " The Beautiful 
Necessity," will suggest to the decorative artist 
many new and beautiful, as well as artistic, forms 
of design. 

Not often does one find so much sane and con- 
structive thinking in so few pages as is contained 
in Mr. Percy MacKaye's "A Substitute for War " 
(Macmillan), previously printed in the "North 
American Review." War is picturesque; peace is 
drab. If peace is to replace war, it must be made 
handsome. This is to be done by organizing the 
armies of peace, and by properly symbolizing their 



86

functions by utilizing the arts of the theatre and 
of pageantry to make them fascinating. The 
Panama Canal, a peace enterprise, captivates the 
imagination. Why cannot other constructive proj- 
ects of society be made equally appealing? The 
rich fruits which followed a pageant at Saint 
Louis in 1914, produced under Mr. MacKaye's 
personal direction, convince him that it can and 
should be done. 

" The Poet's Lincoln," consisting of " tributes in 
verse to the martyred President," is compiled and 
published by that zealous and well-informed Lin- 
colnian, Mr. Osborn H. Oldroyd. He has col- 
lected in his two hundred and sixty pages many 
more Lincoln poems of merit than most of us sus- 
pected to be in existence. To trace them and, in 
many cases, their authorship, must have been a 
task. Dr. Marion Mills Miller contributes a valua- 
ble introductory chapter on " The Poetic Spirit of 
Lincoln," and the Lincoln portraits and other ap- 
propriate illustrations are many. Mention should 
be made of the worthy purpose of the book, " to 
assist in preserving the collection of memorials 
now contained in the house in which Lincoln died, 
516 Tenth Street, Washington, D. C." The vol- 
ume is published by the editor, at the above 
address. 

Many a shudder, for those who enjoy shudder- 
ing and are credulous enough to be made to shud- 
der, may be had at small cost by purchasing and 
reading Mr. Hereward Carrington's " True Ghost 
Stories" (Ogilvie), a collection of curious tales 
from such sources as the " Proceedings of the 
Society for Psychical Research," W. T. Stead's 
" Real Ghost Stories," and Mr. Robert Dale Owen's 
" Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World." 
Mr. Carrington, who is an experienced ghost- 
hunter, intersperses original matter in the way of 
explanation and suggestion, and gives to his book 
that serious and plausible air which will make it 
all the more acceptable to the class of readers 
naturally attracted by its title. An appendix is 
devoted to " the phantom armies seen in France," 
and another to " historical ghosts." A short 
bibliography of miscellaneous ghost literature 
closes the book. 

All scholars interested in folk-song, all Middle- 
Westerners, and all who enjoy things human, 
should find much instructive entertainment in a 
new number of the " Nebraska Ethnology and 
Folk Lore Series." Miss Louise Pound, Associate 
Professor of the English Language in the Uni- 
versity of Nebraska, has prepared a syllabus of 
" The Folk-song of Nebraska and the Central 
West," which will be followed later by a complete 
collection of words and music. There is consid- 
erable technical value in this collection, providing 
as it does material for the study of the variations 
in common folk-songs. Besides this, the indig- 
enous songs, such as " I Want to be a Cowboy," 
" The Little Log Shanty on the Claim," " Bury Me 
Not on the Prairie," "The Horse Wrangler," 
" The Kinkaider's Song," and the famous dog- 
gerel of the Cat Creek Glee Club, give the pam- 
phlet an interest that will not fail to appeal to the 
general reader.

Longmans. 

A new edition of "Why We Punctuate; or, 
Reason versus Rule in the Use of Marks," will be 
issued early in February by the Lancet Publishing 
Co. of Minneapolis. This work was published 
anonymously ("by a Journalist") nearly twenty 
3 r ears ago. It has now been entirely rewritten. 

Mr. Robert Bridges has edited " The Spirit of 
Man," an anthology in English and French from 
the philosophers and poets, which Messrs. Long- 
mans have in press. The book is a new kind of 
anthology, the quotations, prose, and poetry mixed 
together, being arranged in context, to exhibit the 
aspects of life on a spiritual basis. 

Announcing that they have become Mr. Gran- 
ville Barker's American publishers, Messrs. Little,

Housman and Mr. Barker. A new book from 
Mr. Barker's pen will be announced shortly.

A new serial by Mr. William Dean Howells will 
begin in an early issue of the " Century Maga- 
zine." It is called " The Leatherwood God," and 
the story, set in the backwoods of Ohio, is that of 
a religious imposter who proclaims himself first a 
prophet, then the Messiah, and finally, announcing 
that he is God, is almost convinced of his divinity 
by the worship of deluded believers. 

A cumulative volume of all the numbers of 
" Information," a monthly digest of current events, 
is in preparation by the R. R. Bowker Co. for 
early issue. It will be a complete review of the 
history and happenings of a momentous year, 
forming a supplement to the latest encyclopaedias. 
In the arrangement of contents the alphabetical 
plan will be preserved with ample cross references 
to allied topics. 

" Nights : Rome, Venice in the Esthetic Eight- 
ies; Paris, London in the Fighting Nineties," is 
the title of an immediately forthcoming volume of 
reminiscences by Mrs. Elizabeth Robins Pennell, 
with illustrations from photographs and etchings 
by Mr. Joseph Pennell, which Messrs. J. B. Lip- 
pincott Co. will publish. It gives interesting 
accounts of Beardsley, Henley, Henry Harland. 
Whistler, and other literary and artistic friends of 
the Pennells. 

A new edition of de Vogue's book, " The Rus- 
sian Novel," is announced by Mr. Alfred A. Knopf. 
This notable work, which has passed through a 
dozen editions in France and has been translated 
into almost every European language, tells of the 
origin, rise, and progress of the novel and the cir- 
cumstances by which it became the specific means 
of forming modern Russia, freeing the people and 
educating the governing classes. The work deals 
more especially with Pushkin, Gogol, Tourgueniev, 
Dostoieffsky, and Tolstoy, and was chiefly instru- 
mental in winning for its author a seat in the 
French Academy. 

An addition to the " World's Classics " is prom- 
ised in a collection of " English Critical Essays 
(Nineteenth Century)," selected and edited by Mr. 
Edmund D. Jones, who hopes to follow it with a 
companion volume representative of Renaissance 



and Neo-Classic criticism. The present collection 
extends from Wordsworth's essay on " Poetry and 
Poetic Diction" (1800) to Lowell's essay on 
Wordsworth (1875). Another forthcoming volume 
in the same series is an anthology of " English 
Prose Narrative, Descriptive, and Dramatic," 
compiled by Mr. H. A. Treble, whose selection 
ranges in period from Thomas Malory and John 
Lyly to George Meredith and Robert Louis 
Stevenson. 

Professor John Christopher Schwab, librarian 
of Yale University, died on the twelfth of this 
month at the age of fifty years. He was born in 
New York City, entered Yale with the Class of 
1886, and after his graduation studied a year at the 
University of Berlin and another year at Gottin- 
gen. In 1890 he became instructor in political 
economy at Yale, and in 1898 was made a profes- 
sor. In 1905 he was chosen university librarian 
and he held that position until his death. Dr. 
Schwab was the author of two books, " The His- 
tory of the New York Property Tax " and " The 
Confederate States of America," contributed to 
many economic periodicals, and was a member of 
the American and British Economic Associations 
and the American Library Association. He was 
to have been secretary of the committee which is 
arranging for a pageant next autumn in celebra- 
tion of the 200th anniversary of the coming of 
Yale to New Haven. 

In the death, on January 10, of Frank Howard 
Dodd, head of Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., the 
American publishing trade loses one of its promi- 
nent members. Mr. Dodd had been in the pub- 
lishing business from the time of his graduation 
from Bloomfield Academy in 1860 until his death. 
He was born in Bloomfield, N. J., and entered 
business with his father, M. W. Dodd, who founded 
a publishing firm in 1839 in Brick Church Chapel, 
Printing House Square. In 1870 he succeeded to 
the business, and with Mr. Edward S. Mead 
founded the present house of Dodd, Mead & Co. 
He was President of the American Publishers' 
Association for a number of years, was active in 
many civic organizations, and was a member of 
the Chamber of Commerce and a Trustee of the 
New York Kindergarten Association and the 
Greenwich Savings Bank. As president of the 
publishing house he established "The Bookman," 
in 1896, and "The New International Encyclo- 
paedia," in 1902.

Great historical drama 

Master Olof 

Translated by EDWIN BJORKMAN 

$1.50 net. 

" The hero of this drama was the Luther of his people.

\XTRITERS-professional or amateur like THE 
v EDITOR, the fortnightly Journal of Infor- 
mation for Literary Workers. THE EDITOR is 
now in its 22nd consecutive year of publication. 
pROM the days when Jack London, Mary Rob- 
erts Rinehart, Peter Clark Macfarlane, Albert 
Bigelow Paine, etc., were unknown aspirants, writ- 
ers have made THE EDITOR a great exchange 
through which they have transferred to one an- 
other the results of their valuable experiences. 

Roberts Rinehart has said: "THE 
EDITOR helped to start me, cheered me 
when I was down, and led me in the straight path 
until I was able to walk alone." 
JACK London has said: "The first number of 
THE EDITOR I read aroused in me a great 
regret for all my blind waste of energy. I may 
not tell a hundredth part of what I learned from 
THE EDITOR, but I may say that it taught me 
how to solve the stamp and landlady problems." 

IN addition to practical, inspiriting articles on artistic and 
business phases of the art-trade of writing, THE 
EDITOR prints each fortnight news of markets for all kinds 
of literary material. 

UP-TO-DATE news of photoplay markets and of oppor- 
tunities to sell post-card, second serial and other rights 
of already published manuscripts is a feature. 



Considered Trifles." 

NO writer can afford to be without the pleasant, inspiring 
and profitable fortnightly visits of THE EDITOR.

The Diplomacy of the Great War 

By ARTHUR BULLARD. 

Beginning with a discussion of the development 
of international politics in Europe since the Con- 
gress of Berlin in 1878, Mr. Bullard traces the 
causes and conditions of the present war, by a 
study of the diplomacy that preceded it. An 
interesting feature of the book is the review of the 
diplomatic relations between the United States 
and Europe. $1.50. 



Law and Order in Industry 

By JULIUS HENRY COHEN. 

A vivid description of the processes and results 
of the collective dealing between a trades union 
and an employers' association covering a period 
of five years. It furnishes lessons of great immediate 
and future import to all employers of labor, trades 
unionists, social reformers, and students of political 
science and economics. Ready February g. 



The Aftermath of Battle 

By E. D. TOLAND. 
With a preface by Owen Wister. 

"The pages in this book are like the photo- 
graphs which go with them, torn fresh and hot, 
so to speak, from the diary of a young American 
just as he jotted them down day by day in the war 
hospitals of France." Owen Wister. 

Illustrated. $1.00. 



Roadside Glimpses of the 
Great War 

By ARTHUR SWEETSER. 
prisoner of the Germans Once, of the French Twice.

by one whose unusual experiences brought him 
close to the glory, the tragedy and the grim humor 
of the battlefield. Illustrated. Ready in February. 



The Mechanistic View of War 
and Peace 

By GEORGE W. CRILE, M. D. 
"Everybody should read Dr. Crile's book, 
whether or not he accepts his biological inter- 
pretation of war or his mechanistic view of man." 
N. Y. Globe. "Interesting, suggestive, and 
illuminating. It is as devoid of statecraft as of 
mawkish sentimentalism. " PhUa. North-Ameri- 
can. "A most remarkable book." Phila. Evening 
Ledger. Illustrated. $1.25. 



Ordeal by Battle 

By FREDERICK SCOTT OLIVER. 

"The first great book on the war. . . . No more 
readable book, none more enthralling, has for years 
been written. ... It deals, and deals worthily and 
greatly, with the mightiest issues ever known to the

What Is Coming 

By H. G. WELLS. 

How are people going to take such obvious 
matters as the waste of the world's resources, the 
arrest of material progress, the killing of a large 
moiety of the males in nearly every European 
country, and universal loss and unhappiness? These 
are some of the channels through which Mr. Wells 
approaches his all important subject. Incidentally 
he discusses the probability of the establishment 
of a long world peace. To be published shortly. 



The German Empire Between 
Two Wars 

By ROBERT H. FIFE, JR. 
Not a "war book," and yet one of its several 
interests undoubtedly arises from the application 
of the matters which it discusses to present events. 
Gives a clear unbiased account of Germany's 
foreign and internal politics from 1871-1914 and a 
most interesting picture of modern Germany as 
revealed by the school systems, the church, the 
press and the government of the rapidly growing 
cities. Ready February 16.

ON READING FOR ENJOYMENT. 

This phrase, or something like it. is Fitz- 
Gerald's. He who stood aside from the world, 
to whom the ordinary employments of man- 
kind were unsubstantial and visionary, kept 
his heart open to books until the last. Imagi- 
nation took the place of action with him, as 
it does with a boy. To the most of us, how- 
ever, reading for enjoyment is only possible 
in youth. Afterward we read for knowledge, 
or to get some profit for our labor, or at 
least to acquire that ineffable consciousness 
of superiority to hoi polloi which does not 
read. But the wild ecstacy of our earliest 
acquaintance with books, the intoxications, 
orgies, debauches of imagination by which we 
accompany and supplement our reading, can 
hardly be recaptured. Only the creative 
artist, perhaps, though moving behind the 
scenes amid the pulleys and trap doors of the 
stage, can retain enough of the innocence of 
youth to believe in the make-believe that is 
presented to the front of the house. 

My parents were worshippers of Scott and 
Dickens, so that my boyhood was ruled by 
those large luminaries. There could hardly 
have been better or more beneficent influ- 
ences. Imagine a petty and desiccated child- 
hood developing under the auspices of Jane 
Austen, or a dwarfed and repulsive growth 
under the malign powers of the modern real- 
ists. My mother had various portfolios of 
engravings and pictures of the Waverley and 
Byronic epoch. Before I could read I was 
familiar with the names and faces of the 
heroes and heroines of that literature, and 
carried them about in my mind for imitation 
or admiration: I wore the vestments of the 
men and the livery of the ladies. I remem- 
ber, too. an enormously extended life of Napo- 
leon full of vividly colored prints, which one 
drew out accordion-fashion, depicting pretty 
nearly all the chief incidents in the career of 
the Conqueror. After all. the Moving-Picture- 
bred boy of to-day has not so much the advan- 
tage of our older generation, for we could pore 
over our pictures by the hour and recur to 
them again and again until we knew them by 
heart.

[Feb. 3 



My parents had the habit, which I suppose 
is common enough; of attaching imaginary 
personalities to real ones. Such an acquain- 
tance was Quilp or Dick Swiveller or the 
Antiquary. If I did anything creditable I 
was Mark Tapley, " coming out strong." 
There was thus always a coming and going 
of ideal figures in our house. As soon as I 
began to read for myself I set to work to 
construct them and their regions even more 
strongly. My father was a soldier and a 
mighty hunter, and so I had a great store of 
leaden bullets of various sizes and shapes. 
With these, on the cartography of the carpet, 
I laid out the scenes and worked out the plots 
of my romances and novels as fast as I read 
them. Or in my long and lonely walks it was 
no trouble for me to displace the streets or 
landscapes that I saw and substitute in their 
stead the houses and country scenes of my 
book-fed vision. 

Side by side with the larger lords of fiction 
I have named came Cooper and all his com- 
peers of wood and wave. I probably made 
no critical distinction between the literary 
masterpiece and the dime novel. Both .were 
good if they could be worked over in imagina- 
tive play. What a debt I must have owed to 
Mayne Reid! There is hardly one of his 
adventures that I have not re-enacted in 
fancy a score of times. Books of travel and 
exploration, arctic, tropic, mountain, con- 
tinental, all were magnificent fuel for my 
imagination's fire. Of course I am aware that 
this is the common experience of youth ; but 
because it is common it proves that that is the 
period of imaginative enjoyment. Some of 
my preoccupations might have been peculiar. 
I remember the fascination which the idea of 
that arctic food, pemmican, had for me. In 
all my dream wanderings in the Hudson Bay 
region or the Fur Country, that edible accom- 
panied me. I was living on the fat of the 
land in my comfortable home ; but nothing, it 
seemed to me, could be quite as good as pem- 
mican. Alas, I have never tasted pemmican ! 
One other ideal food of my boyhood, jerked 
beef, the carne seco of the Southern plains, I 
have eaten. To my sorrow, I have been forced 
to subsist on it for considerable periods. It 
consists of the flesh of beef, or some other 
animal, cut into thin strips, dried in the sun, 
and then rolled up in masses in the hide. 
Under the tropic sun it soon acquires a pro- 



nounced flavor and potency of life; but it is 
nutritious and a hungry man is not choice. 
Perhaps pemmican would be equally disap- 
pointing. 

My first poet was Scott. " The Lady of the 
Lake " was read to me by my mother before I 
was twelve years old; and I immediately 
borrowed a lead-pencil and some paper and 
started an epic of my own on similar lines. 
That was always the effect of verse on me. 
Prose started me to imaginary imitation of 
its action, poetry to an attempted reproduc- 
tion of the form. Description, images, fine 
writing in prose, I loathed, and always 
skipped. Set to the motion and tunes of 
verse, they lassoed me and drew me captive 
after them. I do not think I thought myself 
into the characters and scenes of poetry. It 
was an Eden protected from entrance by a 
flaming sword ; but I soon discovered that it 
was an Eden built up out of words, and I set 
myself to discover their secret. Pope and 
Shelley were the next poets who unfolded 
themselves to my infant mind. I read and 
re-read them sedulously, though what I made 
out of their moralities or anti-moralities is 
more than I can say now. Shelley did con- 
vert me to vegetarianism, and made me a 
nuisance in the household for some time. We 
had no copy of Keats, and I first found him 
in my first circulating library, bound up in 
one volume with the poems of Mary Howitt 
and Dean Milman. I took the book out so 
often that the librarian must have thought 
these improving authors most attractive to 
me. I read them, of course, for what were 
books printed for except to be read? But I 
heeded them not. The spell of Keats was 
upon me, the vision and revelation of the 
wonders of expression. Keats, too, served me 
as a gateway to Shakespeare. I had read a 
few of the master's plays before, in an un- 
knowing way; but Keats discovered to me 
their technique, and for many years I almost 
buried myself in Shakespeare. I read him 
sitting at a desk, curled up on a sofa, flat on 
the floor, on my head, nearly, lying down- 
ward on a stairway. I read Shakespeare him- 
self, and all the critics and commentators. 
a library of them. Since I came of age I can 
hardly be said to have recurred to such read- 
ing. Unless one wants to be one of the 
" train attendant," it is best not to frequent 
too much the court of great kings. However,

I did for many years constitute myself a 
slave or courtier of Shakespeare in his theatri- 
cal guise. Stage exhibitions are perhaps the 
most enjoyable form of reading. They lack 
the perfection of the inner realizations of 
the mind; but their overwhelming vividness 
of presentation, their life, color, and vibrant 
tones, stamp even deeper impressions. 

How much enjoyment is associated with the 
reading incidental to schoolwork, remains a j 
question. Slowly to dig out a few pages of 
Homer or Virgil by the help of dictionary \ 
and crib, is not an entrancing occupation. 
Of course such work gives one the key to 
future conquests. I did not go far in this 
direction in my youth, but I went far enough 
to realize that there were " livers out of 
Britain " ; that there were vast treasures out- 
side of English literature. 

After the first flush of the experience of i 
books is past, probably the best way to re- ' 
cover some sense of freshness and newness in j 
intellectual matters is to change ground 
entirely, leave the cultivated and floriated 
regions of imaginative literature for a time, 
and get among the crags and rocks of harder 
studies. " How charming is divine philoso- 
phy ! " sings Milton. Its portals and windows 
are gray and forbidding enough from the out- 
side, but from within they are flooded with 
light and color. For four or five years in my 
early manhood I fed almost exclusively on 
metaphysics,, and would have laughed at any 
one who thought its Barmecide banquets un- 
satisfactory. No lollipops for me when I 
could get syllogisms! What was any novel 
or romance to a Dialogue of Plato or a Trea- 
tise of Kant? Metaphysics is the royal game 
of the mind. It imposes itself upon life and 
literature, which are both largely what it 
decrees. It is a cyclone whose circumference 
sweeps everything in its vortex, but at whose 
centre there is peace and quiet. 

The sciences, too, or some of them, astron- 
omy, geology, biology, are capable of bring- 
ing back to the mind its spring, its keen and 
devouring interest in things. As for law, 
Blackstone is as readable as a novel. Almost 
everything of human interest is in the book, | 
customs, habits, adventures, marriage matters, I 
money affairs, and innumerable hangings. 

But in the end, verse lasts best. The hurly- 
burly of the happenings of life seems to have 
little plan or order, and they plagiarize each 



other shamelessly, as do the prose books which 
repeat them. But the movement and music of 
verse do seem to have something in them of 
the primal or final harmony of the universe. 
After all, reading to any great extent, or 
any great enjoyment of reading, is hardly 
compatible with the work and doings of 
actual life. "If rum interferes with your 
business," says an old quip, "give up your 
business." I am afraid it is that way with 
reading. We can hardly fully inherit the 
ideal and the real worlds at the same time.

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN LONDON. 



AN ENGLISH IMPRESSION OF THE " SPOON RIVER 
ANTHOLOGY." -- THOMAS GRAY AS A LETTER- 
WRITER. THE SECOND GEORGIAN POETRY BOOK. 
SOME MAGAZINES AFFECTED BY THE WAR. 
" FORM," A NEW ENGLISH QUARTERLY. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
New books have been rather more interest- 
ing since I last wrote. Several good things of 
various kinds came out toward the end of the 
autumn season, and the spring season opens 
this week with the appearance of Mr. Arnold 
Bennett's " These Twain," which you have 
already seen. At the moment the Press is 
agitated over the " Spoon River Anthology " 
which, until we saw it, we had presumed to be 
a collection of verses by some brotherhood of 
young poets who had formed a Pantisocratic 
community on the bosky banks of the mean- 
dering Spoon, where under the friendly 
heaven, they reconciled the claims of Art and 
Nature by cultivating the Muse and the 
Potato. We were wrong. How wrong I need 
scarcely explain to readers who will be already 
familiar with the Gestes and Sayinges of the 
shades of Tennessee Claflin Shope, Wm. Lloyd 
Garrison Standard, Wendell P. Bloyd, Henry 
C. Calhoun, and Hod Putt whose name runs 
Boy Ed close as an example of monosyllabic 
compression. Some people here are enthusi- 
astic about Mr. Masters's exposure of the 
human race; others, amongst whom I count 
myself, think that the readableness of his book 
is largely accounted for by the originality of 
his idea of (I don't use the phrase in an offen- 
sive way) plying the muck-rake in a cemetery. 
A sane view was expressed, I think, by an 
English author who said that Mr. Masters was 
an American Masefield with more sense than 
Mr. Masefield, but a smaller poetic gift. 

It is possible that some earnest student of 
literature mav illustrate the whole difference

between the twentieth century and the eight- 
eenth by comparing Mr. Masters's observa- 
tions in a Churchyard with those of Thomas 
Gray. "From Stoke Poges to Spoon River: 
An Appraisement of Relative Values " : surely 
the book must already be in course of composi- 
tion. This idea, I am happy to say, would not 
have occurred to me in the normal way; but 
I have just been reading Dr. Paget Toynbee's 
new Gray letters published in what may fairly 
claim to be the most important volumes of the 
season " The Correspondence of Gray, Wai- 
pole, West and Ashton" (Oxford University 
Press) . Gray is certainly one of the best of En- 
glish letter- writers. Cowper who had had no 
opportunity of reading Horace Walpole's let- 
ters and modestly failed to foresee the opinion 
that posterity would hold as to his own said 
he was the best. " I once thought." he wrote 
(to Joseph Hill in 1777), " Swift's letters the 
best that could be written; but I like Gray's 
better. His humour, or his wit, or whatever 
it is to be called, is never ill-natured or offen- 
sive, and yet, I think equally poignant with 
the Dean's." In Dr. Toynbee's collection of 
the letters exchanged between the members of 
the Etonian " Quadruple Alliance," there are 
nearly a hundred of Gray's which have never 
before been published, and they are as good 
as the old ones. The high-spirited jokes of this 
most solemn of poets contrast curiously with 
the refined and polished humor of Walpole: 
one letter from Cambridge, burlesquing the 
trivialities of ordinary correspondence, fin- 
ishes up with "My Duck has eat a Snail." 
The early letters give a pleasing picture of the 
stagnancy of the eighteenth century universi- 
ties. West went to Oxford, the other three to 
Cambridge, and though their letters as fresh- 
men are, no doubt, rather affected in their 
boredom, such letters could scarcely have been 
written in an age when the universities were 
enjoying a vigorous life. West describes Ox- 
ford as a place " flowing with syllogisms and 
ale, where Horace and Virgil are equally un- 
known " and Gray writes of Cambridge : 

" The Masters of Colledges are twelve grey- 
hair'd Gentlefolks, who are all mad with Pride; 
the Fellows are sleepy, drunken, dull, illiterate 
Things; the Fellow Com: are imitatours of the 
Fellows, or else Beaux, or else nothing: the Pen- 
sion: (i. e. Pensioners) grave, formal Sots, who 
would be thought old, or else drink Ale, and sing 
Songs against y e Excise. The Sizers are Graziers' 
Eldest Sons, who come to get good Learning, that 
they may all be Archbishops of Canterbury." 
There are some new Walpole letters, but these j 
are a drop in the ocean of Horace's remains. 

The new Georgian Poetry book, a companion 
volume to "Georgian Poetry. 1911-12," has 



appeared ; and if it is not quite as good as its 
predecessor it contains some very beautiful 
lyrics by Walter de la Mare, W. H. Davies, 
D. II. Lawrence, Ralph Hodgson, Rupert 
Brooke, and J. E. Flecker. The longest things 
in the volume are two plays by Mr. Lascelles 
Abercrombie and Mr. Gordon Bottomley. 
Mr. Abercrombie's " The End of the World " 
is a laborious failure ; Mr. Bottomley's " King 
Lear's Wife " is, although full of distinguished 
writing, scarcely the " better half " of " King 
Lear." The . Queen dies while her husband 
makes love to her handmaid in the death- 
chamber; Goneril, a virgin huntress, murders 
the handmaid; and the Queen's body is 
washed by a crone who accompanies the ablu- 
tion with a song beginning : 

" A louse crept out of my lady's shift 
Ahemm, Ahumni, Ahee, 
Crying ' Oi ! Oi ! We are turned adrift 
The lady's bosom is cold and stiffed, 
And her arm-pit's cold for me.' " 

When the play was produced the other day 
the Censor, with his usual sensitiveness, 
knocked out this song; but the audience, I 
imagine, found the rest of it quite enough to 
stomach. It is not a good play : its horrors are 
laid on and its characters are unreal. But its 
author is one of the most ambitious and origi- 
nal of the younger poets, and nothing he 
could do would be unmitigatedly bad. The 
Chicago Repertory people might have a look 
at it if they want a change. 

So far, the war has not killed as many 
papers as one had expected it would includ- 
ing trade-journals, which I do not as a rule 
read but which I understand have fallen " like 
the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath 
blown." But Mr. Scott-James's twopenny 
literary journal the "New Weekly" "became a 
casualty" (as they say at the front) early in 
the war; " Poetry and Drama " (a periodical 
which, in its short career published much of 
the best work of the younger poets) has suc- 
cumbed, though its spirit lives in hopes of a 
later re-incarnation; "Notes and Queries" 
has been seriously, though one trusts not mor- 
tally, wounded and is calling out for help; 
and now the "Athenaeum," a seamed and 
bronzed veteran, has found the tussle a little 
too hot and been compelled to retire to more 
favorable ground. After running as a 
weekly for the best part of a century, and sur- 
viving the curses of the countless bad writers 
and inaccurate scholars whose withers it has 
wrung, the "Athenaeum" has decided to ap- 
pear once a month instead of once a week. Its 
articles, one gathers, will still be principally 
book reviews, but will approximate in length 
to those in the other monthlies. One of the

most striking things about the old "Athe- 
naeum" has always been the almost complete 
anonymity of its contents, many of the best 
known of English literary men having con- 
tributed without signing. Its present editor, 
Mr. Vernon Kendall, is a Cambridge man, a 
fine classical scholar with a puckish wit and an 
extraordinary knowledge of the holes and cor- 
ners of literature. 

At such a time one certainly would not have 
expected anyone to have the audaeity to bring 
out a. new paper devoted exclusively to the 
arts. But such a paper is at present in gesta- 
tion, and the first number is expected in 
March. It is to be a quarterly, its name will 
be " Form " : its editors are Mr. Austin Spare 
(one of the best of the younger draughtsmen) 
and Mr. Francis Marsden ; and it will be com- 
posed partly of original drawings and partly 
of creative work in verse and prose. Messrs. 
Charles Ricketts, Charles Shannon, and Ed- 
mund J. Sullivan are all taking an interest in 
it; Mr. W. B. Yeats is contributing a number 
of poems to the first issue; and many other 
eminent persons have promised to help. But 
its principal object will be the publication of 
the young: and its existence will be justified, 
(or the reverse) , by the degree of its success in 
getting good work from men whose reputations 
are not yet established. One thing is certain : 
it will be one of the most beautifully "pro- 
duced " papers we have ever had. I have seen 
advanced sheets. The page is large : the type 
beautiful: and the text is throughout (as our 
ancestors would have put it) "embellished 
with cuts" head-pieces, tail-pieces, and 
elaborate initial letters. Whatever the qual- 
ity of the contents, therefore and there is 
reason to hope that it may be good it seems 
likely that " Form " will inevitably become a 

" collector's item."

CASUAL COMMENT. 



PUBLISHERS' ETHICS seem to those of mature 
years to have been on a higher plane " in the 
good old days" than in this latter age. The 
late Frank H. Dodd, of whom many good 
things are being said of late, was in moral 
standards as well as in business ability an 
ornament to his calling. The house of which j 
he was so long the distinguished head that ! 
of Dodd, Mead & Co. held it little short of J 
dishonorable to make approaches of a pro- i 
fessional nature to the authors of another 
publishing house. In harmony with this up- 
rightness of principle was Mr. Dodd's action 



in a little occurrence related by Mr. Howells. 
When the now flourishing firm in Franklin 
Square had fallen on evil days and there 
seemed to the veteran novelist no other course 
open to him but to seek another publisher, he 
went to Mr. Dodd with the first chapter of 
what afterward became " The Kentons " and 
offered the novel for publication. Naturally 
the offer was gladly accepted; but soon the 
sky cleared in Franklin Square, and it became 
evident that no severance of relations be- 
tween Mr. Howells and the Harpers would be 
necessary or advisable. This cheering devel- 
opment caused the greatly relieved novelist 
some embarrassment, but he went again to 
Mr. Dodd and stated the situation frankly, 
asking to be released from his engagement. 
As he himself has narrated the incident, " in 
business, which the ignorant think altogether 
sordid, many delicate and generous things are 
done, and I could never forget the terms of 
this eminent publisher's compliance with my 
suggestion, or the wish for my profit and 
pleasure in the renewal of my old relations 
with Franklin Square which he so cordially 
expressed." One saying of Mr. Dodd's, which 
does him great credit and illustrates his ideal- 
ism, his loftiness of motive, is this : " I think 
we ought to publish every year twenty or 
thirty books of which we know in advance 
that they cannot possibly pay, but of which 
we feel sure that they will be a credit to our 
house." That such a publisher should have 
won to himself many authors who were both 
a credit to the house and a source of hand- 
some profit, is not surprising. 


TlIE FIRST PINE CARELESS RAPTURE OVER 

SHAKESPEARE, such as is known to those who 
have had the good fortune in early life to 
stumble upon and read the plays before hear- 
ing anything or reading anything about them, 
is rather more difficult to recapture than that 
expressed in the song of Browning's wise 
thrush. This handicap* of portentous celeb- 
rity, of unapproachable greatness, is suffered, 
as has often been remarked, by other works 
of literature besides Shakespeare's writings 
most notably of all by the Bible, and in 
hardly lesser measure by Homer. Virgil. 
Dante, and Milton, too, tend to repel by their 
excess of fame; they are introduced to the 
young reader as something more than human. 
Vividly does the present writer recall the 
warm human interest that infused, for him, 
the Old Testament stories that were read to 
him at a very early age before any knowledge 
had come to him of a great book called the 
Bible. The listening and re-listening to those 
stories in the King James version was an 



102

[ Feb. 3 



unending delight, marred only by an occa- 
sional attempt at paraphrase or abridgment 
on the reader's part. Something of this de- 
light was apparently felt by the young 
attendants at a Shakespeare performance 
recently mentioned in the columns of the 
London " Times." The writer says : " Con- 
spicuous among the St. James's audience were 
a row or two of schoolgirls, who, lucky crea- 
tures, were evidently making their first 
acquaintance with ' The Merchant of Venice ' 
on the stage. They went into fits of laughter 
when poor, blind, old Gobbo mistook Launce- 
lot's back hair for a beard, and shrilly ap- 
plauded when Portia so ingeniously turned 
the tables upon the bloodthirsty Shylock. 
That is the way we should all try to enjoy 
our Shakespeare, if we were wise, instead of 
making a fuss over new ' readings ' or minute 
details of mise-en-scene. The trouble is that 
at every successive Shakespearean perform- 
ance a long vista of previous recollections gets 
in the way of our simple pleasure and spoils 
what should have been a whole-hearted sur- 
render to the romance or the fierce passion 
or the mere fun of the moment." Not so, 
however, with all of us, especially if we belong 
to that exalted company known as the gallery 
gods. To them the play is the thing, irrespec- 
tive of any stage traditions relating to its 
presentation. 

LIBRARIANS' SHOP-TALK OF HALF A CENTURY 
AGO, or fifty-two years and four months ago, 
to be exact, is to be found, by those curious in 
such matters, in the " Proceedings of the 
Librarians' Convention Held in New York 
City September 15, 16, and 17, 1853," now 
reprinted by the Torch Press of Cedar Rap- 
ids, Iowa. The call for this first meeting of 
American librarians was issued in May, 1853, 
and was signed by Charles Folsom of the Bos- 
ton Athenaeum, C. C. Jewett of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, "William F. Poole of the 
Boston Mercantile Library, Lloyd P. Smith 
of the Library Company of Philadelphia, and 
others either professionally engaged in library 
work or disinterestedly zealous in promoting 
the growth and multiplication of libraries 
accessible to the public. At the conference 
resulting from this call there were present 
eighty men from thirteen States. Forty-seven 
libraries were represented, containing collec- 
tively more than six hundred thousand vol- 
umes. The entire absence of women from this 
gathering is to us of the present day a nota- 
ble feature, but probably not one of those 
male delegates had the faintest dream of the 
preponderance of the other sex at future 
meetings of the same sort. Among subjects 



discussed prominence was given to the diffi- 
culties and perplexities of maintaining any 
adequate catalogue of a growing collection of 
books, the inadequacies of the printed list 
being pointed out and some system of cumu- 
lative cataloguing by means of separate 
stereotype plates for the successively added 
titles being recommended a fruitful sugges- 
tion, as we now know. But the very simple 
and to us obvious card-catalogue idea was not 
yet conceived. Book-classification, in its crude 
beginnings, was discussed, and " a copy of a 
new index to the Periodical Literature of 
England and America was exhibited to the 
Convention" the author being, of course, 
he whose name has appeared on the back of 
so many successive supplements to that index. 
And all this took place twenty-three years 
before our library workers finally succeeded 
in forming a permanent organization to safe- 
guard and promote their interests. Some 
future periodic assembling of librarians was 
hoped for by this pioneer conference, but it 
seems to have been a hope deferred. 


A HALF-CENTURY'S RECORD OF GOOD LIT- 
ERARY WORK was closed with the death, on 
Jan. 17, of Jeannette Leonard Gilder, who 
has told her own story so well, with such 
charm of romance thrown about the dry bones 
of fact, in " The Autobiography of a Tom- 
boy " and " The Tomboy at Work," that the 
reader need only be referred to those volumes 
for an essentially lifelike portrait of her 
vivid personality and a chronicle of her some- 
what multiform achievements in letters, and 
in some other branches of eager effort. Not 
quite half a century, to be exact, is covered by 
her literary activity; for she began writing 
as a journalist in Newark at eighteen years of 
age, and she had left her sixty-sixth birthday 
not quite three months behind when death 
suddenly overtook her in her New York home. 
Her work on the Newark "Morning Regis- 
ter," the New York "Tribune" and "Herald," 
the Boston "Transcript" and "Saturday 
Evening Gazette," the Philadelphia "Press" 
and "Record," the Chicago "Tribune," and 
the London " Academy," made her known, 
first and last, to thousands of appreciative 
readers. With her brother Richard Watson 
Gilder she was associated in the editorship of 
the old "Scribner's Monthly" (afterward 
"The Century") ; and with another brother, 
Joseph B. Gilder, she ably conducted " The 
Critic," which was later merged with the 
resuscitated " Putnam's Magazine." In addi- 
tion to all this activity she wrote plays and 
magazine stories, was co-editor of various vol-

urnes of prose and verse, established " The 
Reader," which she conducted as an aid to 
book-buyers, and was widely known as author 
of the two autobiographical productions 
named above, and also of " Taken by Siege." 
Of her early work in book-reviewing she her- 
self has told us very agreeably how, by Kate 
Field's advice, she adopted the dialogue form 
and " had a family take up the books of the 
day and discuss them, giving various opin- 
ions: the sons and daughters maintaining a 
point that was immediately bowled over by I 
the father. My ' Chats about Books ' became J 
a popular feature of the paper. Publishers 
offered to put them into book form, and they 
attained the importance of being burlesqued 
by the inimitable Xym Crinkle. He called his 
burlesque ' The Drivel Family,' and I am sure 
that it was well named." 



FORTY YEARS OF OUR OLDEST COMIC JOURNAL 
will be rounded out on the seventh of this 
month, when " The Harvard Lampoon " com- 
pletes its fourth decade of mirthful existence. 
Naturally the occasion revives memories and 
traditions of the literary frolic entered into 
by the half-dozen or more students who, one 
day in January, 1876. met in Samuel Sher- 
wood's room in Matthews Hall and outlined 
a plan for the publication, if even for only a 
single issue, of a Harvard "Punch." But 
that initial number proved so hilarious a suc- 
cess that no further encouragement was want- 
ing to persuade the editors to continue as 
they had begun. Among those pioneers in the 
cause of wholesome college humor are found 
the names of Mr. Edward S. Martin, now 
associated with a still more widely known 
though seven years younger comic paper 
("Life"), and the late Edmund M. Wheel- 
wright, architect of the present home of the 
publication he helped to start. Other notable 
contributors to the early success of " Lampy " 
were Mr. Robert Grant (who brought out in 
its pages his "Little Tin Gods on Wheels"), 
Mr. Owen Wist er. Mr. Lloyd McKim Garrison. 
Mr. William Roscoe Thayer. Mr. Frederic 
Jessup Stimson. and Mr. John T. Wheel- 
wright, the last-named still mirthfully associ- 
ated with his "Rollo's Journey to Cambridge," 
one of the paper's most brilliant successes. 
In 1880 occurred a brief period of suspended 
animation, but publication was resumed after 
a six months' interval and has continued with- 
out interruption ever since. To-day, with a 
building of its own, though not yet quite paid 
for, and apparently no decline in its excel- 
lence and popularity, this "' Charivari " of 
our oldest university may be regarded as a 



permanent institution. At any rate, so bright 
a representative of college journalism ought 
to have a perennial existence. 



POLITE LETTERS AND MILITARY TRAINING 
have so little in common that the present ten- 
dency to bring them together in our colleges 
and universities may well excite protest. At 
Harvard, where many students have enrolled 
themselves for soldierly drill, this amateur 
effort to further the cause of " preparedness " 
is not viewed by President Lowell with un- 
qualified approval. Rather the contrary. He 
says, in the course of his annual report: 
" The question of military instruction in term 
time is more difficult. A popular impression 
still survives that drill, comprising the man- 
ual of arms and evolutions in small bodies, is 
the main point in military training. It is, of 
course, essential, but it forms a very minute 
part of the education of an officer; and it is 
quickly learned, as anyone who has visited the 
students' camps must have observed. More- 
over, it had much better be taught under 
military conditions like those in a camp or in 
the militia, rather than in student organiza- 
tions at a college which is not primarily a 
military school. Constant drill in a hall or 
on an athletic field is artificial, monotonous, 
and wearisome, tending to produce an aver- 
sion for military training instead of an inter- 
est in the real problems with which an officer 
must deal." Certain military studies that 
might be pursued as electives, supplementary 
to field training at summer camps, are named, 
but only in a tentative, suggestive way. To 
urge a student to enter upon the study of the 
science of human butchery might seem to in- 
volve some such risks as, according to Pope, 
accompany the too frequent viewing of the 
face of vice. , , 

A YEAR'S LIBRARY LEGISLATION is summa- 
rized by Mr. William R. Eastman in a report 
lately submitted to the New York Library 
Association and now published in "The 
Library Journal" (January issue). It ap- 
pears that in 1915 one hundred and three 
bills affecting libraries were presented in the 
legislatures of thirty-one states and in Con- 
gress: and of these fifty-eight became law. 
West Virginia passed a general library law 
empowering a municipality to establish and 
maintain a public library by taxation. No 
other general law of this nature was enacted, 
though efforts to that end were made in Penn- 
sylvania and Indiana. No additional state 
library commission was created, though at- 
tempts are recorded in West Virginia and 
Oklahoma. Kansas raised its tax limit for 



104 



THE DIAL 



[ Feb. 3 



libraries in cities of fewer than forty thou- 
sand inhabitants, making the maximum half 
a mill on the dollar instead of four-tenths of 
a mill. County-library systems were adopted 
by Texas and Montana ; but in Pennsylvania, 
Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, and 
Arizona, county-library bills were defeated. 
In Ohio and Oregon amendments to existing 
county-library laws were adopted. The cause 
of the legislative reference library was pro- 
moted in North Carolina, Georgia, and else- 
where. Travelling libraries and school libraries 
were the subjects of some progressive legis- 
lation, and retirement pensions for super- 
annuated librarians were considered by the 
law-makers of Ohio and Michigan, but the 
consideration proved unfavorable. Among 
bills of a foolish and impracticable nature, 
precedence must be accorded to the Massachu- 
setts proposal that every book returned from 
circulation should be disinfected or sterilized 
before going out again. The bill failed of 
passage. On the whole, it was a year of 
progress in wise law-making for the public 
library, as will appear more unmistakably 
upon perusal of Mr. Eastman's report in full. 


MB. MASEFIELD IN AMERICA becomes an ob- 
ject of considerably more curiosity and inter- 
est to us than Mr. Masefield in England. 
Though English-born, he might be claimed by 
us as half- American ; for it was from our | 
shores that he set forth, some fifteen years 
ago, to win his present place in the world of 
letters. Scorning school and books in boy- 
hood, he seems to have driven his parents 
well-nigh to distraction by his errant ways. 
At any rate, he was finally indentured to the 
captain of a merchant vessel, apparently as 
the only means of holding him within some 
sort of bounds. Such a record of wandering 
by sea and land as next follows can be 
claimed by no other living poet, if indeed it 
can be equalled by any biography of poet in 
the past. About the nearest approach to any- 
thing like formal education in Mr. Masefield's 
development seems to have been that summer 
he spent with the poet Yeats in Devonshire, 
"loafing and talking" and indulging in the 
innocent pastime of sailing paper boats (much 
as Shelley used to do, one surmises) on the 
placid streams of the neighborhood. To be 
sure, this was informal enough as educational 
discipline, but it has been regarded as a con- 
siderable factor in the poet's training, and 
there is no reason to doubt it. On the whole, 
no more picturesque and oddly attractive per- 
sonality has sought our shores from the old 
world for many a day. 



A FAR NORTHWESTERN WORD IN DEFENCE OF 

OUR LANGUAGE against the havoc-working in- 
roads of self-styled reformers comes to our 
notice and commends itself as worthy of the 
attention of all to whom "simplified spell- 
ing" is a subject of vital concern. The 
Portland " Oregonian," in the course of an 
able and spirited declaration against the per- 
nicious activities of the language-tinkers, 
after referring in general terms to "the evil 
of simplified spelling " and the likelihood that 
it " will do nothing more than befuddle the 
student to a greater extent even than the 
present-day accepted spelling does," contin- 
ues in similar strain, and thus concludes: 
" Incomplete as the English language is, it is 
the English language, and the most of us 
would like to have it retain a semblance of 
its form. The radical simplified spelling 
would do well to apply itself to a new lan- 
guage, Esperanto, for instance, and leave the 
dignity of our language undisturbed. Correct 
spelling goes with learning, although many 
college men are notoriously poor spellers. 
Nevertheless, to have mastered the difficulties 
of words is a badge of distinction. Standard 
spelling takes into account etymology, orthog- 
raphy, and phonetics. Radical spelling re- 
form deals almost solely with the last, and 
not consistently with that." Standard spell- 
ing takes into account much more than is here 
named : it jealously preserves history and 
poetry and hundreds of associations, most of 
them precious, many of them, it may be, inti- 
mately personal, which would be ruthlessly 
swept away by the zealot to whom simplifica- 
tion is more than the bread of life. 


ECHOES FROM THE GREAT INTERNATIONA!; 
BOOK-FAIR that so unexpectedly suffered par- 
tial eclipse from the outbreak of international 
hostilities have been reverberating through 
the world ever since those attractive pavilions 
at Leipzig were closed, some of them prema- 
turely in August, 1914, and the others with 
more deliberation in October. Especially per- 
sistent has been the rumor that the country 
which acted as host on that occasion lost no 
time in confiscating the exhibits of the hostile 
nations, to the great indignation of the ex- 
hibitors and their sympathizers. Of course 
denials have been made and have fallen on 
deaf ears; but now there comes from the 
scene of the supposed outrage a press com- 
munication (addressed to the Chicago "Trib- 
une" and printed also in the New York 
" Times," and perhaps elsewhere as well) con- 
tradicting the alleged violation. Mr. Jamas 
O'Donnell Bennett writes from Leipzig that 
both by inquiry and by ocular evidence he has

assured himself that the authorities concerned 
have both taken the utmost care of all exhib- 
ited property left on their hands when the 
war-panic sent the custodians flying to their 
several homes, and have even gone so far as 
to insure this property against loss or dam- 
age, paying the insurance charges themselves. 
The whole transaction is most creditable to 
Germany. 

THE YEAR'S LITERARY HARVEST IN ENGLAND 
shows some unmistakable effects of the violent 
interruption to peaceful activities, but they 
are less marked than might have been ex- 
pected. While the book-product of the 
United Kingdom fell off in 1914 to the extent 
of 842 items, with five months of war to ac- 
count for the decrease, the output for 1915, in 
the face of a whole year of warfare, showed 
a loss of only 872 as compared with the pre- 
ceding twelve months ; and this diminution is 
proportionately greater in new editions than 
in new books. These facts are set forth with 
clearness and brevity by " The Publishers' 
Circular" of London, which also informs its 
readers that while fiction shows a decrease of 
419 (the largest of any class), science a de- 
crease of 142, and technology one of 167, 
history has gained 309, and geography 118, 
with lesser gains in several other classes. As 
was remarked last year by the same authority, 
so this year " the average quality of the books 
published ... is probably somewhat lower 
than during pre-War days, owing partly to 
a reluctance to place on a disturbed market 
works requiring a great outlay, and partly to 
the appearance of numerous ephemeral works 
dealing with the War." In view of England's 
frightful losses in young men of the highest 
attainments and brightest promise, the won- 
der is she can still make so good a showing. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

HISTORICAL INACCURACIES IN LONGFEL- 
LOW'S " EVANGELINE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In a letter to the New York " Nation " (Novem- 
ber 6, 1884, p. 398), Francis Parkman quotes 
another writer who had asserted that " Most peo- 
ple when they desire to know the true history of 
Acadia will be content to read Longfellow," and 
says : " If so, they will not find what they seek, 
but in its place, a graceful and touching poem and 
a charming ideal picture. The author of the 
remark just quoted also adds : ' The history of 
events is not always the history of humanity.' 
But the history of humanity, to be good for any- 
thing, must rest, not on imagination, but on truth." 

The only authority who can be suggested as 
having affected Longfellow's point of view in : 



"Evangeline" is the Abbe Raynal, whose emo- 
tional Acadian story is so obviously and intensely 
prejudiced as hardly to be reckoned an authority. 

The late Charles Francis Adams has dealt in his 
customary vigorous and incisive style with the 
treatment by the Cambridge poet of Myles Stan- 
dish and Paul Revere. Comment can be made as 
justly upon the unfortunate dealing with facts in 
his classic poem of " Evangeline " concerning the 
expatriation from Grand Pre, especially as an 
unavailing effort has been made to have these sug- 
gestions incorporated by foot-notes in popular 
editions of the poem. There are indeed some gen- 
eral observations in the preface of certain of these 
editions which might suggest the fact that the poem 
is not a history, but there are no corrections of 
definite mis-statements. Aside from the fact that 
nobody reads a preface, the antidote should be 
immediately connected with the passages which 
require it. 

This historical vindication is made the more 
necessary by the presentation of a dramatic ver- 
sion of " Evangeline " not long ago in New York, 
with an announcement made upon its programme, 
under the authority of a committee of the Depart- 
ment of Education of that city, stating that Long- 
fellow " translated history into poetry," and that 
" for his facts he turned to records," and that the 
commanding officer's proclamation, testifying to 
the disagreeableness of his duty in causing the 
removal of the people and his hopes for a good 
future for them, was " cruel irony," and charac- 
terizing the separation of Gabriel and Evangeline 
as " typical " and not exceptional. These state- 
ments, though unexpected from an official body, 
quite represent a popular opinion (which was 
shared by the present writer in his youthful ad- 
miration for the poem). The removal of the 
Acadians from Grand Pre cannot be thus con- 
demned, like the expatriation of the Belgians, nor 
can the commander of the expedition be classed 
with the lieutenants of Alva in the Netherlands and 
of Oliver Cromwell in Ireland. 

Admiring appreciation of the poetic gifts of 
imagination in the author of "Evangeline" must 
be conceded to the creation of the pictures of 
nature therein, since Longfellow had not visited 
Grand Pre or the Mississippi, but trusted, as we 
are told, to descriptions by others and to Banvard's 
panorama. Though the actual history of the de- 
portation had not been widely made known when 
the poem was written, Winslow's " Journal " was 
as accessible to one who was himself a member of 
the Massachusetts Historical Society as it is now 
to members, and indeed, through its generous cour- 
tesy, to any student. 

Let us now consider in detail some of the 
specific passages in which Longfellow has substi- 
tuted for history a popular myth of his own 
creating 1 . 

" Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian 

farmers, 
Dwelt in the love of God and of man." 

The settlement had been a nest of traitors. If it 
"dwelt in the love of God and of man," it cer-

tainly did not dwell in the love of the men of the 
English colonies. Plots and plans for raids by 
French and Indians were so incessant that at last 
the choice of expatriation or the taking of the 
oath of allegiance mentioned in the next note 
became inevitable. 

" The expulsion of the Acadians may seem to us a 
cruel act, but it was forced upon the English by the 
hardest necessity, the necessity of self -protection ; and 
in spite of all that has since been written to the con- 
trary, no impartial student of history can perceive in 
what other way than the deportation of these irrecon- 
cilables could the peace of New Scotland have been 
assured, a peace which has lasted to this day." 
("Nova Scotia," Beckles Willson, 1911, pp. 75, 76.) 

" Murder, rapine, and open warfare instigated by 
them were incurred at the hands of the native Mic- 
macs." ("The Fall of New France," Gerald E. Hart, 
1888, p. 22.) 

" Many of them have been detected in joining the 
French and Indians both in peace and war against his 
Majesty's subjects." (" Present State of North Amer- 
ica," John Huske, 1755.) 

" Les Anglais ne sont pourtant tout-a-fait delivres 
des inquietudes que leur donnaient les alliances des 
Sauvages avec les Francais. Ces derniers qui habi- 
taient en Acadie n'ayant pas voulu se soumettre a la 
domination anglaise, se sont retires dans la GaspSsie, 
d'ou ils incommodent leurs voisins." (" Histoire et 
Commerce des Colonies Anglaises," Butel-Dumont, 
3755, p. 72.) 

" What their design may be is unknown ; but all are 

commanded 
On the morrow to meet in the church." 

The design for which the " simple Acadian 
farmers " were ordered to assemble must have 
been pretty well known to them, pace the poet's 
assumption. Though twice confirmed British sub- 
jects by the Treaty of Utrecht and that of Aix-la- 
Chapelle, they had repeatedly refused to take an 
oath of allegiance which English officials were too 
weak to enforce until 1730, when Governor Gen- 
eral Richard Phillips brought over with him the 
following form, to which he secured general sub- 
scription : " Je promets et jure sincerement en 
foi de Chretien que je serai entierement fidele et 
obeirai vraiment Sa Majeste le Roi George le Sec- 
ond, que je reconnais pour le Soverain Seigneur 
de 1' Acadie ou Nouvelle Ecosse. Ainsi Dieu me 
soit en aide." Nevertheless, the Acadians after- 
wards maintained that Governor Phillips had 
verbally made reservations by which they were per- 
mitted to remain " neutrals " ; and they were sum- 
moned on five occasions between 1749 and 1755 to 
renew the oath, repudiating the alleged reserva- 
tions, to which, however, they stubbornly adhered, 
though they had been explicitly and repeatedly 
forewarned of the consequences the forfeiture 
of their lands and their removal. 

" Those who had taken the oath were safe in their 
homesteads." ("Nova Scotia," Beckles Willson, 1911, 
P. 74.) 

"Prisoners now I declare you; for such is his Maj- 
esty's pleasure. 

" Four times the sun has risen and set ; and now on 
the fifth day ... 



Opened and forth came the guard, and marching in 

gloomy procession 
Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient, Acadian 

farmers." 

The men who were summoned to meet the com- 
mander in the church were not all confined there 
until the fifth day, but, however recalcitrant, were 
allowed to go in squads to their homes to make 
preparations for departure, their superiority in 
numbers making it necessary to keep the body 
under observation. Winslow had a few hundred 
men; while there were nearly four thousand Aca- 
dians in the province. 

"And the Necesity of Providing for them Selves 
and Families, permitted Twenty of them vizt Ten of 
the Districkt of Grand Pre & Ten of Cannard &c to 
be absent at a time and to return at the End of 
Every 24 Houers & Others to go out in their room 
the French them Selves to Chose these People, and to 
be answerable for their return, and their Buissness 
to Sea their Bretherin Provided for &c, and this 
Method I have Continued in to this Day and have 
found no Ilconveniency in it." (Winslow's " Journal.") 

" Wives were torn from their husbands and mothers, 

too late, saw their children 

Left on the land, extending their arms with wildest 
entreaties." 

The description of the embarkation, with im- 
plied frequent separation of families, is absolutely 
denied by the recorded fact of the painstaking and 
almost universally successful efforts to place mem- 
bers of families in the same transports. 

" It remains certain that Winslow did all possible 
to bring members of the same families in the same 
transports." (Francis Parkman, " Harper's Weekly," 
Vol. 69, p. 876.) 

"Eemoved the several men that were Embarked in 
the Three Different vessels So as to commode each 
Neighbourhood for their Familys to Joyne them when 
the other Transportes arrives." (Winslow's "Jour- 
nal.") 

" But the soldiers strove their best to perform their 
painful duty as humanely as possible, and no unneces- 
sary harshness marked their operations." (" Nova 
Scotia," Beckles Willson, 1911, p. 75.) 

" 'Twas the returning tide, that afar from the waste 

of the ocean 
With the first dawn of the day, came heaving and 

hurrying landward. 
Then recommenced once more the stir and noise of 

embarking ; 
And with the ebb of that tide the ships sailed out of 

the harbor." 

The embarkation, here represented as a wild 
scramble accomplished in two turns of the tide, in 
reality occupied weeks, partly owing to the lack of 
transports. The removal, comprising 5788 per- 
sons, actually began on October 8, and was not 
entirely completed until December 20. Where the 
exiles were landed, 

" with but few trifling exceptions they were humanely 
treated and supported at public expense; throwing 
into bold relief the cold and repellent reception the 
three thousand refugees who found their way into 
Canada met with at the hands of their fellow coun- 
trymen who gave them hides and horse-flesh as food, 
and scant supply at this, as many of them, it is re- 
corded on the dark pages of French-Canadian history,

died from starvation." (" The Pall of New France," 
1755-60, Gerald E. Hart, 1888.) 

Of Winslow it may be said that family tradi- 
tions justify the indication of character in the 
portrait owned by the Massachusetts Historical 
Society, he was urbane, genial, and kind-hearted, 
characteristics inconsistent with the baseless ac- 
cusations, by some writers, of inhumanity and 
cruelty. His proclamation, denounced as "cruel 
irony " by the document which described the poem 
as " translated history into poetry," is known to 
have expressed " the feelings of a soldier obliged 
to fulfil a painful duty performed with all con- 
sideration in his power" (Francis Parkman, 
"Harper's Weekly," Vol. 69, p. 876). 

" He has left on record that the task in which he 
was now engaged was a most uncongenial one." (" In 
Acadia." Xew Orleans, 1888, Historical Sketch of the 
Acadians, John E. Ficklen.) 

' Es steht fest dass Winslow sein Moglichtes tat, 
um Angehorige einer Familie in dasselbe Fahrzeug 
zu bringen." ("Longfellow's Evangeline Kritische 
Ausgabe mit Einleitung, Untersuchungen fiber die 
Geschichte des englischen Hexameters und Anmer- 
kungen." von Ernst Sieper, Dr. phil., a. o. Professor 
an der Universitat Miinchen, Heidelberg, 1905.) 

Along with the vindication of an act whose 
cruel necessity has been impugned so unjustly, 
goes the personal vindication of the chief actor 
therein. The advocates of the church which is still 
that of French Canada have shut their eyes to the 
truth of the Acadian situation, involving some of 
its clergy and membership, and have not failed to 
assert that Winslow should have " declined to 
cany out a project so repellent to generosity and 
justice." On the contrary, if his character was 
such as Parkman describes, the manly and dutiful 
undertaking of the painful task is an evidence of 
its unavoidable exigency. The historian's estimate 
is just. The commander of the Acadian expedi- 
tion was a worthy descendant of the ancestor 
whose kindness to Massasoit saved the infant Ply- 
mouth colony from destruction by the natives, who 
prevented its removal to Jamaica according to the 
Protector's design, by Cromwell's regard for the 
' ; smooth tongued cunning fellow," as his enemy 
Maverick called him, and who created the Society 
for the Propagation of the Gospel among his 



beloved Indians.

Boston, Mass., Jan. 25, 1916. 



EXTRINSIC VALUES IX AET. 
(To tiie Editor of THE DIAL.) 

That the application of the term " quaint " to 
Chaucer betokens a superficial acquaintance with 
the poet is the dictum recently enunciated by a 
leading Chaucerian scholar. " The ancients did 
not know that they were ancient." Great art can- 
not be quaint. 

Perhaps it is only in self-defence that I venture 
to differ. Is it not really legitimate to feel that 
certain art is " quaint " ? Does only the superfi- 
cial student detect a quaint something in Chaucer? 
Does not the whole matter come back to the point 
of view? 



Any phenomenon in nature the odor of jas- 
mine, for instance, is not quite the same to you 
as to me. To a slight difference in mere denota- 
tion, due to idiosyncracies in our olfactory nerves, 
add the difference in connotation due to the differ- 
ences in the environment and experience of our 
lives, and one must be impressed by the varieties 
of appeal that a single natural phenomenon may 
make to various human beings. To one who en- 
counters jasmine for the first time, it gives forth 
merely a rich; delightful fragrance or, possibly, 
not delightful; to another, born and bred amid 
jasmine, the fragrance brings with it clouds of 
memories and romance. A familiar landscape is 
sweet and restful; foreign scenery piques and 
stimulates. A view in Japan is two quite different 
things to an American and to a Japanese. The 
appeal of its beauty to the two beholders may be 
equal, but cannot be identical; for to the one it is 
native, to the other alien. 

Differences in the impressions produced by 
nature, however, are not so striking as in those 
produced by the human elements in scenery. 
Physiognomy, costume, habitations, monuments of 
architecture are either familiar or strange: and 
this fact greatly intensifies the difference between 
the impressions produced by a Japanese scene 
upon a native and upon a foreigner. If one in- 
cludes less tangible elements of the human sort 
language, customs, habits of thought all the more 
does the appeal of things Japanese to an American 
diverge from their appeal to a native of Japan. 

Now, it is just these elements, natural and 
human, which enter into the composition of art. 
To a person of our race there must needs appear 
in a Japanese painting something strange and 
curious, a beauty unknown and alien. The natural 
and human differences have been magnified in 
passing through the mind of the artist, with its 
Japanese habits of thought, and we feel with 
redoubled force an appeal unlike that with which 
we are familiar and at home. Whether the art be 
painting, sculpture, architecture, music, or litera- 
ture, this flavor of the Asiatic and the Japanesque 
must reach us as it cannot possibly reach a native 
Japanese. The Japanese soul is, in the object of 
art, a soul differentiated by centuries of develop- 
ment from that of the American. Only by trans- 
muting himself into a Japanese may the American 
feel Japanese art as it is felt by the native of 
Japan. How difficult if not impossible is 
such transmutation of personality appears in such 
striking persons as Kipling and Lafcadio Hearn. 
These writers never became Japanese or Hindu: 
on the contrary, their very sensitiveness to the 
alien and exotic flavor of Japanese and Hindu 
life and art enabled them to act as intermediaries 
between the East and the West. No man may 
one be so dogmatic ? can ever be native to both 
hemispheres. 

So it is, likewise, if we move backward in time 
instead of stepping across the world in space. No 
twentieth-century reader of Homer will register

mind and heart. Neither can any reader quite 
cease to be of his own generation as he cons the 
charming lines of Chaucer. Let him become as 
familiar as he can with Chaucer's language, style, 
rhythm, thought, personality, environment, still 
there remain in the background of consciousness 
Shakespeare and all the moderns to forbid the 
complete abolishment of the perspective of time. 
Chaucer to the scholar of to-day is not quite the 
beloved master of Lydgate and Occleve. To be 
sure, this tertium quid, the resultant of the inter- 
action of two personalities far separated in time, 
the writer and the reader, must be much less 
pronounced in the case of a mature scholar than 
in that of a beginner in mediaeval literature. Yet 
it cannot wholly vanish. 

Call the quality of this appeal " quaintness," or 
what you will, is it to be lamented ? Well, that 
depends. In reading a writer so great that his 
thought, style, and personality are worthy of eter- 
nal remembrance, a sense of strangeness may be a 
hindrance to our highest enjoyment and profit. 
Dante we should strive to see without needless dis- 
tortion. It is surely wise that Shakespeare should 
be printed in modern style, with modern spelling, 
except for scholars. But in the case of less lofty 
specimens of literature, quaintness may be an 
unearned increment, a gracious bestowal of Time, 
moss, lichens, and ivy upon structures other- 
wise less appealing. In contemporary art we 
enjoy a sense of fresh contemporaneousness: why 
not treat ourselves when reading Boccaccio and 
Chaucer to a flavor of the remote, the antique, the 

beautifully quaint?

THE " TWELVE DAYS OF CHEISTMAS " 

FOLK-SONG. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The "Bit of Folk Poetry" in your issue for 
January 6, page 13, is well worthy of record; but 
your correspondent, Mr. Nelson Antrim Crawford, 
is mistaken in thinking that the verses have never 
been published. I remember the book as a Christ- 
mas gift in childhood, some time in the '80's 
probably. It was a gorgeously illustrated quarto- 
pamphlet, received by me near Boston, Massachu- 
setts, but imported no doubt from England. Mr. 
Crawford's version differs somewhat from my 
recollection of the printed verses. Each stanza of 
mine ended with " Some part of a juniper tree " 
(" And " being prefixed in the stanzas following the 
first), instead of "A beautiful juniper tree." The 
" Twelve bulls a-roaring " and " Eleven lords a- 
leaping " had a somewhat more graceful substitute 
in my edition, which I am unable just now to 
recall. It would seem to be a nursery song, from 
about Shakespeare's time or before, and some of 
our English readers may know more of its origin, 
or whether it came by chance from even earlier 
French lines.

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The Christmas folk-poem quoted in your issue 
of January 6 has long been familiar to students of 
English folk-lore. See the publications of the 
Percy Society, " Early English Poetrv," volume 4, 
" The Nursery Rhymes of England," by Halliwell- 
Phillips, where it appears as number 226. A 
slightly different version is given in the fifth edition 
of the " Nursery Rhymes," 1886. The version sent 
in by Mr. Crawford differs in a few details; " col- 
ored balls " is substituted for the original " colly 
birds," " chests of linen " for " geese a-laying," etc. 
The poem is of course a game, and tests a child's 
ability to repeat all that has been sung and to add 
a new line. There is a similar game played by 
American children, which begins, " My Aunt Mary 
went to England, and packed in her trunk "... 
The traditional music of the English nursery 
rhyme has, I believe, also been preserved.

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In regard to the communication in your issue of 
January 6 concerning the quaint folk-song, " The 
Twelve Days of Christmas," your readers may be 
interested to know that one version of this song has 
been published and is available in two forms. " The 
Complete Mother Goose," published by the H. M. 
Caldwell Co., (1902) pp. 222-4, includes this in a 
group of children's finger games. It is also pub- 
lished with the original musical setting by Novello. 
The song is a great favorite witli the students of 
Milwaukee-Downer College, who have sung it at 
their Christmas Revels for the last six years. 

It is evidently one of the many counting songs 
used by fond parents of the olden time to relieve 
the tedium of mechanical memorizing. The accumu- 
lative process of incremental repetition is an old 
favorite with children, as is seen in " The House 
that Jack Built," "A gaping, wide-mouthed, wad- 
dling frog," and many others. This version 
enumerates the following gifts from "my true 
love": A partridge in a pear tree, two turtle 
doves, three French hens, four calling birds (also 
written collie birds), five gold rings, six geese 
a-laying, seven swans a-swimming, eight maids 
a-milking, nine drummers drumming, ten pipers 
piping, eleven ladies dancing, twelve lords a-leap- 
ing. The order, from nine to twelve, seems to vary. 
Another quaint 'counting game, evidently used by 
parish priests to fix in the minds of youth certain 
articles of belief, though combining in grotesque 
fashion, as was not at all uncommon, secular ideas 
with the ecclesiastical, is " The Twelve O's." This 
song comes from Cornwall and reads as follows : 
" Come and I will sing you ; 

What will you sing me? 

I will sing you one O; 

What is your one O? 
One of them is God and Mini 

and ever will remain so. 

" Come and I will sing you ; 
What will you sing me? 
I will sing you two O; 
What is your two O?

Two of them are lily-white babes

The other O's enumerated are as follows :

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In the issue of THE DIAL for January 6, atten- 
tion is called to a bit of folk -poetry, beginning " On 
the first day of Christmas " and going on to the 
twelfth day in cumulative fashion. 

Your contributor thinks that this poem has never 
been printed. The general form of the ballad, with 
variations, may be found on page 258 of " Mother 
Goose's Nursery Rhymes" (Fred'k Warne & Co.), 
a treasure house of folk-lore jingles and games. 
The items differ somewhat from your version, but 
that is accounted for by oral tradition, in which 
considerable freedom was allowed. The idea is to 
make a game for children, to " do a stunt " of 
memory and oral glibness. The directions are, 
" Each child in succession repeats the gifts of the 
day and raises her fingers and hands according to 
the numbers named. Forfeits are paid for each 
mistake." 

On page 445 of this same edition of " Mother 
Goose " is another cumulative piece, as follows : 

" A kid, a kid my father bought 
For two pieces of money: 

A kid, a kid! 

" Then came the cat and ate the kid 
That my father bought 
For two pieces of money: 

A kid, a kid! " 

And so on, for ten stanzas, with an interpreta- 
tion based on the Chaldee or the Hebrew version, 
reviewing the history of the world. 

I recently made a collection of little songs sung 
by children when jumping rope (last spring), 
among which was one that I dubbed " The Endless 
Chain." It is not cumulative, but it might go on 
forever as a " stunt " in. matching rhymes. It 
reminds one of an " endless controversy," where 
each one is trying to have the last word ; or it may 
hark back to ancient " amo?bic " verse, a pastoral 
diversion of shepherds. The lines are as follows: 

" Mother. Mother, guess what I heard ! 
Pa's going to buy me a mocking bird. 



" If the mocking bird won't sing, 
Pa's going to buy me a diamond ring. 

" If the diamond ring turns to brass, 
Pa's going to buy me a looking glass. 

" If the looking glass gets broke. 
Pa's going to buy me a Billy Goat. 

" If the Billy Goat runs away, 
Pa's going to buy me a horse and sleigh. 

" If the horse and sleigh won't go, 
Pa's going to buy me I don't know ! " 

This is recited in very sing-song fashion, while 
turning rope for jumping. The game is to see if 
the child jumping can jump without missing until 
the whole story has been recited. If she does, the 
girls who are turning the rope then recite " Salt, 
vinegar, mustard, pepper," turning faster and 
faster until the jumper misses. 

I have an interesting collection of these jumping- 
rope songs. They add greatly to the enjoyment of 
jumping rope, and belong, no doubt, in the depart- 
ment of folk-lore. They have been sung for years, 
one for thirty years, I judge, having passed down 
from mother to child. CHARLES D. PLAIT.

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Apropos of Mr. Crawford's version I venture to 
send that by which my mother was wont to sing 
me to sleep. The twelfth line escapes me, but she 
would not have sung about " roaring bulls." Prob- 
ably it escapes me because I went to sleep at 
eleven, so to speak. The tune was a minor, very 
different from that of another quaint cumulative 
song that she sometimes used.

CAPITALS AND THE NEW POETRY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
May one who is fond of the old-fashioned poets 
ask why the moderns, whose motto seems to be 
" Off with the old, on with the new," have not gone 
one step further in their crusade to free poetry 
from all the shackles of the past? Why have they 
not done away with the capitals at the beginning of 
the lines of their " vers libre " ? Is their reluc- 
tance to do this very consistent thing due to the 
fact that there is a lurking fear that their poetry 
may be mistaken for prose?

THE 'GENIUS OF SARAXAC.* 

So distasteful to Dr. Trudeau, " the beloved 
physician" of Saranac, was anything like 
personal fame or popular applause that the 
wonder is he could ever have been induced to 
write a book sure to add considerably to such 
measure of renown as he had hitherto been 
unable to escape. But his friends persuaded 
him that he owed it to the medical profession, 
to those afflicted as he himself so long had 
been, and to the world in general, to tell the 
story of his life and work ; and doubtless, too, 
the plan of withholding the book from pub- 
lication until after the writer's death helped 
appreciably to tone down for him the terrors 
of successful authorship. At any rate, we 
now have from his hand "An Autobiography," 
characteristically unpretentious in its title, 
but rich in human interest and almost as 
remarkable for what the discerning eye reads 
between the lines as in what those lines them- 
selves explicitly set forth. At the same time 
there comes from another hand, from a con- 
genial friend of the autobiographer and in 
some measure a fellow-sufferer with him, a 
short but vividly executed sketch of the man, 
under the title, "The Beloved Physician." 
Mr. Stephen Chalmers is the author, and 
what he has so appreciatively written about 
the founder of Saranac has already won 
approval in the "Atlantic." He now prefixes 
Dr. Trudeau's "last public utterance," an 
address on " The Value of Optimism in Medi- 
cine," written as he lay on a bed of suffering, 
and delivered before the Eighth Congress of 
American Physicians and Surgeons at Wash- 
ington, May 2, 1910, when the speaker's bod- 
ily condition hardly admitted of his standing 
up and going through the task. 

The chief external facts of the life now in 
some sense laid open to our view may be 
briefly related. Edward Livingston Trudeau, 
of French descent on both sides, and with 
physicians in both paternal and maternal 
branches of the family, was born in New York 
City, October 5, 1848, was taken to Paris in 
1851 by his mother and her father, returned 
to his native city soon after the Civil War 
ended, and became painfully aware, as he 
himself told his American girl cousins, to their 
undisguised amusement, that "ze English 
language is a very hard language to pro- 
nonciate." Much gaiety and even a mild

degree of dissipation seem to have marked this 
adolescent period of his life before he at last 
felt the hereditary prompting to the pursuit 
of medicine. Before that, however, among 
other abortive undertakings, he had started to 
train himself for the navy, being as he re- 
lates, "packed off to a preparatory school at 
Newport, as the Naval Academy and the old 
ship Constitution, on which the cadets lived, 
were then at Newport." Mr. Chalmers must 
be in error when he tells us, in this connec- 
tion, that an elder brother of Edward's " had 
preceded him to Annapolis." It was this 
elder brother, as both accounts inform us, who 
preceded the younger in contracting tubercu- 
losis and in succumbing, far more quickly 
than in Edward's case, to its inroads. Beau- 
tiful in their revelation of character are the 
words written by the autobiographer about 
this brother, and touching is the account of 
the young lad's devoted nursing of the pa- 
tient through the three months of his rapid 
decline to the final death-bed scene. Sacri- 
ficing his own plans and throwing up his 
appointment as midshipman, the junior 
brother gave what we now see to have been 
little short of his very life to ease the other's 
sufferings. He writes of this early victim to 
a disease then little understood: 

" From childhood he had been delicate, having a 
congenital heart trouble, and any over-exertion, 
excitement or fatigue caused his heart's action to 
become irregular and his nails and lips to turn blue. 
For this reason, though some years younger than he 
was, I had always cared for him and helped him 
and fought his battles with the French boys at 
school, who took advantage of his lack of strength 
to torment him. He, on the other hand, was a very 
strong, unselfish and beautiful character, deeply 
religious, and constantly trying to help me in the 
straight and narrow path from which I was apt to 
wander. . . . 

" My brother had a rapidly progressive type of 
tuberculosis and my time was soon entirely taken 
up in caring for his needs. We had no trained 
nurses in those days, and I took entire care of him 
from the time he was taken ill in September until 
he died on December 23, 1865. We occupied the 
same room and sometimes the same bed. I bathed 
him and brought his meals to him, and when he felt 
well enough to go downstairs I carried him up and 
down on my back, and I tried to amuse and cheer 
him through the long days of fever and sickness. 
. , . Not only did the doctor never advise any pre- 
cautions to protect me against infection, but he 
told me repeatedly never to open the windows, as it 
would aggravate the cough; and I never did, until 
toward the end my brother was so short of breath 
that he asked for fresh air." 

Such, then, was a significant part of the 
training of him who was ere long to become 
the pioneer in an earnest and intelligent

in 



effort to arrest if not overcome tuberculosis 
by the open-air treatment. His medical edu- 
cation for the work before him, though he 
knew not then what that work was to be, he 
secured at the College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons, in New York ; and after graduation in 
1871 he entered upon the practice of his pro- 
fession in the same city, with Dr. Fessenden 
Otis. "In the same year," as Mr. Chalmers 
records the facts, "unconscious that he was 
doomed to his brother's disease, he married 
Miss Charlotte Beare, of Douglaston, Long 
Island, to whom he ever attributed the inspir- 
ation of his labors through nearly half a 
century. The marriage was a perfect one, 
although attended by many sorrows. Three 
of their four children died. One son sur- 
vives Dr. Francis B. Trudeau. The death 
of Dr. Edward L. Trudeau, Jr., in 1906, was 
a great blow to his father and a loss to the 
medical profession." 

At the age of twenty-five, after repeated 
but unheeded warnings, Trudeau was amazed 
and for a moment stunned to hear himself 
doomed as a well-nigh hopeless case of tuber- 
culosis. How he pulled himself together, 
went into the Adirondacks against medical 
advice, repaired to an astonishing extent the 
ravages of his malady, taught the world from 
his mountain retreat how best to withstand 
that dreaded disease, and became the founder 
of a large open-air colony of health-seekers, is 
known to some extent, though the founder's 
name has, as he desired, escaped the trumpet- 
ing that would have been so little to his taste. 
Where it has been heard it has been received, 
for some curious reason, as the name of one 
who. long ago, perhaps in the Stevensonian 
era, did his work at Saranac and passed to 
his reward. That, on the contrary, he was a 
very much alive man up to last November, the 
books now relating his history make suffi- 
ciently evident. 

The foregoing reference to Stevenson will 
serve to introduce him as the most illustrious 
visitor to Saranac Lake and the valued friend 
of Saranac's presiding genius. Dr. Trudeau 
writes of him : 

" Mr. Stevenson was my patient, but as he was 
not really ill while here I had comparatively few 
professional calls to make on him. He was so 
attractive, however, in conversation that I found 
myself, as it was growing dark, very often seated 
by the big fireplace in the Baker cottage having a 
good talk with my illustrious patient." 

As the writer himself admits, there was 
little in his laboratory researches and profes- 
sional interests to appeal to the brilliant 
novelist : but there was a congeniality of tem- 
perament that made companionship agreeable. 



Mr. Chalmers concluded from what the doctor 
told him that " they agreed on so many of the 
greater things of life that they had to dis- 
agree about trivial matters for the sake of 
something to discuss. They actually got into 
heated argument over the great issue as to 
which was superior, the American system ,*>f 
transferring baggage, or the British method 
of handling luggage." Very characteristic was 
Stevenson's emphatic utterance after he had 
escorted an admiring lady visitor to the door 
and shut the latter rather forcibly upon her 
departure : " Trudeau, it is not the great 
unwashed whom I dread; it is the great 
washed ! " 

Of Trudeau's labors at Saranac, chiefly 
charitable and unremunerative labors, there 
is room to say but little here. Amazing is the 
amount of work he did in those strenuous 
years. It was enough to break down a strong 
man. and he was an invalid. He speaks of 
his waiting room, his piazza, and even the 
lawn as being filled with patients on many 
occasions when he returned home from some 
occupation elsewhere: and further: 

" The waiting room, which one lady always spoke 
of as my ' menagerie,' must have impressed others, 
for on going into the patients' cottages at the Sani- 
tarium one day I came across an excellent caricature 
of myself which a patient, the Reverend Mr. West- 
cott, a brother of the author of David Harum, had 
drawn. I was depicted sitting behind a high picket 
fence with a double-barreled shot-gun on my lap, 
waving back an excited crowd who were all shout- 
ing impossible questions at me about their health, 
while underneath was written, ' The Penalty of 
Fame!' The thing struck me as so funny that I 
begged it of him, and I still have it as a remem- 
brance of those strenuous office hours." 

Much of the wisdom that comes only from 
hard experience is reflected in Dr. Trudeau's 
pages. An intimate talk with him must have 
been something to remember. In the words 
taken down from his mouth by Mr. Chalmers 
there is much grim humor "the grim 
humor of grit," as his friend calls it. One 
day, toward the end, after assuring Mr. 
Chalmers that he was " not going to die right 
away," he added cheerfully, "No such luck!" 
His next remarks are worth quoting. 

" But what is the scheme of this business of 
lif e suffering death ? I do n't understand. It 
reminds me of the English ' Cat and Mouse ' bill 
for suffragists. They put a woman in a cell till 
she's near dead of starvation. Then they let her out 
for a square meal so she can get strength enough 
to suffer some more. You've got to have feeling, 
you know, to suffer. There's a philosophy, by the 
way, for those who fear the agony of death. As 
you lose the enduring powers of life, you lose also 
the sensibility to suffering. It must be so. It is so.

I have seen it many times. . . . Cat and mouse 
life and death. Death's the cat comes and paws 
until poor life is about dead to all feeling. Then 
the cat retires into a dark corner and purrs while 
the mouse gets a little life back, so as to be more 
sensible of suffering when the cat comes pawing 
again. I do n't say there's no reason behind it 
but I can't see it can you ? " 

There we have the man and his philosophy; 
and if the life-story of such a man, with its 
interspersed commentary on the significant 
occurrences in that life, is not well worth read- 
ing, where shall we find a book that is? 

PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



INTERPRETATIONS OF H.IT KRATURE.* 



Death has by no means put an end to the 
publication of writings by Laf cadio Hearn. His 
latest posthumous work, " Interpretations of 
Literature," comprising some eight hundred 
pages in two ponderous volumes, is calmly an- 
nounced by the editor, Professor John Erskine, 
to be merely initial. Material to the amount 
of 400,000 or 500,000 words is available : and 
will no doubt in due time, or undue time, be 
published in toto. This material is in the 
form of notes taken by students who attended 
Lafcadio Hearn's lectures while he held the 
chair of English literature in the TIniversitv 
of Tokyo (1896-1902) ; in lecturing, he "used 
no notes, but for the convenience of his class, 
who were listening to a foreign language, he 
dictated slowly, and certain of his abler stu- 
dents managed to take down long passages, 
whole lectures, even a series of lectures, word 
for word." 

As might be expected, the record of the lec- 
tures unfortunately reveals many traces of 
their impromptu presentation. Inconsisten- 
cies are common; exaggerations abound; 
commonplace statement of fact (common- 
place, that is, to the Occidental reader) causes 
many a page to be pedestrian, if not dull; 
occasionally the lecturer blunders upon a 
term, like "sheet-lightning," which must be 
laboriously explained to an audience unfamil- | 
iar with it; here and there the style is far 
from typical of Hearn, as in this sentence, 
apparently a definition of Wordsworth: j 
"Wordsworth was a man who composed ! 
nearly all of his shorter poems standing up." 
In brief, these lectures are decidedly ragged, 
and would have been a dismal nightmare to 
Hearn if he, with his love of finish, had had 
an opportunity to see them. When advised 
to print his lectures, he responded that they 
were too lacking in form: "Were I to re-

write each of them ten or fifteen times, I 
might print them. But that would not be 
worth while." Hearn then goes on to dis- 
parage himself in terms as exaggerated as 
those in Professor Erskine's praise of him : 
" I am not a scholar, nor a competent critic 
of the best ; there are scores of men able to do 
the same thing incomparably better. . . I have 
not the scholarship needed for the develop- 
ment and exercise of the critical faculty, in 
the proper sense of the term." On the other 
hand. Professor Erskine is bold enough to 
assert of these lectures : " In substance if not 
in form they are criticism of the finest kind, 
unmatched in English unless we return to the 
best of Coleridge, and in some ways un- 
equalled by anything in Coleridge." 

Both of these wholesale utterances surely 
need radical modification ; the truth lies, as 
one might expect, in that golden mean which 
Hearn decried. So far as Hearn's estimate of 
himself is concerned, it is clear that he under- 
rated his scholarship, and overrated in gen- 
eral the need of wide scholarship in the kind 
of writing congenial to him. As for Professor 
Erskine's estimate, it is difficult to see, from 
these " initial " eight hundred pages, how 
Coleridge's reputation as a critic is in any 
respect to be eclipsed by Hearn's. To some 
extent, this disagreement between Hearn and 
his editor is apparently due to a difference in 
the use of the term " criticism." When Hearn 
speaks of " the critical faculty, in the proper 
sense of the term," he perhaps thinks of criti- 
cism primarily as judgment certainly that 
/x "the proper sense of the term." However 
responsive in sensibility, Hearn very likely 
felt that he did not know enough to be a good 
judge of literature. But to Professor Erskine. 
criticism apparently is an account of " the 
effect of the writing upon the reader"; it is 
a " showing you what is waiting there to be 
seen"; it is, in a word, not judgment, but 
interpretation. 

This brings us to the central quarrel 
among the critics of literature should the 
first aim of the critic be to interpret or to 
judge? a quarrel by no means in a way to 
be settled soon, or to be renewed at length 
here. It will suffice, in this connection, to 
point out that as a judge of literature Hearn 
is by no means distinguished. Aside from 
not very remarkable specific assertions, such 
as his designation of Stevenson as " one of 
the finest masters of style in all English lit- 
erature," or his conclusion that, in compari- 
son with Tennyson, Arnold was " not a great 
thinker or a profound poet," or his astonish- 
ing dictum that the poetry of Coleridge is

" such poetry that there is nothing greater in 
English past or present, and can scarcely be 
anything greater in the English of the 
future" (are the transcribers of Ream's lec- 
tures perchance at fault here?), an entire 
lecture like the one " On Romantic and Clas- 
sic Literature, in Relation to Style " is a clear 
indication of Hearn's all but complete lack of 
the poise and disinterestedness of the mind 
that judges ably. This is how he seeks "to 
define the romantic position " : 4< It is right 
and artistic to choose whatever form of lit- 
erary expression an author may prefer, pro- 
vided only that the form be beautiful and 
correct." We need not make much of the odd 
implication that what is beautiful is artistic : 
but what of the word correct? What decides 
whether the form be correct? Is not that a 
tacit confession of the need of a standard 
other than the one proposed in the definition 
itself? He proceeds to contrast with this 
meaningless definition a definition of classi- 
cism that does violence to pseudo-classicism 
even, which, indeed, and not classicism, he is 
trying to define: 

" You have no right whatever to choose your 
own forms of literary expression, either in poetry 
or in prose. Experience has proved that the forms 
which we prescribe are the best, and whatever you 
have to say must be said according to our rules. 
If you do not obey those rules, you will be inflict- 
ing an injury upon your native language and your 
native literature; and for such an injury you can- 
not be forgiven." 

Elsewhere, in a lecture on Keats, he de- 
scribed the genuine classic style: 

" Well, in the mind of the old Greeks, who saw 
great truths perfectly, the beauty of utterance 
consisted in expressing the largest truth in the 
most direct and frank way, and in language that a 
child could understand." 

Toward the end of the lecture on the two 
schools, the critic, with unconscious legerde- 
main, reaches some curious conclusions. He 
is attempting the futile task of proving the 
superiority of the Romantic school by show- 
ing how abundant great Romantic literature 
is. " Out of all the glorious names on the 
roll of European [as contrasted with Orien- 
tal] literature you will find that the vast 
majority are names of romanticists." He 
does not name them, but says he " might cite 
fifty names by way of illustration/' Fifty 
would be wearisome, but let us name for him 
a few (the very greatest) of these redun- 
dantly numerous '' romanticists " : in Greece, 
Homer and Sophocles; in Italy. Virgil. Hor- 
ace, and Dante: in France, Racine and Mo- 
liere; in Germany. Goethe: in England. 
Shakespeare and Milton. This fine showing 



is to be explained by the fact that the Classic 
school, championing impersonality, is moving 
in the wrong direction,, while the Romantic 
school, championing personality, naturally 
achieves genius (for " Personality, in its high- 
est forms, signifies Genius"). Hearn goes on 
to illustrate the superiority of Romanticism 
by remarking that in nineteenth century En- 
glish literature there is not a single Classic 
writer of importance: significant, surely, in 
a Romantic century, when even Romanticism 
did not produce a poet of the first rank ! 

Distinction as a judge of literature is 
surely not to be attained by a mind that 
moves in these mysterious ways. But another 
distinction Lafcadio Hearn as surely had, 
he was an illuminating teacher. He showed 
infinite skill in presenting Western thought 
and emotion to an Eastern audience, a skill 
that might be illustrated at length. It is 
another and more essential skill, however, 
that justifies the publication of these volumes, 
the presentation of literary thought and 
emotion in such a manner that the meaning 
of the text, or the coherence of the poet's 
life, is revealed to the reader far more clearly 
than before. The title of the work is appro- 
priate-, these lectures are truly interpreta- 
tions of literature. Professor Erskine rightly 
characterizes Hearn's ideal of the teaching of 
literature as " rare and beautiful " : that ideal 
being, in Hearn's words, to teach literature 
" as the expression of emotion and sentiment. 
as the representation of life. In consider- 
ing a poet I tried to explain the quality and 
the powers of the emotion he produces." Al- 
though the intellectual point of view is un- 
happily slighted in this ideal, it is surely a 
" rare and beautiful " ideal in comparison 
with that which still dominates in the histori- 
cal, scientific, Germanized departments of 
literature in the American university; though 
the present world earthquake is already caus- 
ing signs of a change in the minds and 
bosoms of Productive Scholarship. The fol- 
lowing, from a " Note on the Study of Shake- 
speare," though not without Hearn's romantio 
twist, is salutary advice for the secondary- 
school teachers of our day. even for university 
teachers : 

" The study of Shakespeare . . must be based 
upon imagination. I mean that the best way to 
study a play of Shakespeare is to try to under- 
stand perfectly, not the language, which is often a 
matter of very secondary' importance, but the situ- 
ations. . . To approach Shakespeare, the student 
ought first to get rid of the idea he is about to 
study a monument of language. . . The style and 
the language of Shakespeare are the least impor- 
tant part of his creations, while in the other poets 



114

they form, the most important part. . . And so it 
were better that in reading Shakespeare you should 
begin by paying least attention to the language 
and most attention to the action or, to be more 
explicit, the living incident of the plays." 

"Imagination," "the living incident of the 
plays," these are, as every teacher knows in 
his heart, central in the study of Shakespeare 
and many another poet, and not Sources, 
Elizabethan English, the Elizabethan Stage, 
Elizabethan London, Elizabethan Manners, 
and all the other backgrounds and fore- 
grounds and sidegrounds that distract atten- 
tion from the centre. 

The foregoing discussion hardly suggests 
the range of subjects embraced in these lec- 
tures. The first volume is mainly a nine- 
teenth century selection, containing lectures 
on Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Keats, 
Shelley, Hood, Carlyle, Writers of Prose Fic- 
tion, Meredith, etc., (with a separate index 
for the volume). Volume II is a miscella- 
neous collection, the Bible, Ballads, Berke- 
ley, Longfellow, the Havamal, Poems about 
Insects, etc. A single illustration of Hearn's 
mode of treatment in discussing a particular 
poem must serve. In the lecture on Words- 
worth, after a few words on flowers in En- 
glish poetry, " The Daffodils " is printed 
entire ; then comes this passage, in which the 
meaning is surely brought home to a mind 
previously unresponsive : 

" The daffodil is a bright yellow flower, and a 
bed of daffodils in blossom really produces such a 
blaze of color as would remind a Japanese traveller 
of the blossoming of the Natane in some parts of 
this country. The effect described by the poet 
must have been greatly enhanced by the proximity 
of the dancing lake-water beyond the flowers, 
bright blue under the sun. You know what a fine 
contrast is made by the meeting of blue and yel- 
low. This is a bit of painting from the English 
lakes. But the point of the poem, written nearly 
one hundred years ago, is not in the description; 
it comes, like a surprise, with the last stanza. 
Have you ever noticed what the effect of certain 
bright scenes may be upon your own senses? It is 
at night particularly that the phenomenon may be 
studied. You blow out the lamp and lie down to 
sleep, and close your eyes; then, all at once, in 
the dark you see in bright sunshine some incident 
that impressed you during the day. Perhaps it is 
a street, with people passing by, and children play- 
ing; and perhaps it is the face of a friend with 
whom you have been talking. Or it is a scene of 
travelling, a stretch of sea beach, with waves 
breaking silently. This may come to you again 
and again come to you also in dreams, and you 
will never entirely forget it. I am told that old 
persons see these after-images more clearly than 
young persons; but everybody sees them at times. 
This is more than what is commonly called imagi- 



nation or memory; perhaps we might call it per- 
fected visual memory. It may be pleasant or 
unpleasant. But if the experience thus recalled 
be of a happy and beautiful kind, a visual memory 
is accompanied by the revival of the same happy 
feeling. 

" It is so in the poet's case. He felt more than 
common pleasure in the sight of the yellow flowers 
swaying in the summer breeze beside the sunlit 
water; and afterwards, whenever the picture re- 
turned to his memory, he felt the joy of the 
moment again the happiness of the season, and 
of the sunlight and of the bright air, all of which 
seem to him expressed by the l dancing ' of the 
yellow flowers. One expression in the last stanza 
I hope you will remember, as it is now very 
famous ' that inward eye which is the bliss of 
solitude.' Of course the poet means, by ' inward 
eye,' the faculty of imagination; and imagination 
indeed makes the pleasure of solitude that is, 
enables its possessor to be happy in spite of being 

a one ' NORMAN FOERSTER. 



"PASSAGE TO MORE THAN INDIA."* 

When a book on anything concerned with 
India is described on the title-page as "a 
traveller's record," a reviewer is likely to be 
distrustful. But he must remember that there 
are travellers and travellers; and in the case 
of Dr. Pratt's " India and Its Faiths." he 
must finally adjudge the words both modest 
and significant. One of the delights of faring 
about the "multanimous peninsula" is the 
willingness of the native and the resident 
alien to talk helpfully, if you are genuinely 
and intelligently interested; but not less 
striking is their capacity for turning the cold- 
est of cold shoulders, if you are just " globe- 
trottingly" and superficially inquisitive. 
Fortunately for himself and his readers, Dr. 
Pratt belonged to the former type of ques- 
tioner, being most generously equipped before 
he landed; and he evidently utilized every 
moment of a rich and active visit to correct 
his impressions and broaden his knowledge. 
His training in the problems of psychology 
and religion (he is professor of philosophy in 
Williams College) made an admirable propae- 
deutic for his investigations in India; and he 
has given us a thoughtful book, that is schol- 
arly with no tinge of pedantry, and is un- 
marred by the intolerance of the old-time 
missionary zealot on the one hand, or the love- 
blinded enthusiasm of such thoroughgoing 
converts as Sister Nivedita on the other. He 
still believes in the superiority of Christianity 
as a working religion, and in the West as 
opening more useful doors on the future ; but

he believes this only in spirit of one who has 
seen India and its people with wise and 
kindly eyes: 

" It is hard for me to conceive how one can stay 
anytime among them without finding them truly 
lovable and without imbibing a genuine respect for 
the simple dignity of their lives, the quiet courtesy 
of their manners, their uncomplaining endurance 
of hardships, their unbounded hospitality, and the 
feeling for spiritual values, which, in spite of gross 
superstition, is unmistakable in the Indian atmos- 
phere." 

For the monotheistic or agnostic Occiden- 
tal, the easiest approach to a study of Indian 
religions would seem to lie through Moham- 
medanism. Of course the followers of the 
prophet number only some sixty-seven mil- 
lions, about a fifth of the population; but 
their faith is fairly familiar to us all, and at 
the same time it has been so influenced by its 
sojourn in India as to offer a tiny bit of help 
in making the transition to Hinduism. 

One feature of Mohammedanism that is 
always interesting, the problem of predestina- 
tion, receives its full share of attention from 
our author. He reports that both the learned 
theologian and the ordinary tradesman in- 
sisted stoutly on their belief in the freedom 
of the will, and he adduces the following 
conversation as typical: 

" Question. ' Does everything happen in ac- 
cordance with God's will, so that nothing is done 
anywhere in the universe which He does not 
decree ? ' 

"Answer. 'Yes, everything that happens and 
everything that is done by man or by anyone else 
is in accord with God's will.' 

" Q. ' When a man sins, then, it is God that 
makes him sin ? ' 

" A. '-Oh, no, not at all. God never wills sin.' 

" Q. ' How do you reconcile this with your for- 
mer statement?' 

"A. 'You see, man's power to sin, as man's 
power for all his actions, comes from God. But 
man's choice of sin is his own and is against the 
will of God. God is displeased at sin.' 

" Q. ' Then man's will is free? ' 

" A. ' Oh, yes.' 

" Q. ' Then some things do happen that are not 
in accordance with God's will? ' 

"A. 'Yes.'" 

But it must be remembered that a discussion 
of God's possible responsibility for sin 
trenches on very delicate and difficult ground ; 
and we respectfully believe that the Indian 
Moslem is much more of a fatalist than such 
a conversation might imply. When a Moham- 
medan trader concludes his bartering with 
you by making the simple dignified asser- 
tion, "If it is destined that I sell you the 
wares, I shall sell you the wares," he is 
speaking much more naturally and signifi- 



cantly than when he has been deliberately 
engaged in a discussion of predestination as 
connected with God's responsibility for sin; 
and we believe that Dr. Pratt's conclusion as 
to the popular belief in free will would have 
been modified by a wider and less formal 

| investigation. 

As an example of the changes effected in 

| Mohammedanism by its alien surroundings, 

I we may mention the greater tolerance of 
the Indian Moslemite, as compared with his 
Arab or Turkish co-religionist. This differ- 
ence is very marked; and Dr. Pratt was 
naturally astonished when he was asked not 
only to attend the Friday service at Benares 
and kneel with the faithful during prayers, 
but also to make an address in the mosque 
at the conclusion of the ceremonies. But the 
influence we have in mind is seen in its 
extreme form in the coloring of popular 
Mohammedanism by Hinduism in very many 
districts. This coloring is touched upon by 
Dr. Pratt in passing ; but it is deeply signifi- 
cant for historian and philosopher alike, and 
deserves more extended notice. It is impos- 

| sible to give exact figures; but one might 
almost talk of millions of Indian Moslems 
who are to be distinguished from Hindus for 
the most part in name only. They join their 
Hindu fellows cheerfully in all sorts of relig- 
ious festivals, share piously their idolatrous 
rites, and feel much more at home with the 
kindly Ganesh than with the solitary and 
distant Allah. Hinduism is incredibly ab- 
sorbent on its native ground. 

When the honest student passes from 
Mohammedanism to Hinduism, he passes 
from the difficult to the desperate. Let any 
intelligent inquirer converse with a venerable 
pundit about the realization of the self in 
divine love, and go next morning to the reek- 
ing sacrificial services at the Kalighat shrine. 
Let him read the transcendent teachings of 

j Rabindranath Tagore, and then turn to such 
a book as Thurston's " Omens and Supersti- 
tions of Southern India," or to some of the 
unblinking pages in the invaluable "Hindu 
Manners, Customs, and Ceremonies" of the 
Abbe Dubois. Let him ponder the higher 
aspects of the doctrine of transmigration, 
and then consider the more repugnant and 
terrible features of child marriage. All glib 
conclusions and ambitious formulae seem 
strangely pitiable. Nor does our author dis- 
guise the difficulty. Throughout six rather 
long chapters he does all one can to give an 
impartial treatment of the subjects indi- 
cated or implied by such captions as " Hindu 
Worship," "The Many Gods," "The One 
God," "Duty and Destiny," "The Hindu

Dharma," and " Teachers, Priests, and Holy 
Men." And on the whole his achievement 
is distinctly praiseworthy, the chapters be- 
ing replete with sound information and sane 
judgments. 

Naturally, there is no single clue to this 
colossal labyrinth; but Dr. Pratt comes as 
near to giving one as is possible by dwelling 
on the Hindu belief in the soul. " Hindus 
are sure of the soul. There is nothing else 
they are so sure of." "Underneath all the 
strange noises of Hinduism, like the distant 
murmur of the sea, there sounds ever the far- 
off music of the soul." And it is some con- 
cern about this great practical reality, the 
soul, that connects Shankara's Brahman, the 
spiritual unity back of all phenomena, with 
the thirty-three million gods, or godlings, of 
the official figures. The average Hindu be- 
lieves very simply that there are many gods. 
Very many Hindus would say there are many 
gods but there is also one God, without feel- 
ing any necessity to reconcile his statements. 
Not a few would say the same thing, and 
offer a reconciliation, convincing or not ; and 
some would say there is only one God. And 
within these countless millions you would 
have every range of attitude from the most 
degrading devil worship to the most exalted 
spiritual monotheism, every sort of conduct 
from the grossest animal indulgence to the 
most self -immolating asceticism; and every 
individual considered might rightly lay un- 
hesitating claim to the name of Hindu. It is 
easy to write that the life of the Hindu is 
essentially a religious life, not merely a life 
that is superstitious or filled with pious per- 
formances, but, more than that, a life lived 
in unfailing realization of relations that bind 
human life to a supernatural world. But 
when you have said this, you have still an 
infinity of gradations to take into account, 
and you must not rest in the deceptive com- 
fort of an alluring definition. 

The fact is simply that Hinduism refuses 
to be generalized. It must be taken step by 
step, point by point, and, save in the highest 
spheres, one is often confronted with the fact 
that what seemed a religious philosophy turns j 
out to be an unreasoning system of caste, j 
And therewith one is launched again on a \ 
vast and treacherous ocean. Dr. Pratt writes j 
optimistically : " Nearly everyone who knows 
anything at all about India knows about 
caste, so little need be said of it here." But 
the people who know caste are rare indeed, 
although you encounter it at every turn in 
Hindu life and religion. However, we may i 
not follow this tempting theme any further, j 
and must merely repeat the old warning, ! 



" Whoso seeketh a work on Hinduism that sat- 
isfieth, seeketh forever in vain ; yet whoso once 
beginneth the search will never be satisfied 
uutil he hath found such an one." In the 
meantime Dr. Pratt's volume offers a sane, 
useful, and stimulating treatment of the more 
salient features. 

Over the remaining chapters we must pass 
without discussion. They bear such headings 
as " Reform Movements within Hinduism," 
"The Kabir Panthis and the Sikhs," "The 
Parsees," " Christian Missions in India," 
" Education and Reform." It is particularly 
hard to refrain from a word or two about 
Buddhism, and about the possible lessons for 
America in Indian religion and philosophy. 
To us the chapter on " What the West Might 
Learn " does not correspond to the expecta- 
tions aroused in turning to it after the other 
sections of the book; but fortunately it is a 
subject on which each reader will be prepared 
to form his own conclusions. 

Inasmuch as we have commended the book 
so warmly, even if we have ventured to differ 
about some not unimportant points, we shall 
not be misunderstood if we voice a protest on 
a few details. For instance, there is an occa- 
sional infelicitous flippancy, as in the quota- 
tion from a friend who spoke of the goddess 
Kali as "a kind of militant suffragette." 
Such a statement merely distracts the mind 
and befogs the discussion. Again, a man who 
wantonly shoots ducks that cannot possibly be 
retrieved is not " surely a very typical prod- 
uct of our Western culture with its love of 
self-assertion and its cult of sport." There 
is hot a good sportsman in England or Amer- 
ica who would not brand such wanton slaugh- 
ter as the work of a cad. Furthermore, it 
seems to us that Dr. Pratt is generally just a 
little hard on the Britisher in India ; but that 
is a large subject. Indian life is not all meta- 
physics and hospitality. As a criticism of a 
different type, one may regret that the author 
did not include a brief account of several of 
the primitive religions so richly represented 
among the less civilized outlying tribes. Of 
course these represent a rather remote part of 
the field for the general reader ; but they are 
interesting and surprisingly instructive. 

The book is well printed, contains twenty- 
four good illustrations, and is appropriately 
bound. On page 57 mention is made of a 
picture of Krishna on the cover; but the 
actual cover shows the delightful lines of the 
Taj Mahal. In a second edition, which we 
hope will be demanded very soon, a few statis- 
tical tables might well be inserted before the 
helpful index.

INTELLIGENCE AS A MORAL OBLIGATION.* 

Seldom does it fall to the lot of a reviewer 
to open a book upon which he finds it impossi- 
ble to bestow anything but unqualified praise, 
and such a rare experience tends to paralyze 
that critical faculty the exercise of which he 
has accustomed himself to regard as his dis- 
tinctive privilege. It is therefore not without 
a sense of strangeness that we frankly aban- 
don the customary attitude of criticism, and 
adopt that of grateful acceptance, inviting all 
who enjoy good things to share with us the 
pleasure and profit to be derived from the 
reading of " The Moral Obligation to Be 
Intelligent." by Dr. John Erskine of Colum- 
bia University. 

The book takes its name from the first of 
the four essays of which it is composed, the 
other three bearing the titles. " The Call to 
Service," " The Mind of Shakespere." and 
" Wonder and Magic in Literature." Many 
readers of " The Hibbert Journal " will recall 
with pleasure the appearance in its pages, 
about two years ago, of the titular essay re- 
ferred to. Its timeliness and its appropriate- 
ness to the needs of an age that is conspicuous 
for its lack of forethought and its empiri- 
cal habit of " muddling through," must have 
struck many of its readers at that time. Its, 
excellent literary quality, too, was such as we 
do not expect and do not frequently find in 
magazine articles, and it is therefore with 
peculiar pleasure that we welcome its re- 
publication in book form, and the more so 
that it is re-enforced by three other papers of 
fqual quality. 

A volume of " collected essays " cannot usu- 
ally be regarded homogeneously, or thought 
of otherwise than as what it is, an assemblage 
for convenience in publication of separate 
literary efforts. In these four articles, how- 
ever, a distinct thread of connection is to be 
discovered, a unity of aim and purpose, a 
similarity of direction and a kinship of spirit 
which it is hard to describe. The connecting 
thread is the author's conviction indicated in 
the title of the book that the duty lies upon 
men not only to acquire that culture which 
consists in a refinement of the emotions, but ta 
bring the power of the understanding to bear 
upon all the problems of life. We shall prob- 
ably be reminded that what we chiefly suffer 
from in these days is over-intellectualism, and 
that the present reaction in speculative think- 
ing toward intuitionalism and pragmatism is 
the inevitable consequence of having laid 
undue emphasis on the idea of mastering the

problems of ontology by the aid of the under- 
standing. It may be true that in the region 
of pure speculation the instrument of reason 
has been used for a purpose to which- it is 
unsuited, and that the effort to transcend the 
finite and comprehend the infinite by means 
of the intelligence alone is but another of 
those fruitless attempts to answer the old 
question stated by Job in the words. "Who 
shall find out the Almighty to perfection? 
It is higher than Heaven, deeper than Hell, 
what canst thou know?" But to recognize 
the limits beyond which the intellect, when it 
leaves the atmosphere of human experience, 
must attempt to soar in a vacuum, is not to 
deny it its rightful uses within these limits. 
It is as a necessary part of our equipment for 
the art of practical living that Dr. Erskine 
lodges his claim for a deeper recognition of 
intelligence as among the cardinal virtues. 

It is undoubtedly true that our poets and 
writers of fiction, and those teachers and 
preachers on whom we have relied for 
guidance in the conduct of life, have not suffi- 
ciently emphasized the need for an intelli- 
gent apprehension of the causal relations of 
things. We have been warned by Solomon 
that " Out of the heart are the issues of life," 
by Tennyson that " Knowledge must know 
her place, she is the second not the first." by 
Browning that "All else but what man feels 
is but the froth o' the liquor that o'er-brims 
the cup and runs to waste adown its side." by 
Burns that " the heart's aye the part aye that 
maks us richt or wrang." It has been so 
hammered into our consciousness that to be 
good is better than to be clever, that the 
divine gift^of reason has to some extent fallen 
into disrespect. But here we must feel our 
way carefully. The universal conviction of 
the best of men that the Tightness of the heart 
and the possession of those virtues that'right- 
heartedness implies are of primary impor- 
tance, must not be lightly put aside. A man 
may be full of errors of the head, his knowl- 
edge may be of the most limited description, 
and his reasoning powers those of a child: 
yet if his heart is sound, his instincts pure, 
and his affections deep, we unhesitatingly 
(and we believe rightly) place him among the 
masters in the difficult art of living. To 
retain this conviction that character comes 
before intelligence, and yet to recognize the 
obligation that, the possession of character 
imposes upon its possessor to develop his in- 
telligence to the highest degree, this is the 
moral contained in the first essay of Dr. 
Erskine's book. " He that sinneth against his 
understanding wrongeth his own soul."

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 3 



Emmanuel Swedenborg, in his interpreta- 
tion of the doctrine of the Trinity in terms of 
human psychology, affirms that Love, Feel- 
ing, or Emotion represents the primary force 
of the Universe, the ESSE of Being; but 
that only when that Esse was incarnated in 
the form of Truth, Wisdom, or Intelligence, 
and became the EXISTERE of Being, could 
there have been generated an effluent force 
(the Holy Ghost) equal to the task of raising 
life from its low estate to that high one which 
"doth not yet appear" but toward which we 
believe we are moving. This interpretation, 
it will be observed, gives Love the primary 
place among our conceptions of spiritual 
origins, but imposes upon Love the necessity 
of embodying or objectifying itself in Truth 
or Wisdom, the Word had to be made flesh 
and to dwell among men. In this way we 
would interpret Dr. Erskine's warning. We 
are not merely to rest in the consciousness 
that the Eternal arms are around us, that we 
are being carried on a stream of tendency 
toward righteousness, that we are doomed to 
perfection by an irresistible evolutionary 
law; but we must consciously become part- 
ners in the redemptive process, we must not 
only add to our faith virtue but to our virtue 
knowledge, we must acquire skill in the use 
of that instrument by which alone virtue can 
effectively express itself, Intelligence. We 
forfeit the right to justify our errors by the 
reflection that we have walked humbly ac- 
cording to our lights, if we have failed to 
inquire whether the light that is in us is not 
darkness. To "trust in God and do the 
right" is a useful working principle only if 
we have intelligently endeavored to discover 
what the " right " is. 

But Dr. Erskine's charge against the old 
Anglo-Saxon way of viewing life is not 
merely the negative one of failing to realize 
the importance of intelligence, or to give it 
its place as among the cardinal virtues. He 
charges us, and not without reason, with hav- 
ing regarded the intellect with suspicion as 
a peril and a snare ; with having assumed that j 
a choice must be made between goodness and j 
intelligence; "that stupidity is first cousin 
to moral conduct and cleverness the first step 
to mischief." It is not difficult to find proof 
of the justice of this charge in the constant 
dissociation of goodness and understanding 
that is reflected in our literature and social 
standards. Mephistopheles is invariably rep- 
resented as the embodiment of pure intellect, j 
while the biographies of saints and philan- 
thropists are for the most part pictures of 
glowing souls radiating heat without light, 
feeling without understanding, emotion with- 



out intelligence. This over-emphasis upon 
character as against intelligence shows itself 
especially in our fruitless attempts to solve 
social problems by mere force of good will,- 
problems in economics, for example, in which 
(human welfare being the end aimed at) it is 
assumed that kindly feeling and noble enthu- 
siasm are the only instruments necessary for 
the solution. An attitude of kindly contempt 
expressing itself in such words as " doctri- 
naire" or "theorist" is maintained toward 
those who approach such problems from the 
side of the intellect, whose aim it is to attain 
to an understanding of fundamental things, 
and to deal with causes rather than symp- 
toms. 

And it is strange, indeed, that to a prob- 
lem in engineering we bring all the knowledge 
of scientific principles that intelligence can 
discover ; to produce commodities cheaply we 
develop our inventive and creative powers to 
the highest degree ; but that in attempting to 
solve the great problem of human living- 
together in relations of justice and equity, 
we forget that here, too, active intelligence is 
the virtue which gives whatever value they 
possess to all those other virtues that have 
moved us to action. 

In Dr. Erskine's Commencement address 
entitled " The Call to Service," the same de- 
mand is made upon the student beginning his 
life's career, to break away from the cus- 
tomary attitude which eager young minds so 
readily adopt in conceiving of the places they 
are called upon to fill in the economy of 
things, and to bring the whole force of the 
intelligence to bear upon the ultimate pur- 
pose for which he has been trained. Here, 
again, the appeal for a broader and more 
comprehensive conception of the ultimate 
goal toward which human culture strives, or 
should be striving, implies a draft upon the 
higher intelligence. It is only too easily 
assumed that those who serve and those who 
are to be served constitute two separate 
classes whom God hath put asunder and 
whom man may not join without disrespect 
to the Divine Purpose. The attitude of mind 
in which those stand who are called to serve 
the world as preachers, scientists, or teachers, 
toward the great mass of somewhat unwilling 
recipients of those services, is of the most 
vital importance. If that attitude is wrong, 
as it is so likely to be, it can only be made 
right by an active use of the intelligence, 
by rising above personal enthusiasms and 
ambitions, however noble, and obtaining a 
glimpse of the ultimate end toward which the 
whole creation moves, as seen by a God who 
is no respecter of persons, but who loves the 



1916] 



humblest day-drudge equally with the most 
gifted savant. 

The questions which Dr. Erskine addresses 
to his students are most well-timed, and we | 
indulge the hope that in the attempt to find 
answers to them many of our young men may 
have had their reflective faculties aroused, 
and been compelled to take such new sound- 
ings and bearings as may change perma- 
nently the course they are to steer in the 
voyage to which every commencement address 
is a cheering send-off. It can do our future 
snides and philosophers nothing but good if 
they are impelled to such heart-searching as 
must be stimulated by the questions, " Do you 
hope to cure your neighbour's misfortune or 
merely to live by it ? " " Do you look on the 
unfortunate as your brothers in temporary 
distress, or do you see in them objects of char- 
ity ? " " Do you think your function is to 
serve and their function to be served; and 
if by a miracle they should get on their feet, 
would you have lost your career?" Nor is 
the author less definite in his arraignment of 
the professors of Science and Teaching, or of 
those who propose to serve by making them- 
selves the repositories of learning and wis- 
dom. Not only, he indicates, should the 
ultimate purpose of a priesthood be to make a 
nation of priests, and to prepare the way for 
a condition in which a priesthood will be 
unnecessary, but this should be the conscious 
aim of all who serve, in whatever capacity. 
So long as the gulf separating the servers 
from the served- is conceived of as being or- 
ganic and in the nature of things, the service 
can never be of spiritual benefit to either 
giver or receiver. After warning his theologi- 
cal students of the delusion that "a system 
of superiorities and inferiorities is vital to 
the religious life," or even that a certain 
superiority of consecration attaches to the 
office of priest, he addresses himself in sim- 
ilar words to his scientific students. "You," 
he says, "can no more be scientific for your 
neighbors than you can be holy for them. 
Scientists are as eager to do our thinking for 
us as ever the Church has been ; they are just 
as ready to use force to make effective the 
truth as they see it, and they keep the scien- 
tific spirit to themselves as effectively as the 
priests keep their priesthood." 

The third essay. "The Mind of Shake- 
spere," is peculiarly refreshing to one who 
has just read Dr. Tannenbaum's excellent re- 
view (in THE DIAL of Dec. 9) of Mr. J. P. 
Baxter's book on the time-worn Bacon-Shake- 
speare controversy. From the account which 
the reviewer gives of the author's tortuous 
attempts to deal with the apparent incon- 



gruity between the Shakespearean plays and 
the character and circumstances of their re- 
puted creator, it is a pleasure to turn to Dr. 
Erskine's essay, where the strange phenome- 
non which the mind of Shakespeare presents 
to the psychologist is discussed in a manner 
which does no violence to our sense of proba- 
bility and accords with what we know of the 
constitution of the human mind. " Can we 
not imagine." he asks, " a grown person with 
whom for the most part expression has re- 
mained an instantaneous reflex of experience, 
who sees true habitually as we less child-like 
folk do occasionally, and who speaks so spon- 
taneously that he takes no account of his 
utterances ? " Here is suggested the idea of 
a sort of short-circuiting of the current which 
connects perception and expression, in which 
consciousness and intention are left out. 
"The clearness of vision and the immediate- 
ness and accuracy of expression." which are 
so conspicuous in the best of Shakespeare's 
work, are certainly more explicable on this 
theory of direct connection between the per- 
ceptive and the expressive faculties, than 
where the surface-consciousness, as with ordi- 
nary mortals, must take a hand in the transac- 
tion. If this theory seems to make of the 
poet an unconscious automaton, Dr. Erskine 
accepts the risk of that conclusion with a bold- 
ness which we admire. 

In the fourth and last essay, Dr. Erskine 
reminds us that we have not yet so completely 
escaped from the dominion of superstition, 
and the child-like belief in magic and won- 
der, as we like to persuade ourselves. We 
have told ourselves so frequently that we now 
live in a world of cause and effect, and that 
the spirits with whom our fathers lived on 
terms of familiarity have been finally ban- 
ished from the earth, that we firmly believe 
it. In spite of this, we exhibit the remains 
of our old faith in magic and miracle in many 
ways. "We have as yet gained far less con- 
trol of experience than our intellectual self- 
respect demands. We still blunder through 
life as though we did not know that the great 
game must be played according to rules." 
We still believe, Micawber-like. in things 
" turning up." We have not made the prog- 
ress in the scientific habit of mind that the 
passing of the years and the amassing of 
experience ought to have produced. We still 
love to think that miracles happen, that un- 
caused good-luck befalls the virtuous though 
incompetent person, and the literary fiction 
that reflects the persistence of this primitive 
superstition still attracts us. And the diffi- 
culty is. as Dr. Erskine points out, that we 
cannot, and should not if we could, entirely 



120 



THE DIAL 



[ Feb. 3 



banish this ancient habit of mind. "If we 
love the poetry of life, there is a sense in 
which we cannot get along without miracles; 
without them as a language to talk with we 
cannot express that profound wonder at com- 
mon facts which is the sign of enlightened 
manhood." The difficulty with most of us is 
to preserve this love of the miraculous, 
wedded as it is to that faculty of wonder 
which keeps the imagination alive, and yet to 
detect the thimble-rigging by which some of 
our writers would delude us into the belief 
that the laws of consequence are occasionally 
out of action. The danger of falling under 
this delusion is finely indicated in the follow- 
ing passage : 

" We are convinced that to be a professional 
crook will lead to moral deterioration, but we read 
with pleasure these fables which keep the soul of 
the crook unspotted from his own conduct. Our 
pleasure is based on a fine humaneness, on the 
undoubted fact that criminals are largely manu- 
factured, and that few of them are originally bad 
at heart. But thjs doctrine, excellent as a vantage- 
point from which to enter upon some social respon- 
sibility and rescue, has been stretched in our fiction 
until it misrepresents the consequences of wrong- 
doing, and even diminishes strangely enough that 
sense of social responsibility from which it sprang. 
We felt to blame for letting our fellow-man 
become a criminal, but after the story or the play 
has demonstrated how excellently moral the crim- 
inal is, we feel less guilty." 

Here, again, the moral contained in the title 
of this book returns to us, and we realize the 
imperative need for the constant watchful 
play of the intelligence upon all our mental 
and emotional processes. In the words quoted 
from Emerson, " The beginning of power is 
in the belief that things go not by luck but

COSMIC; SYSTEMS AND PHILOSOPHICAL 
IMAGINATION.* 



Philosophy, I have had occasion more than 
once to point out, maintains, in its great tradi- 
tion, an essentially compensatory character. 
The world is not one which was made for us. 
That slow reconstruction of it in fact, which 
we call civilization, is too slow and too inade- 
quate to satisfy the impatient mind. Imagi- 
nation does not wait upon fact, but leaps 
beyond it to the heart's desire. Such leaping 
beyond has been predominantly the part of 
philosophy in its great tradition. Against the 
fact of death it has sought to demonstrate 
desired immortality; against the fact of 

* THE CONCEPT OF CONSCIOUSNESS. By Edwin B. Holt. New 
York : The Macmillan Co. 



change, the pleasant eternity; against the 
restless multiplicity and diversity of the daily 
life, the reposeful unity of the metaphysical 
unseen. That which it has opposed to expe- 
rience it has called real; and the substance 
of experience itself, because it was so fraught 
with evil and danger, it has called unreal and 
relegated to the realm of appearance. The 
skill with which it has done this, the subtlety 
with which it has met the difficulties which 
fact always puts in the way of dialectic, have 
made it a high and precious exercise of the 
creative imagination. 

Now of all passions which animate the 
philosophical mind, perhaps the strongest is 

j the logical passion, the passion for unity and 
consistency. Thought may surrender, one after 
another, all the cherished compensatory excel- 
lences with which the imagination endows the 
world. It may surrender the immortality of 
the soul, the spirituality and eternity of the 
world, the freedom of the will, but it will still 
cling to cosmic unity and logical consistency. 
This desideratum becomes the principle of 
reconstruction in all sorts of systems, mate- 
rialisms and idealisms and empiricisms, the 
one sole salvage from the wrecks of disillusion _ 
The use of it escapes monotony chiefly by 
force of the materials to which it is applied, 
and the organization of them by which it is 
generated. One such very interesting con- 
struction which abandons all desiderata but 
this is Neo-Realism. 

On this side of the water the most interest- 
ing protagonist of this new philosophic fash- 
ion is Mr. Edwin Holt, of Harvard University. 
His philosophy is in most respects a philoso- 
phy of disillusion. In one respect, however, 
that of unity, it is a masterpiece of imagina- 
tive construction. The world as Mr. Holt sees 
it is composed of a few simple elements eom- 

| bined in a hierarchy w y hich moves from the 
simplest to the most complex, from the neutral 
entities of logic, which are neither mind nor 
matter, to those high, complicated organiza- 
tions of psychology which combine a special 
significance with a reducible compositeness. 
Between these two extremes range, in due 
order, the world of the secondary qualities, of 
colors and sounds and tastes and smells, the 
worlds of geometry and mathematics, of phy- 
sics, of chemistry, of geography, of astron- 
omy, and of biology, and beyond psychology 
is to be found the World of values, these being 
the last terms, in the process of the synthesis 
of simples, that man knows. 

Considered absolutely, none of the entities 
which these different sciences deal with pos- 
sesses a status either in the world of mind or 
the world of matter. It exists on its own 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



121 



account, "neutral" to both. When, however, 
it is related in a particular way to a group of 
other entities, it assumes a status, and may be, 
according to its relation, indifferently both 
mind and matter at the same time. Thus the 
sky you look at, as and when you look at it, 
takes its place with a series of beings, all of 
them related in a specific way to your nervous 
system and your body. Because it is so re- 
lated, it is a mental image and thought, a 
sensation, a memory, any psychological form 
of existence you choose. Again, however, in 
connection with the system of ether waves, of 
physical tensions and stresses, it is a material 
fact in the external world. In itself it simply 
is. Reality is an infinite collection of such 
autonomous entities, some irreducible simples, 
some compounded of such irreducible simples, 
and all together constituting what Mr. Holt 
calls a " neutral mosaic," and all ultimately to 
be derived from the few elemental logical 
entities which constitute the walls of the visi- 
ble and the invisible world. 

This Mr. Holt demonstrates with a beauti- 
ful and logical consequentially, and with the 
adduction of many interesting empirical data. 
He builds his world from neutral entity to 
mind and values, with a deductive precision 
and in a sprightly manner which other pro- 
fessorial philosophers might do well to imi- 
tate. His language is a little difficult, because 
of his attempt to assimilate all forms of exis- 
tence to the terms of logic. In his vocabulary, 
facts are propositions and events theorems, 
etc.; but once this slight difficulty is over- 
come the position is plausible enough. The 
world appears as a consistent system, over- 
whelmingly integrated and logical. Unhap- 
pily. Mr. Holt's sense of fact gets the better 
of his sense of logical form. The scientist and 
the artist in him are not at one, and they do 
not appear to be at one in the particular 
matter following. 

The world we live in is, of course, a world 
in which we make mistakes, a world in which 
error appears. The problem of error has been 
one of the great puzzles in the compensatory 
tradition, and Mr. Holt faces it with a cour- 
age and originality quite without parallel. 
From his point of view, contradictions are as 
real in the neutral world as consistencies, and 
error he regards as a clash of contradictory 
propositions, a struggle for survival between 
two organizations of being within a given 
complex. This description of error I believe 
to be correct. Unhappily, it is not consistent 
with the conception of a completely consistent 
universe. If contradictions are real, the uni- 
verse cannot be a unity. If the universe is a 
unitv. contradictions cannot be real. Mr. 



Holt's imagination has carried him farther 
than his sense of fact has allowed him to go. 
The quality of this imagination is striking, 
both in the new avenues of vision it opens up 
for the reader and in the plausibility with 
which it accounts for many interesting and 
puzzling details concerning the nature of 
mind. " The Concept of Consciousness " is an 
imaginative achievement of great freshness 
and dialectical subtlety simply because it has 
restated so much of the world of experience, 
with the irreducible uniqueness of its con- 
tents, in terms of " logical entities." But the 
restatement has been made at the cost of 
neglecting this qualitative uniqueness in 
experience, and of violating the desiderated 
consistency of the system. In this respect. 
Mr. Holt is, however, no worse off than any 
other philosopher who aims to construct a 
system as well as to describe the universe, and 
he is much better off with respect to the inter- 
est of his material and the liveliness of his 
style. His book is easily the foremost contri- 
bution which the New Realism has as yet 
made to the art of metaphysics and the near- 
science of psychology. H M KATTT!V 



SOUTH AMERICA AS A COMMERCIAL 
FIKLD.* 



The majority of the numerous books pur- 
porting to give information about our South 
American neighbors resemble the forced 
plants grown in the superheated atmosphere 
of a hothouse. An artificial interest has 
drawn them forth from an almost barren 
soil, poorly fed with scraps of statistics 
snatched at random from consular reports 
and commercial publications, and they art' 
colored by the pallid tints retained in the 
retina of unobservant eyes after a hurried 
trip in some country or other. Their literary 
value is nil; the information they impart is 
worse than worthless: it really is misinfor- 
mation Such books must have a detrimental 
effect on the relations between the United 
States and Latin America, retarding as they 
do the understanding which will have to ex- 
ist between the peoples of the two continents 
if the commercial castles in the air, so fondly 
reared by some of our business men, are to 
have their foundations on terra firma. 

In his preface to " The Future of South 
America/' Mr. Roger "W. Babson makes the 
admission on which he wishes to be em- 
phatic that he does not "attempt to com- 
pete with the seasoned traveller, nor the man

who has spent many years in these southern 
republics." His intention is to furnish the 
reader with information "which should be of 
service to those looking at this continent from 
a money-making, rather than from an his- 
torical, point of view." 

If Mr. Babson had achieved this purpose, 
his book would have been unique among the 
publications on South America; but it has 
fallen short of the self-imposed mark. And 
this could not be otherwise. The author is a 
statistician of country-wide fame. Therefore, 
one is not surprised, but rather expects, that 
he should attribute great importance to the 
power of statistics in unravelling the myste- 
ries of South America. Statistics, however, 
like most sciences which depend for their 
expression upon figures, is entirely impotent 
in giving 1 an idea of nationality. The 
complexities of a nation nay, of a single indi- 
vidual, are beyond the reach of mere numer- 
als. The most skilful statistician, armed with 
the most elaborate and up-to-date statistics, 
could not have foretold, at the beginning of 
last century, the enormous engineering and 
industrial development that was in store for 
such an unpromising country as Scotland. 
Again, according to some statistical contem- 
porary of Charles V, Spain should have been 
to-day mistress of the world. Statistics alone 
cannot reveal to us the future of South 
America. 

Mr. Babson is fully aware of the shortcom- 
ings of statistics. He realizes that his science 
can only be fully understood by experts, and 
that mere numerals will fail to appeal to the 
average person "looking at this continent 
from a money making . . point of view." 
He therefore indulges in what we might call 
spectacular statistics, fit for drawing-room 
entertainment. " If Massachusetts were to be 
extended westward through the Central States 
to the Pacific Ocean, it would be about one 
hundred and twenty-five miles wide and 
nearly three thousand miles long. Imagine 
this belt of land turned on end so that it will 
lie north and south instead of east and west, 
and you will then have an idea of how large 
and how peculiar is the shape of Chile." 
There is in such a metamorphosis something 
reminiscent of the light-handed conjurer who 
transforms a rabbit into a pigeon by a simple 
turn of the hand. 

It is all very cleverly done, and if the mind 
has not been fatigued by such geographical 
contortions one may obtain some idea of the 
location and extent of a country. But there 
is something else infinitely more important 
than the country itself, and that is its people. 



Mr. Babson confesses that his " visits [to 
South America] have been short," and that 
in many of the cities he writes about he spent 
but little time. It is only logical, therefore, 
that he should not have become acquainted 
with the people of South America, as indeed 
he has not. His observant mind, neverthe- 
less, has perceived that the South Americans, 
as they exist to-day, are vastly different from 
the conception formed of them by the North 
Americans. He dispels the myth, entertained 
by some writers of better intentions than 
judgment, that the peoples of the Southern 
republics are connected with the people of 
the United States by a kinship springing 
from the similarity of governmental institu- 
tions. The countries of South America are 
republican in government, and their inhabi- 
tants are imbued with as great a love of flag 
and country as could be found anywhere else 
in the world; but that and no more is 
the extent of their resemblance to the people 
of the United States. They belong to a dif- 
ferent race and a different civilization. The 
countries are, in the majority of cases, much 
older than the United States; and having 
been kept, under the long tutelage of Spain, 
secluded from the rest of the world, they 
have developed traits of character, habits, 
and customs which are peculiarly their own, 
and which will not be changed at the bidding 
of the first American drummer who happens 
to visit them. 

Mr. Babson makes all this perfectly clear, 
and with the insistence necessary to the incul- 
cation of an all-important lesson; and there- 
in, rather than in his statistics, lies the real 
value of his interesting book.

RECENT FICTION.* 



The name " Flashers Mead " will not mean 
much to many, but some will recall that, at a 
certain season, Michael Fane went into the 
country with Guy Hazlewood, who wanted to 
find a place where he might devote himself to 
poetry. They found a place called Flashers 
Mead. Here Guy established himself, and 
here Michael came later and wrote something 
on the window with Guy's diamond pencil, 
and then looking out of the window saw Guy 
in a canoe with a very charming girl like a 
wild rose or a fairy child. It was later still, 
while Michael was moving strangely in the 
extraordinary netherworld of London, that he

heard from Guy that there were difficulties 
which led him to think he would have to 
choose between love and art. So much of a 
glimpse of Flashers Mead there was in " Sin- 
ister Street"; we now have a fully realized 
view of a very beautiful and exquisite imagi- 
nation. Whether Mr. Compton Mackenzie 
had in earlier days conceived the story more 
fully, or whether, in the hours of idleness that 
must come even to those on an expeditionary 
force, he picked up the loose threads and 
worked out a new pattern, would be hard to 
say, and perhaps not worth while. But it 
may well be in these days in which a tragic 
possibility impends over all that younger gen- 
eration to which he belongs, that Mr. Macken- 
zie has desired to leave some record of the 
beauty of the England and the English life 
of to-day. At any rate, we have the life at 
Flashers Mead told not from the standpoint 
of the queerly sophisticated set at Oxford, 
but almost as from the charming but whimsi- 
cal old rectory. The book, like so much of 
England, has wonderful beauty; also like 
England, there impends over it a sense of a 
terrible outcome. 

Those who know Mr. Compton Mackenzie 
will have already read " Flashers Mead," and 
will have found in it the same beauty and life 
of youth that runs so joyfully and with such 
strains of melancholy through his other 
books: the places and people are as good as 
in "Youth's Encounter," the story as good 
(and as bad) as that of "Carnival." Those 
who have never read Mr. Compton Mackenzie 
will find his latest a good book to begin with, 
for it has most of his strong points and few 
of his weaknesses. 

By this publication Mr. Compton Macken- 
zie puts himself ahead, begins to get out of 
the group that one rather thinks of together. 
Mr. D. H. Lawrence's latest book was allowed 
only a brief moment of circulation, so we 
think of him still as we have thought of him 
before. Mr. Hugh "Walpole has allowed him- 
self something of a breathing-space in pro- 
ducing " The Golden Scarecrow." We have 
seen nothing of late by Mr. Beresford or by 
Mr. Cannan. So Mr. Compton Mackenzie 
rather emerges from the younger generation. 

Viewing him thus, one rather asks why 
there is anything in these books that one will 
not find elsewhere. If it comes to presenting 
merely a charming or exquisite quality of 
life, there are certainly many who can do 
that sort of thing. Mr. Locke or Mr. Cham- 
bers would be enough for the average taste. 
Or if it was for the rather acrid and sordid 
quality that is nowadays somewhat the fash- 



ion, there are a good many people who supply 
that too, Mr. Dreiser, say, or Mr. Somerset 
Maugham. But it is not because he is charm- 
ing and exquisite on the one hand, or acrid and 
sordid on the other, or indeed because he is 
both together that Mr. Compton Mackenzie is 
worth reading : it is because he is such a mas- 
ter of the facts of youth, because he knows 
so much of its seriousness, its triviality, its 
tragedy, its exhilaration, its ignorance, as 
well as of the follies or fancies, gaieties and 
delights, and other things wherein youth 
shares the lot of more exercised mortality. 
Of these things Mr. Compton Mackenzie 
offers a rich and well-filled record, and for 
these things one could ignore more defects 
than he otherwise has. 

In "Flashers Mead" Mr. Mackenzie is at 
his best. It is not that the book is about more 
pleasing and attractive people and places 
than may readily be found in " Carnival " or 
" Sinister Street," for the pleasing and attrac- 
tive is often enough too much of an end in 
itself. Nor is it that the book seems nearer 
to life and truer than some parts of Mr. 
Mackenzie's other work, although that would 
probably strike a good many readers. It is 
because the whole thing is so entirely fused 
in the imagination that it makes its impres- 
sion definitely and surely as the writer would 
wish. Its characters, its setting, its story all 
go together, and make a piece of work such 
as one does not often meet. 

" The Golden Scarecrow " may be some- 
thing of a disappointment to those who have 
read "The Duchess of Wrexe," not to say 
others of Mr. Walpole's books, so it should be 
said at once that it is a book of a different 
kind. For one thing, it is not a novel ; it is 
a series of sketches bound together only by 
the idea which informs them all. And 
though we may say that the interest in a story 
is not the highest literary interest, yet it is 
certainly the case that when the story is lack- 
ing we find it more difficult, at first at least, 
to fix our attention on what there is. Mr. 
Walpole is good at a story : from " The Gods 
and Mr. Perrin." where you go right along 
with the people in a very dramatic narration, 
to "The Duchess of Wrexe," a much fuller 
book with more analysis, his books have a 
story. "The Golden Scarecrow" does not. 
Nor does it at first sight deal with the same 
things that Mr. Walpole has generally dealt 
with; it does not have the interest of a bit 
of the world, representative or not, in which 
microcosm we follow with interest some of the 
writer's feelings and thoughts on life in gen- 
eral. Mr. Walpole's previous books, especially 



124 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 3 



the latest of them, seemed to be a study of 
some of the things in the world of our time 
or perhaps only of the England of the twen- 
tieth century, that Mr. Walpole thought inter- 
esting. It is not remarkable that, in a time 
of such social turmoil and upheaval, Mr. 
Walpole should not have seen his way clear 
to going on with his analysis of that social 
order which is now being so terribly shaken. 
He might easily have turned aside to some 
quite different idea that stood by itself, in- 
stead of continuing the work already an- 
nounced. That he should do so was very 
natural, perhaps inevitable; but so also is it 
natural, perhaps inevitable, that people who 
have thought of Mr. Walpole in one way 
should like to find him what they have found 
him. 

Mr. Walpole, of course, feels that his latest 
book has its definite place in his work, in- 
deed, in a way it certainly has; it is put 
among his other things as one of the " studies 
of place." But the book will hardly make its 
impression as a study of place. The people 
who read it will think it a series of sketches 
of children (who, it is true, all lived in 
March Square) based on what may well 
enough seem more of a fancy than anything 
else. 

All that sounds a bit discouraging. But 
really, "The Golden Scarecrow" is a very 
interesting book, and has a perfectly definite 
relation to the rest of Mr. Walpole's work, so 
that all his readers ought to read it thor- 
oughly. It is hardly (to my mind) a study 
of place, any more than some of Mr. Wal- 
pole's other books so called. It is really a 
development of the theme that 

" Heaven lies about us in our infancy ; 
Shades of the prison house begin to close 
Upon the growing 1 boy." 

" Shades of the prison house " have gener- 
ally been present in Mr. Walpole's books. 
Mr. Perrin in that dreadful school-world of 
Moffatt's, Maradick in the daily life which 
at forty has often become so definitely set, 
Olva Dune dissolving the bond of secrecy 
before the football match, Rachel Beaminster 
in the world of hard and fast determina- 
tion of which her grandmother the Duchess 
was the dominant mistress, in fact, it is to 
be seen in all of Mr. Walpole's books as far 
as I remember. His people find themselves 
limited, bound down, almost bricked up in a 
wall (as who does not now and then?) by 
whatever set of circumstances makes up their 
life, and to each there comes at one time or 
another the chance to break away. This is 
the great moment in each life, and each acts 



in the same way. They do not break away; 
each sees that the thing to do is not to break 
away but to keep on, not to succumb to the 
imperious surrounding but to master it and 
live differently. Each finds out that " the 
prison unto which we doom ourselves no 
prison is." Each becomes, not reconciled to 
that which was before unbearable, but able in 
some way or other to see how it can be made 
not a restraint but an opportunity. Each 
gets a new strength, a new power in life. 
This would seem to be Mr. Walpole's philoso- 
phy of life, his idea of how one may live 
finely, never expressed as a consistent 
scheme, but never absent in his work. 

The latest book of his shows us the begin- 
ning of such things. Children (if we follow 
the thought of the great poet, which Mr. Wal- 
pole seems to have adopted) live at first 
finely; as time goes on they are broken in to 
life. But in those early years they are still 
aware of that great Friend (especially, it has 
been often thought, of children) who as life 
goes on they see and hear less and less often. 
He will doubtless be with them later in life 
when they need him, but he fades out of daily 
existence. 

In such a way does this latest book of Mr. 
Walpole's take its place with the rest of his 
work. Of course it is not an explanation of 
the great mystery: Mr. Walpole is stating 
no creed; and very wisely, for people would 
not understand it. It is a fanciful story, it 
does not pretend even to take itself seriously ; 
but then, Mr. Walpole explains all that at the 
beginning, as when he compares Mr. Pidgen. 
the man who had let his fancy run away with 
him, with Mr. Lasher, who was a much more 
practical person, and goes on: "Of course, 
the ideal thing is somewhere between the 
two; recognize St. Christopher and see the 
real world as well." Or else a page or two 
later, when Mr. Pidgen tells the boy : " ' The 
more you live in your head, dreaming and 
seeing things that aren't there, the less you'll 
see the things that are there. You'll always 
be tumbling over things. You'll never get on. 
You'll never be a success.' 'Never mind,' 
said Hugh, ' it does n't matter much what you 
say now, you're only talking "for my good" 
like Mr. Lasher.' " 

Mr. Walpole has usually shown us the real 
world, or rather the world as it appears to 
be, so he may well enough do the other 
thing now. Perhaps some time he will get 
" the ideal thing . . . somewhere between the 
two." 

These books offer food for thought to those 
earnest inquirers who are asking (in the lit-

erary papers) how the war will influence 
literature. It is evident that it will not ere- ; 
ate a " war-literature " resonant with the 
sound of drums and tramplings. One of the 
most sympathetic souls of our time has asked, 
" AVho is there among us who would have the I 
heart, while his country is in agony and 
his brothers are dying, to write a drama or ; 
a romance ? " Both Mr. Compton Mackenzie | 
and Mr. Hugh Walpole take the situation j 
seriously : both are doing practical work, one 
in the hospital service, and the other with \ 
the Russian Red Cross. Neither fiddles while | 
the city is in flames. And the war leads them ! 
to produce, the one an exquisite idyl, and the \ 
other a fanciful tale about children. Yet few ' 
readers will fancy that these are works un- 
worthy a time of so great a tension of spirit.

BRIEFS ox NBW BOOKS. 

Much of the quiet humor, the 
delightful drollery, the ingrati- 
ating intimacy of personal con- 
fession, the seventeenth-century turn of 
expression, that make the "Essays of Elia" 
so pleasing, will be found in the several brief 
disquisitions composing the "Journeys to 
Bagdad," by Mr. Charles S. Brooks, a volume 
bearing quite conspicuously the Yale stamp, 
which should do it no disservice with its read- 
ers. The Yale University Press attractively 
publishes this product of a Yale pen, some of 
its contents having already appeared in " The 
Yale Review." and others in "The New Re- 
public." The first paper, which gives its 
name to the collection, treats of imaginary 
journeys to the city of "Arabian Nights" 
fame, journeys of a sort far more enjoyable 
in these days than would be the real ones. 
Then come chapters on such inviting themes 
as "The Worst Edition of Shakespeare" 
( which is John Bell's), "The Decline of 
Nightcaps," "Maps and Rabbit Holes," 
" Tunes for Spring," and five more in all a 
most enjoyable half-score of genially humor- 
ous and sometimes deliciously droll exercises 
in imagination and fancy, in musing and 
memory and invention. In justification of 
the comparison of Mr. Brooks's style with 
Charles Lamb's, let a sentence or two be 
quoted. " There is nothing to-day more de- 
generate." asserts this modern lover of things 
ancient, " than our title-pages. It is in a 
mean spirit that we pinch and starve them. 
I commend the older kind wherein, gener- 
ously ensampled. is the promise of the rich 
diet that shall follow." "This shows/' in 



another connection, "that gossipry must be 
judged by its effects. If it allay the stone or 
give a pleasant evening it should have reward 
instead of punishment." "My nose may 
serve by way of ornament or for the sniffing 
of the heavier odors, yet will fail in the nice 
detection of the faint waftings and olfactory 
ticklings." This last will recall Lamb's mod- 
est disclaimer of that fineness of hearing 
characteristic of the " ear for music." But it 
is cause for regret to find Mr. Brooks's nice 
sense of the shades of meaning in words fail 
him almost at the very opening of the book. 
" If smells were bears, how often would I be 
bit ! " he exclaims ; and this misuse of 
" would " recurs more than once in the subse- 
quent pages which would disturb one far 
less in a less admirable author. A return to 
the good old-fashioned woodcut is to be noted 
in the book's illustrations, which are con- 
ceived and executed in the spirit of the text 
by Mr. Allen Lewis. 



Professor Taussig's interesting 
1 "" 1 an< * very readable chapters on 

" Inventors and Money-Makers " 
(Macmillan) were originally delivered as lec- 
tures at Brown University, on the occasion of 
the 150th anniversary of that institution. 
The author is frankly psychological in his 
approach and treatment, and holds that a 
fundamental constructive tendency in human 
nature is the parent trait responsible for in- 
ventor and money-maker alike. That trait 
has been given a large stage, a versatile ex- 
pression, an abundant reward, and has also 
acquired a comprehensive complication with 
other derived forms of instinctive trends, in 
the world so full of a number of things in 
which as best we can we seek to move, make a 
living, and develop such being as fate or- 
dains. The competitive instinct, which makes 
men fighters and workers for causes and 
schemes, makes a close partnership with the 
constructive trait, and enlists the vitality of 
the will to prevail in the interest of the will 
to create. Yet at the economic level the 
minor differentiations of these tendencies 
count, and bring it about that the inventor 
and the promoter and money-maker are found 
inhabiting different tenements of clay. The 
marketing of a product, and the shrewdness 
to foresee the interactions of supply and de- 
mand, bring to the front a different perspec- 
tive of qualities than those in which invention 
is or remains central. The treatment is fit- 
tingly brought to a conclusion by a chapter 
on "Altruism: The Instinct of Devotion." 
This points a moral as well as adorns a well

told tale. Money-making and invention, and 
the array of minor devotions which they 
encourage and to which they give expression, 
are so many forms of personality; this con- 
clusion is suggestive because it means that 
business motives are strangely mixed and 
intricately blended with many others fail- 
ings and virtues alike which give the lie to 
the commonplace that business is business. 
The fuller and truer reason why business 
absorbs is that it gives real play, in the way 
of ready suggestion and necessary economic 
relations, to a creditable variety of human 
traits. Professor Taussig's little volume may 
be cordially recommended to the business as 
well as to the academic mind. 



The crowd and 
the State. 



There are certain excellences in 
the work on " Politics and 
Crowd Morality" (Button) by 
the late Arthur Christensen, a patriotic Dane 
of ample experience in political life. His 
criticism of democracy is a clear-eyed picture 
of its defects; and from the recent political 
history of England, France, Scandinavia, and 
America he has collected an effective array of 
instances of the breakdown of democratic 
forms. He gives a pessimistic account of the 
"interstate politics" of the world; and his 
strictures upon the selfish policies pursued by 
the Great Powers, and the danger to smaller 
countries and backward races, as Avell as to 
the Powers themselves, involved in these ten- 
dencies, have been amply justified by the war 
which has broken out since the first publica- 
tion of his book. But as an attempt to construct 
a new theory of democratic government, and 
to demonstrate a new set of political princi- 
ples, founded upon a careful social psychol- 
ogy, the book is unsatisfactory. In the first 
place, it slavishly follows the general theories 
of crowd psychology, and of the interaction 
between the individual and the mass, worked 
out twenty years ago by Le Bon and Tarde, 
without due recognition of the fact that these 
men have exaggerated the irrational behavior 
of crowds, and that their explanation of what 
irrationalities do exist, by "suggestion," 
" imitation," " counter-suggestion," and so on, 
is vague and inadequate. In the second place, 
it bases its solution of the problem of provid- 
ing an efficient democratic government upon 
theories that none but a special school of 
labor leaders can consider tenable. Having 
argued that human societies are ignorant, 
prejudiced, and excitable, and that their 
members often urge each other into what the 
Germans call "waking hypnosis," he goes on 
to suggest a substitute for this government by 



the unorganized crowd. This is based upon 
the organization of society into professional 
and trade groups. There is to be a quasi- 
syndicalist constitution ; each special func- 
tion in the State is to be exercised by the 
specialists in that function; and differences 
are to be composed, and common interests 
controlled, by the representatives of different 
economic groups. The methods by which Mr. 
Christensen shows that trade and profes- 
sional corporations are "rational" and 
"natural," as opposed to the irrational and 
artificial crowd, are interesting examples of 
forced and unsound reasoning. Until our 
labor unions, professional societies, and man- 
agerial boards show more conclusively that 
they are exempt from the general frailties 
and passions common to all groups of human 
beings, democratic nations will depend upon 
the present mass constituencies for govern- 
ment. 

A study of Anatole France, by 
JJSfSf JJgJ* Mr. W. L. George, the English 

novelist and feminist, is one of 
the first volumes in the " Writers of the Day " 
series (Holt). Mr. George is in some ways 
well equipped for his task owing to his French 
schooling and his comparative freedom from 
Anglo-Saxon and puritanic prejudices. Ana- 
tole France, as someone has said, represents 
the consummate flowering of the Latin genius ; 
to entrust the interpretation of him to a man 
unappreciative of the esprit gaulois would 
have been sheer barbarism. If we assume the 
object of the series to be informational as well 
as merely critical, we may say that Mr. George 
has done his work well. His account is lucid, 
well-balanced, and sympathetic. For the 
ignoramus or the moderately informed there 
is plenty of sustenance. Nevertheless, the real 
lover of Anatole France will experience some 
slight disappointment. There is no subtle 
insight and no warm glow of enthusiasm. 
Connoisseurs will also deprecate certain state- 
ments, notably the phrase about "the dap- 
per quality" of the Frenchman's thought, 
where the adjective seems peculiarly inappro- 
priate, and the further assertion that M. 
France is sentimental. Mr. George announces 
at the outset that he has read very few books 
or articles about Anatole France. It might 
have been better if he had read more. Per- 
haps in that case he would not have been so 
categorical in his denial of any evolution in 
his author. To many it appears that since the 
Dreyfus affair there is a ground-tone of earn- 
estness in M. France's work which was scarcely 
perceptible before. Ironical, skeptical, genially 
tolerant as ever, the dilettante has become, like

another mocker, Heine, a " valiant soldier in 
the war of humanity's liberation." The writ- 
er's judgments on individual books are gener- 
ally sound. He would apparently select as the 
best of his author " Sylvestre Bonnard" and 
"L'lle des Pingouins." One very delightful 
book, " La Rotisserie de la Reine Pedauque," 
seems to have escaped his notice entirely. 

Professor E. B. Gowin has writ- 
ten a timely book which he calls 
"The Executive and His Con- 
trol of Men: A Study in Personal Effi- 
ciency" (Macmillan). Its timeliness consists 
in the appeal to current interests and the 
mode of their practical expression which the 
subject carries. It cannot be said that it 
rises to the level of less ephemeral timeliness 
by advancing insight into the problems which 
it treats interestingly but rather aimlessly. 
On the psychological side it contains a praise- 
worthy contribution, which is the result of a 
very extended questionnaire circulated with 
unusual success in coaxing returns. The re- 
plies of successful men in forty callings show 
convincingly that in the long run and the ; 
short sprint physique tells. The "big" 
men in achievement are taller and heavier 
than the average. " Superintendents of I 
street cleaning" are the heavyweights, and 
"psychologists" the lightweights, among the 
forty professions thus immortalized; only 
" reformers " are taller than the " superin- 
tendents." while publishers and (most of all) 
musicians are small men. The defect of stat- 
ure of musicians is so striking that it must 
have some other (racial?) than an occupa- 
tional selection as its clue. But apart from 
this statistical investigation, the central pur- 
pose of the volume is to direct attention to the 
quality of energy and the glory of its organi- 
zation that in the modern world bring power 
and wealth to the man who can control and 
direct his fellow men. The enormous empha- 
sis which modern industrial life, and the 
many phases of human interest patterned 
after this type of efficiency, places upon this 
aspect of human quality entitles it to the 
most comprehensive and intensive study that 
industry and insight can command. From 
the volume in hand the reader will gain a 
suggestive realization of the many factors 
which determine the expression of this much 
rewarded quality. He will see it pictured in j 
theory and practice, illuminated by psycho- 
logical principles and illustrated by practical 
achievement. And for the most part he will I 
carry away a more definite notion of the , 
executive functions and their economic sig- 
nificance. Beyond this he may gain little, 



and may even leave the volume with the 
uneasy feeling of hopes aroused and disap- 
pointed. But the book will doubtless find a 
grateful as well as a lenient clientele, and 
thus fulfil the well intentioned purpose of 
the author.

^ T - Harry Parker Ward's vol- 
ume on "Some American College 
Book-plates" (Columbus, Ohio: 
Champlin Press) is an addition of genuine 
value to book-plate literature. The body of 
the volume consists of 360 pages of reproduc- 
tions of well chosen plates from a large num- 
ber of educational institutions in all parts of 
the country, including a few from learned 
societies, museums, etc., and a few from well 
known individuals with such college connec- 
tions as to make their appearance not inappro- 
priate. Harvard is represented by about 
thirty of the two or three hundred plates 
which distinguish various collections in her 
great library. The reproduction is skilfully 
done, and certainly reflects credit on the 
Champlin Press. There are a dozen inset 
prints from the original plates. Mr. Ward 
has had the cooperation of Mr. Theodore Wes- 
ley Koch, Librarian of the University of Mich- 
igan. who contributes a very interesting 
"Defense of Book-plates," embracing some 
sensible suggestions to anyone who may wish 
to secure a plate for his own books. Mr. Win- 
ward Prescott. a well known authority and 
member of the best book-plate societies in this 
country and Europe, contributes a check-list 
of book-plate literature covering nearly fifty 
pages, the most complete bibliography of the 
kind yet presented. This is prefaced by some 
good suggestions to the collector. The acci- 
dental inclusion of a University of Chicago 
Quadrangle Club plate among the Princeton 
specimens is unfortunate, but in a piece of 
work so carefully done as a whole it may be 
pardoned, -

To furnish this important element is the spe-

author has studied the framework of his inci- 
dents on the spot, although it required jour- 
neys aggregating twenty thousand miles. He

and Paris, his garrison at Valence, along the

house, a palace, a battlefield, or an Alpine 
pass. For example, from the legendary 
tower of Theodoric, which rises in an orchard 
at Marengo, he asks the reader to look out 
over the plain which stretches away to Ales- 
sandria, and which he compares to a " great 
football field, bordered on either side by hills 
that rise like the tiers of a grandstand," the 
river Bormida at one end and the heights of 
San Giuliano at the other. In a similar way 
he describes the countryside between Briinn 
and the village of Austerlitz. The wonder is 
that he did not take his camera with him and 
give us photographs of the more interesting 
places, instead of illustrating his volume with 
cheap reproductions of familiar paintings, 
many of which are utterly valueless for the 
study of Napoleon's life. As a biography this 
book will scarcely take a conspicuous place in 
the increasing volume of Napoleonic studies. 
Many statements represent traditional rather 
than critical views. The description of the 
constitution of the Consulate, to cite an in- 
stance, shows little comprehension of its real 
character. 

The conception of Professor 
.4 plebiscite on Foster F. Boswell's " The Aims 

college education. i -r-* < t~t 11 -ni 

and Defects of College Educa- 
tion " (Putnam) is admirable. In Part I are 
presented a number of letters, and excerpts 
from letters, written by more or less promi- 
nent Americans in reply to two questions sent 
out by Prof essor Boswell : (1) "What traits 
of character and mind should a college aim to 
develop in its students to make them useful 
and efficient in modern life?" (2) "In what 
ways does the present college education fail 
in giving students training it is able to give? " 
Those addressed were men in public life, 
college presidents, professors in the more 
practical departments of great universities, 
journalists, and business men. The answers 
are interesting in the light of their authorship 
as well as intrinsically; but they are so 
various that it would be difficult to do them 
collective justice, despite Professor Boswell's 
claim that they show a remarkable unity. 
Certain defects attributed to college students 
are noted in several letters, "slipshod and 
superficial work done for the purpose of 'get- 
ting by,' " unpunctuality, social arrogance, 
lack of initiative ; and it is true that the gen- 
eral trend of these letters from " practical " 
men rather surprisingly emphasizes the impor- 
tance of the more general and cultural stud- 
ies as a basis for professional or business life. 
The second part of the volume is made up of 
Professor Boswell's comments and conclusions 
on the data provided by the letters. A strik- 



ing defect in the method of carrying out the 
conception of the book lies in its narrow 
range, the somewhat local character of the 
business men quoted, and the fairly dogmatic 
and absolute conclusions drawn from answers 
of persons apparently selected with some care 
by the investigator. 

A careful study of Eliza Hay- 
ry. wood, one of the lesser known 

eighteenth century novelists, 
who wrote passionate romances, secret histo-

may be classed as novels of domestic life, 
attempted the drama, and figured as one of 
Pope's victims in the " Dunciad," has been 
made by Dr. George Frisbie Whicher, of the 
University of Illinois. The author of some 
seventy separate publications, Mrs. Haywood 
has been described as "the most voluminous 
female writer" that Great Britain has pro- 
duced. Mr. Gosse calls her the " Ouida" of a 
bygone day. Although one contemporary 
poet (not Pope) affirms: 

" You sit like Heav'n's bright minister on High, 
Command the throbbing Breast, and watry Eye," 

present day readers will feel hardly more 
than an antiquarian interest in her work. 
Yet "The History of Miss Betsy Thought- 
less" (1751) is not without merit as an ex- 
periment in the fiction that draws upon 
everyday life. Dr. Whicher's monograph is 
vivaciously written, and presents its subject 
with much interesting and informing detail.

" Then the people of your honorable nation

is a great pity that more Americans are not 
familiar with the teachings which have 
moulded the lives of countless millions of our 
fellow creatures. An easy means of approach 
is offered by Mr. Miles Menander Da.wson in 
" The Ethics of Confucius" (Putnam), for he 
has culled choice passages from the works of 
the Master and his commentators and gath- 
ered them under seven heads, such as "What 
Constitutes the Superior Man," " Self -Devel-

" The Accolade " is a new novel by Miss Ethel 
Sidgwick scheduled for February publication by 
Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. 

Silvio Pellico's tragedy, " Francesca da Rimini,"

this month under the title of " The Golden Woman." 

Forthcoming novels that Messrs. Putnam have in 
train for earlv publication include, among others, 
" Bars of Iron " by Miss Ethel M. Dell and " The 
Wiser Folly " by Miss Leslie Moore. 

Professor Allen R. Benham has compiled a 
source-book for the history of English literature, 
' English Literature from Widsith to the Death of j 
Chaucer," which the Yale University Press will 
publish in June. 

" Child and Country " is the title of a new novel \ 
by Mr. Will Levington Comfort which Messrs. 
Doran announce. From the same house will come j 
" Old Judge Priest " by Mr. Irvin S. Cobb and : 
"Gossamer" by George A. Birmingham (Canon j 
Hannay). 

Arrangements have just been made by the Mac- 
millan Co. to bring out in a limited edition the j 
sonnets of Mr. John Masefield, the distinguished I 
English poet who is now in this country. Only five j 
hundred copies will be published, each copy num- ! 
bered and signed by the author. 

A committee of the Intercollegiate Socialist i 
Society, including Messrs. William English Wall- ; 
ing, H. G. Sedgwick, J. G. Phelps Stokes, and 
others, has compiled a volume of significant docu- | 
ments of socialists throughout the world to be I 
issued under the title " The Socialism of To-day." 
Messrs. Holt are the publishers. 

In " The Diplomacy of the Great War," an- j 
nounced by the Macmillan Co., the author. Mr. j 
Arthur Bullard, seeks to contribute to an tinder- i 
standing of the European situation by revealing i 
something of the diplomacy of the past years, cov- \ 
ering the development of international politics in j 
Europe since the Congress of Berlin in 1878. 

" Fear God and Take Your Own Part " is the 
bombastic title of a forthcoming volume of re- 
printed addresses and magazine articles by Mr. 
Roosevelt, which Messrs. Doran will publish. It is 
comforting to know that it is only God whom we 
have to fear; we had gathered from Mr. Roose- 
velt's recent utterances that it was the Germans. 

Three studies in criminology are announced by 
Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. for early publication, 
as follows : " Criminal Sociology," by M. Enrico

The authorized biography of the late Major- 
General William Rufus Shafter, U. S. A., who com-, 
manded the expeditionary force which captured 
Santiago, Cuba, is being prepared by Mr. Charles 
A. Weissert, a member of the House of Representa-

a number of monographs on Michigan history. 
Included with the biography will be letters and 
papers of importance by General Shafter, who 
was a product of pioneer life in the Michigan 
wilderness. 

" The Drama of Savage Peoples " by Dr. Loomis 
Havemeyer is announced by the Yale University 
Press. The origin of the drama is traced back to 
mimetic action and gesture language of primitive 
people, and its development is followed through 
their religious, initiation, and war ceremonies to the 
pleasure plays of savage peoples. The author aims 
to do for drama as expressed in social evolution 
what Dr. Frazer has done with the early history of 
religion, Professor Westermarck with marriage, 
and Professor Tylor with culture. 

An English translation of M. Augustus Hamon's 
"Bernard Shaw, the 20th Century Moliere," has 
been made by Messrs. Eden and Cedar Paul, and 
the volume will be issued this month by Messrs. 
Stokes: From the same house will come " Rudyard 
Kipling: A Literary Appreciation" by Mr. R. 
Thurston Hopkins, " Maurice Maeterlinck, Poet 
and Philosopher" by Mr. Macdonald Clark, 
" Indian Thought, Past and Present " by Dr. R. W. 
Frazer, and "Belgium," a series of plates repro- 
duced by wood engraving after drawings by Mr. 
Frank Brangwyn. 

A supplementary volume of " Scientific Papers " 
by the late Sir George Howard Darwin, edited by 
Messrs. F. J. M. Stratton and J. Jackson, will 
soon come from the Cambridge University Press. 
This volume will contain the author's series of lec- 
tures on Hill's lunar theory, a paper representing 
Darwin's last printed word on periodic orbits, two 
mathematical addresses, and biographical memoirs 
from two points of view. Sir Francis Darwin 
writes of his brother's life apart from his scien- 
tific work; and Professor E. W. Brown deals with 
his work as astronomer and teacher.

How Sanatogen Relieves Poor Digestion 
and Nerve Strain 



DIGESTION and the nervous 
system are interdependent. 
For while the products of 
digestion nourish the nerve cells, 
the nerves in turn control digestion. 

Thus if aught wrongly affects either the 
nerves or the digestive organs the other 
also must suffer. 

When, for instance, worry, overwork or 
shock interferes with digestion, the result- 
ant lack of nourishment weakens the ner- 
vous system, causing nerve-strain. This 
nerve-weakness then reacts and still further 
disturbs the faulty digestion. 

At such times Sanatogen is specifically 
helpful first, because it is so easily assimi- 
lated by even an enfeebled digestion, and, 
second, because Sana togen's chemical union 
of purest protein and organic phosphorus 
furnishes precisely the two elements most 
needed to restore aot only the weakened 



digestion but the impoverished nerve cells 
as well. 

This explains why Colonel Warterson, 
the famous American editor, was able to 
write: 

" I do not think I could have recovered 
my vitality, as I have done, without 
this Sanatogen operating equally upon 
the digestive organs and nerve centers." 

And why Hon. Wm. E. Chandler, former 
Secretary of the Navy, wrote : 

"Sanatogen is a pleasant nutriment for 
cases of impaired digestion. It strength- 
ens without irritating and promotes 
vitality in feeble folks." 

It also explains the striking endorsement 
of the medical profession as expressed in 
signed letters from over 21,000 physicians 
who have watched the work of Sanatogen 
in countless cases. 

And it gives you the reason why we are 
so confident that Sanatogen can help you 
when you give it an opportunity. 



Sanatogen is sold by good druggists everywhere in three sizes, from $1.00 up 
Grand Prize, International Congress of Medicine, London, 1913

TRUE Facsimiles from Originals in the Department of Manuscripts, 
British Museum, of Royal, Historic and Diplomatic Documents, 
State and Secret Papers, Letters and Autographs of Kings and Queens, 
Princes, Statesmen, Generals and World-Famous Litterateurs; With 
Descriptions, Translations, References and Editorial Notes, By GEORGE 
F. WARNER, M.A., ASSISTANT KEEPER OF MANUSCRIPTS BRITISH MU- 
SEUM, LONDON, ENGLAND. 

" The Most Valuable Collection of Historical and 
Literary Manuscripts Ever Issued." 

The Manuscripts show the hand-writing, erasures, interlineations and signatures 
an exact facsimile in each case, and in every sense equal to the originals. They are one 
of the greatest curiosities of the age, and the most uncommon and original collection of 
State and literary archives in the world. 

To possess this collection is like owning a whole section of the State archives, right 
in your own library, where you can examine its contents at your leisure. It is difficult 
to exaggerate the pleasure which is derived from their perusal, in the very form in which 
they first took shape. 

To lovers of literature what could be more enjoyable than the reading of the many 
letters in this collection, from famous poets and authors? Public libraries and historical 
societies will find these manuscripts a great asset. Being the very life of History, they 
are of great value to historical students, as they make it possible for them to get close to 
original sources. As material for those studying the science of documentary evidence 
they are invaluable. 

Each of the three portfolios is eleven by seventeen inches. The covers are printed 
on heavy rough paper in two colors: Black and red. The first portfolio contains a 
beautiful parchment title-page (to be used in a permanent binding) , illuminated in red, 
gold and black. The manuscripts themselves are printed on antique stock in black ink 
over a buff-tinted background, which gives a very realistic antique look. Each manu- 
script is preceded by a title-page giving the title, editorial notes, references, etc., and each 
portfolio contains an index or list of manuscripts as follows :

WRITERS professional or amateur like THE

mation for Literary Workers. THE EDITOR is 
now in its 22nd consecutive year of publication. 
pROM the days when Jack London, Mary Rob- 
erts Rinehart, Peter Clark Macfarlane, Albert 
Bigelow Paine, etc., were unknown aspirants.writ- 
ers have made THE EDITOR a great exchange 
through which they have transferred to one an- 
other the results of their valuable experiences. 
MARY Roberts Rinehart has said: "THE 
EDITOR helped to start me, cheered me 
when I was down, and led me in the straight path 
until I was able to walk alone." 
JACK London has said: "The first number of 
THE EDITOR I read aroused in me a great 
regret for all my blind waste of energy. I may 
not tell a hundredth part of what I learned from 
THE EDITOR, but I may say that it taught me 
how to solve the stamp and landlady problems." 

IN addition to practical, inspiriting articles on artistic and 
business phases of the art-trade of writing, THE 
E DITOR prints each fortnight news of markets for all kinds 
of literary material. 

UP-TO-DATE news of photoplay markets and of oppor- 
tunities to sell post -card, second serial and other rights 
of already published manuscripts is a feature.

Master Will of Stratford 

A Play for Children in a Prologue, 
Three Acts and an Epilogue 

By Louise Ayres Garnett 

A play that children will delight to see as well as 
to give. The scene is in Stratford, on a New 
Year's Eve, and Shakespeare's mother, Oberon, 
Titania and Queen Elizabeth all appear together 
on the stage. The style is truly Shakespearean, 
with the raciness, the quickness of wit, the alert- 
ness and dexterity of metaphor characteristic of 
Elizabethan dramatic speech. Boards, 50 cents. 



"The most readable, most attractive and con- 
venient presentation of Shakespeare's works." 

THE TUDOR SHAKESPEARE qHo 

Published under the general editorship of 
William Allan Neilson, Ph.D., of Harvard University, and Ashley Horace Thorndike, L.H.D.,

Now complete in forty volumes, including The Facts About Shakespeare, which supplements 
the introductions and the notes to the individual plays and gives a corrected account of 
Shakespeare's life, environment, work and reputation. 

" In type, paper, size, in all matters of make-up, it is safe 
to say this edition has never been surpassed, if equalled. 
Every Shakespearean student should possess a 
set of these volumes." Boston Times. 

"These volumes, in their convenient size and clear type, 
can not fail to become immensely popular owing to their 
excellence in form and substance and their very moderate 
price." Philadelphia Public Ledger. 



Three feature* especially commend this edi- 
tion of Shakespeare its authenticity of text, 
its ideal format, and the terse practicality of 
its introductions and notes.

NEW WATS AND THE OLD PERSON. 

By the Old Person I don't mean old as 
aged, but old as against young: middle-old; 
the person who has done with, or done for, 
the business of mating ; of whom one says, he 
hath or hath not hair, good spirits, or a waist- 
line ; who is credited with playing a fair game 
for his age; who, gazing upon the lessening 
delight of his image in the morning glass, 
assures himself that he feels as young as ever 
and that youth is an overrated affair anyhow. 
In short, I mean the person who, but a little 
while ago, could have comforted himself with 
the reflection that it was he, and not the 
youngster bawling at the piano yonder, who 
was acknowledged heir to all ages past and 
sponsor for the years to come. 

But a little while ago! Before Dr. Osier 
made his fateful remark ; before the motor had 
speeded up life and the movie had speeded 
up the drama; before Mr. Shaw, and Mr. 
Wells, and the rest, began so sportively to 
expound the inferiority of parents. We who 
were born in the seventies and eighties who 
among us ever doubted that his father and 
mother in their green middle age were the 
real thing, that it was they who were doing 
the real business of living, and that the world 
was, on the whole, properly arranged for 
their comfort and convenience? Pater- 
familias was not a word of mockery then; it 
stood for a reality, official and august; nor 
was his consort a person to be flouted. They 
demanded respect of us, and we innocently 
yielded it to them. 

Well, we begin now to see how weak of us 
that must have been. There, we may sup- 
pose, was our lost opportunity. Who knows? 
If it had occurred to us to assert ourselves, 
to oppose the wisdom of youth to the dried 
formulas of age, we might have found father 
amenable enough behind his dundrearys, 
mother apologetic enough under her shawl. 
But it did not occur to us. We might, in 
sanguine hours, aspire to hoodwink those 
ancients, but alas, we never dreamed of brow- 
beating them. Thus, it appears, we fell be- 
tween two stools. For times changed, and 
manners with them; and somehow, when at 



142 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 17 



last we had grown up, and produced de- 
scendants, and (feeling that it was now our 
turn) placed ourselves in a convenient atti- 
tude to be respected and deferred to by them, 
all we got for our pains was a stare and a 
giggle, and a rear view of careless youthful 
shoulders. 

This kind of shock has to be met. In a way 
we have adapted ourselves to it; the new 
order even has its compensations. Side- 
whiskers and shawls have vanished with the 
authority they symbolized. Some privileges 
we expected to sacrifice on the altar of middle 
age remain to us. "We may be as light- 
minded and irresponsible as we choose. Since 
nobody has any respect for us anyhow, we 
need not waste time standing on our dignity. 
We need no longer pretend to be infallible, as 
persons of our age had to a generation ago. 
We need not wear rubbers or abstain from 
smoking for the sake of our influence, since 
we possess nothing of the kind. It is not to 
be wondered at that this sudden emancipa- 
tion reacts upon us in striking ways. We 
skit, we gambol in the open, we cavort to 
measure in enclosed pens, shamelessly vying 
with our juniors. One of these days some clever 
fellow (presumably English) will remark that 
the man is father to the child, and so win 
applause as begetter of a brilliant paradox. 

And yet somehow the situation isn't all 
comfort and luxury for us. In sober moments 
we have an uneasy feeling that there is a 
screw loose somewhere, and that it ought to 
be attended to if the old machine is to be kept 
going. Life isn't all beer and skittles, even 
since the Victorians lugged their adages off 
the scene. There has to be some sort of 
responsibility and authority somewhere. 

Here is the matter of books and reading, 
for instance. Under the regime that flour- 
ished in our own youth, we were supposed to 
be protected from certain manifestations of 
literary art. The theory was applied rather 
loosely to the literature of the past. Bowdler 
went sniffing among the pages of the school 
Shakespeare, but no parent thought of deny- 
ing his child the home edition. Infants were 
urged to read the Bible through, and hideous 
passages were mumbled over at family 
prayers. " Don Juan " was probably at hand 
behind the glass doors of the black-walnut 
bookcase; and among the musty old calf vol- 
umes on the top shelf, an inquiring hand 
might even search out a " Tom Jones " or a 



"Roderick Random." But as for contempo- 
rary literature, theory and practice were firm 
enough. "Virginibus puerisque," our eld- 
ers lived and wrote in the fear of the Young 
Person. I dare say they felt that to be them- 
selves worthy of respect, they must reverence 
that young mind, they must take care not to 
outrage those pure youthful sensibilities. 
There were large spaces of fact and fancy 
from which the young must be restrained till 
the little wings were strong enough to bear 
them safely through those perilous chaotic 
regions. 

All that has been changed pretty thor- 
oughly. Childhood is still guarded after a 
fashion. We make some attempt, at least, to 
distract infancy from the salty fare of con- 
temporary fiction by plying it with specially 
concocted sweetmeats known as " children's 
books." Meantime the age of literary consent 
has been steadily pushed back to the nether 
verge of adolescence. The fact is, youth in 
its teens is no longer the Young Person, the 
innocent ward of age and experience. It is 
humanity in the ascendant, the ruling power, 
which has a right to know what sort of world 
it is set to rule over. In short, it must get to 
know "life" by the shortest cuts possible. 
For its edification, therefore, the magazines 
and the book-stalls and the theatres, and here 
and there a public library, are setting forth 
without stint "the elementary facts of life." 
Now we all know what that means not much 
more and nothing less than the risky or the 
seamy side of sex. This new order of things 
permits the most isolated of budding maidens 
to inspect a world of print in which sexual 
passion, with or without a veil of romantic 
glamour, stalks proudly at noonday. A very 
little reading in the right quarters will in- 
struct her, on the one hand, how not to become 
a white slave, and, on the other, how to be- 
come a mistress, with or without the wedding 
ring. I think the cheap glamourists have 
most to answer for. I have daughters, and I 
wish they would read that manly animal 
Fielding instead of the gilded prurience of 
Mr. R. W. Chambers and his crew. 

In all this pseud'o-lore of sex the maiden 
we know is a hoary grandmother, compared 
with the Young Person of half a century ago, 
her own grandmother in the flesh. Her, the 
reverent or if you like sentimental art of that 
period loved to picture in well-disposed ring- 
lets, dove on finger, gazing innocently from 



1916 



THE DIAL 



143 



her chamber-window upon a world which was 
all a sweet and tolerably silly mystery to her. 
Her descendant carries a cigarette upon her 
finger, and strides through the streets look- 
ing about critically, and sees no reason for 
any mystery whatever about her soul or her 
ankles, and indeed there is little room for 
speculation about either. She doesn't mind 
if the Old Person thinks her vulgar, as long 
as nobody can fairly accuse her of being gen- 
teel. As for reading, give her books that deal 
fearlessly with "life." She has her opinion 
about Strindberg, and she will discourse you 
cheerfully upon real books like "Ann Veron- 
ica," which shows what a fine thing it is to be 
a free female, or " The Dark Flower," which 
shows what rotten humbugs middle-aged men 
are. 

At this point I may cheerfully (and con- 
veniently) own that I was set upon my little 
journey of inquiry by a suggestion let fall by 
the editor of THE DIAL in a letter written to 
me about a year ago. " I have sometimes 
thought," he said, "that the entire problem 
has gradually been turned topsy-turvy of 
recent years, that the mass of realistic nov- 
els and plays now appearing are frankly in- 
tended for the Young Person, who is their 
most numerous, most understanding, and most 
appreciative patron; and that it is the older 
generation, reared in a more reticent or (if 
you will) narroicer tradition, whose suscepti- 
bilities really need shielding and sheltering." 

The passage which I have italicized espe- 
cially stuck in my mind : I believe there is a 
whimsical truth in it, and that the younger 
generation now and then show signs of real- 
izing it. I happen to have heard very re- 
cently of two incidents in point, both of which 
befell Old Persons of my own little town. 
One of them is a bachelor, a devoted church- 
man, and very fond of boys. Last winter, in 
all innocence, he treated a group of choir- 
boys and acolytes to the most revolting 
brothel-play Broadway has thus far pro- 
duced. Apparently it made little impression 
on the boys, but. said one of them, " It was too 
bad Mr. X was kind of broken up, I guess." 
The other instance is of another contemporary 
of mine, a cultivated woman (as we used to 
say), with a daughter of (as we used to say) 
marriageable age. The daughter not long ago 
took her to a play which was scoring a nota- 
ble run in New York. You observe that the 
daughter took her, to begin with. " It was a 



dreadful play," said my contemporary, in re- 
porting the incident, "not only wicked, but 
vulgarly wicked. Mildred seemed quite en- 
thralled. ' It's so real,' she kept saying, when- 
ever the worst things were happening. I 
stood it till the end of the second act, and 
then I said to her, ' Mildred, if you think this 
is the kind of play to bring your mother to, 
I don't.' It didn't occur to me how funny 
that was till later. I don't think it occurred 
to her at all. She was rather annoyed at hav- 
ing to go, but I believe she really felt she 
might n't have done her duty by me ! " 

The Comic Spirit might here discern the 
basis for a reasonable adjustment of the new 
relation, a working proposition, as it were. 
It is clear that the moral works of society 
cannot run without a balance-wheel of inno- 
cence somewhere. If the young are to repu- 
diate that function, npon their shoulders 
should lie the responsibility of its mainte- 
nance. "We took no end of trouble with them 
once: now why shouldn't they return the 
compliment? Let them change the tag to 
"Viris femimsque reverentia debetur," and 
be a little gingerly with us, in common hu- 
manity. Very cheerfully, for our part, we 
might render them the respect due to supe- 
rior wisdom, with its burden of mysterious 
and unpleasant duties. Very contentedly we 
might leave them to their literary grubbing in 
\ the muck-heaps of human nature and expe- 
rience, until such time as they might weary 
of that sorry task. For the time would come : 
I cannot believe, at least, that they would 
willingly bequeath such tasks, responsibilities 
| so carking and so dingy, to their children. 
Who knows but even in our own time the 
! wheel will come full circle, and the status of 
! the Young Person be in some measure (not 
bodily, let us hope!) restored, by those who 
| in their day have experienced the perils and 
the penalties of the prematurely old?

NEW NOTES ON POE'S EAELT 
TEARS. 

There are still sundry dark places in the 

life of Poe. For this no one is so much 

i responsible as the poet himself. He was

to misrepresentation, as happened more than

less complete silence with regard to himself. 
In particular he was inclined to reticence con- 
cerning his early life in London and Rich- 
mond and Baltimore. Several years ago I 
succeeded, through a partial examination of 
the letters and office-books of the business 
firm to which the poet's foster-father, John 
Allan, belonged (papers now in the posses- 
sion of the Library of Congress and known 
as the "Ellis- Allan Papers"), in. clearing 
away some of the obscurities that have sur- 
rounded Poe's earliest years in London and 
Richmond. I am now able, as a result of a 
further examination of these papers, to throw 
light on certain other obscure or disputed 
points in his history at this time. And I 
have, through an examination of certain court 
records and of the files of several old news- 
papers, and a re-examination in the light of 
these of the evidence already at hand, man- 
aged also to uncover one or two new facts 
about his life in Baltimore in the early 
thirties. 

I. 

The most interesting of the new bits of 
information that I have come across in the 
Ellis- Allan Papers is a bill for Poe's schooling 
in London in 1816. This document makes it 
clear that Poe was not a pupil, as has been 
generally supposed and as he himself held 
("Virginia Poe," I, p. 344), at the school of 
the Rev. John Bransby at Stoke Newington 
throughout his five years' stay in England 
(1815-20), but that he spent a part of this 
time at a school in the city of London a 
boarding school kept by the Misses Dubourg 
in Sloane street, near the South Kensington 
Museum. This bill runs as follows: 

Masr. Allan's School Acct. to Midsr. 1816.

On the verso of this paper the words 
"Masr. Allan's School Acct. School recom- 
mences, Monday, 22nd, July" are written; 
and in one corner of the same page is entered 
the notation: "Bill & Rect Edgar's School 



Acct to midsumr 1816 [] 12-2-0." On a 

slip of paper accompanying the bill is a re- 
ceipt bearing date July 6, 1816, and signed 
by George Dubourg. On the cash-book of the 
firm of Allan & Ellis there appears under the 
same date the following entry: "pd Miss 

Dubourgs a/c for Edgar [] 12-2-0." 

George Dubourg was a brother of the Misses 
Dubourg, as appears from several letters in 
the collection, and was employed by Allan & 
Ellis in 1816-7 as a book-keeper and copyist 
in their London establishment. 

That Poe was also a pupil of the Misses 
Dubourg in the second half of 1816 is shown 
by an entry in the Ellis- Allan cash-book un- 
der date December 28, 1816 : " pd Miss Du- 

bourg's a/c for Edgar [] 23-16-0." There 

is a similar entry in the same volume under 
date August 28, 1817, for "Edgar's School 

a/c [] 24-16-0."; but whether this was 

paid to the Misses Dubourg or to Dr. Bransby 
is not clear, though the fact that the amount 
specified tallies closely with that paid the 
Misses Dubourg in the preceding December 
would indicate that Poe continued his stud- 
ies in Sloane street down to the middle of 
1817. 

Not without interest also are several letters 
written by John Allan in 1815 to his partner, 
Charles Ellis, in Richmond, in which mention 
is made of the boy Poe. In a letter from 
Liverpool on July 29, 1815, the day after his 
arrival in England, Allan gives an account of 
his voyage across the Atlantic, and notes that 
although certain of his party were "verry 
sick " on the voyage, Edgar was only " a little 
sick, and soon recovered." From Greenock, 
Scotland, he wrote on September 21 on the 
same subject: "Edgar says Pa: say some- 
thing for me say I was not afraid coming 
across the sea." In a letter from London 
written one October evening shortly after he 
went up to the city, Allan represents himself 
as seated, as he writes, before " a snug fire in 
a nice little sitting parlour in No. 47 South- 
ampton Row," while "Frances" and "Nancy" 
(Mrs. Allan and her sister) are sewing and 
Edgar is "reading a little Story Book." A 
letter of May 18, 1816, from one of Poe's play- 
mates in Richmond, C. M. Portiaux, conveys 
this message to the future poet : " Give my 
love to Edgar and tell him I want to see him 
very much . . I expect Edgar does not know 
what to make of such a large City as London 
tell him Josephine and all the children want 
to see him." 

Several entries in the office-books of 
Charles Ellis serve to confirm certain tradi- 
tions as to Poe's visit to Richmond in 1829-30. 
Under date of March 3, 1829, John Allan is 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



145 



charged with a bill of dry-goods sold "p[er] I 
order to E A P," which authenticates the i 
tradition that Poe returned to Richmond soon j 
after the death of the first Mrs. Allan. , 
(Among the items in this bill are three yards J 
of black cloth at twelve dollars a yard, three j 
pairs of black hose at four shillings per pair, j 
and one "London Hat" at ten dollars.) An- j 
other entry, under date of January 8, 1830, ; 
proves that Poe was again in Richmond early ' 
in the following year ; and an entry on Janu- 
ary 28 of the same year indicates that he 
remained in Richmond on this visit for sev- ! 
eral weeks. On May 12, 1830, Allan is 
charged with a bill of dry-goods, "p[er] j 
E. Poe," in which four blankets (evidently | 
intended for the poet's use at West Point) i 
are the leading item. 

II. 

The most obscure period in the life of Poe | 
is that of the two and a half years immedi- | 
ately following his expulsion from West i 
Point in March, 1831. That he went to Balti- i 
more shortly after leaving the Academy is 
established by a letter that he wrote to a 
Baltimore editor, William Gwynn, on May 6, | 
1831. That he was living in Baltimore in the 
autumn of 1833 is established by John P. 
Kennedy's reminiscences of him in connection 
with his winning " The Baltimore Visitor's " 
short-story prize in October, 1833. The evi- 
dence as to his whereabouts in the interven- 
ing years is conflicting. Mr. Ingram, Poe's 
English biographer, declares that the corre- 
spondence of Mrs. Clemm, aunt and mother- 
in-law of the poet, indicates that he did not 
live in Baltimore at this time. To like effect, 
also, as Professor Woodberry points out, is 
the testimony of a Baltimore cousin and 
sweetheart. Miss Elizabeth Herring. But the 
testimony of another Baltimore sweetheart, 
Miss Mary Devereaux, and of an early friend, 
Lambert A. Wilmer, is to the effect that he 
did live in Baltimore most of this time.* 

* The reminiscences of Miss Devereaux are embodied in an 
article contributed by Augustus Van Cleef to " Harper's 
Monthly " for March, 1889. Wilmer's reminiscences were 
published in the " Baltimore Commercial " of May 23, 1866, 
and in his volume, " Our Press Gang." Miss Devereaux's 
name is not mentioned by Van Cleef, but it is given by F. W. 
Thomas in his sketch of Poe on the authority of a Baltimore 
acquaintance of his, James Tuhey (see J. H. Wbitty, " Poems 
of Poe," p. xxxiv), and the identification of the two is vir- 
tually established by the Baltimore directories for the early 
thirties. Miss Devereaux asserts that she lived on Essex 
street (evidently a slip for Exeter street there was no 
Essex street in Baltimore) , next door to the home of her land- 
lord, a Mr. Newman, and that Mrs. Clemm " lived around the 
corner " in a street that crossed her own. The Baltimore 
directory for 1831 (there was no issue for 1832) represents 
the uncle of Miss Devereaux, James Devereaux (with whom, 
apparently, she lived), as making his home at 38 North Exeter 
street, and reports at the same time that Lawson Newman 
lived in Exeter street, near Wilks, and that Mrs, Clemm lived 
in Mechanic's Row, Wilks street. Before May, 1833, accord- 
ing to the directory of that year, Mrs. Clemm had moved to 
Amity street, but Newman still lived on Exeter street, and 
both Newman and the Devereaux family were living on Exeter 
street in 1835-6. 



Professor Woodberry takes the position in 
his revised life of Poe that the testimony of 
Mrs. Clemm and of Miss Herring must give 
way before the more circumstantial accounts 
of Wilmer and Miss Devereaux, and he con- 
cludes that the evidence in the case justifies 
the assumption that Poe was living in Balti- 
more throughout the period in question. An 
examination of the testimony of Wilmer and 
Miss Devereaux in the light of contemporary 
evidence not hitherto brought to bear on the 
case leads me to believe that Professor Wood- 
berry is correct, in the main, in the infer- 
ences that he draws from their testimony, but 
that he is mistaken in assuming that they 
connect Poe with Baltimore for the entire 
period. The reminiscences of these two early 
acquaintances of the poet make it reasonably 
certain that Poe lived in Baltimore from May, 
1831, to the autumn of 1832; but in my 
judgment they do not prove that he lived in 
Baltimore during the following year. 

Mr. Woodberry proceeds on the theory that 
the year of Wilmer's association with Poe 
when he saw the poet daily "for weeks to- 
gether" was 1833. "It is necessary," he 
asserts, "to connect Wilmer's recollections 
with the year 1833, and especially with its 
latter part, when Poe won the prize in the 
'VisiterV competition." But notices of the 
"Visiter" in the "Baltimore Chronicle" of 
January 6, 1832, and later dates, make it 
plain that Wilmer's connection with the 
"Visiter" began in January, 1832, with the 
establishment of that paper; and it termi- 
nated six or eight months later, as he tells us 
in his recollections, when, after a squabble 
with the proprietors of the paper, he brought 
suit against them in chancery. The Balti- 
more court records show that this suit was 
instituted on August 10, 1832, and that, after 
a preliminary trial, it was transferred, on 
September 29, to the higher courts at Annapo- 
lis. It was settled soon afterward, and about 
the same time (in the "chinkapin season," as 
Wilmer tells us, or before the end of October) 
he left Baltimore; and he was not closely 
associated with the poet again until 1834 or 
1835. 

The recollections of Miss Devereaux, which 
Professor Woodberry associates with the years 
1832-3, relate, I believe, to the years 1831-2. 
She declares that she first met the poet in the 
summer, shortly after his return from West 
Point, and that the period of her intimacy 
with him (when he called on her daily) lasted 
but a year "from summer to summer." 
She associates in time the termination of their 
intercourse with an occasion apparently re- 
ferred to also by Wilmer, that of an eve-

ning's carousal on the part of the poet with 
some West Point comrades whom he had 
chanced to meet. It would seem, then, that 
the break between the two lovers came shortly 
before Wilmer left Baltimore ; and she states 
that she did not see the poet again until sev- 
eral years after his marriage. 

We are accordingly justified, I think, in 
concluding that Poe made his home in Balti- 
more from the spring of 1831 to the autumn 
of 1832; but until further evidence is forth- 
coming, we can not be certain where he lived 
from the autumn of 1832 to the autumn of 
1833. 

There is uncertainty also as to Poe's activi- 
ties during these years. Mrs. Weiss records 
a story to the effect that he was seen on one 
occasion during his early life in Baltimore at 
work in a brick-yard. F. W. Thomas reports 

on the testimony, apparently, of another 
(see Whitty's edition of the poems, p. xxxiv) 

that he wrote for the newspapers while in 
Baltimore ; and according to the same author- 
ity he went on a voyage to Ireland at some 
time during this period. Wilmer states that 
when he knew him in 1832 he had already 
composed some of his stories. That his chief 
literary employment at this time was upon his 
stories is the view that now seems most plausi- 
ble, though he may also have had some irregu- 
lar newspaper connection. That he was at 
work on his stories then is established by the 
fact, which has escaped his biographers, that 
he published five of his tales in a Philadelphia 
weekly in the year 1832. 

On January 14, 1832, there appeared in the 
Philadelphia " Saturday Courier " his story 
" Metzengerstein." The same paper pub- 
lished on March 3, 1832, his " Due de 1'Ome- 
lette " ; this was followed on June 9 by 
"A Tale of Jerusalem"; and on November 
10 by "Loss of Breath " (under the title "A 
Decided Loss"); and on December 1 by 
"Bon-Bon" (under the title "The Bargain 
Lost"). Each of these was published anony- 
mously, and each was to be republished, in 
revised form, several years later in the 
" Southern Literary Messenger." 

The " Courier " was a weekly much after 
the order of the "Saturday Evening Post," 
its most important rival. It had been estab- 
/ished early in 1831 ; and in its issue of July 
31, 1831, it had announced a short-story con- 
test, in which a prize of one hundred dollars 
was offered. It is probable that Poe origi- 
nally submitted his tales in competition for 
this prize. According to the rules of the con- 
test, all stories submitted had to be in the 
hands of the proprietors by December 1, 1831. 
The decision of the judges was announced in 



the "Courier" on December 31, 1831: the 
prize of one hundred dollars was awarded to 
"Miss Delia S. Bacon, of the State of New 
York, author of ' The Tales of the Puritan/ 
etc.," for her story "Love's Martyr." This 
story was printed in the " Courier " on Janu- 
ary 7, 1832 ; and in the " Courier " of the fol- 
lowing week appeared " Metzengerstein." 

The revelation that Poe published some of 
his stories so early as 1832 makes it necessary 
to revise slightly the view heretofore held as 
to the time at which he began his short-story 
writing. His biographers have assumed that 
the earliest of his tales to find its way into 
print was the "MS. Found in a Bottle," pub- 
lished in the " Baltimore Visiter " in October, 
1833, and it has been supposed that he first 
became actively interested in the short story 
either in 1833 or in the preceding year. It 
now becomes plain that he began his career 
as a writer of stories not later than the au- 
tumn of 1831.

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN PARIS. 

THE NEW ACADEMY AWARDS, AND SOME OTHERS. 

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF LITERARY 

PRIZES. THE TOULOUSE FLORAL GAMES. 
(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

This is the season in France for the award- 
ing of prizes by the great and small literary 
and scientific bodies all over the country; 
and among the French, probably more than 
in any other nation, this custom flourishes. 
Next to the passion for honorific decorations, 
the thirst for being " crowned " or a " lau- 
reate" is most characteristic of this people. 
Every summer, at the end of the school year, 
the streets of Paris are thickly sprinkled 
with the children of the primary schools re- 
turning home with their proud parents, a 
wreath of artificial laurel around their young 
heads and a bundle of red-bound books under 
their arms; while at "the distribution of 
prizes" of the high-schools and colleges, the 
grown-up boys and girls are ladened to profu- 
sion with medals and volumes of every size, 
subject, and value. Thus habituated from 
their earliest childhood to this prize-giving 
and prize-accepting practice, the fashion is 
observed by both parties concerned to the 
very end of life, medals and especially money 
being the award generally conferred on the 
adults of France. 

The book-trade is largely accountable for 
the flourishing of this usage, and is one of the 
principal gainers thereby. It profits in two- 
ways. In the first place, every well regu- 



1916] 



THE DIAL

lated French publishing house has a depart- 
ment of prize books ; and in the second place, 
authors with an itch for winning these dis- 
tinctions are only too prone to print their 
books beforehand in order to accomplish this 
object the better, or to print them afterwards 
when, as manuscripts, the honor has been at- 
tained. In fact, it is the few hundred francs 
thus acquired that generally serve to pay the 
printer's bill. In either case this prize mania 
brings much grist to the publishing and print- 
ing mills of France. 

The most distinguished prize-dispenser in 
this land, and the one whose bounties and 
honors are the most sought after, is of course 
the French Academy. In fact, the annual 
ceremony in this connection is one of the chief 
events of the literary season of Paris, the 
principal number on the programme being the 
Report on the Competitions written and read 
by the Perpetual Secretary, who seizes the 
occasion to prepare a well-turned speech 
which is much enjoyed by the limited public 
crowded into the exiguous and old-fashioned 
auditorium which the venerable and conserva- 
tive Academy persists in preserving as its 
home. Thus for the year just ended, it was 
M. Etienne Lamy who held forth: and what 
he said, and said well, had a special interest 
just now, for both in 1914 and 1915 the lit- 
erary prizes of the French Academy were 
bestowed on the young writers killed in the 
service of their country. It was a touching 
ceremony, performed with all the taste and 
sentiment for which the French are distin- 
guished in functions of this kind. 

"Among death's victims," began the Per- 
petual Secretary, " some die more than others. 
The most destroyed are those who contained 
in themselves the most of life: hence it is 
that the tenderest pity goes forth to the 
youngest of those who are no more. What 
life there was in those who sixteen months ago 
went forth from the colleges to the battle- 
field! These boys whom war transformed 
into men did not have time to make a name : 
their signatures are found only at the end of 
a thesis and they are signalized only because 
they are the sons of famous parents." And 
then the orator awarded prizes, which it was 
customary in the past to confer on gray- 
beards in literature, to lads who in some 
cases scarcely had shaved the down of boy- 
hood from their upper lip. Such are Andre 
Michel, "by right of birth devoted to art" 
(his father is conservator of the Louvre 
Museum); Charles Picard. "son and grand- 
son of great mathematicians": Jean Mas- 
pero. "formed by the master of the oldest 
history" (Gaston Maspero, the Egyptologist) ; 



Lionel des Rieux, "more famous perhaps as 
the grandson of Chenier than for his ' Le 
Choeur des Muses ' " ; and then he told us of 
Allan Meeus, boy of twenty at Saint Cyr, the 
AVest Point of France, when the war broke 
out, who was the class poet and who carried 
with him to the front in his haversack his 
first and only thin little volume of verse, 
"Reves d' Amour et de Gloire" "how the 
title fits the age " ! and then he is awarded 
and what fitness here, too the Francois 
Coppee Prize. And thus were hallowed the 
names of nearly eighty young French men of 
letters. 

M. Emile Boutroux said to me after this 
memorable ceremony : 

" In order to make it perfectly clear that the 
Academy wished to honor the supreme devotion 

i of these noble young men, joined to the money 
award was a gold medal with a proper inscription 
which will perpetuate the souvenir. But the Acad- 

; emy had in mind not only the expression of the 
gratitude of the nation to those who have given 
their lives in order that the nation may remain 
free and great. Faithful to its mission to hold 
high the standard of letters, the Academy seized 
this occasion to mark what, in its eyes, character- 
izes the veritable grandeur of the man of letters. 
Pascal has said that one is charmed when, expect- 
ing to find simply an author, one discovers in ad- 
dition a man, and Vauvenargues has written this 
celebrated phrase : ' Grand thoughts come from 
the heart.' Such is the view taken by the French 
Academy. It does not look upon letters as simply 

\ a source of intellectual amusement, a more or less 
distinguished pastime. It holds that letters pene- 
trate life and reality, revealing what is most pro- 
found and best in the human soul, a power capable 
of lessening the woes of humanity and of lifting 
up the heart towards an ideal. Hence it is that 
the French Academy has found a peculiar attrac- 
tion in crowning these men of letters who have 
well served their country, seeing in them not only 
true patriots but writers who have fulfilled to the 
uttermost limit their role as men of letters by unit- 
ing the virtues of the man to the talents of the 
intellect." 

And the Academy of Sciences, though by 
its nature further removed from the troubles 
of the hour, has not shown itself, in awarding 
its prizes during the past two years, wholly 
oblivious to the war. In 1914 it gave a prize 
of 15.000 francs to the military hospital 
opened by the Institute in the former Thiers 
mansion in the Place St. Georges, given to 
the Institute some years ago by the historian's 
family; and at its recent annual Public 
Meeting, the retiring president, M. Edmond 
Perrier, the naturalist, conferred prizes on 
fifteen young scientists killed in battle. "I 
know." he said, among other things, " a grand 
scientific establishment ninety of whose mem- 
bers are at the front " ; and M. Camille Jordan,

[Feb. 17 



the distinguished mining engineer, who suc- 
ceeded him as president for 1916, was received 
by the audience with the warmest marks of 
sympathy when it was known that he had had 
his three sons killed in battle. 

But the prizes of this Academy are inter- 
esting for other than military reasons. Such 
is the Breant Prize of 100,000 francs, which 
awaits "the person who finds the way of 
curing Asiatic cholera and who discovers the 
cause of this terrible curse." Another 100,- 

000 francs stands ready for " the person who 
solves the problem of communicating with a 
star other than the planet Mars," and the 
donor adds with much good sense : " Fore- 
seeing that this prize cannot be given immedi- 
ately, the founder has expressed the wish that 
until then, the interest on the capital be 
employed every five years as a prize for a 
French or foreign scientist who has contrib- 
uted something of importance towards the 
progress of astronomy." The Osiris triennial 
prize is for the same amount of money and is 
on somewhat similar lines, " for a discovery 
or very remarkable work in science, letters, 
arts, or industry, and in a general way, in 
everything of public interest." A less pre- 
tentious but very practical prize is that pro- 
vided by one of the female descendants of 
Laplace, a complete set of the great astrono- 
mer's works for the young man who each 
year stands at the head of his class at the 
famous Paris Polytechnic School, whose foun- 
dation was largely due to the efforts of 
Laplace. The widow of a certain other scien- 
tist displays less good taste when she pro- 
vides an annual prize " for a young scientist 
whose work has been overlooked," on condi- 
tion that "the recipient visits the tomb of 
her husband at Montparnasse cemetery the 
month following the award." The act of 
" John Sanf ord Saltus, a New York artist " 

1 copy this time from the official list of the 
Academy of Fine Arts does not seem to be 
very happy, either, for he offers " an annual 
prize of a hundred dollars to the painter of a 
battle picture exhibited at the Paris Salon." 
The son of Henner improves on this, for he 
has arranged to have an annual sum of 9000 
francs divided equally among three young 
men leaving the Academy of France at Rome 
and to be given to them during three years, 
until they get started in their artistic career. 
Often the prize is not only richly merited but 
very helpful, as was the case when the poor 
old entomologist, the late J. H. Fabre, was 
awarded a 2000 franc prize ; and when M. 
Gaillot, who is now over eighty and was one 
of Leverrier's faithful assistants, was re- 
membered in a similar way, because he had 



promised the great astronomer, almost on his 
dying bed, that the tables of Jupiter, Saturn, 
Neptune, and Uranus would be carefully re- 
vised, and this great task M. Gaillot has now 
accomplished. The French Academy grants 
certain awards for the promotion of music 
and dramatic arts which are also worthy of 
approval. Thus, M. Alfred Poizat, the author 
of " Sophonisbe," and M. Gustave Guiches, 
the author of "Vouloir," both recently given 
at the Theatre francais, each received this 
year the Toirac Prize, which carried with it 
4000 francs, while the Emile Augier Prize of 
5000 francs was awarded to Mile. Marie 
Leneru for her " Les Affranchis," given with 
success at the Odeon. 

This appetite for prizes comes out well in 
the history of the Paris Society of Men of 
Letters (Societe des Gens de Lettres), which 
was established in 1838 originally for the 
unique purpose of having a care for the copy- 
right interests of authors. But as early as 
1852 the prevalent craving began to show it- 
self, when Baron Tremont founded the first 
prize, and now at the end of each year the 
committee awards something like a score. 
During the past month a new one has been 
announced; the talented artist, M. Henri 
Nocq, has just composed a medal to be named 
in honor of the late Paul Hervieu, which 
M. Georges Lecomte, the president, states 
"will be distributed on very rare occasions." 
Speaking of the prize-giving by this society, 
M. Paul Souday said to me recently : " Here 
the objections to the custom are more legiti- 
mate than in the case of the French Academy, 
where, as a rule, the best writers of France 
sit as judges, whereas the committee of the 
Society of Men of Letters is not chosen with 
this aim in view." A young writer, M. 
Florian-Parmentier, is still severer on this 
custom than is M. Souday. In his recent 
book, "Histoire Contemporaine des Lettres 
Franchises" (Paris: Figuiere, 5 francs), a 
book which, by the way, should be in the 
hands of everyone who wishes to understand 
the complex literature of the France of to- 
day, he considers these prizes the equivalent 
of the old-time pensions, and condemns them 
because they are awarded to intriguing and 
begging candidates, and go even to writers 
who are rich. In a letter which I have just 
received from him written from the army, 
where he is a marechal des logis, he says: 
" The Society of Men of Letters has just given 
me a prize for my last book ! " The exclama- 
tion mark is mine. But M. Salomon Reinach 
takes issue with M. Florian-Parmentier : 

" This is all nonsense. It may happen that a 
rich man writes a good book and gets a prize, but

THE DIAL

nobody on the committee I have often served on 
them in my Academy of Inscriptions ever en- 
quires if a book is by a Croesus or an Irus; that 
concerns nobody. But a more serious objection to 
the system arises from the fact that the number 
of prizes in the French Academy is now so large 
that the members of the different committees can 
not possibly read all the books sent in; so it hap- 
pens that some volumes get prizes because the 
author is said to be in great want, because the 
title seems serious, or because the work has been 
highly ' recommended.' Some fifteen years ago a 
Protestant paper in Paris complained because a 
goody-goody book had been given a prize, though 
it contained a panegyric of the Massacre of St. 
Bartholomew. I went and saw in the matter the 
then Perpetual Secretary, Boissier, whose ances- 
tors had been Protestants, and who told me that 
the report on that very book had been drawn up 
by Ludovic Halevy, who was of Jewish descent, 
but who, being overwhelmed with books for prizes, 
'had only just peeped into this one and had not 
read it through.' That may happen often enough. 
It does happen also that splendid original work, 
like that of Loisy, is not rewarded because relig- 
ious prejudice, still very strong in the Academy, 
objects to it. But judging things fairly, prizes are 
a very good institution. In the first place, they 
make it possible to reward very worthy writers 
whose books create no sensation and who need this 
support and this recommendation to the reading 
public. Again, these awards enable impecunious 
scholars to publish at their own expense learned 
works, which without this aid would bring them 
into debt. And in the matter of the ' virtue ' 
prizes, they bring honor and a little money to 
faithful children, nurses, and the like, who have 
nothing to expect elsewhere of a pecuniary nature. 
The great enemies of the prize system are those 
who do not get them, either because their work is 
bad or because it is too good and is in advance of 
the times." 

Nor does M. Gustave Geffroy, President of 
the Goncourt Academy, disapprove of the cus- 
tom, at least in so far as his body is con- 
cerned. " I consider the Goncourt Prize," he 
once wrote to me, " very useful in vivifying 
the love of letters, now more than ever essen- 
tial to civilization. And then I may say that 
our literary group is absolutely independent." 
But M. Paul Margueritte, also of the Gon- 
eourt Academy, is, as I know, a little more 
critical of the custom : 

"Personally I am not very favorable; but yet 
we should not overlook the difficulties which writers 
encounter at the start, the almost total absence 
to-day of any really sound literary criticism, and 
the venality of the press. Nor should we forget 
that the Goncourt Prize 5,000 francs each year 
to some young writer of talent, a novelist by pref- 
erence becomes a real advertisement for him and 
his book. Again, it should be noted that this prize 
has not given ground for the objections which 
might have been feared, the imitation of a genre 
and the danger that candidates might adopt a 



manner that would render them surer of securing 
the coveted honor. The astonishing variety of the 
books which have won the Goncourt Prize proves 
the correctness of my statement." 

It seems that the origin of this institution 
I refer now more to the literary prizes 
is to be found in the so-called Floral Games 
established in Toulouse more than a century 
before America was discovered ; while for the 
virtue prizes, I suppose Baron de Montyon 
(1733-1820) may be considered their author. 
Each year the Toulouse Academy celebrates 
its traditional Fete des Fleurs, the poetic 
name given to the ceremony organized by the 
equally poetically named Academic des Jeux 
Floreaux. The event is a mixture of litera- 
ture, sentiment, and religion. The day opens 
with a eulogy of Clemence Isaure, that noble 
dame of Toulouse who has a more or less 
mythical existence far back in the fifteenth 
century, and who is believed to have re- 
founded the Floral Games, though ruthless 
modern criticism has tried to play havoc with 
this, as with so many other charming legends. 
But in spite of the learned doctors, the Acad- 
emy very sensibly continues the pretty wonts 
of the past. Thus, after the delivery of the 
eulogy, a committee of academicians goes to 
fetch the gold and silver flowers which have 
been exhibited since early morning on the 
chief altar of Notre-Dame la Daurade, where, 
according to tradition, Clemence Isaure lies 
buried. During the absence of this commit- 
tee, the report on the year's competitions is 
read; and on the arrival of the flowers, the 
awards are made. The quality of the flowers 
is quite in keeping with the good taste of the 
whole performance. Thus, the gold violet is 
valued at 750 francs, and the one in silver at 
250; the gold eglantine, 450 francs, and the 
amaranth, 400. And the meaning of the 
flowers is accentuated by the rule of the 
Academy that the exchange of a flower for 
its money value is not a right enjoyed by the 
successful candidates ; and when it is granted, 
the laureate may receive in specie only four- 
fifths of the real value of the flower. The 
wide popularity of these Toulouse prize con- 
tests is shown by the fact that in the recent 
one for French poetry, the Academy, the 
Perpetual Secretary informs me, received 70 
odes, 77 ordinary poems, 15 epistles, 2 rhymed 
discourses, 4 eclogues, 17 idyls, 31 elegies, 18 
ballads, 14 fables, 46 sonnets and 12 hymns in 
honor of the Virgin, 277 irregular sonnets, 58 
poems on aviation, and 277 miscellaneous 
poems, over 900 in all! But the labor of 
the Toulouse academicians is much lessened 
by the rule that " no poem may contain more 
than two hundred lines."

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 17 



The Toulouse competitions in langue d'oc 
are particularly interesting, there in the old 
home of the Troubadours. Of course the 
number of the competitors is much smaller 
and their learning on a higher level than is 
generally the case with the candidates for the 
ordinary literary prizes. At the last contest, 
126 persons took part, and among those who 
won flowers were three college professors, one 
from Cyrano's town, Bergerac, and one a 
priest from the Cantal. The official circular 
of the Academy thus defines the langue d'oc 
of to-day : " The romance language of Upper 
Languedoc and its environs, Lengo Moundino, 
with its diverse variants, of which the Tou- 
louse dialect will be considered as the type in 
the decisions of the Academy." The competi- 
tors are requested to accompany their manu- 
scripts with a translation in French, to state 
which dialect they make use of, and to put at 
the top of their manuscripts the name of their 
commune, canton, and department. So Jas- 
min, who died over a half century ago, might 
still exclaim, likening his dear patois to a 
mother, with the grace and fire which made 
him famous, if he could speak from the top of 
his monument in his picturesque old Agen : 

" De sabens francimans, 

La coundannon a mort dezumpey tres-cens ans; 
Tapla biou saquela ; tapla sous mots brounzinon ; 
Chez elo, las sazous passon, sonon, tindinon; 
Et cent-milo-miles enquero y passaran, 

Sounaran et tindinaran!"

sounding and ringing.]

CASUAL COMMENT. 



KINDLY HUMOR AS AN ATTRIBUTE OF CULTURE 
in its highest sense has often received the 
praise it so richly deserves ; and now, inciden- 
tally, in an article on " The German Mind " 
published in " The Hibbert Journal " for the 
current quarter, Professor George Trumbull 
Ladd says another good word for it. The con- 
nection in which it is uttered may perhaps be 
held to disqualify it for quotation on the part 
of a judicious editor of a purely literary 
journal; but this difficulty may be obviated 
by inviting the reader to transpose or other- 
wise change at will the national designations 
used by the writer. It is the general princi- 
ple, not its specific illustration, that here 



solicits approval. Professor Ladd writes: 
" It is no new discovery in literary criticism 
that the comic thought of modern Germany, 
whether expressed in words or in pictorial 
form, is for the most part devoid of the deli- 
cacy of the French and the kindliness of the 
English. But, to quote a fine characterisa- 
tion from a modern English writer: 'Your 
sense of humour, that delicate percipience of 
proportion, that subrident check on impulse, 
that touch of the divine fellowship, is a thing 
of mellower growth. It is a solvent and not 
an excitant. It does not stimulate to sublime 
effort ; but it can cool raging passion. It can 
take the salt from tears, the bitterness from 
judgment, the keenness from despair.' That 
the typical Prussian is capable of being stimu- 
lated to ' sublime effort,' and of accomplishing 
many praiseworthy and glorious deeds, the 
history of Prussia through all its past, and 
the history which is to-day being made by a 
Prussianized Germany, evinces abundantly. 
At the same time there is less and less evi- 
dence, whether in words or in conduct, of that 
delicate 'percipience of proportion, that sub- 
rident check on impulse, that touch of the 
divine fellowship ' with human frailty, which 
result from 'the mellower growth' of the 
sense of humour." A good and expressive 
term, whether in respect to literary work or 
painting or sculpture or other form of crea- 
tive art, or in reference to the art that is 
above all these, the art of daily conduct, is 
" artistic detachment " ; and this detachment 
implies something of that genial humor, that 
freedom from passion, that conquest of selfish 
emotions, which Professor Ladd evidently has 
in mind in the foregoing passage. 

THE SHORT LIFE OF A LIBRARY BUILDING 

short as compared with the builders' confident 
expectation of many decades of usefulness for 
their imposing structure is a thing of fre- 
quent remark. If the building does not have 
to give place to a larger within a dozen or at 
most a score of years, it commonly needs 
enlargement and modernizing, so rapid is the 
increase in its patronage and so constant the 
development of new processes and appliances 
and activities. It seems but yesterday, as the 
phrase goes, that the present writer was 
escorted over the Amherst College Library 
building and invited to admire its modern 
system of book-stacks (by no means filled with 
books) and other equipments, all up to the 
minute in newness and unsurpassability. Yet 
that building has now long been the despair 
of its users because of its inadequacy its 
hopeless state of congestion and its increas- 
ing inability to meet the demands made upon

it. Great, therefore, is the rejoicing at this 
New England college over the recent an- 
nouncement of a quarter-million gift from 
some source for a new structure. Work on 
the plans of such a building was started some 
time ago, in anticipation of an early answer 
to Amherst's prayers, so that the operations 
of carpenter and mason can begin with little 
delay. But who would dare to prophesy that 
even those of us who are no longer young will 
not live to hear a renewed clamor from the 
Deerfield valley for a new library building 
where, not so very long ago, Mr. Fletcher 
was in proud control of the very latest thing 
in bibliothecal architecture and equipment ? 



RESUSCITATING A DEAD LANGUAGE may fairly 
be reckoned a desperate undertaking. To 
have life and spontaneity, speech must be 
acquired with little or no conscious effort. 
Any attempt to revive the Cornish, for ex- 
ample, or other extinct Celtic dialect, though 
a praiseworthy enterprise from a philological 
viewpoint, cannot be expected to accomplish 
great results. But the very difficulty of such 
undertakings must add to their attractiveness 
for those whose mission it is to lead forlorn 
hopes. Every once in a while the assertion is 
hazarded that Latin is not a dead language, 
and elaborate proof is offered of its present- 
day vitality. For instance, a few weeks ago 
the Czar of Bulgaria greeted the Kaiser of 
Germany at Nish in a ceremonious address, 
all in Latin ; and the world was called upon 
to recognize and appreciate the propriety of 
this choice of the tongue of Caesar and Cicero 
on the site of the old Roman fortress of Nissa. 
A neutral language was required, and the dig- 
nified and sonorous Latin answered the need. 
In our own country, in the city of New York, 
there is a Societas Gentium Latina, its moving 
spirit Dr. Arcadius Avellanus, who learned 
the language colloquially as a boy in Hun- 
gary, and its president Dr. Herbert C. de V. 
Cornwell, who believes Latin to be the most 
perfect speech ever spoken by tongue of man. 
There is a Latin Printing Press Company in 
Philadelphia, and from it have come works 
of modern literature in ancient dress. Dr. 
Avellanus, again, is the leader in this move- 
ment to make Latin as easy and delightful to 
learn as French or Italian or Spanish. In 
recent years he has had an enthusiastic and 
munificent patron in Mr. E. Parmalee Pren- 
tice, originator and publisher of the "Mount 
Hope Classics." volume three of which is 
noticed more at length on another page. Mr. 
Prentice's intelligent activity in the so-called 
Amherst movement for the promotion of 
classical studies is well known. Some vears 



ago a famous English schoolmaster visited 
this country to demonstrate the success of his 
system of training pupils in Latin by the con- 
versational method; and he made a highly 
favorable impression. These and other zeal- 
ous attempts to preserve and perpetuate some- 
thing of what has been considered the best in 
a liberal education are deserving of warm 
praise and hearty encouragement. 



A VAST STOREHOUSE OF POETRY, in the 

" new " manner, is contained in the country's 
commercial and journalistic records. Here is 
a field overflowing with unsuspected (and un- 
suspecting) bards, a garden of poesy so 
boundless and luxuriant that the future an- 
thologist may well despair when he comes to 
cull his bouquet of blossoms from its confines. 
As examples of the treasure trove existent in 
this hitherto unworked mine of vers libre, the 
following lyrics have lately been offered : 

I. 
" Railroad stocks 

More than held 

Yesterday's gains 

At the opening this morning, 

3,000 shares of Pennsylvania, for example, 

Appearing on the tape 

At an advance 

Of li/i points." 

II. 
" Children 

Under five years of age 

"Will be carried free 

When accompanied by parent 

Or guardian : 

Five years of age and under twelve, 

Half fare; 

Twelve years of age 

Or over, 

Full fare." 



TWO WAYS TO INDUCE A LOVE OF THE BEST 

BOOKS are recognized in Portland, Oregon, as 
elsewhere; but the two methods are at va- 
riance and have each its separate advocates. 
The public librarian of Portland, Oregon, 
writes in the course of her annual report of 
progress at the institution over which she 
presides : " There are two opinions among 
teachers and also among librarians regarding 
the methods to be used in developing a love 
for good literature. One group holds that 
the ' working up ' book is essential and that 
it must be within easy reach of the student. 
The other group believes that standards are 
set only by contact with the best, and that 
the mediocre book is overestimated and 
should be used as 'bait' only with the most 
difficult cases." The Portland authorities 
have adopted the heroic course of interdicting 
the second-rate and the commonplace in their 



152

ordering of the young people's reading. Sta- 
tistics of circulation are expected to suffer, 
but what of that? What will it profit a boy 
if he get ecstasies of delight from " Nick Car- 
ter " and lose his capacity to enjoy Scott and 
Dickens and Shakespeare ? "Literature teach- 
ers," says the high-minded librarian already 
quoted, "are said to be the devoted cham- 
pions of a lost cause; the high-school libra- 
rians should share in the battle and help to 
sustain their faith in the capacity of their 
pupils to enjoy the best things." The "work- 
ing up" method would win more confidence 
if it were not for the hundreds of thousands 
who are started so promisingly on that ascend- 
ing ladder, but never get higher than the 
lowest rung or two. 



OUR COPYRIGHT BUSINESS shows a rapid in- 
crease since the reorganization of the office in 
1897. In the current Report of the Librarian 
of Congress the Register of Copyrights an- 
nounces that the yearly fees received in his 
office have more than doubled since 1897, 
passing the hundred-thousand-dollar mark in 
the fiscal year following the passage of the 
new copyright law, which took effect July 1, 
1909, and amounting to nearly one hundred 
and twelve thousand dollars in the last fiscal 
year. This means, of course, a corresponding 
increase in the total number of books and other 
items copyrighted. In the twelve months end- 
ing June 30, 1914, 20,296 volumes printed in 
this country were copyrighted ; also 1894 vol- 
umes that were printed abroad in a foreign 
language; 25,696 pamphlets, leaflets, etc.; 
49,696 numbers of periodicals ; 40,437 musical 
compositions; and 6596 motion-picture pho- 
toplays. The last-named productions have 
increased in number very rapidly since the 
first entry of 160 in the records of 1912-13. 
On the other hand, musical and dramatic com- 
positions and foreign books have greatly 
fallen off of late, the decline in both instances 
being probably attributable to the same de- 
plorable cause, the great war. English works 
registered for "ad interim copyright" also 
show a considerable and easily intelligible 
decrease, as do also works of art and repro- 
ductions of such works. The encouraging fea- 
ture in the whole display is the uninterrupted 
growth of our domestic literary activity. 



A GIFTED BOOKMAN, and most generous in the 
use he made of his gifts, was the late Edward 
Tiffany, who died recently at nearly ninety 
years of age after a life largely devoted to lit- 
erature and to library work, but who left 
behind him nothing in printed form to pre- 
serve his name from quick oblivion; and, 



indeed, that name will be looked for in vain in 
the handbooks of contemporary biography to 
which one naturally turns in any attempt to 
write his fitting obituary. But from one who 
knew him well it is learned that Mr. Tiffany 
was the son of Osmond Tiffany, of Baltimore, 
a merchant and manufacturer, whose fortune 
was lost in the panic of 1873. Edward, thrown 
upon his own resources in middle life by this 
family disaster, found his true vocation in 
books. After some years of library service in 
his native city he was called to the Boston Pub- 
lic Library, where for a generation he placed 
his wide knowledge of literature at the service 
of all who chose to consult him. Unlike the 
typical bookman, he cared nothing for first 
editions or other similar rarities. To him the 
outside of a book, its mere form or age or cost- 
liness, . meant nothing; but with the matter 
that books contained he had an astonishingly 
intimate acquaintance. All branches of polite 
literature and even some departments of the 
literature of science were familiar to him, and 
he was exceptionally well versed in music and 
the drama. Such was the modest gentleman 
who placed thousands in his debt during his 
long connection with one of our foremost pub- 
lic libraries; and a more than perfunctory 
tribute of respect is due him in reviewing, 
however inadequately, the main facts of his 

long and useful life. 



A NOTABLE DIARY, recently acquired by the 
Division of Manuscripts of the Library of 
Congress, and described by Dr. Gaillard 
Hunt, Chief of that Division, in the latest 
Report of the Librarian, is a voluminous 
composition (25 volumes) from the pen of 
Edmund Ruffin, and covers the ten years, 
1856-1865. Dr. Hunt says of Ruffin and his 
diary : " He was a man of a high order of 
talent, a successful scientific farmer on a large 
scale, an author especially on agricultural 
subjects a slaveholder, and a firm believer 
in the economic system of the South. He was 
an intense believer in state rights, and was 
selected to fire the first gun against Fort 
Sumter, April 12, 1861 (he being then a mem- 
ber of a South Carolina regiment) . He kept 
a voluminous diary during the whole period 
of the Civil War, giving the march of events 
and his own views upon them, from day to 
day. It presents faithfully his extreme point 
of view and is a document of peculiar value. 
At the close of the War, on June 18, 1865, 
being then 71 years of age, poor, and infirm 
in health, and not wishing to live under the 
government which had conquered his state, he 
committed suicide. The last entry in his 
diary was made on the day of this tragic

event." An abridged edition of this diary 
ought to be worth publishing as a book of 
rather unusual historical if not also romantic 
and pathetic interest. 



PROHIBITIONS FOR POETS are formulated, to 
the number of sixteen, by Mr. Arthur Guiter- 
man and printed in the New York "Times." 
Of these negative injunctions, all beginning 
with "Don't," and all uttered in the interest 
of poets whom material considerations do not 
allow to cultivate poetry merely for pleasure, 
the following are especially noteworthy: 
" Don't think of yourself as a poet, and don't 
dress for the part. . . Don't call your quar- 
ters a garret or a studio. Do n't frequent ex- 
clusively the company of writers. Do n't think 
of any class of work that you feel moved to do 
as either beneath you or above you. Don't 
complain of lack of appreciation. . . Don't 
speak of poetic license or believe that there is 
any such thing. Don't tolerate in your own 
work any flaws in rhythm, rhyme, melody, 
or grammar. Don't use 'e'er' for 'ever,' 
'whenas' or 'what time' for 'when,' or any 
of the 'poetical' commonplaces of the past. 
. . Do n't omit articles or prepositions for the j 
sake of the rhythm. Don't have your book | 
published at your own expense by any house 
that makes a practice of publishing at the 
author's expense. . . Don't, don't write hymns 
to the Great God Pan. He is dead, let him 

rest in peace." 



THE POCOMOKE WAY of securing the bless- 
ings of good literature for smaller communi- 
ties has its admirable features. At Pocomoke 
City, Maryland, the public library has no 
building of its own, nor any very large collec- 
tion of books to require such a building. It 
received the offer of the disused Pennsylvania 
Railroad station, but could obtain no suitable 
site- for the building, and consequently was j 
forced to refuse it. Its quarters, rent-free 
and provided with heat and light, are in the 
so-called Fireman's Building. Not long ago. 
as we read in the Maryland Public Library 
Commission's Biennial Report, "a play was 
given by the children of the town under a 
professional trainer. They cleared $40.00. i 
With this fund two Crex rugs, a reading ! 
table, three straight-back chairs, a wicker | 
rocker, and 97 new books were purchased." 
Ninety-seven new books (note the adjective), 
and a variety of articles contributory to the 
more enjoyable use of those books, all for | 
forty dollars, is not a bad record ; it is library 
economy, in a very literal sense, carried to its 
utmost limit. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

BACONIAN ANTICS. COBIOLANUS'S SLIP 

OF MEMORY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In his defence of Mr. Baxter's " solid work " on 
the Bacon-Shakespeare question (THE DIAL, Jan. 
20, 1916), Mr. E. B. Lupton reminds your read- 
ers, with the usual Baconian disregard for truth, 
that I corrected Mr. Baxter "on one or two 
minor points" regarding Shakespeare's applica- 
tion for a coat-of-arms. As a matter of fact, I 
showed that Mr. Baxter knew nothing about the 
subject, had not investigated the matter, and had 
contented himself with reproducing and distorting 
a part of Sir Sidney Lee's absurd account of the 
transaction. I made no pretence to proving my 
"hero's claim to the authorship of the plays." 
Shakespeare's title is in no danger, and needs no 
defence. The Baconians, and other anti-WiUians, 
assuming that a man who did anything so dis- 
honorable as to conspire to be made a " gentleman," 
could not have written great poetry, always cite the 
Shakespeare application for a coat-of-arms and 
put the most discreditable interpretation on the 
incomplete data available to us, thinking thereby 
to prove that he could not have been the author of 
" Hamlet," " Lear," etc. By disproving their 
calumnies I destroy the prop on which they build 
their edifice. 

Mr. Lupton is not telling the truth when he says 
that none of Shakespeare's contemporaries, "with 
possibly one exception, identifies the author 
[Shakespeare] with the Stratford actor, and this 
possible exception is by no means a clear excep- 
tion." He refers to John Davies's poem in which 
Shakespeare is spoken of as " our English Ter- 
ence," and says that if the Terence plays were the 
work of Caius Laelius then Davies's allusion 
"suggests a pseudonym." This, then, proves 
nothing, and may be equivocal. It is amazing what 
wizardry an "if" exerts upon a Baconian. But 
has Mr. Lupton forgotten Ben Jonson's wholly 
unequivocal identification of Shakespeare with 
Stratford? And has he overlooked the testimony 
of Shakespeare's monument in Stratford? And 
Leonard Digges's poetic reference in the first col- 
lected edition of Shakespeare's works (1623) to 
the poet's " Stratford monument " ? 

I will concede to Mr. Lupton that a stringing 
together of a (large) number of passages in praise 
of George Eliot's works would lead us to the con- 
clusion that "the author of the novels must have 
been a man of that name." But only in the 
absence of evidence to the contrary. But in Shake- 
speare's case there is not a particle of evidence to 
the contrary, and therefore absolutely no sane rea- 
son for doubting his authorship. Besides, the 
Shakespeare allusions speak of the man as well as 
of his works. 

Mr. Lupton is at his best when he maintains that 
Mr. Wallace " unwittingly proved conclusively that 
the actor [Shakespeare] was unable to write, be- 
cause his name [in the Bellott-Mountjoy affidavit] 
is written by a law clerk in law script, and the 
deponent [Shakespeare] made his mark beneath 



154

this signature." No human being outside of a 
lunatic asylum, or a fit candidate for one, who has 
ever seen a facsimile of the deposition and the wit- 
ness's signature can for a single moment entertain 
the belief that the abbreviated signature was writ- 
ten by the clerk who wrote the deposition. No 
sane person who knows anything of graphiology 
can for a moment doubt that the signature in ques- 
tion is an unquestioned Shakespeare autograph; 
and that the deposition as well as the signa- 
ture are in the hand-writing that was in general 
use at the time. Has Mr. Lupton mistaken the 
lex scripta for " law script " ? Furthermore, what 
Mr. Lupton calls a " mark " beneath the signature 
is only a small blot. Had the witness not been 
able to sign his name, the clerk would have written 
the name, and would have written the words " his 
mark" between the Christian name and the sur- 
name, in accordance with general usage. 

I wish to assure Mr. Lupton that I am not at all 
displeased with the Baconians for distinguishing 
between " Shakspere " and " Shakespeare." I 
have yet to see any evidence that " Shakespeare " 
was a pseudonym. As to Mr. Lupton's confident 
assertion that " Shakspere " and " Shakespeare " 
are essentially different names, I venture to say 
that his confidence is probably in inverse propor- 
tion to his knowledge of the subject. 

Miss Porter's defence (also contained in your 
issue of January 20) of what may be regarded as 
the current interpretation of Coriolanus's failure 
to recollect the name of the " poor man " in whose 
home he had found a lodging and whose kindness 
he wished to reward by saving him from possibly 
being sold to slavery confirms me in my own inter- 
pretation of the incident (THE DIAL, Dec. 23, 
1915). 

I cannot agree with Miss Porter when she says 
that " to make Coriolanus forget the name . . 
is one of those multitudinous trifles of invention 
that speak eloquently of the characterizing and 
humanizing genius of Shakespeare." " To forget 
the name while remembering the deed of a benefac- 
tor at a time when most men would be full only of 
themselves " does not strike me as one of the char- 
acteristics of the human soul. Coriolanus would 
have been just as human had he remembered the 
name or succeeded in recollecting it. We must not 
lose sight of the fact that Shakespeare departs 
from Plutarch in introducing the hero's lapse of 
memory. The poor man's freedom, we fear, was 
not very dear to Coriolanus, who was probably 
more solicitous about the effect his display of mag- 
nanimity and freedom from sordidness made upon 
the many there assembled. 

Miss Porter points out that Shakespeare's " cun- 
ning " kept back until now the f aintness mentioned 
by Plutarch earlier. This is quite true, but there is 
absolutely nothing in the scene to show that any- 
body noticed any evidence of faintness or weakness 
in Coriolanus until he himself mentions it as an 
excuse a poor excuse is better than none for 
having forgotten his benefactor's name. Our hero's 
words and actions are quite lusty throughout. In 
Plutarch it was " the Komans " who noticed that he 



was " faint with the great wounds he had upon 
him." 

I am not sure that I understand Miss Porter's 
assertion that Coriolanus " forgot because his very 
capacity to remember within his wounded head was 
faint for loss of blood." Scalp wounds do not 
affect the memory more than wounds of other parts 
of the body. Nor does a hemorrhage from the 
scalp or elsewhere conduce to the forgetting of 
men's names more than of men's actions. Corio- 
lanus's memory seems to have suffered no impair- 
ment as to other, and less essential, details. 

" The blood has ceased to flow, is drying, a token 
of its exhaustion implying the need of care and 
nourishment." I can hardly believe that Miss Por- 
ter has so completely forgotten her physiology. 
The clotting of blood is not a token of its exhaus- 
tion, and this fact cannot therefore be adduced as 
evidence of Coriolanus's enfeeblement to the point 
of forgetting men's names. Cominius's remark 
" The blood upon your visage dries ; 't is time It 
should be look'd to " which Miss Porter mis- 
interpreted, means no more than that it is a long 
time since Coriolanus's wounds had been inflicted 
and that they ought to receive a surgeon's attention. 
His words do not, therefore, " reinforce the ex- 
planation " offered by Coriolanus. 

Miss Porter, I regret to say, has wholly misun- 
derstood my communication, and has consequently 
woefully misrepresented my views. She attributes 
to me the utterly untenable statement that " Corio- 
lanus forgot [the name] . . because he scorned 
to remember [it]." I did not say this, or imply it. 
To scorn something is a conscious act; whereas 
Coriolanus's lapse of memory, as I tried to show r 
was unconsciously determined. He himself did not 
know why he could not recall the name, and was as 
much surprised as chagrined at his forgetting. 
This does away with Miss Porter's strictures about 
" the sincerity of the scene and the characters." 

We are asked, too, by your correspondent to 
remember that Shakespeare " prepared earlier for 
a special loss of blood in the head. This dauntless 
hero took his wounds headlong, confronting the 
foe." Does this mean that Coriolanus butted the 
Volscians with his head and thus received his in- 
juries? There is absolutely no warrant for Miss 
Porter's diagnosis of " loss of blood in the head." 
A cerebral or intracranial hemorrhage would have 
rendered our hero unconscious on the battle-field, 
and would have made his appearance and his 
robustious oratory so shortly thereafter wholly 
impossible. 

To an Elizabethan audience the fact that the 
Volscian was described as " poor " would have been 
sufficient indication that he was a plebeian. That 
he was " noble of nature " is Miss Porter's assump- 
tion; Shakespeare says nothing about it, although 
Plutarch does describe the man as " honest." 

Would Shakespeare have troubled to introduce 
so slight, so unobtrusive, so subtle a touch into the 
portraiture of so striking a character as Corio- 
lanus? That he would is proved by the fact that 
he did so. He did not avoid perhaps could not 
help introducing slips of the tongue and other 
similar touches into his dramatic compositions. His

own unconscious insight into the minds of men 
made him do these things. He probably never 
stopped to think that some of his finest touches 
would escape his audiences and his readers, oh, 
yes! he had readers in mind, many of whom to 
this day look upon him through the very common- 
sense spectacles of Peter Bell, to whom a primrose 
was a yellow primrose and nothing more.

Xew York, Feb. 5, 1916. 



LOXGFELLOW AND MENDELSSOHN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Pray let a humble Bostonian thank Mr. Hervey 
for his eminently sensible defence of Longfellow 
and, incidentally, of Mendelssohn. I have often, 
in the same way, compared Longfellow and Men- 
delssohn; the parallel is almost perfect. I should 
not have mentioned the " Elijah," for I agree with 
many of the critics that it is more nearly fustian 
than anything else that Mendelssohn composed. 
But the " St. Paul " holds its own perfect as a 
statue by Phidias as the purest, heavenliest of 
all oratorios. 

Not long ago an artist was at my house, and was 
combatting my dictum that the poet and the com- 
poser were each equally suffering from a tem- 
porary eclipse or obscuration. I got down the 
" Kiverside Edition " of Longfellow's poems and 
read to him some of the sonnets, beginning with 
those relating to Dante; and I waxed as eloquent 
as my limited vocabulary would permit over their 
perfect form, their exquisite melody, their splendid 
climaxes. " You have converted me." he said, and 
he carried off with him that charming little book 
enshrining all Longfellow's sonnets. 

" The Psalm of Life " has become banal, perhaps, 
through too much familiarity and too many paro- 
dies; but if one has the imagination to put oneself 
back into the early day when it first appeared, one 
can feel something of the thrill which it caused, and 
one can understand why it was a trumpet-call to 
the youth of that period. 

Almost all poetry consists of a certain amount 
of wood-pulp, and when the vital sap dries up to 
a greater or less extent one can discover why it is 
that the collected works of popular contempora- 
neous writers are allowed to collect dust on the 
shelves while only a line or two or a single stanza 
satisfies our own demand or finds its place in the 
dictionaries of quotations. But there is a good deal 
of sweet juicy poesy still mellowing the work of 
Longfellow. " The Children's Hour " and a dozen 
others of his lyrics are simple, sincere, and melo- 
dious. 

Mr. W. S. Braithwaite, in his review and ap- 
praisement of the poetry of the year 1914, denied 
that the six American poets Bryant, Emerson, 
Whittier. Longfellow, Holmes, and Lowell gen- 
erally regarded as " great " deserve that epithet. 
They are good poets, he said, but not great; and 
he proceeded to instance Poe, Whitman, Lanier, 
Moody, Hovey, and Miss Anna Branch as really 
great. I sent a letter of protest to " Poetry : A 
Magazine of Verse," which Miss Monroe returned 
with the declaration that Poe stood a hundred or a 



thousand times higher than Longfellow! (We 
know how she regards Bryant.) Comparisons are 
odorous, and it little profits to make such distinc- 
tions. Poe's influence on French literature de- 
serves a special essay; but Poe's lyric in which 
occur the memorable lines 

" The glory that was Greece 

And the grandeur that was Rome " 
is marred by the most banal run-on line (ending 
with " which " to rhyme with " window-niche ") to 
be found anywhere. A careful study of Poe's 
verse surprises one by the mediocrity of its aver- 
age, and by the limited number of really poetical 
lines. He wrote no sonnet to be compared to any 
one of fifty from among Longfellow's, 

I can say all this with a clean conscience, for I 
delight in the vers libre of Gustave Kahn, the 
founder of the new movement in France (why is 
he studiously neglected by Miss Amy Lowell?) and 
that iconoclastic school, and I am not averse to 
Marinetti's " parole libere," that is, I am not so 
bigoted an upholder of the Parnassians as to be 
disgusted with the vagaries of the Cavort icists 
when, as is occasionally the case, they strike a 
genuine spark of vivid light from their steel. If 
there is any gold in the quartz it behooves us to 
extract it. 

In the same way, while I still get delight from 
Mendelssohn the " Songs without Words," the 
Scotch or Italian Symphonies, the " Hebrides Over- 
ture," and a dozen other perfectly balanced and 
melodious compositions, and from Porpora and 
Bach and dear old Haydn, this does not preclude 
me from waxing enthusiastic over the splendid 
richness of Strauss and the frequently cacophonous 
originalities of Schoenberg and the high-colored 
magnificence of Debussy. While I would applaud 
every new thing, I hope I am broad enough to 
desire also a movement to " mediterraneanize " 
music once more to come back to the melodious- 
ness of the early men, when a dozen composers 
frankly vitalized simple melodies such as any per- 
son on the street might catch and whistle, even if 
the critic could not tell whether it was the work of 
one man or another. 

Monet and Manet and other Impressionists 
taught us to see colors to which our eyes were blind ; 
and yet the paintings of the academic school may 
still give us pleasure, if we have eyes to see. So, 
as Mrs. Josephine Peabody Marks said in her 
admirable address at the annual dinner of the 
American Poetry Society in January, there should 
be no reason why the advocates of " the new verse " 
should be narrow-minded and not allow the poets 
who prefer the old forms to practice them ; nor, on 
the other hand, should the classicists take as a per- 
sonal affront the experiments of self-styled re- 
formers. Let us ride Pegasus, who, as Mrs. 
Marks remarked, had four legs and four wings, 
if we want to do so. If others choose a whirring 
motor aeroplane and stun us with its noise, perhaps 
they too will reach the top of Olympus even more 
quickly. It is a big little world, and there is room 
for all. So hail to Longfellow and Mendelssohn!

SOME NOTES PROM JAPAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Those who read the paragraph in one of the mid- 
summer issues of THE DIAL about an immense 
Japanese dictionary will be interested in the fol- 
lowing paragraph on Dr. Modzume and his under- 
taking, which appeared not long ago in the " Japan 
Advertiser " : 

" It looked for a time as though the thirty years' 
work of Dr. Modzume, who has been working all that 
time on the compilation of a Japanese dictionary, was 
to go for nothing, but through the generosity of a 
friend his dictionary is to be published after all. 
While working on his book, Dr. Modzume spent all 
his fortune for the purchase of reference books and 
other expenses. He was in debt about 30,000 yen. 
As the time of publication drew near, his copy was 
distrained by creditors. Mr. Nakamura Geihichiro, 
who happened to read about his financial difficulty in 
the papers, has volunteered to pay his old debts and 
arranged for the author to publish his work." 

If that work is ever completed, the industrious com- 
piler may well claim the title of the " Japanese 
Johnson " ! 

The following paragraph from " The Far East " 
is significant : 

" Since the outbreak of the war an interesting 
change has taken place in the relative value of foreign 
languages among Japanese students. While German 
is still assiduously studied by students at the univer- 
sities and higher schools, there has been a considerable 
falling off in the number of students of German who 
are preparing for a business career. This was well 
illustrated in the number of applicants for the Ger- 
man course at the Tokyo School of Foreign Lan- 
guages this term. While there were 125 the year 
before the war, the number this year was only 62. 
Applicants for the Russian course numbered 172 this 
year, in contrast with 93 last year, mainly due to the 
expansion of Japan's trade with Russia, and the 
desire to know more of Russian literature at first 
hand. The eagerness of many to learn of things Rus- 
sian may be gauged from the large monthly sales of 
books on Russia and the Russians at the Maruzen, 
while the Russian-Japanese conversation books are 
also much sought after. That the English language 
is receiving due attention from the majority of Japa- 
nese students needs no emphasis. It is noticeable, 
however, that the study of this universal language 
has been made much easier for the student to-day 
than twenty years ago, thanks to the scientific method 
employed in teaching by such men as Mr. Saito of the 
Seisoku School. The day of the English grammar is 
already gone. Present-day Japanese want to be more 
practical, since conversation and composition are occu- 
pying a great deal of their hours of study. Last but 
not least interesting is the fact that the Chinese 
vernacular is being enthusiastically learnt by many 
young men in view of the enormous trade prospects. 
The study of the Chinese classics is, however, as dead 
as the proverbial doornail in Japan. The younger 
generation seems to be seeking only what is practical." 

Japan will not lag behind other nations in the 
celebration of the tercentenary of the death of 
Shakespeare on April 23. Waseda University is 
expected to celebrate the occasion with due cere- 
mony. And there is a plan under way to mark that 
occasion with the presentation of Shakespearean 
plays by Dr. Tsubouchi, Messrs. Togi, Shimamura, 
Kato, Sasaki, and other playwrights and actors 



(and actresses?). There will surely be something 
interesting. 

It is the custom of the professors and students of 
the Science College of the Imperial University, 
Tokyo, to hold an annual " apple festival " on 
December 25, which is the anniversary of the birth 
of Sir Isaac Newton. This year, as usual, a por- 
trait of Newton which hung on a wall in the physics 
lecture hall was decorated with green leaves and 
flowers, and offerings of apples were made to it. 
Two of the professors delivered lectures.

THE MEANING OF "UNTENTED." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The interesting analysis of the meaning of " un- 
tented " submitted by Dr. Tannenbaum in your 
issue of January 20 moves me to suggest that this 
word survives and is in current use in Scotland 
to-day. " Tak tent to yersel," i. e. take heed to 
yourself, is a common expression. The word is 
used in the same sense in the north of Ireland. The 
glossary of Scottish words and phrases of the 
Standard Dictionary says : " Tent. A field pulpit, 
attention ; heed ; caution ; to take heed." The last 
quotation in Dr. Tannenbaum's letter, " Her fes- 
tered members must be lanc'd and tented," I read : 
" Her festered members must be lanc'd and at- 
tended to or cared for or heedfully looked to." 

King Lear curses and reviles his daughter, Gone- 
ril. She is impassive and scornful of the old man. 
He says " Th' untented [unheeded?] woundings of 
a father's curse Pierce every sense about thee ! " 
Curses do not always act immediately.

"MICE AND MEN." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
An anticipation of Burns's famous lines, 
" The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men 

Gang aft agley," 

is found in Pope's " Imitations of Horace " (Book 
II, Satire VI) : 

" Consider mice, like men, must die, 

Both great and small, both you and I." 
Pope's lines occur in the story of " The City and 
the Country Mouse," the tale which Prior and Mon- 
tague used (to Thackeray's delight in his " English 
Humourists ") in their parody of Dry den's " The 
Hind and the Panther." 

The probable source of Burns's lines for 
critics agree that the poet was well versed in the 
literature of sensibility is given by Dr. Otto 
Ritter (" Quellenstudien zu Robert Burns," 1773- 
1791, "Palaestra," XX, 82) as Mrs. Barbauld's 
" The Mouse's Petition " : 

" When destruction lurks unseen, 

Which men, like mice, may share." 
Mrs. Barbauld, in turn, may have based her lines 

on Pope's. _. T

THE PRFXCE OF " COLVUMISTS." * 



Nothing under the sun is quite new. The 
combination of wit, humor, satire, and erudi- 
tion of an odd and unexpected sort, which 
characterizes that form of journalistic litera- 
ture technically known as the " colyum," is 
commonly regarded as something distinctly 
modern. Its sprightly manner seems instinct 
with the spirit of this unusually present and 
up-to-date age of ours. But some forty-five 
years ago a professor of mathematics in 
London, Augustus De Morgan, was doing 
precisely the same sort of thing in "The 
Athenaeum," under the title, "A Budget of 
Paradoxes," that F. P. A., B. L. T., and a few 
others are doing now in our metropolitan 
newspapers. Indeed, the modern exponents 
of this gentle art of "colyuming" might do 
much worse than to study De Morgan for fine 
points of technique. In the deftness and 
sureness of his characterizations; in the pre- 
cision, acuity, and yet unfailing good humor 
of his satire; and in the nimble wit and 
verbal felicity of his writing altogether, this 
genial mathematician has never been sur- 
passed. 

Before his death, De Morgan had started 
upon the pleasant labor of collecting and 
completing the "Athenaeum" papers, both by 
editing and by considerable additions of actu- 
ally new material. He did not live to com- 
plete it, however. The first edition of the 
"Budget," which appeared in 1872, was 
edited by Mrs. De Morgan. In her preface 
she made many apologies for the imperfec- 
tions of the work in comparison with what it 
would have been could it have been finished 
by Professor De Morgan himself. Without 
doubt the book did fall short of what it would 
have been under entirely favorable circum- 
stances, but in spite of all this it was imme- 
diately successful in point of sales. It was 
apparently never reprinted after the first edi- 
tion, and consequently soon became out of 
print. Second-hand copies have become in- 
creasingly rare as time has gone on, until in 
recent years it has become quite impossible 
to obtain the book unless one was prepared to 
pay a distinctly long price. This circum- 
stance, coupled with the permanent intrinsic 
worth of the book itself, has led Professor 
David Eugene Smith, a distinguished student 

A BUDGET OF PARADOXES. By Augustus De Morgan,

of the history of mathematics, to edit, and the 
Open Court Company to publish, a second 
edition. By the fact alone of doing this 
thing, the editor &nd publishers have put the 
world of scholarship, in the very broadest 
sense of that term, greatly in their debt. Con- 
cerning the manner in which the re-editing of 
this classic has been done, the case is not 
quite so clear; but on that matter comment 
will be reserved until a later point in this 
review. 

Let us first of all be quite sure that every- 
one is clear as to just what the "Budget of 
Paradoxes " is, what it has for an object, and 
the means taken to attain that object. Then 
we may proceed to discuss it with greater 
freedom. To the reviewer it seems odd that 
it should be necessary to explain what the 
"Budget" is: his own familiarity with the 
book, which covers in point of time the whole 
of his mature mental life, is so complete as 
to induce much the same sort of feeling in 
regard to explaining what the book is about, 
as one would have if he were to start to 
explain to grown-up persons what the Bible, 
or Shakespeare, or Dickens, was about. In 
other words, it seems difficult to conceive that 
anyone can have reached even moderately 
adult life without having read at least some 
portion of the "Budget of Paradoxes." But 
so great is our confusion of thought regard- 
ing the fundamentals of an education, that 
one must conclude that even within THE DIAL 
family there may be those for whom the 
pleasure of the elder De Morgan's acquain- 
tance is still anticipatory. For such no better 
statement of the purpose of the "Budget" 
can be made than De Morgan's own. The 
book opens with the following words : 

" If I had before me a fly and an elephant, hav- 
ing never seen more than one such magnitude of 
either kind; and if the fly were to endeavor to 
persuade me that he was larger than the elephant, 
I might by possibility be placed in a difficulty. 
The apparently little creature might use such argu- 
ments about the effect of distance, and might 
appeal to such laws of sight and hearing as I, if 
unlearned in those things, might be unable wholly 
to reject. But if there were a thousand flies, all 
buzzing, to appearance, about the great creature; 
and, to a fly, declaring, each one for himself, that 
he was bigger than the quadruped; and all giving 
different and frequently contradictory reasons; 
and each one despising and opposing the reasons 
of the others I should feel quite at my ease. I 
should certainly say, My little friends, the ease of 
each one of you is destroyed by the rest. I intend 
to show flies in the swarm, with a few larger ani- 
mals, for reasons to be given. . . 

" During the last two centuries and a half, phys- 
ical knowledge has been gradually made to rest 
upon a basis which it had not before. It has

become mathematical. The question now is, not 
whether this or that hypothesis is better or worse 
to the pure thought, but whether it accords with 
observed phenomena in those consequences which 
can be shown necessarily to follow from it, if it be 
true. Even in those sciences which are not yet 
under the dominion of mathematics, and perhaps 
never will be, a working copy of the mathematical 
process has been made. This is not known to the 
followers of those sciences who are not themselves 
mathematicians and who very often exalt their 
horns against the mathematics in consequence. 
They might as well be squaring the circle, for any 
sense they show in this particular. 

"A great many individuals, ever since the rise of 
the mathematical method, have, each for himself, 
attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I 
shall not here stop to point out how the very 
accuracy of exact science gives better aim than the 
preceding stage of things could give. I shall call 
each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system 
a paradox. I use the word in the old sense: a 
paradox is something which is apart from general 
opinion, either in subject-matter, method, or con- 
clusion. 

" Many of the things brought forward would 
now be called crotchets, which is the nearest word 
we have to old paradox. But there is this differ- 
ence, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to 
speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary 
sense of paradox. Thus in the sixteenth century 
many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox 
of Copernicus, who held the ingenuity of that 
theory in very high esteem, and some, I think, 
who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth 
century, the depravation of meaning took place, 
in England at least. Phillips says paradox is ' a 
thing which seemeth strange' here is the old 
meaning : after a colon he proceeds ' and ab- 
surd, and is contrary to common opinion,' which is 
an addition due to his own time." 

It might appear from this that the 
"Budget" was confined to the discussion of 
strictly scientific matters. Such a conclusion 
would be far from the fact. De Morgan used 
the " Budget " as a receptacle for his opinions 
de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis. Mat- 
ters literary, social, political, pedagogical, 
editorial, historical, financial, classical, philo- 
sophical, and generally otherwise, all fell 
within his purview as naturally and easily as 
did things scientific. In fact, the subject- 
matter of the " Budget " may be characterized 
in Mr. Venus's conveniently embracing ter- 
minology as "human warious." 

A considerable part of the book is devoted 
to those hardy perennial paradoxers who 
square the circle, or, put in another way, who 
convince themselves and endeavor to convince 
others that they have discovered not only that 
the ratio of the circumference of a circle to 
its diameter is exactly commensurable, but 
also just precisely what that measured ratio 



is. With the quadrating gentry De Morgan 
has unmeasured fun. The most persistent 
and entertaining of the lot was Mr. James 
Smith, of Liverpool. Of him the author says : 

" When my work appeared in numbers, I had 
not anything like an adequate idea of Mr. James 
Smith's superiority to the rest of the world in the 
points in which he is superior. He is beyond a 
doubt the ablest head at unreasoning, and the 
greatest hand at writing it, of all who have tried 
in our day to attach their names to an error. 
Common cyclometers sink into puny orthodoxy by 
his side. 

" The behavior of this singular character induces 
me to pay him the compliment which Achilles paid 
Hector, to drag him around the walls again and 
again. . . He will come out of my hands in the 
position he ought to hold, the Supreme Pontiff of 
cyclometers, the vicegerent of St. Vitus upon 
earth, the Mamamouchi of burlesque on inference.'' 
This intention was carried out, fully and 
adequately. 

As is readily to be inferred from De Mor- 
gan's definition of a paradoxer, already 
quoted, he distinguished many different spe- 
cies and varieties of the genus. Not all re- 
ceived the same sort of treatment as Mr. 
Smith. De Morgan considered that he him- 
self belonged in the group which he classified 
as rational paradoxers. Under this name he 
included " all who, in private life, and in 
matters which concern themselves, take their 
own course, and suit their own notions, no 
matter what other people may think of them. 
These men will put things to uses they were 
never intended for, to the great distress and 
disgust of their gregarious friends. I am one 
of the class." 

He goes on to tell the following anecdote of 
another rational paradoxer, Dr. Isaac Milner, 
sometime President of Queen's College, Cam- 
bridge : 

" He wanted a seat suited to his shape, and he 
defied opinion to a fearful point. He spread a 
thick block of putty over a wooden chair and sat 
in it until it had taken a ceroplast copy of the 
proper seat. This he gave to a carpenter to be 
imitated in wood. One of the few now living who 
knew him my friend, General Perronet Thomp- 
son answers for the wood, which was shown him 
by Milner himself; but he does not vouch for the 
material being putty, which was in the story told 
me at Cambridge; William Frend also remem- 
bered it. Perhaps the Doctor took off his great 
seal in green wax, like the Crown; but some soft 
material he certainly adopted; and very com- 
fortable he found the wooden copy." 

The temptation to go on quoting from this 
thoroughly delightful book is great, but must 
be resisted. To anyone who is familiar w r ith 
the " Budget of Paradoxes," and at the same 
time has some understanding of the principles

of heredity, there is no uncertainty as to an 
important, if not indeed the chief, reason for 
the literary ability and charm of William De 
Morgan. It is doubtful if there is anywhere 
a more conspicuous and precise example of 
the inheritance of literary ability than in this 
notable son of a notable father. Every lover 
of the son's novels should put the father's 
" Budget" next them on the shelves, for if he 
likes one he is sure to like the other. Indeed, 
they are in some measure supplementary. For 
in the case of the novels one is bound to be- 
come interested in the progress of the story, 
and so be enticed to go on and on reading. 
The "Budget" has no plot, and if taken in 
too large doses might give one a severe case 
of mental indigestion. It is to be picked up 
and dropped into at random, and, after a 
choice morsel has been extracted, put back 
upon the shelf until again one wants a little 
nip of that exclusive brand of intellectual 
stimulant provided by the De Morgan family. 
Coming now to the matter of the editing of 
this present reprint of the " Budget," the 
reviewer finds his opinion somewhat at 
variance with that of the editor as regards 
the general plan, and widely so as regards the 
manner in which the plan has been executed. 
With such part of the editorial scheme as 
allowed no textual changes except the correc- 
tion of obvious typographical errors and the 
substitution of American for English spell- 
ing, there can be no serious quarrel, though 
upon the second point there might be differ- 
ences of opinion. The main feature of the 
new edition is something of a totally different 
order, however. It consists of some odd mil- 
lions (more or less) of footnotes, designed, in 
the words of the editor, " to elucidate the text 
by supplying such information as the casual 
reader might wish as he passes over the 
pages." It may be granted that just possibly 
something is to be said for such a plan on 
theoretical grounds, as a general proposition 
regarding the editing of books of an earlier 
generation. But the sanity of the plan in 
any particular case obviously depends solely 
upon the manner in which it is carried out 
in that case. Professor Smith's idea of the 
mental equipment of those persons likely to 
read the "Budget of Paradoxes" is that, in 
the first place, they know no single word of 
any language other than the English, and 
that, in the second place, they are so com- 
pletely and totally ignorant of all history and 
literature that any and every allusion to per- 
sons or events must be fully explained in 
terms easily to be comprehended by the most 
~" casual " reader. 



To anyone who has not examined the book 
it will be nearly unbelievable that petty 
didacticism could be carried to such lengths 
as it here is, even in a text-book. Just for 
an example : on page 169 of Vol. I occurs the 
following passage, which is here set down 
literatim et punctatim as it occurs in the 
text : " There is an awful paradox about the 
book, which explains, in part, its leaden 
sameness. It is all about I'homme, I'homme. 
I'homme, 6 except as much as treats of les 
homines, les hommes, les hommes. 7 . ." At 
the bottom of the page footnote 6 furnishes 
the desperately needed information: "Man, 
man, man." This is pretty bad, but worse is 
yet to come. Footnote 7 reads as follows: 
" Men, men, men." Thus this difficult bit of 
idiomatic French is cleared up. and poor 
De Morgan's little joke is fully explained, so 
that any " casual " idiot may easily compre- 
hend it. Many, many examples of the same 
sort of thing might be instanced, were there 
need to do so. The effect on the intelligent, 
in contradistinction to the editor's "casual," 
reader is like that which would be produced 
upon the readers of F. P. A.'s " Conning 
Tower" if each mention of Washington in 
that sprightly turret were to be garnished 
with a footnote to this effect : " G. Washing- 
ton, born Feb. 22. 1732, died Dec. 14, 1799. 
first President of the United States. Popu- 
larly known as ' The Father of his Country.' 
A gentleman of very dignified bearing, much 
esteemed by his contemporaries." 

Xo doubt many utterly wearisome argu- 
ments might be adduced in support of the 
contention that in this day and age many of 
De Morgan's allusions would be incompre- 
hensible, in the absence of these painfully 
lucid footnotes, to any but scholarly persons. 
But just in that argument lies the meat of 
the matter, in a manner totally unperceived 
by those who advance it. De Morgan did 
not write the "Budget of Paradoxes" for 
unscholarly people. He spoke the language 
of sound, thorough, and mellow scholarship. 
He assumed, as a matter of course, that his 
readers understood that language. No more 
determined or bitter foe of all that is 
"casual" and shallow in intellectual matters 
ever lived than he. If as a people we have 
any one outstanding intellectual character- 
istic it is laziness. Intellectual laziness en- 
genders mental mediocrity. More and more 
does it become the dominant quality of our 
literature that it shall be capable of absorp- 
tion without the slightest effort, conscious or 
unconscious, on the part of the reader. This 
being a country in which all people are more 
or less free and equal, or at least like so to

ing which can be done either about or to those 
persons who wish to have their intellectual 
pabulum so pre-digested that they need not 
stir a neurone in the process of getting it 
into their systems. But to pander to their 
low tastes in the name of Augustus De Mor- 
gan is a thing which no one who deeply hon- 
ors and cherishes the spirit of that genial 
scholar, who contributed not alone to the sum 
of knowledge but so notably to the joy of 
living, can allow to pass without vigorous

GERMAN HISTORIANS AND THE GREAT 
WAR.* 



In a report on public opinion in Germany, 
a report made to the French Minister of For- 
eign Affairs on July 30, 1913, M. Stephen 
Pichon said that "some want war because 
in the present circumstances they think it 
inevitable/' The remark was probably meant 
to apply only to those who felt that the con- 
crete situation was such that war could not 
long be delayed. But any analysis of the 
modern German conception of Kultur would 
find one of the pervasive characteristics of 
this " specifically German way of thinking 
and feeling" to be the notion that Germany, 
in the twentieth century, is destined to a 
position of material and moral supremacy. 
Fate, or Providence, or a "force not our- 
selves that makes for righteousness," so it 
seems, has laid upon the Fatherland the cos- 
mic task of extending "the German Idea" 
in the world. Somehow or other this must 
be done: if by peaceable means, well and 
good; if not by peaceable means, then in 
"shining armor" and with the good sword. 
In forming this conception of the German 
mission, many influences have united; of 
these influences, not the least is that of the 
philosophy of history promulgated with so 
much learning and eloquence by German his- 
torians in the nineteenth century. 

M. Guilland, whose book appeared some 
years ago and is now very acceptably trans- 
lated into English, has attempted, in a num- 
ber of essays on certain historians, Niebuhr, 
Ranke, Mommsen, von Sybel, Treitschke, 
to determine the character of this philosophy 
and to estimate its influence upon German 
political ideals. Notwithstanding the author 
has little sympathy with these ideals, he has

dealt fairly enough with his facts, and has 
given us a book that is fascinating reading 
from beginning to end. Nowhere in English 
will one find such masterly portraits of the 
great German historians, particularly of 
Ranke, Mommsen, and von Sybel, or a more 
penetrating analysis of that part of their 
work with which M. Guilland is concerned. 
It is important to keep in mind, however, 
that he is concerned with the work of these 
historians) primarily only in so far as it had 
an influence in spreading abroad in Germany 
a peculiar philosophy of history. The reader 
has to remember, for example, that the " His- 
tory of Rome" was but a small part of 
Mommsen's work as historian, a kind of 
political pamphlet, a very German pamphlet 
to be sure, which the author threw off by the 
way, as a sort of intellectual recreation. It 
is an author's right, nevertheless, to limit his 
subject ; it is a reader's business to remember 
what that limitation is. 

Undoubtedly M. Guilland admires Ranke 
more than the others. Ranke was a good 
German, but then he was a good European 
also; he could admire France, and he said 
many just things about Frenchmen. His 
serene good humor, his tolerance and sanity, 
the catholicity of his interests and his tastes, 
in a word the humanism and universality of 
his mind, distinguish him sharply from men 
like Droysen and Treitschke; we do not 
think of him as quite comfortable in the hot 
and irritating atmosphere which the later 
chauvinistic Prussian historians seemed to 
require as a stimulant. For this very reason 
it is more difficult to detect in the work of 
Ranke, devoted as he was to describing the 
past wie es ist eigentlich gewesen, any influ- 
ence in shaping the political ideals of modern 
Germany. Nevertheless, in shaping these 
ideals, the work of Ranke had a very real 
influence. 

The thinking of the nineteenth century, in 
many of its aspects, reflects the reaction from 
the ideas of the Revolution. The reaction 
from eighteenth century cosmopolitanism and 
the propagandist spirit of the Revolution 
found expression, particularly in Germany, in 
an exaggerated nationalism; while the in- 
tense application, after 1815, to the study of 
history, and the immense respect for the 
past which partly inspired and partly re- 
sulted from such studies, was one form of 
reaction from the rationalism of the Philos- 
ophes. Divine Right was a little obsolete,

alike, therefore, most Germans turned to his- 
tory, seeking the meaning of the present and 
a guide to the future in the actual historical 
process, a process which came to be regarded 
as the true revelation of the divine purpose, 
or as an embodiment of universal reason in 
contradistinction to analytical thought or any 
individual's rationalization of experience. 
The history of each nation could thus be 
counted on to furnish the guarantee for its 
own law and custom, as well as to justify its 
right to maintain them against any other 
nation. 

Few men did more to confirm this way of ! 
thinking than Ranke. To be sure, he did not j 
think of other nations as existing merely to ! 
heighten, by contrast, the glory and great- ! 
ness of Germany. But if he conceived of his- 
tory in a universal sense, as " the progress of 
mankind," and thus, in his insistence on the 
international character of European culture, 
reminds us of the cosmopolitan spirit of Vol- 
taire, he nevertheless has conceived of this 
progress in terms of "the individuality of j 
nations," each nation at certain periods being, 
as it were, the incarnation of some great 
"idea" which at the particular time best 
expressed that "multiple being which we are." 
The way was thus prepared for the belief 
that the Fatherland had contributed some- 
thing in the past to this "progress of man- i 
kind," and that it was destined in the future, 
since the Germans were the only nation that i 
had retained the qualities of a genuine i 
"urvolk," to be the home of God's chosen | 
people. And if Giesebrecht depicted the glo- I 
ries of the Fatherland in the time of the 
mediaeval empire, Ranke himself, in his widely 
read " History of Germany in the Time of the 
Reformation," had his share in establishing 
that modern formula of cosmic philosophy 
which, according to Professor Dewey, in his 
" German Philosophy and Politics," runs as 
follows : 

" First, the German Luther who saved for man- 
kind the principle of spiritual freedom . . ; then 
Kant and Fichte, who wrought out the principle 
into a final philosophy of science, morals, and the 
state; as conclusion, the German nation organized 
in order to win the world to recognition of this 
principle, and thereby to establish the rule of free- 
dom and science in humanity as a whole." 

"When Ranke's "Reformation" appeared, 
the organization of the German nation was 
rapidly becoming the central question of Ger- 
man politics ; and after the dissolution of the 
Frankfort National Assembly the best chance 
of effecting such an organization seemed to be 
through Prussian leadership. To celebrate 
the history of Prussia as the state at once 



capable of guaranteeing order and establish- 
ing true freedom, and to set it over in con- 
trast against the history of France as the 
country where anarchy and license ran unre- 
strained under the mask of liberty, this was 
the task faintly forecast by Ranke himself in 
his "Nine Books of Prussian History," and 
finally completed by Droysen, Treitschke, and 
above all by von Sybel. The latter, in his 
" History of the Revolutionary Period," 
proved from newly discovered and unim- 
peachable sources that the French Revolution 
failed because its principles were wrong, and 
that the principles of the Prussian state were 
correct because Prussia would succeed, as the 
logic of its history clearly indicated, in 
achieving the unification of the German na- 
tion. If this great end could be attained only 
by "blood and iron," no one should despair, 
not even good German Liberals. Prussia had 
not often accomplished her destiny by 
speeches and resolutions of Parliament; be- 
sides, drastic methods would be well employed 
if by such means German minds could be 
purged of Gallic vapors and false doctrinaire 
principles of liberty and the Rights of Man. 
And in fact, as the Prussian historians justi- 
fied Sadowa, Sadowa in turn justified the 
Prussian historians. "A king who so quickly 
brought about so fine a stroke," said Treit- 
schke, "must be right against everybody." 
Everyone was not as easily convinced as was 
Treitschke ; but nothing was lacking to a com- 
plete justification of the Prussian prophets 
when, five years later, the lost provinces were 
recovered and the new German Empire was 
proclaimed, at Versailles, in the famous Hall 
of Mirrors of the ancient palace built by 
Louis XIV. 

"The most indifferent arguments are good," 
said Bismarck, "when one has a majority of 
bayonets." All the great events of that gen- 
eration the founding of the Second Empire 
in France, the unification of Italy, the pres- 
ervation of the American Union, above all 
the success of Bismarck's policy of "blood 
and iron " seemed to illustrate and confirm 
this cynical philosophy. And these were pre- 
cisely the years when materialistic theories, 
borrowed from natural science, were modify- 
ing the older conceptions of man and his his- 
tory. Der Mensch ist, was er isst. If nature, 
in evolving the higher animals, employed the 
method of ruthlessly exterminating the weak 
through ceaseless conflict, could it be sup- 
posed that another method regulated the evo- 
lution of society? Economic competition and 
war, what were they, what had they ever 
been, but nature's test of the fittest ? In those 
years, when materialism had its day in

science, pessimism in philosophy, naturalism 
in literature, when religion seemed a spent 
force, the economic interpretation of history, 
of which the corollary was that principles and 
ideals and theories were but ingenious instru- 
ments forged in the service of deep-lying 
selfish interests, was profoundly modifying 
historical research and the attitude of histo- 
rians toward the past. 

If theories of this sort were to become 
widely popular anywhere, one might suppose 
that it would be in Germany, where natural 
science was in such high repute, and where 
Bismarck, who had made and was consoli- 
dating the Empire in the spirit of a new 
Machiavelli, was the popular hero. In a 
sense one would be right in so supposing. Yet 
one would be wrong in supposing that the 
bald theory that "Might makes Right" was 
accepted and entertained in its primitive 
state, naked and unadorned, by the German 
mind. For the German mind is incurably 
idealistic ; and hence the materialism of natu- 
ral science, before it could be applied to 
political uses, had to be ideally transformed, 
had, as it were, to be draped and vestured 
with an attractive covering of morality and 
religion. No, might does not make right, says 
the German; and the good Bernhardi is 
amazed and shocked that anyone should find 
such a philosophy in his writings; might is 
but the evidence of right, which you perceive 
is a different thing altogether. Could there 
indeed be a more profound pessimism than to 
suppose that the universe is so fashioned that 
the spirit of evil, der Geist der stets verneint, 
could triumph in the end ? That nation which 
at any time attains a superior wisdom and 
virtue, a superior morality and culture, will 
by the sheer inner force of these qualities 
clothe itself with power. In the long run the 
fittest nation survives. It survives through 
force, certainly ; but this force, whether exer- 
cised indirectly through peaceable competi- 
tion or directly through war, is generated by 
a superiority in attaining the ideal ends of 
life, a superiority in intelligence and morality, 
a superiority in Kultur. 

Do not expect, therefore, to find German 
historians glorifying force, simply as force. 
The war of 1870, said von Sybel, was one of 
those necessary struggles "between a young 
state wishing to make for itself a place in the 
sun and an old nation which was struggling 
to keep up its position." And M. Guilland 
adds: "After that, you would expect Sybel 
to describe in a straightforward manner this 
work of conquest, justifying the Prussian 
wars, as Mommsen had done in his History of 
Home, by Darwin's law of the survival of the 



fittest. Now this is not so." Certainly it is 
not so. Nor is it quite true, as M. Guilland 
implies, that Mommsen explained Roman his- 
tory as a triumph of force, as an example of 
the doctrine that might makes right. Momm- 
sen, as M. Guilland himself says elsewhere, 
" seeks to show the reasons for the superiority 
of this people over the other peoples of 
ancient history." And what was this supe- 
riority? The Italian, said Mommsen, "sur- 
rendered his own personal will for the sake of 
freedom, and learned to obey his father that 
he might know how to obey the State. Amidst 
this subjection, individual development might 
be marred. . . The Italian gained instead a 
feeling of fatherland and of patriotism such 
as the Greek never knew, and alone among 
the civilized nations of antiquity succeeded in 
working out . . a national unity which at 
last placed in his hands the mastery not only 
over the divided Hellenic stocks, but over the 
whole known world." That is to say, Rome is 
not justified by her conquests, but her con- 
quests are justified by her superior moral 
qualities. 

In this way precisely have the German his- 
torians justified the conquests of Prussia in 
Germany and of Germany in Europe. Sub- 
stitute the word German for Italian, the word 
Europe for antiquity, and the word Celtic for 
Hellenic, and the sentence of Mommsen might 
stand as the essential resume of all that has 
been said by the Prussian school about Euro- 
pean history in the last two centuries. And 
of no German historian would this be so true 
as of the last and most chauvinistic as well 
as the most influential of the Prussian school, 
Heinrich von Treitschke. 

The present translation of the famous 
" History " was doubtless inspired by the fact 
that the name of Treitschke, almost unknown 
in England and America, suddenly became a 
word to conjure with in the multitude of arti- 
cles and books that endeavored to explain the 
Great War. In the circumstances, it is not 
strange that the work shows signs of having 
been somewhat hastily done. There are a 
good many misprints due to careless proof- 
reading; and good German phrases have too 
often been taken over literally. " Thought- 
struggles," "World-all," "Napoleon prepon- 
derantly esteemed the exact sciences," " the 
thought-process of the Philosophers gave rise 
to a new moral view of the World-order," 
" Schiller's influence was more in the direc- 
tion of width," and similar expressions, are 
simply not English. But on the whole the 
volume reads well, and the translators have 
caught a good deal of the movement and flu- 
ency, a good deal of the lyric enthusiasm, and 



1916]

something of the plastic qualities, which make 
Treitschke's work one of the great master- 
pieces of historical narrative. 

Now, that which inspires Treitschke's 
" History,'' that fundamental preconception 
which beyond everything else gives it char- 
acter, is the profound conviction, amounting 
to a religious faith, that the success of Ger- 
many in the nineteenth century was due to 
the intellectual and moral supremacy of the 
German nation. Treitschke reminds one of the 
arood English matron who sympathized with 
the French because they had the misfortune 
to be born in a foreign country. It could 
hardly be otherwise than that the Germans 
should attain supremacy over other nations; 
in spite of themselves, a people whose car- 
dinal and commonplace virtues were obedi- 
ence, loyalty, steadfastness, and self-sacrifice, 
a people whose intelligence was at once so 
profound and so exact, must take the front 
rank. Where was so excellent a language as 
the German for expressing every kind of idea, 
or one so rich and flexible that the works of 
Shakespeare and Euripides acquired an addi- 
tional charm after having passed through the 
medium of the German mind ? " Goethe's 
Iphigenia, the poem which of all the works of 
modern art best attains the spirit of the 
antique, was nevertheless permeated by a 
sentiment of loving gentleness such as was 
never understood by the hard-headed heathen 
of antiquity." The truth is that Treitschke, 
for whom the German army like the German 
language is a moral product, was as far as 
possible removed from the cynical pessimism 
of those who would agree with Bismarck that 
"the most indifferent arguments are good 
when one has a majority of bayonets." No 
word is on his tongue more often than 
"' moral "or "morality." He despises En- 
irland. not because she is weak, but because 
Englishmen are dominated by mercenary 
ideals which they hide behind a mask of cant- 
ing hypocrisy. For Treitschke, history is the 
result of moral forces, the revelation of the 
moral law; and if Prussia has succeeded in j 
making Germany great, if Germany is des- 
tined to a position of predominance in the 
world, it is because Prussians better than 
other Germans, and Germans better than non- 
Germans, abide by this law which their phi- 
losophers have discovered and which their ; 
history confirms. Fundamentally. Treitschke i 
is not an historian, but a preacher : a preacher, < 
in dead earnest, who illustrates from the his- 
tory of nations the text that we Germans are 
the people and wisdom shall die with us. 

The doctrine that success, in the long run, 
is the evidence of right, is perhaps the only 



philosophy to be derived from history stud- 
ied objectively, as a record of what has oc- 
curred in the world. If, as the nineteenth 
century would have us believe, there is for us 
no revelation through inspired book or infalli- 
ble inner light of conscience, if for us the only 
revelation is through nature and history 
rationalized, what is left but to say with 
Hegel : " The actual is the rational and the 
rational is the actual"? What is there for 
the historian to do but to find the qualities 
that explain the success of one nation over 
another, and, having found them (he should 
indeed be very sure that he has found them) 
pronounce them good? But, obviously, good 
in a relative sense only. And this is impor- 
tant. If success is evidence of virtue, we 
must wait for the success before affirming the 
virtue ; the virtue is relative only to the par- 
ticular situation, not an inalienable possession 
of which we can assume the effectiveness in 
any other situation. This is a philosophy, 
therefore, excellently adapted to explaining 
the past, but dangerous in the extreme for 
predicting the future. 

Now, in the minds of the men who for the 
last decade have governed the Empire, the 
very men who have read Treitschke's "His- 
tory" and have listened to him, at Berlin, 
preaching the incomparable virtues of the 
German people, this philosophy has suffered 
a curious transformation. These superior 
German virtues have, in their minds, taken on 
an absolute character, have come to be re- 
garded as something innate, as something 
which cannot be lost by Germans or acquired 
unaided by nations less favored of the gods; 
and thus is Germany's supremacy in the twen- 
tieth century thought to be an assured, indeed 
a necessary, result. Instead of success being 
taken as an evidence of superiority, an as- 
sumed superiority is taken as clear evidence 
of a cosmic mission which must fail unless 
the Fatherland shall bestride the narrow 
world like a colossus. "It is perfect non- 
sense," says Herr Kohrbach in his " German 
World Policies," to say that Germany needs 
colonies for her expanding population. On 
the contrary, Germany needs an expanding 
population in order to give " enduring 
strength to her material expansion," the end 
of material expansion being the extension of 
"the German idea in the world." What! 
Must the German mission fail because of a 
declining birth rate and the weakness of 
diplomacy in face of a consolidated Entente! 
Where, then, is this boasted German superior- 
ity? German superiority must be proved at 
all costs, and for that the good sword alone 
remains. Thus was the Great War inevitable.

In such devious ways has the doctrine that 
virtue will clothe itself with power been trans- 
formed into the doctrine that the exercise of 
power is necessary to maintain an alleged 
virtue. The Germans of to-day, by dint of 
applying the lessons of their historians not 
wisely but too well, have somehow managed 
to get ahead of the schedule. They have dis- 
counted the historical process in order to 
realize on future values. It would be more mod- 
est, and more in accord with a safe philosophy 
of history, to let coming events reveal the con- 
tinued superiority of the German nation. But 
the patient Germans are singularly impatient ; 
without waiting for God to dispose, they have 
themselves, assuming the task of Fate, and 
with their accustomed efficiency, made to-mor- 
row's programme in the Foreign Office. Thus 
have the Germans, so practical in dealing with 
the material world, lost touch with reality in 
dealing with the moral world. Professed 
devotees of real-politik, they remain idealists 
and doctrinaires to the end of the chapter ! 

CARL BECKER. 



THE ESSAY IN ENGLAND.* 



It would not be easy to find a recent vol- 
ume of literary criticism which more admira- 
bly satisfies a genuine need than Professor 
Walker's study of the English essay. The 
rather peculiar difficulties about defining and 
evaluating the modern essay, touched upon in 
the author's Introduction, are likely to pique 
the curiosity of even superficial readers; 
while the comparatively late appearance of 
the type, placing Bacon practically at the 
head of its English pedigree, spares the his- 
torian the necessity of the extremely attenu- 
ated treatment and constant shift of critical 
attitude incident to attempts at sketching the 
progress of older literary forms. 

Professor Walker's twelve chapters, tracing 
the essay's evolution from the pre-Baconian 
"Anticipations" to "Some Essayists of Yes- 
terday " i. e. Andrew Lang, Laf cadio Hearn, 
George Gissing, and Francis Thompson), are 
themselves instinct with the allusiveness of 
thought, the epigrammatic grace, and the rich 
personal flavor which modern prose has 
learned from the best-loved recent essayists. 
Certainly it would be difficult to hit upon a 
better style than Professor Walker's in which 
to write of essays. The best proof of its 
entire adequacy is the reader's excited inter- 
est as sentence after sentence seems to strike 
the very heart and soul of the work criticized. 

* THE ENGLISH ESSAY AND ESSAYISTS. By Hugh Walker, 
LL.D. " Channels of English Literature." New York : E. P. 
Button & Co. 



The writings of Sir Thomas Browne suggest 
this notable paragraph: 

" Flawlessness is even more rare in prose than 
it is in verse, and if all the pieces were collected 
which a reasonable criticism could praise wholly 
without reserve, they would make only a very small 
volume. But an extraordinary proportion would 
come from Urn Burial a proportion higher than 
any other work of equal length would yield, possi- 
bly higher than could be gleaned even from the 
longest works." 

Lamb, another essayist whose distinctive 
merit it is certainly far from easy to express 
with conspicuous success, calls forth some re- 
marks which no sympathetic reader can let 
pass with ordinary approval : 

"Lamb's friends loved him and admired him; 
and yet they had more than a suspicion that in the 
weightier matters they were his superiors. They 
were not. Lamb was, among other things, one of 
the wisest men of his time. The evidences of this 
wisdom are to be met with everywhere. It is the 
essence of Lamb's criticism. No one but a man 
endowed with the very genius of common sense 
could have been so uniformly right as he. Taste 
alone will not do." 

Has the Olympian sweep and majesty of Dry- 
den's prose, before which all lovers of unde- 
filed English must adore, ever been better 
characterized than in the following sentences ? 

" The great merit of Dryden is that his style 
would have suited Solomon when he spake of 
trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even 
unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall. 
No style written before is comparable with it in 
range. Its characteristics are lucidity and easy 
grace. It flows on apparently without effort and 
with that perfect art which conceals art. But it is 
art, not chance. Evidently Dryden deliberately 
steered clear of the Scylla and Charybdis on one 
or other of which nearly all his predecessors were 
apt to strike. . . He saw two deviations from what 
he would have called nature. It was a deviation 
to conceal meaning under verbal quibbles and by 
excessive condensation; it was equally a deviation 
to conceal it in the maze of long involved sen- 
tences. The first business of prose was to convey 
a plain meaning unmistakably; and this was best 
done by a style based upon that of conversation, 
yet differing from it as the permanent will differ 
from the temporary and the studied from the 
spontaneous. Such seem to be the principles that 
underlie the prose style of Dryden." 
The vexed question of the relative merits of 
Steele and Addison has seldom if ever been 
more trenchantly answered than thus : " There 
is such a thing as tone in writing, as well as 
style, and Steele at his best is as much supe- 
rior to Addison in the former quality as he is 
inferior in the latter." Again, the one mighty 
reservation which must always qualify our 
admiration of Macaulay's splendid achieve- 
ment in letters could hardly be better ex-

pressed than as Professor Walker expresses 
it : " There are no dim vistas in his writings ; 
no man could be less of a mystic than he." 

Professor "Walker's appraisal of Bacon 
brings up fairly what is doubtless the most 
important question in the general criticism 
of the essay. He says: 

"Bacon is too stately, and his thought is too 
profound, to permit us to speak of the essays as 
the confidential chat of a great philosopher. . . 
Just here we detect the secret of Bacon's inferior- 
ity (of course merely qua essayist) to his model 
Montaigne or to the greatest English master of the 
form, Charles Lamb. The ideal essay seems to 
imply a certain lightness and ease, and a confiden- 
tial relation between the author and the reader. 
That we find in Oxford in the Long Vacation and 
in Mrs. Battle's Opinions on Whist. But not in 
Bacon." 

This verdict against Bacon will be generally 
accepted at the present day. Yet on further 
thought the reader may well ask himself 
whether Bacon's essays can safely be re- 
garded as inferior to Lamb's when both are 
viewed sub specie immortalitatis. The charm- 
ing lightness of Lamb is achieved, in a large 
part of his work at least, at the cost of a 
leaning toward artificiality and affectation, 
which may render him two centuries hence a 
much less vital force than Bacon is to-day. 
Can it not be fairly doubted whether Bacon's 
language and attitude deserve the epithet of 
" stately," when compared with average Eliza- 
bethan prose for example, with that of 
Sidney or Hooker or Ben Jonson ? And may 
we not reasonably apprehend that the mere 
process of time, which has lent a somewhat 
stately tone to the essays on "Studies" and 
" Truth," may render the " Chapter on Ears " 
positively grotesque? 

English essays have been written, as it 
were, in three persons. Those of Macaulay, 
of Addison, and of Hazlitt, and Dryden's 
prefaces, are third-personal. In the best of 
these, the writers seek conscientiously the ex- 
pression of ideas of universal validity, irre- 
spective of the special tastes of the authors or 
the peculiar interests of any particular class 
of readers. Such, we think, should be called, 
in a phrase which Professor Walker invents 
for another purpose, " essayists of the centre." 
The majority of the best English essays are 
doubtless of this type, and it would almost 
savor of literary snobbery to doubt that they 
have as a whole the best chance of weather- 
ing the fluctuations of changing taste. 

Bacon's essays would inevitably be notable 
both for their enormous fund of abstract wis- 
dom and for the tremendous personality of 
their author; but to be properly appreciated 
they must be read with a clear conception of 



the type of person addressed. They are dis- 
tinctly essays of the second person. Their 
content and their form are determined by 
Bacon's vivid mental image of his ideal 
reader: the young Elizabethan (or Jacobean) 
of strenuous ambition and large opportunity, 
intent upon the completest self-realization in 
public life. Writers as different as Steele, 
Thackeray, and Stevenson can be grouped in 
the same class. On the whole, the germinal 
principle in their most characteristic essays is 
neither the person speaking nor the things 
spoken about, but the reader addressed, the 
society person of Queen Anne's Age, the 
early Victorian "snob," or the morally and 
artistically unsteadied doubter of the "yel- 
low nineties." In all such essays the horta- 
tory imperative is latent if not expressed. 

Lamb, Fuller, and Sir Thomas Browne be- 
long to the third class of essayists : those who 
write mainly in the first person, whose espe- 
cial charm lies in their frank portrayal of 
their own delightful individualities. Profes- 
sor Walker's treatment of these writers is par- 
ticularly happy, and he hardly hesitates to 
award them the palm over all the other En- 
glish essayists. Which of us at the present 
day is likely to act otherwise in selecting 
reading for our personal amusement? Yet 
we hardly dare forget that there is a suspi- 
cion of the local and the temporal about such 
a predilection; that the position of Fuller 
and Browne as first-class literary figures de- 
pends as wholly as that of Lamb himself 
upon early nineteenth-century taste. Omens 
like the rehabilitation of Samuel Johnson as 
a critic and the increasing sympathy for 
Macaulay suggest that a radical change in 
taste may even now be on its way, that soon 
the business and love letters of a major poet 
may no longer, as at present, arouse a sin- 
cerer interest than his poetry, and that an 
essayist's habitual exhibition of himself in 
bedroom slippers, instead of irresistibly at- 
tracting, may even revolt us as it would have 
revolted the eighteenth century. 

TUCKER BROOKE. 



A YOUNG POET'S TRAVEL, IMPRESSIONS.* 

Charm of youthful personality and the 
pathos of an early death in his country's ser- 
vice seem to have given Rupert Brooke a 
measure of fame that long life and full oppor- 
tunity to mature his powers as a poet might 
not have brought him. At any rate there is 
a manifest disparity between his actual

achievement in literature and the acclaim he 
has won on two continents. But whatever his 
merit as poet, which time will determine with 
some degree of justice, it suffices for the pres- 
ent to acknowledge that there are a certain 
undeniable picturesqueness and romance 
about his youthful and buoyant and eagerly 
adventurous personality, and that to see the 
world renew its youth through his young eyes 
is a refreshing experience. This experience 
is made possible for all who can read by the 
publication in book-form of his " Letters from 
America," chapters of travel that first ap- 
peared in " The Westminster Gazette " and, 
in two instances, at the end of the volume, 
" The New Statesman." 

Mr. Henry James contributes an introduc- 
tion of some length, in which, characteristi- 
cally enough, and to the satisfaction of his 
admirers, there is rather more of the mind 
and art of Mr. James than of the character 
and appearance of Rupert Brooke. " Noth- 
ing more generally or more recurrently 
solicits us, in the light of literature, I think," 
begins the great master of prose, " than the 
interest of our learning how the poet, the true 
poet, and above all the particular one with 
whom we may for the moment be concerned, 
has come into his estate, asserted and pre- 
served his identity, worked out his question 
of sticking to that and to nothing else; and 
has so been able to reach us and touch us as 
a poet, in spite of the accidents and dangers 
that must have beset this course." And so 
through three solid pages he marvels at the 
rare good fortune that has attended poetic 
genius, in the past and in our own time, in its 
struggle with the asperities of a harsh and 
cruel world which is all excellent in its 
way, but does not advance us far in our 
acquaintance with Rupert Brooke. Neverthe- 
less we do gather, in the leisurely course of 
this preface, the main facts of Brooke's short 
life. He was born in 1887 at Rugby, where 
his father was a house-master, and he had two 
brothers. The father died in 1910, one of the 
three sons at an earlier date, another in battle 
on the Western Front, and Rupert himself on 
a French hospital ship on his way from Alex- 
andria to Gallipoli. He had finished his edu- 
cation at Cambridge, had won a fellowship at 
King's College, had travelled and seen the 
world and written two slender volumes of 
verse ; and now his mortal part lies buried on 
" the steep summit of a Greek island of infi- 
nite grace . . placed in such earth and amid 
such beauty of light and shade and embracing 
prospect as that the fondest reading of his 
young lifetime could have suggested nothing 
better." In addition to the present collection 



of journalist letters, there is yet to appear, 
under the editorship of " his intimate and de- 
voted friend," Mr. Edward Marsh, another 
volume of letters so arranged and annotated 
as to make " an admirable brief memoir," as. 
Mr. James tells us; and a footnote by Mr. 
Marsh announces that " there remain also to 
be published a book on John Webster and a 
prose play in one act." And now let us turn 
to the " Letters from America." 

Inevitably the visitor's impressions of New 
York, the port of landing, fill the first few 
pages of his book. Of the great city in its 
night apparel of electric light we find him 
writing as follows : 

" On the Staten Island ferry-boat you slip out 
from the darkness right under the immense sky- 
scrapers. As they recede they form into a mass 
together, heaping up one behind another* fire-lined 
and majestic, sentinel over the black, gold-streaked 
waters. Their cliff-like boldness is the greater, 
because to either side sweep in the East Kiver and 
the Hudson Kiver, leaving this piled promontory 
between. To the right hangs the great stretch of 
the Brooklyn Suspension Bridge, its slight curve 
very purely outlined with light; over it luminous 
trams, like shuttles of fire, are thrown across and 
across, continually weaving the stuff of human 
existence. From further off all these lights dwin- 
dle to a radiant semi-circle that gazes out over 
the expanse with a quiet, mysterious expectancy. 
Far away seaward you may see the low golden 
glare of Coney Island." 

It is plain from the outset that America is 
to be viewed with no coldly critical scrutiny, 
prosaic realities and ugly blemishes are to be 
thrust into no offensive prominence. Even 
the plain and undeniable facts of our too 
commercial, too careworn, too paltry existence 
are sometimes overlooked, sometimes even 
denied. Our bustling, hustling, nervous city- 
dwellers strike this young idealist as present- 
ing faces wonderfully free from wrinkles. 
" Smoothness is the one unfailing characteris- 
tic," he writes. Our women, and our men 
too, are of a certain stately comeliness in his 
eyes. " Handsome people of both sexes are 
very common," he declares ; " beautiful, and 
pretty, ones very rare." Could one ask for a 
better instance of attributes possessing an 
excellence not " unborrowed from the eye " ?' 

As was natural and fitting, this young cor- 
respondent on his first visit to the New World 
was vividly impressed by the mere externali- 
ties and superficialities which an older, more 
experienced traveller would have passed by, 
or passed through, to the substance and 
meaning underneath. There is lightness and 
grace and charm in this rapid, careless, yet 
quickly observant and generously apprecia- 
tive survey of the Avonders of the western eon-

tinent. Something more, too, than the surface 
aspect of things is occasionally reflected in 
these letters. Whether or not with the clear- 
est discernment, here is what the young En- 
glishman has to say, among other things, of 
Boston : 

" The city sat primly on her little hills, decorous, 
civilised, European-looking. It is homely after 
New York. The Boston crowd is curiously En- 
glish. They have nice eighteenth-century houses 
there, and ivy grows on the buildings. And they 
are hospitable. All Americans are hospitable; but 
they have n't quite time in New York to practise 
the art so perfectly as the Bostonians. It is a 
lovely art. . . But Boston makes you feel at 
home without meaning to. A delicious ancient 
Toryism is to be found here. ' What is wrong 
with America,' a middle-aged lady told me, 'is 
this Democracy. They ought to take the votes 
away from these people who do n't know how to 
use them, and give them only to us, the Educated.' 
My heart leapt the Atlantic, and was in a Cathe- 
dral or University town of South England." 

Characteristic of the writer is the attention 
lie pays, in his first paragraphs on Niagara 
Falls, to the human element in the surround- 
ings of that wonder of nature. His glance 
notes first of all the " hotels, power-houses, 
bridges, trams, picture post-cards, sham 
legends, stalls, booths, rifle-galleries, and side- 
shows," that fringe the central attraction. 
He gives ample space to the "touts" of all 
kinds, " touts insinuating, and touts raucous, 
greasy touts, brazen touts, and upper-class, 
refined, gentlemanly, take-you-by-the-arm 
touts; touts who intimidate and touts who 
wheedle," and so on for three-quarters of a i 
page. But at last he comes to the cataract 
itself and lets himself loose in some fine de- 
scriptive writing. 

" Here and there a rock close to the surface is i 
marked by a white wave that faces backwards and 
seems to be rushing madly up-stream, but is really 
stationary in the headlong charge. But for these 
signs of reluctance, the waters seem to fling them- 
selves on with some foreknowledge of their fate, 
in an ever wilder frenzy. But it is no Maeter- 
linckian prescience. They prove, rather, that Greek 
belief that the great crashes are preceded by a 
louder merriment and a wilder gaiety. Leaping 
in the sunlight, careless, entwining, clamorously 
joyful, the waves riot on towards the verge." 

Not to the beaten track of tourist travel 
does Rupert Brooke confine himself. After 
seeing New York and Boston. Montreal and 
Quebec and the Saguenay. Toronto and 
Niagara, he extends his journeying to the 
western prairies and the Rockies, to Winni- 
peg and the vast Canadian Northwest. The 
Pacific Ocean, too, and the South Sea Islands 
(for he was on his way to the Orient) receive 
some attention as the book draws to a close 



a book memorable and of a pathetic, roman- 
tic interest because of the attraction one feels 
for the high-hearted, joyous, engaging young 
poet who wrote it, and whose pleasing face, 
let it be added, looks out at us from the 
frontispiece, giving increased desire to read 
his letters of a first voyage to the new Far 
West and the old Far East.

ROMAIN ROL-LAXD AS CRITIC.* 

A great critic will be likely to work in sev- 
eral different ways. He will generally make 
some detailed investigations and studies on 
things of more particular interest to him. He 
will generally begin in this way and so gain 
a solid foundation of fact in one place at 
least. Then he will also make more general 
studies, or rather write something of a more 
general character than his own special studies, 
on the great figures or the great movements or 
great questions of art that seem to him par- 
ticularly significant. He will also now- 
adays at least be likely to put his ideas into 
the form of fiction, and will produce stories, 
novels, or plays moulded by his feeling for 
life and art, or expressive of it. And lastly, 
he will be very likely to say what he thinks on 
questions of the day. Not all men who may 
be called great critics have done all these 
things, in fact there are but few who do 
all. But there are so many who do one and 
another, that all four seem the natural exer- 
cises of the critical power. 

Romaiu Rolland has heretofore been most 
widely known as a novel-writer and a publi- 
cist the two aspects of the critic less com- 
monly thought of till late years at least. In 
" Some Musicians of Former Days " he is the 
student of musical history. In these days, 
when his soul is so wrung with more poignant 
events, he would perhaps not care to be 
thought of as the historian of the opera. But 
for us whatever we can get from his hand is 
of value, and there is an especial pleasure in 
reading this book written in happier days, 
when he could write as ' freely of Gluck and 
Mozart as of Luigi Rossi and of Lully. The 
subject of the book is of less general interest 
than that of its companion volume, "Musi- 
cians of To-day." The early history of the 
opera in Italy and in France, the work of 
Lully and Gluck, are subjects of less current 
interest at least than the work of Berlioz, 
Debussy, and Richard Strauss, not to men-

tion other matters of which he writes in the 
earlier immensely interesting volume. Here 
M. Holland is more of an investigator, a spe- 
cial student. We should be quite unable to 
offer a criticism of the book in its especial 
field; indeed there are probably few musical 
students who know enough of the intimacies 
of the musical history of France in the seven- 
teenth and eighteenth centuries to look at the 
book from a professional standpoint. But 
such a criticism is hardly needed for the gen- 
eral reader; for most of us it is enough to 
say that here is a book by a man of broad 
view and of intimate knowledge, of very gen- 
eral ideas on art and very particular interest 
in detail. It is a remarkable combination, 
more significant really than M. Holland's 
essays on subjects more of our own day. You 
may follow under his guidance along the his- 
tory of music from very early times, and you 
may study Lully's recitative and Racine's 
declamation. There is one good thing about 
such a combination: it rather insures us 
against empty generalizations made on slight 
knowledge, on the one hand, and against the 
passionate insistence on details that are of 
little interest or importance except to the 
writer himself. One reads such a book with 
a sort of confidence. It not only gives con- 
tinual ideas, but it makes one feel that one is 
on solid ground.* 

The book on Michelangelo is of another 
sort ; it is one of those larger generalizations 
which has been mentioned. We do no injus- 
tice to M. Holland to suppose that he is by no 
means the specialist in the Italian art of the 
fifteenth century that he is in French music 
of the centuries following, or in fact to sup- 
pose that he has not the particular knowledge 
of painting, sculpture, architecture, and 
poetry (for in all these arts did Michel- 
angelo excel) that he has of music. It is as 
a musical critic that he is especially known, 

* It is hard enough to give a. true idea of M. Holland's 
powers without stopping for minor linguistic corrections. The 
translation of " Musiciens d'autrefois," though in the main 
good, is quite often incorrect, not by the accident of a mistake 
here and there, but apparently as a result of not knowing 
enough of the author's style and subject. On page 39 the 
translation reads " the stag by St. Eustace's crucifix " ; the 
original reads " du cerf au crucifix de saint Eustache." It 
was, of course, the stag which had the crucifix, between 
his horns. Such errors (and there are a number of them) 
are not vitally important ; rather more so to our mind is an 
error of another kind which occurs now and then. M. Hol- 
land says something of art or life in general ; the translation 
puts it down to some particular time and place. Speaking 
of the art of music of the sixth century, the translation says 
on page 8 : " From Rome it went to England, to Germany, 
and to France ; and no art was more representative of its 
time." M. Holland wrote: " Jamais art ne fut plus repre- 
sentatif d'un temps." The same passage shows also a way 
in which (to our mind) the translation fails to render the 
original. In many cases where the French has two sentences 
the translation merges them in one with a semi-colon and an 
" and " between the two. This is a different way of writing. 
We think it a poorer way ; but at any rate, it is not that of 
M. Holland. We have not compared the text of the transla- 
tion with the original throughout, but we have done enough 
to show that there are too many errors like these. 



and yet it is one of the notes of his especial 
view of art that he should comprehend and 
wish to present the life and work of one of 
the greatest men in the other arts. He has 
written a short book on Beethoven in a series 
called " Lives of Illustrious Men," but for the 
same series he has also written the lives of 
Tolstoi and of Michelangelo. This particu- 
lar book is another study prepared for another 
series. 

This book on Michelangelo is a very char- 
acteristic piece of work; it is a study of the 
man and his influence on his time rather than 
an exposition of the qualities of the different 
works of art which he produced. Those who 
think of art as a storehouse of powers or vir- 
tues, each with its especial effect upon the 
soul of man, will not find here any statement 
of the impression made by one or all of the 
works of Michelangelo upon the beholder. 
M. Holland goes from the work to the man: 
"Nothing like Michelangelo had ever ap- 
peared before," says he. "He passed like 
a whirlwind, and after he had passed the 
brilliant and sensual Florence of Lorenzo 
de'Medici and Botticelli, of Verrocchio and 
Leonardo, was ended forever. All that har- 
monious living and dreaming, that spirit of 
analysis, that aristocratic and courtly poetry, 
the whole elegant and subtle art of the 
' Quattrocento,' was swept away at one blow. 
Even after he had been gone for a long time, 
the world of art was still whirled along in the 
eddies of his wild spirit." It must have been 
a mighty force that did any such work; M. 
Holland is interested in showing what sort of 
force it was. We will not discuss that mat- 
ter; we can fancy that the special students 
of music or of any of the arts might say that 
M. Holland was a biographer or an historian 
rather than a critic. That matter need not 
distract our attention at the moment; M. 
Holland might well say that music or any 
other art can never do more than give us the 
inspiration of a great soul, in fact, I am 
under the impression that he has made that 
statement somewhere. 

M. Holland believes in great men. In 1903 
he wrote as follows: 

" The air is heavy around us. The old coun- 
tries of Europe are stifling in a dense and vitia- 
ted atmosphere. A materialism without grandeur 
weighs upon thought and hinders the action of 
government and individual. The world is dying 
of asphyxia in an egoism, that is base as well as 
prudent. It chokes. Let us open our windows. 
Let us let in the fresh air. Let us breathe in the 
air which has given life to heroes." 
This he wrote in an introduction to a life of 
Beethoven, "notre Beethoven," as he likes 



1916]

to call him,* meaning that a great man be- 
longs to the world. Perhaps M. Rolland was 
the writer of an anonymous article in the 
"Revue Bleue" last Fall called "Pourqu-on 
joue Beethoven." In that article Beethoven 
and Michelangelo were spoken of together as 
the " two high-priests of the will to attain 
their ideal in spite of suffering." By a knowl- 
edge of such men we may endure a surround- 
ing world which we think we cannot bear. 
" We are not alone in the combat. The night 
of the world is aglow with divine lights." 

Such words will have a familiar sound to 
the readers of " Jean-Christophe." Since he 
was able, it was most natural that M. Rolland 
should have liked to imagine and to realize 
the figure of one who was always a rebel 
against the circumstances of a society which 
could not or would not give more than a light 
moment or two to one who believed in the 
things of the spirit. " Jean-Christophe " is a 
biography; in it, as in these critical works. 
M. Rolland goes straight to the facts of life 
as he knows them by his creative imagination, 
just as in the others his critical investigations 
show him the facts of life in monographs and 
memoirs. 

It would have been astonishing if such a 
voice had kept silent during the struggles and 
agonies of the past eighteen months. It is to 
be regretted that when that voice was heard 
there was shortly discerned a lack of harmony 
between its clear note and the voices of his 
countrymen. Yet it would have been strange 
had this not been the case. The temper of the 
political world has in the last half century 
been strongly nationalistic: such has cer- 
tainly been the tone in France; those who 
two years ago read the studies on the disposi- 
tion of the younger generation (for instance, 
Agathon's "Les JeunesGensd'Aujourd'hui") 
will remember that one thing noted there was j 
that the young France of to-day was devoted 
to a patriotic faith, especially as compared 
with the generation now passing from the 
stage. In literature and the arts precisely 
the other thing has taken place : never has the ' 
world of art been so cosmopolitan. In the 
last fifty years the world has gone well along 
in realizing the conception which Matthew 
Arnold voiced for England some fifty years 
ago, of Europe " as being for intellectual pur- 
poses, one great confederation, bound to a 
joint action and working to a common result." 
One does not want to depreciate either of

those two noble feelings to elevate the other. 
M. Rolland has certainly never done so. 
Somehow or other we must have a synthesis 
of the two, but we have not succeeded in get- 
ting it yet. 

M. Rolland now lives, we hear, in Geneva. 
It is a privilege that by the translation of his 
books he is becoming more and more a well- 
known figure in our own country.

AN ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF AMERICAN 
GOVERNMENT.* 

The elaborate " Cyclopedia of American 
Government," produced under the editorship 
of Professors McLaughlin and Hart, is an 
excellent work, which has suffered unduly at 
the hands of the critics. The present reviewer 
feels a bit inclined to throw " his hat in the 
ring," and to write an essay on reviews and 
reviewers. He will, however, restrict himself 
to a few pertinent remarks, suggested by the 
treatment this work has received. 

There are two radically different ways of 
judging a book. According to one method, 
the reviewer may set up an ideal in his own 
mind quite different from the ideal of the 
author, and then blame the author because 
the latter does not conform to the reviewer's 
ideal. The author may, for example, have 
intended to write a history of economic 
thought or of political theory which shall con- 
cisely endeavor to trace out only the great 
main currents that have made the science in 
question what it is. Many reviewers seem to 
think that in such circumstances the book is 
fruitfully criticized when it is pointed out 
that certain minor authors are not discussed, 
although it would have to be an entirely dif- 
ferent sort of book which should discuss these 
minor authors. The second method and it 
seems to the present writer the only fair 
method is to ascertain the task which the 
author set himself, and then endeavor to 
answer the question: In what measure has 
he successfully performed his task? After 
this question has been answered, it is appro- 
priate to ask whether the task was one that 
was worth doing. 

In the case of the " Cyclopedia of Amer- 
ican Government," it is easy to point out 
many things which might well have been dif- 
ferent. Many articles would be better if they 
were longer ; but this would have necessitated 
a much larger work. If it is suggested that

many of the articles could have been omitted, 
this also would imply a different sort of work 
from that which the editors planned. Let us 
consider, then, the task the editors set them- 
selves, as they describe it. 

They tell us that their experience as stu- 
dents and teachers has shown them the need 
of an encyclopaedia of American Government. 
In their Introduction they speak as follows 
of the " range of the work " : 

" In this work the word ' government ' is used as 
a comprehensive term; it includes the theory or 
philosophy of political society, the forms of polit- 
ical organization whether those forms have been 
laid down in distinct, written law or are only more 
or less permanent modes of expressing the public 
will the methods and agencies by which law or 
governmental purposes are usually carried out." 

Perhaps the real nature of the work could 
be described better than the editors them- 
selves have described it. It seems to be an 
encyclopaedia for those whose primary inter- 
est is the American Government, and to in- 
clude those articles within the broad field of 
the social sciences, including history, which 
would be of concern to such persons ; it being 
understood, however, that the appeal of each 
article is not primarily to the specialist, but 
to all those embraced under the somewhat 
vague expression, " the intelligent public." 
The preacher, the newspaper editor, the 
teacher, the politician, these are some whom 
the editors have had in mind. Let us quote 
again from the Introduction: 

" The book is meant for the general reader and 
for those whose interests and duties call them to the 
study of public affairs ; it is meant for the library, 
the study table, the editorial room, and the class- 
room; it is meant for the writer or public speaker 
who wishes to obtain a certain amount of direct, 
concrete information on a special topic, and desires 
references to further and more detailed treatment. 
The editors have kept in mind also the needs of 
school and college students who wish to extend the 
information given in the classroom." 

How have the editors and the authors ac- 
complished their purpose? The reply must 
be, " fairly well." They have produced an 
extremely useful work. The editors, them- 
selves scholars of note, have gathered about 
them most of the American writers of author- 
ity within the field of the social sciences. It 
was to be expected that there should be inac- 
curacies here and there, certainly this could 
not be otherwise in the first edition of a work 
of this character. The present reviewer has 
read many of the articles, and those which he 
has read have been on the whole accurate, 
concise, and fairly well written. Each article 
is followed by a brief bibliography, which 
seems to include the more important works 



for those for whom this encyclopaedia is in- 
tended. Those who read the works mentioned 
will receive sufficient aid for more exhaustive 
studies, if they care to make them. The 
economic essays, which are naturally those tc 
which the present writer first turns, are good, 
Special mention may be made of the articles 
by Professor E. H. Vickers, and he seems tc 
have written many. Professor Commons, an 
acknowledged authority on all labor ques 
tions, has made a number of useful contribu 
tions. An excellent article by Professor H. J 
Davenport on economic distribution deserve? 
mention, and perhaps also a word of criti 
cism, because it is too technical for those foi 
whom this encyclopaedia is intended. II 
would give ground for great surprise iJ 
among those who consult this work one persor 
in twenty would have anything but the 
vaguest idea of what Professor Davenport is 
talking about. On the other hand, his essaj 
is a valuable resume for the special studenl 
of economics. Articles by Professors Ernsi 
Freund, W. W. Willoughby, and Jesse Mac^ 
will attract attention. It seems somewhat in 
vidious, however, to select out those whos< 
names have been mentioned. Just as good, 01 
perhaps better, articles have been written bj 
others in the large group of contributors. 

The law articles are accurate, but they ma^ 
be criticized as jejune. They are too formal 
and, so far as the present reviewer has ob 
served, they entirely fail to take note of th< 
new spirit which is entering into the law 
They do not give even an approximately ade 
quate idea of the social questions involved it 
legal discussions at the present moment, anc 
do not suggest the work' which has been dom 
in recent years under the designation of socio 
logical jurisprudence. 

One does not get the impression that to th< 
editors the preparation of this encyclopaedia 
has been a labor of love. They could hardb 
have contemplated it as a monument to them 
selves. Probably they did not look upon it a: 
a work to be revised and re-revised and con 
stantly associated with their names. When i 
is compared with the German " Handwb'rter 
buch der Staatswissenschaften," the contras 
becomes painful. The late Professor Conrad 
editor-in-chief of the German work, doubtlesi 
looked upon the " Handworterbuch " as om 
of his main contributions to economics am 
political science, and probably would hav< 
mentioned his labors in connection with thi 
" Handworterbuch " as ranking next to hi 
editorship of the "Jahrbucher fur National 
oekonomie und Statistik." The contributor 
to Conrad's " Handworterbuch " seem gener 
ally to have taken their contributions mor<

seriously than perhaps most of those who 
have contributed to the " Cyclopedia of 
American Government." 

Perhaps, however, American conditions are 
as much to blame as the shortcomings of 
editors and authors. The publication of a 
work of this kind appears to be far more ex- 
pensive in this country than in Germany, and 
the possible contributors fewer. German pub- 
lishers seem to find a work like Conrad's 
"* Handworterbuch der Staatswissenschaften " 
remunerative, either directly or indirectly; 
and they are able to get out edition after edi- 
tion, each one an improvement upon the pre- 
ceding. It may be doubted, on the other 
hand, if the publishers of the " Cyclopedia of 
American Government " will ever get their 
money back: and it is to be feared that the 
sales will not warrant new and improved edi- 
tions from new plates. 

The editors should have had more money 
at their disposal. Then, too, the authors 
-should have put more time upon their work. 
if they had been writing for the " Encyclo- 
pedia Britannica " they certainly would have 
done so. Probably it is not possible under 
American conditions to publish without a 
subsidy a work comparable to Conrad's 
" Handworterbuch." Even if the present 
work is worth while as having in a measurable 
degree accomplished its purposes, probably 
the editors would be well advised not to at- 
tempt a similar task again, unless they could 
have a large and generous subsidy, and so be 
able to make their work really monumental. 
The editors gave four years to their task : but 
doubtless they had their regular duties as 
university professors to perform, and other 
literary projects on their hands at the same 
time. 

But after all. both publishers and editors 
deserve commendation for undertaking a diffi- 
cult task under discouraging conditions. If a 
score card is to be filled out with one hundred 
as the highest mark, the publishers would per- 
haps deserve a grade of ninety, the editors 
eighty-five, and the authors eighty-three. 
making a composite of all the authors. Those 
for whom the work is intended will find it 

well worth while.

BREEFS ox XEW BOOKS. 

Academic linen when exposed to 
' public gaze may afford quite as 

undignified a spectacle as that 
of any other persuasion. Professor Lightner 
"Witmer, of the University of Pennsylvania, 
has brought together the documents and opin- 
ions in "The Case of Dr. Scott Xearing" 
(Huebsch) with editorial skill and a fair con- 
sideration of the party of the other part. 
One need not conclude that all is rotten in the 
State of Pennsylvania in order to be con- 
vinced that all is not well there. The tenure 
of academic positions, the grounds of dismissal 
of Dr. Nearing, the considerations to be ob- 
served in academic relations, the merits and 
demerits of Dr. Xearing as an academic ex- 
emplar and public servant, are all involved: 
and over and above all, the infringement of 
academic liberty. The evidence of the compe- 
tence of Dr. Xearing. judged by standards at 
once critical and appropriate, seems complete ; 
his teaching was effective and appreciated. 
The question of the influence of a man's tem- 
per, manner, poise, in reflecting a responsible 
sense of his utterances as representative of 
his University, is a nice one. and less decisive 
in the present issue. Admissions of indiscre- 
tion are rather unpleasantly entangled with 
reformatory zeal in opposition to views and 
interests dear to members of the Board of 
Trustees. Out of the controversial tangle and 
the series of newspaper charges and counter- 
charges a few things of vital import are 
clear. The mode of dismissal of Dr. Xearing 
is indefensible, as equally the policy under 
which the action was taken is incompatible 
with the protection of inalienable rights and 
dignities of an academic position: the mode 
of government in practice at the University 
of Pennsylvania is not conducive to the best 
interests of an institution of the higher learn- 
ing: the considerations weighing with that 
body, and the suspicion of employing an offi- 
cial position to undermine the forces which 
they regard as inimical to their personal inter- 
ests, and all the underground byways of 
influence that play their part in the political 
arena. these strengthen the charge of dubi- 
ous integrity of purpose of the trustees. 
Xothing is white or black: but much of it 
shades closely into the darker grays of inter- 
ference with academic freedom. It may be 
that the dismissal of Dr. Xearing was both 
wise and defensible. The manner of his 
taking off and the disclosure of the question- 
able "diplomatic " setting of the Xearing case 
leave an unpleasant impression, which it is 
the business of those concerned and directlv

even a suspicion of a blot upon its escutcheon. 



An introductory chapter to the 
contemporary second series of Miss Winifred 

French, novelists. _, , -n -I-..T * . 

Stephens s French Novelists of 
To-day" (Lane) elaborates the theory that 
" the French novels produced since the begin- 
ning of the century show that France, like the 
rest of Western Europe, has been experienc- 
ing a revolt against intellectualism ; that in 
French writers there has been a tendency to 
return to authority to evince a preference 
for instinctive rather than rational methods, 
to insist that man is after all only a little bit 
reasonable, that reason plays a very minor 
part in his life; and even to minimise that 
minor part." The chapter makes a fairly suc- 
cessful effort to clarify that which can never 
be fully clarified for English or American 
readers, the interwoven influences of poli- 
tics, religion, and philosophy which must form 
the background for the study of any French 
man of letters. Frequent reference to two 
notable figures, Charles Maurras and Maurice 
Barres, lends the discussion concreteness. 
Thereafter consideration is given, successively, 
to Marcelle Tinayre, Romain Holland (with a 
separate chapter on "Jean Christophe"), the 
Tharauds, Rene Boylesve, Pierre Mille, and 
Jean Aicard. In each case the life and the 
intellectual development of the writer are 
traced, the important works summarized, and 
the novelist's art and theories subjected to 
balanced if not always searching criticism. 
The volume, which is provided with portraits, 
an index, and brief bibliographies, very well 
serves its purpose of introducing the English- 
speaking reader to several novelists of con- 
temporary France. 



Memoirs of Some interesting light on fairly 
a Japanese recent Japanese diplomacy may 
be found in " The Secret Memoirs 
of Count Tadasu Hayashi" (Putnam), which 
have been edited by Mr. A. M. Pooley, for- 
merly Renter's Correspondent in Japan. The 
chapters dealing with the Anglo-Japanese 
Alliance, by far the most interesting in the 
volume, were published in Japan and abroad 
in 1913. Mr. Pooley, however, secured a new 
text, as well as additional chapters of 'the 
unfinished memoirs, and has reprinted several 
articles by Count Hayashi from Japanese 
periodicals. The negotiations leading to the 



first Anglo-Japanese Alliance are dealt with in 
full, for Count Hayashi was Minister to Great 
Britain and a warm advocate of the arrange- 
ment. There was, however, some discussion 
of a Russo-Japanese Alliance at this time, in 
which Prince Ito and Marquis Inouye, two of 
the Elder Statesmen, were prominent; and 
Prince Ito actually took up the matter with 
Russian statesmen in Petrograd while Hayashi 
was negotiating in London. Although there 
are brief chapters on the American-Japanese 
notes of 1908 and the Immigration Question, 
they are less suggestive than those in which 
Count Hayashi defends the policy of the 
Saionji Ministry toward China. As he had 
been Minister to China as well as Minister for 
Foreign Affairs, his views on the Chinese ques- 
tion are well worth noting. He frankly states 
that Japan drove Russia out of South Man- 
churia for purely selfish reasons. He believes 
that there will be many questions to be settled 
between Japan and China, but he counsels 
moderation and patience. He stands for the 
principle of the integrity of China and the 
"open door," and asserts "there is no longer 
any desire to obtain control of parts of China 
for China is a very difficult country to man 
age and the population is very large." Bui 
he also believes " the way to deal with Chins 
is for the Powers to combine and insist or 
what they want and to go on insisting unti] 
they get it." Perhaps the recent Sino-Japa 
nese negotiations might have taken anothei 
course if Count Hayashi had lived and helc 
his old portfolio in Tokyo. 

ri Ml Mr. George Jean Nathan's 

chatter about "Another Book on the Theatre ' 
the theatre. (Huebsch) is described by its au 
thor, a New York professional dramatic critic 
as "a collection of haphazard, fugitive anc 
some might say impudent reflections in and or 
the mirror which the theatre is supposed t( 
hold up to nature but with which, instead, ii 
more often holds up its patrons." It differs 
from most books on the theatre by concerning 
itself with actual drama on the stage rathei 
than with literary drama in books. Mr 
Nathan declares himself a destructive critic 
" The destructive critic occupies an honest anc 
helpful position in the community. He is t( 
drama what vaccine is to smallpox. He make! 
a bit of a mess, to be sure, and a lot of childrer 
kick around with a vague idea that they ough 
to combat him, and he makes a great many per 
sons sore, but he does not fail of his purpose.' 
In this destructive capacity, Mr. Nathan as 
sails everybody and everything in the theatri 
cal world. He assails "constructive" critic; 
as " mountebanks, those bizarre minstrels wh<

bore peaceful managers and rich playwrights 
and poor actors and a helpless public with 
sapient twaddle anent technique, the unities 
of Aristotle and other anachronistic wisdoms." 
He assails " the toothless professors of the tra- 
ditions and the kindly conservative quacks." 
He assails the theatre-going public : " We 
Americans are critically a nation in the con- 
stant state of having just had three cocktails 
on an empty stomach. We are ever ready and 
eager to cheer the guesswork of the nearest 
press agent. We are the back-slappers of the 
cosmos, the have-a-drink convivials of the 
world of art, the good fellows, the lodge broth- 
ers and the come-ons. . . We welcome all 
artists but artists." He assails most of all, 
of course, plays, playwrights, players, and 
managers. His book is full of well-deserved 
ridicule, satire, burlesque, and downright con- 
demnation. For this we are all grateful. It is 
too full, however. Mr. Nathan yields to the 
temptation inherent in facile wit and the 
knack of " punchy " language, and defeats his 
own purpose by a certain indiscriminateness 
of attack. He reminds us of his own defini- 
tion of the " young dramatic critic " as " being 
usually inclined to throw his education around 
and to concern himself with being assiduously 
witty." There is really not much excuse for 
the printing of such criticism in book form. 
In spite of its praiseworthy stand for dramatic 
art, it contains little that is not journalisti- 
cally smart and exaggerated in both matter 
and language. Its chief appeal will be to 
theatre-goers in New York and other large cit- 
ies where there is still acted drama. Add to 
this that it contains too much sex wit. Old- 
fashioned Puritan reticence was at least as 
moral as modern so-called truthfulness, and 
quite as funny. 

An English ^ r Edwin Pears has published 
diplomat in his memoirs of life in Turkey 
lnople - under the title, " Forty Years in 
Constantinople" (Appleton). The number is 
really an understatement, for Sir Edwin's 
residence in Turkey extended from 1873 to 
1915. During that time he witnessed three 
revolutions, saw three Sultans deposed and 
eleven British ambassadors come and go. Al- 
though he held no official position, his emi- 
nence as a lawyer in the Consular Courts and 
his long experience of affairs in the Near 
East combined to make him a valued unoffi- 
cial adviser of the British government. One 
can readily understand how the transparent 
honesty and sound common sense of this 
sturdy Yorkshireman must have proved of 
inestimable assistance in dealing with the tor- 
tuous Levantines. Sir Edwin's reminiscences 



are based on memory, his books and notes 
having been left in Constantinople when he 
was compelled to depart in December, 1914. 
This no doubt accounts for the somewhat 
sketchy nature of the first part of the book. 
The second, and for us the more interesting, 
half deals with events from the beginning of 
the Young Turk movement to the outbreak of 
the present war. The book is soberly, even 
dully, written, but compels interest because it 
is a record of great events sincerely observed. 
There are incidental pictures of many famous 
men, Skobeleff, Lord Dufferin, von der 
Goltz, Biberstein, Abdul Hamid, Enver 
Pasha, and others. It is Sir Edwin's task also 
to show how sentiment in the English colony 
in Constantinople changed during those years 
from pro-Turkish and anti-Russian to the 
exact opposites. The author himself was 
never a Turkophile. As correspondent of the 
London " Daily News " he was instrumental in 
arousing English indignation over the Turk- 
ish atrocities in Bulgaria and thus in influ- 
encing Gladstone's later conduct. Neverthe- 
less, Sir Edwin freely recognizes that the 
Turk in his private capacity is kindly and 
amiable ; it is as a ruler of subject races that 
he has failed lamentably. " The Turkish gov- 
ernment has never known how to treat its 
discontented subjects in any other way than 
by means of massacre," is a sentence that has 
been hideously confirmed by events which 
have happened since it was written. In the 
reconstruction which will follow the war he 
pleads that the seven millions of real Turks 
be allowed to constitute a nation by them- 
selves, though under no consideration to hold 
sway over other peoples. Sir Edwin shows 
clearly from the inside what had already been 
fairly plain to outside observers, that it was 
Germany who forcibly jockeyed Turkey into 
the war in the autumn of 1914. American 
readers will be interested in the author's 
praise of the splendid civilizing work of Rob- 
ert College, and in his appreciation of the 
services which Ambassador Morgenthau has 
rendered to all the Western Europeans in 
Turkey. The handsome book contains many 
fine illustrations.

quality what it lacks in quantity. Volume 
three of the series is just out (volume two, a 
collection of short stories, being delayed) and 
is entitled "Mysterium Arcae Boule." No 
profound knowledge of Latin is needed to 
enable one to recognize in this Mr. Burton E. 
Stevenson's detective story, " The Mystery of 
the Boule Cabinet," though why the transla- 
tor, Dr. Arcadius Avellanus, chooses to accent 
the famous French cabinet-maker's name and 
thus mystify the reader, passes understand- 
ing. Andre Charles Boule (or Boulle) pro- 
nounced his patronymic in one syllable, and 
so unquestioned is this pronunciation that 
" Boule work " is often written, in German 
fashion, "Buhl work." As might have been 
expected, a modern novel of this kind offers 
opportunity for much ingenuity in Latinizing 
colloquialisms ; and praise is due the transla- 
tor for his linguistic dexterity. Here are a 
few examples. " You blithering idiot ! " be- 
comes, in the speech of the ancient Romans, 
"Bipedum stultissime ! " "It's all right" is 
put with even greater brevity, "Nihil mali." 
" Well, I'll be damned! " is not quite so easily 
recognized in " Quid, malum ! " " It's too 
much for me" is translated, "Vires meas 
omnino excedit." Occasionally a somewhat 
unnecessary departure from the letter of the 
original is to be noted. Before one has read 
twenty lines a noticeable instance occurs. 
The narrator speaks of walking "toward 
Washington Square, just above which, on the 
Avenue, the old Vantine mansion stood." 
These words become in Latin, "versus Com- 
pitum Washington, paullo supra eum locum 
Plateae, ubi vetustae gedes Vantinianae sta- 
bant," which does not reproduce the relative 
clause of the original. Again, at the begin- 
ning of chapter eight, " Give him a whiff of 
this" (referring to a bottle of ammonia) is 
rendered, "Praebe illi paucas guttas ex hoc." 
Halitus would seem to be nearer the mark 
than gutta. But enough of hair-splitting. It 
is a first-rate book with which to polish up, 
easily and enjoyably, one's rusty Latin. Mr. 
E. Parmalee Prentice, 37 Wall St., New York, 
is the publisher. 

Ethical 'aspects J/ nder the SUggCStive title of 

of the Freudian "The Freudian Wish (Holt), 
Professor E. B. Holt of Har- 
vard University has produced a thoroughly 
readable and in some aspects notable book. 
The much discussed and equally disparaged 
and acclaimed doctrine of Freud has en- 
livened psychological discussion in many a 
field. The doctrine attaches significance to 
the by-products of the mind's occupations, 



and sets forth the mechanism in which mean- 
ing lies. Life is a conflict between desire and 
the restricted range of expression which op- 
portunity, convention, scruple, restraint, and 
all the many forces of repression make possi- 
ble or seemly. The undercurrent of desire 
breaks through in occasional indulgence and 
sporadic reactions, and yet more subtly and 
evasively in a series of minor lapses and un- 
absorbed impulses now caught, examined, and 
disclosed by the insight of a Freudian scru- 
tiny. Dreams, jokes, forgettings, mis-speak- 
ings, are all similarly significant ; they reveal 
a covertly entertained longing or wish, and 
have an intricate motive history. Professor 
Holt develops the ethical import of the Freu- 
dian doctrine, and sets forth with much 
ingenuity how the conflicts of duty and of 
moral hesitation find their clarification in 
Freudian terms. Much of this exposition and 
analysis is as much Holt as Freud, but it is 
consistently developed from the Freudian 
premises. It harks back to Spinoza as the 
original Freudian, in his statement that 
thinking and wishing are one; and it harks 
back to the Socratic method, as well as to the 
Socratic doctrine that makes ethical conduct 
the most discriminating wisdom. It is the 
resolution of doubt by the absorption and 
integration of conduct in a higher unity of 
consistency (as opposed to the yielding of 
compromise and to the ascetic rejection and 
repression) whereby inner conflict develops 
rather than thwarts. The doctrine as it is 
thus barely outlined seems meagre and poor to 
account for the richness of actual experience ; 
but significance lies in rating, and motives are 
as important as actions. What often repels 
in the Freudian view is not the principle of 
interpretation, but 'the detailed reference of 
trivial inclinations to areas of desire, such as 
that of sex most conspicuously, quite too re- 
mote, and equally quite too pathological, to 
form an acceptable raison d'etre. It is indeed 
unfortunate that the Freudian principle has 
come so largely into psychology with a patho- 
logical tang; and it is one of the merits of 
Professor Holt's little contribution that it 
restores the perspective by an exegesis in nor- 
mal terms and familiar situations. But where 
conclusions are no longer repugnant, they still 
seem far-fetched, like etymological derivations 
of obscure expressions whose history is really 
conjectural. But therein lies the psychologi- 
cal lure. Men will delve for significance so 
long as the prospect is promising; and the 
discoveries of Freud, though they may not 
prove in all cases to be readily worked gold- 
mines, have opened valuable veins in the sub- 
terranean galleries of the mind.

Among the books produced by 
and psychological the war, Dr. George Crile's 
so/. ,, A Mechanistic view of War 

and Peace" (Macmillan) is unusual and espe- 
cially interesting. It is a very readable 
account of a physician's observations of the 
physiological effects of the various phases of 
war on combatants and non-combatants. 
What herculean performances of endurance 
are performed by men under the extraordi- 
nary stimulus of combat is most entertain- 
ingly stated, and fortified by excellent and 
abundant illustrations. Particularly note- 
worthy is the absence of pain when soldiers 
are under high tension, and the support this 
gives to Dr. Crile's belief that pain has its 
basis in muscular reactions. The fighting in- 
stinct, according to Dr. Crile, is a race inheri- 
tance which has left what he calls "action 
patterns" in the mind of man. "War is a 
stimulus which causes man to act; action is 
his safety valve, forced inaction his undoing. 
Hence the desire of generals to have armies 
doing, or thinking they are doing, something. 
Hence also the deleterious effects on a popu- 
lation, like that of Belgium, which is estopped 
from acting according to its desires. Action 
patterns come not only as a race inheritance 
but as the result of education. Of this Ger- 
many furnishes the best illustration. Dr. 
Crile sees the significance of this, and urges 
deliberate effort to impress peace patterns on 
the human mind as the best and most effective 
way of ridding the world of the curse of war. 



fro* Under the ^Ic, " Fifty Years of 
a famous American Idealism" (Hough- 

^ton), Mr. Gustav Pollak has 
edited a volume of editorial comment and rep- 
resentative essays from " The Nation," cover- 
ing the fifty years of that journal's existence. 
Professor Lounsbury's review of Taine's 
" English Literature," upon its appearance in 
English, 1872: an estimate of Joseph Henry 
by Simon Xewcomb. 1878; A. V. Dicey on 
"American Conservatism," 1880 ; Dr. Basil L. 
Gildersleeve on the production of the " Oedi- 
pus Tyrannus " at Harvard, 1881 -. Carl Schurz 
on " Responsible Government in Germany," 
1881: an estimate of Helmholtz by C. S. 
Pierce, 1894, and of Gladstone by James 
Bryce, 1898, are among the best of the essays 
presented: while the selections from "The 
Nation's" editorial comment cover almost 
every important problem which has been be- 
fore the public since the Civil War. For the 
fiftieth anniversary number of " The Nation," 
July 8, 1915, Mr. Pollak wrote an article on 
"The Nation and Its Contributors." This 
article, expanded to a length of over eighty 



pages, and including the editors along with 
the contributors, forms the introduction to 
the present volume. Those readers who are 
familiar with " The Nation " need not be told 
that the selections reproduced are character- 
ized by a high moral tone, serious earnestness 
of thought, and excellent English expression. 
It is a presentment in which the friends and 
sponsors of the journal may well take pride. 



British 
restraints on 
our commerce. 



Under the misleading title of 
" Economic Aspects of the War : 
Neutral Rights, Belligerent 
Claims, and American Commerce in the Years 
1914-1915" (Yale University Press), Mr. 
Edwin J. Clapp deals mainly, though not ex- 
clusively, with the British Orders in Council 
relative to neutral trade with Germany. The 
book was written, Mr. Clapp tells us, because 
it seemed to him that "we Americans were 
paying too much attention to the affairs of the 
belligerents and too little to our own." The 
writer begins by a brief statement of the rights 
of neutrals on the high seas and in the conduct 
of international trade, as formulated by the 
London Naval Conference of 1909 and the 
Hague Conventions, and then proceeds to 
show how, in the stress of actual war, England 
and Germany, but England chiefly, have failed 
I to conform their war practices to the rules thus 
; established. After discussing the trade situa- 
tion during the early months of the war, the 
I extension of the list of contraband goods, and 
the methods England took to prevent the neu- 
, tral nations from supplying Germany with the 
! necessities of war, Mr. Clapp deals succes- 
I sively with the attempts to continue the trade 
! in the more important commodities, such as 
grain, meats, cotton, coffee, rubber, wool, tea, 
I potash, dye-stuffs, fertilizers, and oil. Trade 
| in these articles should be free and untram- 
i meled by Orders in Council, Mr. Clapp argues, 
because historically speaking they have always 
been so treated in times of war and because 
otherwise the United States producers are de- 
prived of a valuable market both during and 
: after the war. Although, according to Mr. 
Clapp, Germany cannot be starved out during 
the war, she can be forced to become self- 
supporting in all these commodities, and thus 
after the war a valuable customer will be lost 
to us. England should be made to observe the 
usual rules of trade ; and if necessary to secure 
the rights of neutrals, the United States should 
declare an embargo on the exportation of arms. 
There would be no need of a formal session of 
Congress, the writer affirms, to accomplish 
this. Let the State Department but intimate 
that the Administration is prepared to call 
such a session and the desired result would be

obtained (p. 308) . The book testifies to the effi-

the blockade of German ports, and in sup-

most vigilance, has been regularly carried on 
through the countries adjacent to the German 
Empire.

mous author of On Staying at 
Home, and Other Essays" (Longmans), who 
merely designates himself on the title-page as 
" the author of ' Times and Days,' etc." But 
good wine needs no bush, and a good book 
needs no sounding name after its title. Sane 
and sensible is one's outlook on the world 
when one can say, as this author opens his 
book by saying : " I confess I have no sympa- 
thy with those that travel. I think it is 
empty heads that make itching heels, and I 
am convinced that wise people can learn more 
by staying at home than by going abroad." 
Excellent also and typical of the tone of these 
unpretentious but well-written essays is the 
following : " If you prefer to be appreciated 
by some of the best, you will live quietly, 
think sedately, write slowly, and be careless 
whether the ' run and read ' reviews praise or 
dispraise, so long as your own taste and con- 
science can accept your work as worth doing." 
This, too, is good: "A vase is made of clay, 
let us say, which is its substance; but it is 
not a vase unless it has shape. And so a 
truth may be all very well, but the truth is 
the way it is presented to you, and the style 
or manner is as essential to the result as the 
substance or message which is conveyed." But 
as the author, in his penultimate essay, cen- 
sures excessive indulgence in quotation, we 
must refrain from further sampling of his 
wares. Two-score topics (less two) are han- 
dled with penetration in the little book, which 
is from no 'prentice pen, as there are twelve 
other volumes already to the author's credit, 
as enumerated on the reverse of the half-title. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" Familiar Letters : English and American " 
selected and edited by Professor Edwin Greenlaw, 
is a recent addition to the " Lake Classics " pub- 
lished by Messrs. Scott, Foresman & Co. The fol- 
lowing authors are liberally represented : Gray, 
Cowper, Lamb, Irving, Jane Welsh Carlyle, 
Dickens, Huxley. The little volume deserves a 
warm welcome, for it covers a field that has long 
awaited from a compiler's hand just such compe- 
tent and scholarly treatment as Professor Greenlaw 
has here succeeded in giving it. 



Students of mediaeval literature will welcome 
from the workshop of that distinguished scholar, 
Professor Gollancz, a new edition of " The Parle- 
ment of the Three Ages" (Oxford Press). For 
this interesting fourteenth-century alliterative poem 
dealing with the "nine worthies," the editor has 
provided full critical apparatus. But, more than 
that, he has made accessible almost for the first 
time the fullest mediaeval treatment of the eternally 
popular subject of heroes. We are especially 
grateful when we can have such attractive printing 
of mediaeval texts. 

Several of the prominent educators of the 
country have contributed interesting and valuable 
papers to " Readings in Vocational Guidance " 
(Ginn), edited by Mr. Meyer Bloomfield. As a 
convenient handbook of the best thought on the 
subject, the volume will probably be found indis- 
pensable to those interested. In the preface, 
Mr. Bloomfield defines vocational guidance as 
" organized common sense used to help each indi- 
vidual make the most of his abilities and oppor- 
tunities." The need for this organized common 
sense has been revealed either in the frequent fail- 
ure of youth to supply the required initiative to 
work out the beginnings of a successful future or 
in the failure of society to present the proper sur- 
roundings in which it can be done. Even a casual 
reading of this book suggests that our " organized 
common sense " has been strenuously directed 
toward correcting the first of the two evils. Per- 
haps danger lurks there. We are so intent on 
shaping the peg to fit it into the square hole, that, 
to drop the figure, we may fail to emphasize the 
greater need of reconstruction of our industrial 
system so that it will meet, more fully and more 
generously, the varying demands of the indi- 
vidual. 

" Those who are stricken with great misfortunes 
often suffer intensely from the lack of sympathetic 
imagination in those who are about them." Thus 
writes, most truthfully, Mr. Robert Hichens in the 
opening piece of " The Blinded Soldiers and Sail- 
ors Gift Book " (Putnam), which has an occasional 
word that, like Mr. Hichens's observation, ought 
to shame us out of our wonted cheerfulness over 
others' ills. Mr. George Goodchild edits and 
sympathetically prefaces this collection of prose 
and verse signed (in facsimile) with such eminent 
names as Edmund Gosse, John Galsworthy, H. G. 
Wells, G. K. Chesterton, Gilbert Parker, Ellen 
Thorneycroft Fowler, Beatrice Harraden, Austin 
Dobson, A. C. Benson, and others, to the number 
of nearly two score. Illustrations by distinguished 
artists are interspersed, and Milton's two sonnets 
(XIX and XXI) on his blindness appropriately 
close the book. By a curious error, the frontis- 
piece, which might be a street scene in " Cranford," 
with crinolined women as the chief figures, and 
hardly a man in sight, is labelled " The Blinded 
Soldier." Of varying excellence and on widely 
varying themes are these gratuitous contributions; 
but surely the purpose of the volume the for- 
warding of the good work at St. Dunstan's in 
helping the blinded war-victims to help themselves 
should procure for it a good sale.

An English translation by Mr. L. G. Redmond-

Ruskin's English publishers, Messrs, Allen & Un- 
win. 

A new book by Mr. Claude Bragdon, entitled 
" Four Dimensional Vistas," will be published next 
month by Mr. Alfred A. Knopf, who has also taken

& Co. are " An Introduction to the Philosophy of

"Just David" is the title of Mrs. Eleanor H. 
Porter's new novel, to be published in March by 
Houghton Mifflin Co. Two other novels imme- 
diately forthcoming from the same house are "At 
the Door of the Gate," by Mr. Forrest Reid and 
" Emmeline " by Miss Elsie Singmaster. 

Mr. John Masefield intends issuing during the 
next few months several new books in limited edi- 
tions for subscribers only. These books are " Son- 
nets and Poems," two prose plavs entitled " The 
Locked Chest " and " The Sweeps of Ninety-Eight," 
a play in verse called " Good Friday," and " Per- 
sonal Recollections of John M. Synge." 



" The Harim and the Purdah: Studies of Ori- 
ental Women " by Mrs. Elizabeth Cooper is an- 
nounced by the Century Co. The author has spent 
many years in China, Japan, Burmah, India, and 
Egypt, and has come into the closest contact with 
Eastern women of every race, class, and type. 

The fourth volume of " The Life of Benjamin 
Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield," by Mr. G. E. 
Buckle, in succession to the late W. F. Monypenny, 
is now in type, and Messrs. Macmillan hope to pub- 
lish it during the spring. It carries the narrative 
from the Crimean War days to Disraeli's 1868 ad- 
ministration. 

" Personal Recollections of Abraham Lincoln : 
The First American," by Mr. Henry B. Rankin, 
will soon come from the press of Messrs. Putnam. 
The author was one of the " Lincoln boys " who 
grew up in the valley of the Sangamon, and was 
for several years a student in the Lincoln and 
Herndon law-office. 

King Albert has consistently refused to accept 
M. Maurice Maeterlinck's services in the Belgian 
army on the plea that the poet's work as philos- 
opher and writer is too valuable. M. Maeterlinck 
now voices his belief in the justice of his country's 
cause in a new volume, " The Light Beyond," which 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. announce.

" Psychology of the Unconscious " is soon to be 
published by Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co., the trans- 
lation having been made by Dr. Beatrice M. Hinkle. 
Abroad Dr. Jung has been recognized as the foun- 
der of a new school of psycho-analysis, called the 
Zurich school, as opposed to the Vienna school 
headed by Dr. Freud. 

Now that the world war is in progress which he 
predicted years before its coming, Mr. H. G. Wells 
is discussing the probability of the establishment 
of a long world peace. " What Is Coming " is the 
title of his new book, on the Macmillan announce- 
ment list ; and in it Mr. Wells attempts to forecast 
how the people are going to accept the tremendous 
waste of life and resources, the arrest of material 
progress, and the universal loss and unhappiness. 

In connection with the celebration of the Shake- 
speare tercentenary, the Columbia University Press 
will publish in March a collection of essays entitled, 
" Shakspere Studies." The volume will be under 
the joint editorship of Professors Brander Mat- 
thews and Ashley H. Thorndike of the Department 
of English and Comparative Literature of Colum- 
bia University, and each essay, of which there will 
be eighteen in all, will be the work of a member 
of the staff of that department.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 17 



Sir Clements Robert Markham, former president 
of the Royal Geographical Society, died at his home 
in the suburbs of London on January 30, after a 
long life devoted to travel and geographical re- 
search. He served in the Navy from 1844 to 1852. 
Thereupon followed travels in Peru which led to 
the introduction into British India of the cultiva- 
tion of quinine-yielding cinchona trees from Peru. 
He edited twenty-two volumes for the Hakluyt 
Society, of which he was secretary for several 
years. His writings include histories of Peru, 
Thibet, and the Abyssinian Expedition; biogra- 
phies of Lord Fairfax, Columbus, Major Rennell, 
Richard III, and Sir Leopold M'Clintock; and 
several records of his travels in Peru and India. 

At the recent public meeting of the Academy of 
Inscriptions and Belles Lettres of the Institute of 
France, its learned President, M. Edouard Cha- 
vannes, paid this tribute, in his annual address, to 
a distinguished foreign correspondent of the Acad- 
emy, an American who passed away last year: 
" William Woodville Rockhill, qui f ut ministre des 
Etats-Unis a Peking, ambassadeur en Russie puis a 
Constantinople, fut, en meme temps qu'un diplo- 
mate de grande envergure, un explorateur et un 
philologue; ses voyages au Tibet et en Mongolie 
ont apporte des informations entierement nouvelles 
a la geographic et a 1'ethnographie ; ses travaux 
sur le Bouddhisme d'apres les sources tibetaines et 
sur le commerce maritime des Chinois sont entre 
les mains de tous ceux qui s'interessent a la civilisa- 
tion de 1'Extreme-Orient." 

The Cervantes Publishing Company has an at- 
tractive name, which is a valuable asset to any 
commercial house. Its recent incorporation and 
establishment in New York for the publication of 
Spanish books may be regarded as another sign of 
our increasing interest in the language and liter- 
ature of the people whose name and achievements 
hold so prominent a place in the history of the 
western continent. The chief concern of the new 
publishing house will be the yearly issue of " El 
Anuario Universal," or "Universal Yearbook," 
devoted, we infer, to Spanish-American interests. 
First-hand information in commercial, political, 
and statistical matters will be sought from the 
governments of the countries concerned, and thus 
it is hoped to make the publication as nearly accu- 
rate as human fallibility will permit. The incor- 
porators are newspaper men, Mr. L. J. de Bekker 
is president of the company, and its headquarters 
are at 20 Vesey Street. 

John Townsend Trowbridge, poet and author of 
stories for boys, died at his home in Arlington, 
Mass., on the 12th inst. He was in his ninetieth 
year. Mr. Trowbridge was born in Monroe County, 
New York. In 1847 he removed to New York City, 
and began to write for " The Knickerbocker Maga- 
zine " and other periodicals. The following year 
he went to Boston, where he later became a promi- 
nent member of the literary group in that city. 
He was one of the earliest contributors to " The 
Atlantic Monthly," and was a contributor and for 
a time editor of " Our Young Folks," a periodical 
later merged with " St. Nicholas." His first book, 



" Father Brighthopes," appeared in 1856. During 
a journey abroad in 1855 Mr. Trowbridge wrote 
his novel of New England life entitled " Neighbor 
Jackwood," which achieved great popularity upon 
its publication two years later. Of his numerous 
boys' books, " Jack Hazard and His Fortunes," 
"Cudjo's Cave," "The Scarlet Tanager," and 
" The Fortunes of Toby Trafford " are among the 
best known. " The Vagabonds, and Other Poems," 
published in 1869, established Mr. Trowbridge's 
reputation as a poet; another volume of verse, 
" The Emigrant's Story, and Other Poems," ap- 
peared in 1875. For the past half century or 
more, Mr. Trowbridge made his home on the bor- 
ders of Spy Pond, in Arlington, a suburb of 
Boston. His autobiography, " My Own Story, 
with Recollections of Noted Persons," was pub- 
lished in 1903. 

A versatile literary craftsman pays for the vari- 
ety of his aptitudes by attaining pre-eminence in 
no one branch of literature. So it was with the 
amazingly productive Andrew Lang; and so it 
has proved again with one who is often spoken of 
as Lang's rival in the field of fairy tales, the gifted 
and scholarly Dr. Joseph Jacobs, who died at Yon- 
kers on the 30th of January. He was born at Syd- 
ney, New South Wales, Aug. 29, 1854, and finished 
his schooling at Cambridge University. His first 
visit to this country was in 1896, and it was ten 
years later that the University of Pennsylvania 
made him a Doctor of Letters. As scholar, jour- 
nalist, lecturer, translator, compiler, editor, ency- 
clopedist, and miscellaneous writer, he has made 
himself known and valued in both Europe and 
America. Jewish history was his specialty, so far 
as his restlessly inquiring mind permitted him to 
have one, and perhaps his most scholarly achieve- 
ment was the editorship, or co-editorship, of the 
"Jewish Encyclopaedia" published by Funk and 
Wagnalls. While in England he was made Presi- 
dent of the Jewish Historical Society and Secretary 
of the Russo-Jewish Committee. He edited " The 
Jewish Year Book " and " The American Hebrew." 
His best-known books include " Studies in Jewish 
Statistics," "English Fairy Tales," "Celtic Fairy 
Tales," "The Jews of Angevin England," "More 
English Fairy Tales," " Studies in Biblical Archae- 
ology," "^sop's Fables," " Jewish Ideals," " Liter- 
ary Studies," " Wonder Voyages," and " The Story 
of Geographical Discovery." A most winsome per- 
sonality lay behind these numerous and bewilder- 
ingly diverse products of authorship.

IN THE 
MARCH FORUM 

HUTCHINS HAPGOOD 

HAS AN ARTICLE 

PROHIBITION 

In which he says: 

"The cause of temperance is the cause of civilization. The cause of prohibition indicates 
an underlying fanaticism which is never present in the most enlightened communities." 

It is a remarkably sane consideration of one of the problems that troubles the world 
whether in war or peace, and examination of the question from a new viewpoint the effect of 
prohibition not the effect of alcohol on character and social customs and the way men 
live their lives. 

HUTCHINS HAPGOOD is neither a "wet" nor a "dry." But he is a very human 
sociologist, interested, as his books attest, in discovering the things that make life richer in 
human values. And he says, frankly, as always, what he thinks of prohibition and prohibi- 
tionists, and the saloon, and the economic aspects of liquor-drinking. It is a wise and far-see- 
ing view of a problem every state in America is blunderingly and sometimes fanatically 
trying to settle. 

Besides Mr. Hapgood's article on "Prohibition," there are other INTERESTING 
AND IMPORTANT things in the March Forum. 

There is 

FIFTY YEARS OF NEGRO PROGRESS

prepared a few days before he died, and probably the last public expression to come from 
Doctor Washington's hand. 

And another of WILLARD HUNTINGTON WRIGHT'S articles about modern 
painters and painting; a story by JAMES HUNEKER; an article about "Proxies in 
Mormon Polygamy," by Theodore Schroeder, that will excite controversy, and a reprinting 
of Herbert Spencer's essay on "The Sins of Legislators," with an illuminating comment by 
the Dean of Columbia University Law School. 

These and other things about Kitchener's Army -and the Miracles of Modern 
Medicine and a new view of Henry Ford's Peace Expedition and two poems are in 
the MARCH FORUM.

THE PERSIAN INFLUENCE ON 
EUROPEAN LITERATURE. 

An American who has grown immensely 
rich was wont to remark, toward the begin- 
ning of his career, that he never felt quite 
comfortable unless he owed a few million dol- 
lars. It is that way with literature. Few 
literatures become great until they have 
caught up, " conveyed," absorbed a vast deal 
of thought and art from foreign or distant 
sources. Take English literature. In the 
Elizabethan age the classical renaissance and 
the Italianate influence were all in all. Then, 
owing to the translation of the Bible, to the 
Reformation, and to Milton, Hebrew thought 
was dominant, and for a time the English 
people were hardly more than a tribe of 
Israel. Every man was a lonely prophet, and 
any neighbor who differed by a shade of opin- 
ion with him was a son of Belial. Then the 
gay and social spirit of France leaped upon 
the English stage, and literature became witty 
and shallow and conventional. And so it has 
gone on down to the present day. Looking at 
English literature in the large, one would say 
that its body has been nourished by a most 
minute half -pennyworth of native bread and 
a most unconscionable quantity of imported 
sack. 

This being so, one might wonder, by way 
of parenthesis, at the stock attitude of En- 
glish critics toward American literary work. 
They always insist that we shall spin our web 
out of our own bodies. "All we want from 
you," they practically tell us, "is the rustic 
murmur of your burgs, your backwoods 
mannerisms : we will attend to the large world- 
transactions in literature." This feeling ex- 
plains their instant acceptance of all our 
oddities and so-called originals, and their 
cold regard for our greatest men. Andrew 
Lang, in his book on English Literature, finds 
that Poe and Emerson and Hawthorne and 
Lowell and Longfellow have grown too rich 
and great trading on borrowed capital, so he 
brushes them all to one side and sets up our 
excellent but not very poetic Whittier in 
first place. Now literary material belongs to 
him who can use it. "We see no reason why

THE DIAL 



[ March 2 



American writers should not follow the exam- 
ple of their European cousins and scour the 
world for inspiration or conquest. " Home- 
keeping youths have ever homely wits," says 
Shakespeare; and we fancy this is true of 
authors and artists. 

But we must get down to our subject, which 
is the not well made out or much thought of 
influence of Persian literature on Europe. 
We all recognize our overwhelming debt to 
Greece and Rome. Latterly some account has 
been made of the riches we have received from 
Hindu, Scandinavian, and Celtic civilizations. 
But the argosies that floated to us from Per- 
sia and Arabia have hardly been kept track 
of in our literary custom-houses. Just to 
show what may have happened, it is asserted 
that one of the earliest migrations to Ireland 
was from Persia. " Erin " could easily be 
corrupted from " Iran." An ingenious Irish 
author wrote a book to prove that the Round 
Towers were built by and for the use of 
Persian Fire-Worshippers. And an Italian 
writer has traced the legend of Tristan and 
Isolde to Persian sources. But the question 
of origins is a baffling one. For aught that is 
really known, the whole human race may have 
come from that "high mountain cradle in 
Pamere." 

The largest known influence which has 
emanated from Persia is that of the Zoroas- 
trian religion the dualism of Good and 
Evil, of Ormuzd and Ahriman. It is a dwin- 
dled worship at home ; but it put its stamp on 
Hebrew thought, and hence on Christianity. 
It has put its stamp also on the latest philos- 
ophy of Europe. 

To the Greeks, Persia was a thing of awe 
and wonder. They were always in opposition 
to the huge State, but always fascinated by it. 
The Great King loomed in their eyes some- 
what as the Grand Monarque did in the eyes 
of Europe. The Greek leaders, driven from 
home by their ungrateful countrymen, found 
refuge with him. "Woe for Miltiades, sup- 
pliant at Persia's court ; woe for Themistocles, 
satrap of Persia's king." A great part of 
Herodotus and Xenophon is devoted to Per- 
sia. Conversely, however, there seems to have 
been no return of interest in Greek civiliza- 
tion, even though Alexander overran the 
great empire. Mr. Edward G. Browne, in his 
"Literary History of Persia," quotes assent- 
ingly the dictum of Noldeke: "Hellenism 



never touched more than the surface of Per- 
sian life, but Iran was penetrated to the core 
by Arabian religion and Arabian ways." 

For many centuries before, during, and 
after the crusades, a good part of Europe 
sat up of nights shuddering at the menace of 
the Moslem power. Mahmud and the Soldari 
must have been almost dominant figures of 
fear and hatred. The epics and legends of 
the middle ages, the Song of Roland, the Song 
of the Cid, the books of Knight Errantry 
reveal this preoccupation, as do the later 
epics of Ariosto and Tasso. Here again, 
however, the influence was one of opposition 
rather than acceptance. 

It was probably not until the publication of 
Antoine Galland's translation of " The Ara- 
bian Nights," in 1704-17, that Persia as a 
literary influence is to be reckoned with. The 
result was shown immediately in the " Lettres 
persanes " of Montesquieu, published in 1721. 
Montesquieu brought his Persians to Europe 
to comment ironically on its civilization, and 
other writers followed in the same vein. Per- 
sian tales and apologues appeared in the mis- 
cellany prints both in England and France. 
William Collins's " Persian Eclogues " show 
the force of the new current, though there 
is not much that is Persian about them. Vol- 
taire and Dryden brought Persia upon the 
stage. Eastern Sultans and Sultanesses, in 
turbans and waving plumes, were admired; 
Roxana and Statira were two of the most 
successful tragedy queens of the time. Lady 
Mary Wortley Montagu travelled to the East 
and lived there some time. 

Then there was apparently a long lull of 
interest in things Persian. The East, with 
its enchantments, waited to be rediscovered. 
Beckford, in his "History of the Caliph 
Vathek," did rediscover and recreate it; but 
his book was too grim and great to be popu- 
lar, or to turn men's thoughts to the regions 
of its scene. It was not until Byron made his 
first pilgrimage to Greece and, on returning to 
England, published "The Giaour" in 1813, 
and followed it up by a quick succession of 
poems, " The Corsair," " Siege of Corinth," 
" Mazeppa," the Greek scenes of " Don Juan," 
that the East of mystery and magic, of 
"fierce wars and faithful loves," of lawless 
action, was burned in upon the European 
mind. Tom Moore is said to have planned 
his "Lalla Rookh" before Byron's publiea-

tions, but it did not see the light until 1817. 
If there is any truth in the early migration 
of Persian Fire- Worshippers, the Formorians. 
to Ireland, Moore's interest in this material is 
a curious reversion to type. Scott adventured 
into the East in " The Talisman " and in his 
last good novel, " Count Robert of Paris." 
To continue the tale of Persian influence in 
England, there is Tennyson's "Recollections 
of the Arabian Nights," which sums up the 
Occidental impression of the Orient. Then 
there is Clarence Siangan's fiery *' Karaman," 
and two or three other poems which are per- 
haps even more vital in their rendering of 
Eastern character and scenery. Kinglake's 
" Eothen " is an excellent book of travel, 
which had a great vogue in its day. And 
above all there is FitzGerald's translation or 
recreation of Omar Khayyam. Many of 
Omar's quatrains are doubtfully attributed 
to him in his own literature : each one of them 
is a separate poem, and the arrangement by 
which FitzGerald made a fairly connected dis- 
course of a hundred or so of them, thereby 
adding immensely to the effect, is unknown to 
the originals. And FitzGerald used the ut- 
most liberty to cut down, weld together, or 
interpolate. Omar does not rank among the 
greatest Persian poets: and as the English 
version has taken place with the best English 
poetry, we are forced to conclude that Fitz- 
Gerald must have put into it about as much 
as he found. Matthew Arnold's " Sohrab and 
Rustum " and " The Sick King in Bokhara " 
are of Persia : and Sir Francis Doyle's " Red 
Thread of Honor," one of the greatest of 
English war lyrics, deals with a Persian 
custom. 

The Germans had a " follow on " in dealing 
with the East. The writing of Goethe's 
" West-Ostlicher Divan" dates from 1814, 
though it did not appear until four or five 
years later. Goethe had written a fragment 
of a " Mohammed " early in life, but it is 
hard to believe that his new interest in the 
East was not due to Byron's example. 
Platen, whose " Ghaselen " appeared in 1821. 
certainly followed in the track of both. Riick- 
ert's " Ostliche Rosen " came out in 1822, and 
" Freiligrath " was much later. Heine, who 
probably more than any modern reproduces 
the Eastern type of poet Hafiz or Saadi, 
dealt but sparingly with Persian or Moslem 
themes. His Orient was Syria or Egypt. 



The French, too, lagged after the English in 
the new exploitation of the East. Victor 
Hugo's "Les orientates " appeared in 1829. 

What is the value of Persian literature in 
itself? We are waiting for some authorita- 
tive critic to come forward and tell us. Mr. 
Browne's magnificent "Literary History of 
Persia " gives us all the data and much excel- 
lent translation, but the author is too modest 
definitely to judge the work he deals with or 
to submit it to comparative criticism. He 
objects to the " Shahnamah," and we agree 
with him that it is not a true epic. It is a 
gigantic chronicle of kings and heroes, whose 
record extends over many centuries. It has 
not the single action and interest that the 
even more gigantic epic poems of India have, 
and it seems to have little of the concentrated 
art of the European epics. Single episodes, 
notably that of Sohrab and Rustum, are fine. 
There are a number of Arabian narrative 
poems which have an immense reputation in 
the East, and which probably have a real 
evolution and concinnity. Neither Persia 
nor Arabia seems to have produced any great 
dramatic poetry. The Persian Passion Play, 
which deals with the sufferings of the de- 
scendants of Ali. is a national work ; and the 
race must have other dramatic performances, 
but they have not risen on our Western eyes. 
The great mass of Persian literature consists 
of lyric and gnomic poetry and tales. Unless 
lyric poetry meets with an inspired transla- 
tor such as FitzGerald, it is likely to remain 
sealed up in its own language. Perhaps Per- 
sia's best gift to the world has been the short 
story. This was perfected first in the East, 
and the myriad of splendid specimens in- 
cluded in " The Arabian Nights " have had a 
vast popularity and influence in the modern 
world. 

The Spirit of the East, what is there that 
distinguishes and differentiates it from the 
genius loci of any other region? It certainly 
has not the measure, the perfect taste, of the 
guardian of Greek life. It has not the holi- 
ness, the sanctity, of the Hebrew angel, or 
the goodness and unworldliness of the Hindu 
one. It is, in fact, thoroughly worldly, but 
fierce, intractable, fatalistic. It is wild, 
bizarre, extravagant, in its imaginations. It 
has wanted either supremacy or a haughty 
isolation. As the Caliph Omar thought the 
Koran the only necessary book, so the whole

race has been wrapped up in its own achieve- 
ments. Except in philosophy, it has accepted 
no intellectual influence from without. Its 
cities, always the abodes of unparalleled lux- 
ury, rise on the edge of the desert. It is diffi- 
cult to say whether they or the mirage pictures 
beyond them are the more unreal.

THE PAPER SHORTAGE IN ENGLAND. MR. SAINTS- 
BURY AND THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. THE 
POET-LAUREATE'S ANTHOLOGY. A VERSATILE 
WRITER. MR. GEORGE MOORE'S NEW NOVEL. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
A modern author seldom remembers how 
many collaborators he has. But we are now 
being unpleasantly reminded that amongst 
these are men in shirt-sleeves who cut down 
trees in the forests of Scandinavia, merchants 
in the Norwegian and Swedish ports, and sail- 
ors who traverse the heaving gray wastes of 
the North Sea. In short, the price of paper is 
going up. For obvious reasons the price of 
paper, like that of every other commodity, 
began mounting as soon as the war broke out. 
But recently the Government has been mak- 
ing ever-heavier demands upon the mercantile 
marine for the transport of troops and sup- 
plies; and the report that Sweden contem- 
plates limiting her export of wood-pulp 
reaches us almost simultaneously with the 
news that the British Government is prepar- 
ing a scheme whereunder our newspapers will 
have to submit to an all-round reduction in 
the supplies of paper allotted to them. Even 
before this, one heard of contracts for paper 
at twice the pre-war prices; the paper- 
makers (or rather the middlemen through 
whom they mostly deal) have been refusing to 
supply customers with more than enough for 
their current needs; and one publisher com- 
plains to me that he has been buying for con- 
siderable sums masses of old paper of odd 
sizes, and that he is issuing his books not in 
the sizes he would choose for them but in 
sizes determined by the paper he finds avail- 
able. But suppose the authorities extend to 
the publishing trade (as it is alleged they are 
thinking of doing) the forty or fifty per cent 
reduction of supplies that it is suggested may 
be imposed upon the newspapers? I do not 
know what real likelihood there is of this hap- 
pening; but if it does, there must obviously 
be an immense reduction in the number of 
books issued. Newspapers can cut down from 
ten pages to six. But a publisher cannot get 



all his authors to truncate their works in 
order that the number of "titles" in his list 
shall be as pre-arranged. If it comes to this, 
we shall feel that the war's failure to evoke 
a large mass of good literature has, after all, 
been for the best ! It would be too distressing 
if the country were brimming over with mas- 
terpieces which could not be printed owing 
to the shortage of ships for the Scandinavian 
traffic ! 

Meanwhile, to do them justice, the publish- 
ers have been " doing their bit." The statis- 
tics of last year's book-production show that, 
although the number of books published was 
smaller than that in any year since 1907, there 
were still over 10,000 new works and new edi- 
tions, exclusive of pamphlets and such small 
deer. The unfortunate thing is that de- 
creases are recorded principally in the various 
departments of serious literature; even books 
of verse, in spite of the war-poets and the 
many gallant efforts of lyrical subalterns, fell 
off considerably in number. This year the 
drop (leaving the paper question out of ac- 
count) will be heavier in all probability, as 
most of the old contracts will have been ful- 
filled by now, and publishers have been chary 
of making new ones since war broke out.

Saintsbury loses none of his energy with age ; 
and in his new volume, " The Peace of the 
Augustans," he lets out at the modernists and 
at the decriers of the Eighteenth Century as 
Friar John did at the Picrocholians when he 
hurried upon them "so rudely, without cry- 
ing gare or beware, that he overthrew them 
like hogs, tumbled them over like swine, strik- 
ing athwart and alongst, and by one means or 
other so laid about him, after the old fashion 
of fencing, that to some he beat out their 
brains, to others he crushed their arms, bat- 
tered their legs, and bethwacked their sides 
till their ribs cracked with it." One rather 
feels however, that some of his victims are 
Aunt Sallies of his own construction. The 
Eighteenth Century is not a lost cause. It 
was out of fashion when it was old-fashioned ; 
it is in fashion again now it is antique. It 
was natural that the early Romantics should 
have been exasperated with those who thought 
Pope a stupendous poet and the regular 
couplet the last word in form ; but sneers at 
Pope are not common to-day. He is read and 
appreciated for what he was: a great wit, a 
great satirist, a consummate craftsman, who 
showed occasional gleams of the highest kind 
of poetic gift. Is Fielding neglected, or Smol- 
lett, or Johnson, Addison, Gray, Cowper, 
Horace Walpole, Goldsmith, Gibbon, or Swift ? 
On the contrary; in recent years as much

serious criticism must have been devoted to 
the Georgians as to the Elizabethans, and 
many men have even (to this kind of effort 
Mr. Saintsbury's writings have been a great 
stimulus) spent a good deal of time nosing 
about among the minor Eighteenth Century 
poets Shenstone, Lady Winchilsea, Dyer 
for fragments of the real thing. That the ; 
Eighteenth Century was a great lyric age, i 
and an age principally addicted to intense ; 
observation of Nature is a paradox that will 
never be established; but the last generation , 
of critics has done a great deal to modify the 
old conception of a sudden transition from 
poetry to prose and back from prose to poetry 
again. And the major figures in Eighteenth 
Century literature, its novelists, satirists, his- 
torians, and letter- writers, are popular enough 
now to be beyond the need of ferocious cham- 
pionship. Mr. Saintsbury, in spite of his 
unique style, is always extremely readable, 
and on old literature he is usually sound ; but 
he has certain peculiar limitations when he 
approaches his contemporaries. 

The Poet Laureate's new anthology, " The | 
Spirit of Man," is an extraordinarily inter- j 
esting book. To appreciate it properly you 
have to approach it in the right frame of 
mind. It is not an ordinary anthology of 
what the compiler thinks the best things in ! 
Art. It is a purely personal affair. It is, ! 
says Dr. Bridges in his preface, " the work of 
one mind at one time." He has gone through 
his library, as it were, with a pencil, marking 
poems or passages of prose, or even single 
sentences, in which he finds spiritual suste- 
nance. He has, where such passages are for- 
eign, translated them into noble English: he 
has arranged his extracts into an ordered 
scheme. To be true to himself and his idea 
he had to take every kind of liberty. Many 
great writers (there is no extract, for instance, 
from the prose of Jeremy Taylor, or from the 
poetry of Vaughan) are omitted entirely be- 
cause Dr. Bridges does not find in them 
(though others may) that essence for which 
he is searching. He will include, on the other 
hand, a poem like "La Belle Dame Sans 
Merci," which, one imagines, no one before 
him ever thought of reading as an allegory of 
eternal things. He will take a fine poem of 
Sir Walter Raleigh's and cut it short in the 
middle; extract a bare two lines from a long 
modern poem ; and reinsert in Gray's 
" Elegy " lines that the poet himself dropped. 
What is one man's food is another man's 
tedium ; and not everyone will find in all Dr. 
Bridges's extracts the quality he finds in them 
himself. But it is one of the most fascinating 
anthologies we have had, and it will certainly 



(besides fulfilling its ostensible purpose) do a 
good deal for the reputations of certain neg- 
lected writers like Gerard Hopkins. 

Every considerable modern author has 
books written about him; and the boom Mr. 
Belloc has had as a commentator on the war 
has induced two young critics, Messrs. 
Creighton Mandell and Edward Shanks, to 
write the first monograph on him. They have 
not done their panegyric by halves. Theirs 
is a small book; and it would appear that, 
with space restricted, they have thought fit to 
leave out everything but the superlatives. 
But it is an error of the right sort, in this case 
and at this time. Belloc has not yet had his 
due here; and I believe I may be mistaken 
that he has had very much less than his 
due on your side. The growth of his reputa- 
tion has been impeded by his very versatility. 
A friend of his protested years ago that 
" Mr. Hilaire Belloc 
Is a ease for legislation ad hoc, 
He seems to think nobody minds 
His books being all of different kinds." 
And if a man will write biographies, histories, 
novels, travel-books, essays, studies in the Art 
of War, volumes of propagandist politics, and 
poems of all sorts, he cannot expect many of 
his contemporaries to get a comprehensive 
view of his work. Whatever he is writing, 
too, he suppresses none of his interests or 
faculties; and it is possible that readers who 
take his books singly find too much of the 
novelist in his political and historical works 
and too much politics and history in -his 
fictions. Over-hasty production has made 
much of his writing less good than it might 
be. If he had written no more than "Dan- 
ton," "Emmanuel Burden" (the most suc- 
cessful satire ever written on a certain sort of 
Imperialism), "The Path to Rome," "The 
Four Men," "Cautionary Tales," "Verses," 
" Hills and the Sea/' and " On Nothing," six 
monographs would probably have been writ- 
ten on him by this time. I notice that even 
the enthusiastic Messrs. Mandell and Shanks 
shrink from the task of constructing a Bibli- 
ography. 

Mr. George Moore's new novel, " The Brook 
Kerith," will appear in the early summer. An 
edition de luxe will be issued simultaneously 
with the other an unusual thing with a new 
novel. But it is an unusual novel. It deals 
with the Founder of Christianity. Mr. Moore 
has adopted the theory that Jesus survived 
crucifixion, and was stolen away alive by 
Joseph of Arimathea; then joining a settle- 
ment of Essenes in the valley of the Brook 
Kerith, a spot selected by Mr. Moore after an 
exhaustive personal inspection of the Holy

Land. Mr. Moore has not hitherto distin- 
guished himself in the field of historical ro- 
mance, except when he has been romancing 
about his own history. Whether he has made 
a success of this tour de force remains to be 
seen. But the mere avoidance of the stilted 

and Mr. Moore could write about Moses 
himself as if he were his own contemporary 

will be a novelty in a book dealing with so 
remote a period in time; and his refreshing 
and habitual avoidance of the obvious may be 
illustrated by the fact that the story opens 
with an elaborate description of the home- 
life of Joseph of Arimathea when a boy.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN POLAND has, with 
many other kinds of freedom in that afflicted 
land, long been conspicuous by its absence. If 
present conditions at Warsaw are as repre- 
sented by a correspondent of the New York 
"Evening Post," and are more than tempo- 
rary, there is reason to rejoice. Dr. R. J. 
Oberfohren writesV " The opening of a Polish 
University in Warsaw in the last months of 
the past year has not found the echo in neu- 
tral countries that could justly have been 
expected. A national university was the ful- 
filment of one of the dearest wishes of the 
Polish people. Under the Russian regime the 
Warsaw University was sorely oppressed. All 
lectures had to be given in Russian, Polish 
professors were few in number and under 
constant supervision, while the majority of 
professors and instructors were Russians. 
The students could only be admitted by Gov- 
ernmental warrant, had to wear a kind of 
uniform, and had strict orders to use the Rus- 
sian language both in private and public. . . 
In the new university all lectures are given in 
the Polish tongue, by teachers of recognized 
standing in the Polish w r orld of science. 
There are no restrictions for the students in 
regard to descent or creed. Full academic 
liberty, one of the finest fruits of German 
thought and civilization, is granted and ap- 
preciated by both professors and students. . . " 
That sounds hopeful, certainly; but whence 
does the re-opened university draw its vigor- 
ous and promising young students, or even its 
able-bodied professors, in these days? And 
even the lauded German academic freedom, 
though Germany has no Siberia for students 
and professors of too liberal or otherwise 
independent tendencies, is not quite all that 
could be desired. There are other ways of 



fettering thought and its expression than b> 
the knout and the prison cell. Nevertheless 
it does seem a change for the better that thii 
Polish institution of learning has undergone 
whatever may prove to be the thoroughness 
and permanence of that change. 


A NOVELIST-LIBRARIAN, or librarian-novelist 
whichever of the hyphenated functions hi 
most prides himself upon, issues an unusually 
interesting record of yearly progress ii 
library work, in the "Report of the Chilli 
cothe, Ohio, Public Library for 1915." Undei 
the direction of Mr. Burton Egbert Steven 
son (a name familiar to lovers of fiction wit! 
a plot to it and a detective or two in the cast< 
of characters), the library of Chillicothe, i 
city of about 16,000 inhabitants, has of lat< 
years been rapidly extending its usefulness 
both in its own immediate community anc 
throughout the county of which it is the shir* 
town. He says in regard to the circulation 
the recognized index to a library's vitality 
that in ten years it "has more than tripled 
in five years it has more than doubled; ant 
the increase of 1915 over 1914 is 20,768, 01 
nearly one-third. . . The total increase for th( 
past two years has been more than 60 pei 
cent. The increase in reference work and ir 
every other branch of the library's activities 
has been fully as great." In round numbers 
the 1915 circulation was nearly 85,000, whicl 
would be an incredible figure if it were no1 
for the county work that for the past thret 
years has been added to the library's citj 
work. In respect to character the circulatioi 
shows some notable features. Fiction, as this 
novelist-librarian points out with satisfaction 
though without derogatory implication as tc 
the dignity and worth of this class of litera 
ture, enjoyed no monopoly of favor with tht 
readers, its circulation amounting to bu1 
forty-five per cent of the total a remarkably 
low figure in public-library statistics. But ii 
should be added that juvenile fiction is nol 
included in this reckoning; with that taken 
into account, the percentage mounts to sev- 
enty, not so astonishing though still credita- 
ble. That a writer of imaginative literature 
can at the same time be practical in even the 
small details of library economy becomes evi- 
dent more than once in the course of this 
report. For instance, in order to keep within 
bounds the increasing expense for re-binding, 
Mr. Stevenson established a repair shop in the 
basement, where " up to the present time 1250 
books have been recased with the use of flexi- 
ble glue. These books are wearing splendidly, 
the process costs only about two cents a book, 
and it looks as though the binding problem

had been solved." To be at once a successful 
librarian and also the author of popular nov- 
els that circulate both in English (perhaps in 
other modern languages as well) and, in 
one instance, in Latin ("Mysterium Arcae 
Boule " ) ought to bring to a reasonable man 
some measure of content even in this world of 
unsatisfied longings and unrealized ambitions. 

MR. TROWBRIDGE'S SUCCESSFUL PLAYS, nota- 
bly " Neighbor Jackwood," " Cudjo's Cave," 
and " Coupon Bonds," are called to mind at 
this time in connection with their author's 
death. Though making no pretensions to 
great dramatic merit, these stage pieces, 
adapted in two instances by Mr. Trowbridge 
himself, with some professional assistance, 
from his stories, furnished wholesome amuse- 
ment and were much in favor with amateur 
companies. Vividly can we recall the inno- 
cent delights of "Coupon Bonds" as pre- 
sented by non-professional players. That was 
longer ago than one likes to say. and carries 
one back almost to Civil War days, when the 
story was written to promote the cause of the 
Union by encouraging its supporters to invest 
in the government's newly issued securities of 
the coupon-bond variety. Almost half a cen- 
tury ago the author made his first decided hit 
as a playwright with " Neighbor Jackwood " 
(from the novel of the same name) on the 
stage of the Boston Museum. March 16, 1857, 
was the date, and he himself has described his 
sensations on seeing the billboard announce- 
ment, " Tremendous Hit ! ! Received with 
Thunders of Applause ! ! ! " This was on the 
very first evening, when he was on his way to 
attend the opening performance. But there 
seems to have been little exaggeration in these 
staring headlines, as the piece had a run of 
three weeks to crowded houses and was a 
favorite with the Museum public for eight j 
years thereafter. " Cudjo's Cave " was drama- I 
tized by some unknown hand and first pro- j 
duced at the Howard Athenaeum, without the 
sanction of author or publisher: but a loop- 
hole in the copyright law r enabled the offender 
to escape punishment. These good old plays 
are now shelved and must be enjoyed, if at all, 
in reminiscence and in perusal, if indeed the 
time-stained, yellow-covered little pieces are 
still procurable. 

A MUCH ABUSED PUBLISHING TERM COmeS to 

every city-dweller's attention every day and j 
usually many times a day. It is the word ! 
" edition." The " Daily Megaphone " appears ' 
at early dawn in an " extra edition," at nine 
o'clock in an " evening edition," at eleven in a 
" 6.30 edition," and before noon has struck it 



may have issued its " midnight edition " or 
some other absurdly entitled impression of its 
slightly altered reading-matter. The French 
newspaper is issued to-day in an edition dated 
to-morrow, and containing the news of yester- 
day; and this practice is familiar in other 
European countries. In the department of 
book-publication the word " edition " has long 
been subject to notorious abuse. With some 
publishers the term " tenth edition " or 
" twentieth edition " may mean no more than 
that the presses have been stopped long 
enough, in printing the first thousand or 
fewer copies, to insert these words in the title- 
page; with others it may have more signifi- 
cance, perhaps even meaning "tenth thou- 
sand" or "twentieth thousand," as the case 
may be. But in general the word so sadly 
abused rarely signifies anything of more im- 
portance than " impression " or " printing." 
Complaints of the inaccuracy have been fre- 
quent, and several attempts have been made 
to arrive at some uniformity of usage in the 
matter; but the difficulties are obvious. The 
distinction between " impression," " edition," 
and "re-issue," as tentatively formulated by 
the Publishers' Association of Great Britain 
is as follows: "IMPRESSION: A number of 
copies printed at any one time. When a book 
is reprinted without change, it should be 
called a new impression, to distinguish it from 
an edition as defined below. EDITION: An 
impression in which the matter has undergone 
some change, or for which the type has been 
reset. RE-ISSUE: A republication at a differ- 
ent price, or in a different form, of part of an 
impression which has already been placed on 
the market." A general observance of these 
distinctions is something greatly to be desired. 


A CRABBE REVIVAL showed signs, about ten 
years ago, of getting itself started and of 
acquiring some degree of momentum. It was 
in September, 1905, that a number of the 
Suffolk poet's admirers undertook to rescue his 
name from an undeserved obscurity if not 
oblivion by holding a celebration at Aide- 
burgh, his birthplace. This performance came 
near to being a sesquicentennial observance, 
since Crabbe was born a few days before the 
end of 1754. Perhaps it had been planned as 
a sesquieentennial and suffered unavoidable 
delay. However that may have been, no great 
results followed in the way of making Crabbe 
a favorite with poetry-lovers. Most of us have 
remained indolently content with such knowl- 
edge of him as we could get (in delightful 
fashion) from Edward FitzGerald's letters 
and from occasional quoted extracts from the 
rather voluminous poetical works. To

Gerald his old neighbor was a most admirable 
and enjoyable singer of the placid pleasures of 
English country life. And now there comes 
to notice another appreciative student of 
"The Borough," "The Parish Register," 
" The Library," " The Village," " Tales of the 
Hall," and the rest of the metrical series bear- 
ing Crabbe's name as author. Professor Laura 
Johnson Wylie, of Vassar College, puts forth 
a volume of "Social Studies in English Lit- 
erature," of which "The England of George 
Crabbe " forms not the least entertaining chap- 
ter. Readers of Crabbe are now so few as to 
render this discovery of a twentieth-century 
student of the leisurely, long-winded poet a 
memorable event. The only regret is that, 
while her essay sends one on an eager quest to 
the nearest library for Crabbe's works, there 
is not one chance in a score that the library 
will be found to contain them. Books and 
articles about Crabbe are procurable in some 
quantity at any large library, but few such 
institutions and still fewer bookshops can give 
you Crabbe himself the more's the pity. 


LIBRARIES IN LABRADOR form the subject of 
an interesting article by Miss Marian Cutter 
in "The Library Journal" for February. 
The theme might be thought to be about as 
barren as Snakes in Ireland, but pioneer work 
in establishing library stations and travelling 
libraries was begun by Miss Cutter and others,- 
with T)r. Grenfell's invaluable cooperation, in 
the summer of 1914, and from St. Anthony, 
where Dr. Grenfell has his headquarters, 
many a book has gone out to relieve the 
monotony and cheer the loneliness of Labra- 
dor life. A large room in the St. Anthony 
schoolhouse received the collection of books 
given by various publishing houses and many 
individuals, and after a month spent in the 
necessary sorting, classifying, shelf -listing, 
and other preliminaries known to the profes- 
sion, the library was ready for use. Of course 
it is a small collection, and the demand for 
books on the part of those remote fisher folk 
is already considerable and rapidly increasing 
as the joy of reading makes itself felt. Just 
how many communities and readers are 
served at present, and how many travelling 
libraries are in use, is not stated; but Dr. j 
Grenfell's "parish" embraces the Labrador i 
coast, the Strait Settlements, and all of New- i 
foundland north of the railway from Bay of 
Islands to Lewisport, so that for a long time 
to come no offering of wholesome literature 
adapted to simple tastes is likely to go begging 
for acceptance. Juvenile books are especially 
welcome, and in books for older readers large 



print is appreciated, as eyes habitually 
focussed upon distant objects do not readily 
adapt themselves to the requirements of small 
print. Now that the world has heard of this 
"pioneer library work in Labrador," it will 
not be so very surprising to learn of similar 
activities in Greenland. There is no geo- 
graphical limit to the scope of library work. 


THE INCREASED COST OF COLLECTING, whether 
the collecting be of old masters, of antique 
furniture, of rare books, or of other objects 
precious and desirable in the collector's eyes, 
has more than kept pace with the increased 
cost of living; and for this advance the 
growing number of wealthy American collec- 
tors is largely responsible. The supply of 
collectible objects of genuine merit remains, 
in some departments, nearly constant, in 
others it is rapidly diminishing, and in few is 
there any increase at all commensurate with 
the increasing demand. In respect to books, 
the Director of the New York State Library, 
which has been striving against heavy odds to 
make good its late losses by fire, has this to 
say: ",Not only have currently published 
books shared substantially in that increased 
cost which has marked luxuries as well as 
necessaries during the past ten or fifteen 
years, but older books, those outside the trade 
and technically known as ' out of print,' espe- 
cially of certain kinds, have multiplied in 
value often many hundredfold. Current 
books and periodicals cost libraries 20 to 25 
per cent more than fifteen "years ago. The 
out of print books, those which must be 
bought from dealers in special subjects, at 
auction, in secondhand book shops, from the 
duplicate stock of libraries, out of garrets, 
private collections, etc., have increased in 
value unreasonably, and out of all relation to 
the intrinsic value of the book's contents. 
This is due somewhat to the rapid and con- 
siderable increase in the number of libraries, 
but most of all to the vastly greater number 
of wealthy private collectors whose ardor in 
the pursuit of rarity or uniqueness creates a 
price which wholly loses sight of intrinsic 
value and merely measures the unreasoning, 
too often the ignorant and undiscriminating 
emulation of multimillionaires." Collectors to 
whom a book's price is a matter of no moment, 
men like Mr. Henry E. Huntington and the 
late J. Pierpont Morgan, Robert Hoe, and 
Alfred Henry Huth, have much to answer for 
to the struggling libraries that are vainly try- 
ing to fill the gaps in their several special col- 
lections. But, on the other hand, as Mr. 
George Watson Cole has recently shown, these 
millionaire collectors do. though chiefly with-

out any such direct intention, often prove to 
be, ultimately and usually after their death, 
the benefactors of public libraries. 

LOVE OF LITERATURE IN THE BLUE GRASS 

STATE led to the appointment, six years ago, of 
a State Library Commission, which now issues 
its Third Biennial Report, a handsome and in 
every way creditable document in illustrated 
pamphlet form, containing sixty-eight pages 
of interesting information. As is stated on the 
first page, " the slogan of the Commission has 
been 'A library for every county in the State 
and free book service for every citizen.' " Of 
course the desired goal still lies far ahead, but 
that it will some day be reached, and then 
passed, the present record of progress gives ; 
encouraging reason to hope. Already the 
travelling-library system embraces nearly as ; 
many stations as there are days in the year. 
A glance down the list of these stations re- 
veals some curious names, names that must ; 
owe their origin in certain instances to senti- 
ment, in others to a nimble inventive faculty, ; 
and in still others to chance associations, some- 
times of a comic nature. For example, women's 
names are not infrequent, as Bertha, Inez, 
Laura, Livia. Louisa, and Nancy; patriotism 
shows itself in Seventy-Six; geological pecu- I 
liarities are seen in Salt Lick, Sandlick, and 
Paint Lick; the world's debt to Kentucky in 
one important respect is recalled by the names, 
Horse Cave, Long Run. and Stamping 
Ground ; and notable for various reasons are 
the designations, Alone, Blood, Bruin, Ceru- 
lean, Eminence, Fairplay. Job, Lovelaceville, 
Xobob, Pactolus. Pine Knot. Savage, and 
Spider. There is nothing colorless or com- 
monplace about these names, nor, we infer, 
about the people who live in the places so 
designated and who read the books sent them 

in the travelling libraries. 


THE CREATOR OF "DARIUS GREEN AND HIS 
FLYIXG MACHINE" probably had not the 
faintest expectation that before half a century 
should have passed the invention of the gifted 
though unfortunate Darius would be per- 
fected and in daily use, and that it would 
constitute one of the chief instruments of 
warfare in a titanic struggle between two 
groups of great European powers. But he 
lived to see this come to pass. Dying recently 
in his eighty-ninth year. John Townsend 
Trowbridge left behind him a bewildering 
array of literary productions in prose and 
verse, in narrative, imaginative, dramatic, and 
poetic composition, in works for the adult 
reader and stories for the boy and girl, such 
as can be found credited to hardly another 



representative of his craft. He was born at 
Ogden, Monroe Co., N. Y., Sept. 18, 1827; 
attended the local schools, but was chiefly 
self-taught; lived on a farm until he was 
seventeen years old, then started out to make 
his way in the world, teaching school in Illi- 
nois and at Lockport, N. Y., afterward going 
to New York City and beginning to write for 
the press, and finally making his way to Bos- 
ton, which has been the scene of his more 
important undertakings ever since. " The 
Atlantic Monthly " gave publicity to some of 
his more notable early writings, and " Our 
Young Folks," which he at one time con- 
ducted and at all times supported with a 
variety of successful contributions, could 
hardly have endured even for its short life- 
time without his aid. His works of fiction, 
from "Father Brighthopes" and "Martin 
Merrivale " to "A Pair of Madcaps." make a 
long list ; his writings in verse were collected, 
in large part, and published in a substantial 
volume in 1903: and the same year saw the 
issue of his highly readable autobiography, 
"My Own Story," wherein his friendships 
with Whitman, Longfellow, Holmes, and 
many other notable contemporaries, are agree- 
ably chronicled. Not among the greatest of 
American authors, he is nevertheless among 
the best loved, and has furnished more whole- 
some and hearty entertainment in literary 
form than some that are reckoned his supe- 
riors. He has well and modestly said- of 
himself: * 

"A flower more sacred than far-seen success 

Perfumes iny solitary path; I find 
Sweet compensation in my humbleness. 

And reap the harvest of. a quiet mind."

STUPID LEGISLATION ABOUT BOOKS is almost 
as old as books themselves. Petty restrictions 
and ignorant meddlings on the part of law- 
makers whose interest in literature did not 
extend beyond 'the daily newspaper have been 
what the publisher and the book-dealer have 
had to contend against with what force- of 
opposition they could command, or to submit 
to with what patience they could -maintain. 
And now. as if it were needed to cap the cli- 
max of American folly in this class of legisla- 
tive imbecility, our chief city and the centre 
of our book-trade has distinguished itself by 
passing an ordinance placing book-sellers in 
the same category with pawn-brokers and 
junk-dealers, requiring of them utterly impos- 
sible modes of procedure in carrying on their 
business impossible, that is, if they are to 
make a living by that business. A license, a 
bond, a suspension of business activity with 
the going-down of the sun, a careful keeping

of records that shall show from whom each 
book in stock was bought, how much was paid 
for it, and any further particulars of signifi- 
cance, also, as some interpret the law, a sim- 
ilar record of each sale, a strict avoidance of 
commercial dealings with servants or minors 
offering books for sale, and a cessation of the 
practice of visiting customers for the purpose 
of buying, selling, or appraising books 
these are some of the grimly amusing features 
of the new ordinance as scanned by the 
amazed and indignant dealer in literary wares. 
If sad experience had not taught us wisdom 
we should be incredulous of the assertion that 
a supposedly intelligent board of aldermen, 
not temporarily insane, had sanctioned so 
ridiculous a piece of tomfoolery, and that a 
chief magistrate in his right mind had put his 
name to it. Is it surprising that the book 
interests concerned have entered a vehement 
protest ? 

A JANE AUSTEN CENTENARY CELEBRATION 
is proposed by Mr. Reginald Farrer, an 
ardent admirer of that gifted novelist, in a 
letter to the London '" Times." It is of course 
" the centenary of her immortality," as he 
expresses it, that he wishes to see duly hon- 
ored. July 18 of next year is the hundredth 
anniversary of her death, and it is suggested 
that a suitable memorial would be an endow- 
ment fund for the benefit of those unfor- 
tunates of her own sex of whom " she always 
speaks with a curious and unexplained in- 
tensity of feeling," poor governesses. At 
the same time it is proposed that a centenary 
edition of her works, including even the least 
significant and least admirable fragments that 
have hitherto been spared the pitiless expo- 
sure of publication, be brought out in sumptu- 
ous form and with every conceivable editorial 
accessory, the profits from this edition to go 
into the poor-governess fund. Another cor- 
respondent approves the suggestion of a 
definitive edition of the novels, but is not 
responsive to the appeal on behalf of the poor 
governess. Instead of the proposed fund, he 
would have the house where Miss Austen died, 
in Winchester, turned into a Jane Austen 
museum for the preservation of Jane Austen 
relics and souvenirs of all sorts. There is 
ample time for weighing all suggestions and 
choosing the best and most feasible, though a 
more unfortunate season than the present for 
obtaining subscriptions to the end in view 
could hardly be imagined. Perhaps the 
pecuniary burden might more easily be borne 
by the American admirers of Miss Austen 
than by her English followers ; but are there 
many in this country who even so much as 



open a book of hers once a year ? There may 
be. Perhaps time and the correspondence col- 
umns of the public press will' tell. 

TOLSTOY'S LATER DIARIES, now preserved in 
the Historical Museum at Moscow, throw so 
much light on his mental and spiritual devel- 
opment in the closing years of his life tkat it 
is good news to learn that his disciple and 
friend, Mr. V. G. Chertkov, is editing these 
records for publication, and that volume one, 
covering the years 1895-99, has already been 
issued at Moscow. A cursory view of its con- 
tents has appeared in the London " Times " 
literary supplement, from which it is evident 
that much of the deeply reflective man 
Tolstoy ingenuously portrays itself in the 
pages of the diary, but that very little of the 
externalities of his life gains admittance to 
those pages. To them he has recourse " like 
a penitent to the confessional, that he may 
unburden himself of his backslidings, his fail- 
ures to endure with patience the whips and 
scorns of life. There is something strangely 
lovable in his unflinching candour and humil- 
ity." Not in any sense a new Tolstoy, it 
seems, does this intimate diary reveal, nor 
was such revelation expected or desired; but 
a fuller and clearer delineation of the Tolstoy 
already known to and loved by his readers 
does appear to be presented, despite the inevi- 
table censoring and editing, the selecting and 
the discarding, that preceded the publication 
of such parts of these personal memorials as 
are now seeing the light. An early appear- 
ance of the work in an English dress is to be 
hoped for and expected. 


THE FUNCTION OF FICTION, as well expressed 
by Sir Conan Doyle, is primarily to interest, 
and the fiction-writer has "some claim to 
hope that if he can but interest his readers he 
fulfills the chief end of man in leaving others 
a little happier than he found them." But 
like all desirable ends it is not to be attained 
without a struggle. " The life of a writer of 
fiction has its own troubles," asserts the same 
authority, "the weary waiting for ideas, the 
blank reaction when they have been used, 
worst of all the despair when the thought 
which had seemed so bright and new goes 
dull and dark in the telling." Perhaps to no 
one more sharply than to the imaginative 
writer does the eternal contrast show itself 
between the practically possible and the 
ideally desirable. One can conceive of even 
Shakespeare as giving way to despair at his 
inability to give his thought adequate utter- 
ance.

A FEARFUL POSSIBILITY IN WORD-FORMATION 

opens to view in connection with the newly 
introduced "preparedness." As a correspon- 
dent of the Springiield " Republican " points 
out. the awkward term is a Germanism and 
has a certain " rigidifiedness," an undisguised 
" German madeness/' hardly in harmony with 
the genius of our language. It begets, one 
might add, a very natural afraidness lest it 
may meet with such acceptedness that we 
shall ere long see the adoptedness of many 
similar terms having little or no adaptedness 
to our linguistic habituatedness. The ending 
-ness has a certain manifest relatedness to the 
German -niss (as in Gleichniss}. and it is 
true, without qualifiedness, that it can be very 
conveniently added to almost any past par- 
ticiple. Nevertheless this addedness has in 
most instances an undeniable uglifiedness, and 
accordingly there are many who entertain a 
firm convincedness that this newest Teutonic 
importedness ought to suffer, without de- 
layedness, a peremptory banishedness, after 
which our present wrong-headedness might 
give place to right-mindedness. 



A WORD FITLY SPOKEN is said, on high au- 
thority, to be like apples of gold in pictures 
of silver. Hardly so radiant as that, though 
extraordinarily expressive to the ear and to 
the imagination, is the word used by Mrs. 
Amadeus Grabau (formerly Miss Mary 
Antin) in describing the sufferings of her 
people in eastern Europe. " Goluth." she 
says, "is our own word for our own sorrows. 
And to-day, in the second year of the great 
war, it is the name of the bloodiest horrors, 
the most excruciating torments, that ever rent 
Jewish flesh or agonized Jewish minds. Never 
were so many of our men and women and 
children on the rack at once. . . Never was 
Goluth Goluth until to-day." Already the 
war has familiarized us with one Hebrew 
word. "Armageddon." Is it destined to make 
the melancholy addition of " Goluth " to our 
vocabulary of woe? 



A FRENCH KIPLING, as M. Rene Benjamin 
is styled by some of his admirers, is one of the 
few bright and cheering literary phenomena 
(if it be permissible to call him a phenome- 
non's of embattled France. His " Gaspard," 
buoyant, breezy, and irresistibly amusing, the 
best work of fiction the war has produced, has 
received the Goncourt prize by unanimous 
verdict the first instance of such unanimity 
in the history of the Goncourt Academy. It 
reflects the author's intimate personal ac- 
quaintance with just such strenuous military 
experience as falls to the lot of the " poilu " 



Gaspard, who is now as popular a character 
with the French as Mulvaney became with the 
English on his appearance in literature. Gas- 
pard owes his being largely to a wound re- 
ceived in battle by M. Benjamin, a temporary 
disablement that gave the leisure needed for 
the writing of the book. Further personal 
details that have been made public describe 
the young author as a Parisian by birth, 
thirty years of age, a graduate of the Lycee 
Louis-le-Grand, a journalist, satirist, drama- 
tist, and novelist. His father was Ernest 
Benjamin, novelist and a member of the 
executive committee of the Societe des Gens 
de Lettres; and the eminent veterinarian. 
Dr. Henri Benjamin, member of the Academic 
de Medecin. is his uncle. The author of 
" Gaspard " went to the front with his regi- 
ment at the beginning of the war, and except 
for the aforementioned hospital term has ever 
since been on duty with the indomitably 
cheerful "poilus" whom his book so faith- 
fully and amusingly depicts. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



EDUCATION AND WAR. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In trying to fix the blame we have been looking 
to corrupt politics for the causes of the war; but 
if we examine the facts more closely, we may dis- 
cover that the true cause lies in want of education. 

Politics are corrupt because they are based so 
largely on deceit, and they have seemed necessary 
because peoples are not sufficiently educated to 
trust one another. 

Education, as we have understood it during the 
past century and as it is understood to-day, has 
meant the gleaning of facts, the stuffing of the 
brain with information. The growth of science has 
tended to make machines of us. In its mechanical 
and tireless search after facts, it has robbed us of 
our feelings and of our religion. We no longer 
have time for meditation, for love, for sympathy, 
for appreciation; there are so many facts to be 
gleaned! And we have mistaken the satisfying of 
this nervous curiosity of ours for education! We 
could not have gone further astray ! In short, and 
in truth, we have been developing our brains and 
neglecting our feelings, stuffing our skulls and 
starving our hearts. And just as long as we go on 
in this way, we need not dream of peace. We are 
barbarians still ; cleverer, perhaps, than those who 
have gone before us, but, perhaps too, for that 
very reason more barbaric. The science of the 
nineteenth century we have applied to slaughtering 
one another in the twentieth. 

Here in America our universities are sadly in 
need of overhauling. Our scholarship consists in 
the collecting 1 of facts, and our teaching in trying 
to ram these facts into our youth. The liigher the 
heap of facts the greater the scholar, and often, 
too often, the poorer the teacher. The asset indis-

[March 2 



pensable to the university teacher is, not a large 
and attractive personality, not ability to teach, not 
a conduct of life worthy of emulation, but a doc- 
tor's degree! And what does the degree signify? 
Why, that the holder possesses his pile of facts! 
And very often the doctor is teaching for the 
simple reason that nothing else " turned up." For- 
tunate young men, indeed, who are privileged to 
study under him! And America is still the land 
of opportunity! The most remarkable teacher I 
have ever known was in the habit of saying : " Our 
purpose here at this school is, not to turn out 
teachers, but to discover them." Unfortunately 
the universities do not have as lofty an ideal : they 
are content with " turning them out." Let a man 
of power, an artist, a thinker, a poet, appear in 
one of our universities, and he is warned that if he 
wishes " to advance," " to succeed " professionally, 
he must lay by his dreams, his thoughts, and his 
songs, and gather facts. 

We expect, and with reason, that enlightenment 
will come through education; but it will never 
come through what we have mistaken for educa- 
tion. There is danger in any extreme, yet we are 
persistently in pursuit of one. To rush to the 
opposite extreme would be no wiser; but it does 
seem as if something like a mean could be reached 
and maintained. We need better teachers and 
better men, less skull-filling, and vastly more atten- 
tion to the development of the sense of right and 
wrong, of duty, of pity, of compassion, of rever- 
ence, of love, of beauty. We need to expend some 
of the energy that has gone to determining the 
probable origin of an adjective to rousing some 
wholesome human enthusiasm. If we no longer 
have the religion of our fathers, let us cultivate 
another. We need to feel, and to trust our feelings. 

Education in the future must mean the training 
of the heart as well as of the intellect. When men 
will have learned truth, faith, compassion, and love, 
there will no longer be danger of warfare or need 
of international polities. When men have ceased to 
be barbaric individually, they will no longer be so 
collectively. Instruct men's minds and you make 
crafty animals ; instruct their hearts and you make 
men brothers. Crime is intellectual, not emotional. 
An impulse becomes criminal only when perverted 
by the mind. Of all crimes, war is the most hellish, 
for it contains all others within itself. Peace comes 
of enlightenment, and enlightenment emanates 
from what transcends reason the affections.

MR. MASEFIELD AS A DRAMATIST. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
I was very much surprised to see the amount of 
praise given to Mr. Masefield's " The Faithful " in 
a recent criticism in your pages. Reviewers have 
a practice, and a good one, of quoting significant 
lines of a book to substantiate their claims for or 
against it. I have a practice, in reading, of copy- 
ing into a note-book lines that strike me as par- 
ticularly fine; and in this play there were four 
lines only, those quoted in the criticism : 



" Sometimes, when guests have gone, the host 

remembers 

Sweet courteous things unsaid. 
We two have talked our hearts out to the embers, 
And now go hand and hand down to the dead." 

And what others could be quoted from " The 
Faithful"? Where else is the same beauty of 
imagery and phrasing? But Chikara and Kurano 
have not talked their hearts out to the embers. 
Far from it you are not convinced. Nor are 
they or the atmosphere of the play Japanese. 
And what greater peril to a character or a situa- 
tion than that you do not believe in it? The test 
question always put to the dramatist is: What 
right have you to ask me to imagine this thing 
happening? 

And again, fine as these quoted lines are, do 
we not feel that here Mr. Masefield is speaking 
and not his character? There is a notable instance 
of this in " The Tragedy of Nan " where Nan 
forces Jenny to eat the tainted pie, saying : " You 
shall eat the charity of the uncharitable," just 
the thing it would never enter Nan's head to say. 

I consider " Nan " a wonderful and stirring 
play. Mr. Masefield has his unique theory of 
tragedy (which he sets forth in a note prefacing 
"Nan"), "of the exultation which comes from a 
delighted brooding on excessively terrible things." 
There is no doubt but that he is a " playwright 
trying for beauty," and no doubt but that he 
has found it in " Nan," " The Widow in the Bye 
Street," and his other very dramatic poems. But 
I do regret " The Faithful," and the earlier play, 
" Pompey the Great," where the old Romans are 
actually shocking with their ultra-modern English. 
Contemporary criticism must be a little generous 
for the sake of encouraging better effort, if for no 
other reason; but do let's be honest, especially 
in dealing with such a man as Mr. Masefield, 
whose reputation is secure.

"OH GOD! OH MONTREAL! "

Correspondence at this distance means leisurely 
controversy. In your issue of Dec. 9, I attributed 
the " Psalm of Montreal " to Samuel Butler. In 
that of Jan. 6, Mr. Win. H. Dall, whilst repudiating 
an excessive reverence for meticulosity, " in behalf 
of the dumb shade of the late William Henry Hurl- 
bert " reclaims " the honor of its authorship " for 
him. 

I do n't know where Mr. Hurlbert comes in. In 
the most recent edition of the " Note-Books of 
Samuel Butler " it is stated that Butler wrote the 
poem in Canada in 1875. It appeared in " The 
Spectator" on May 18, 1878; in 1884 it was in- 
cluded in Butler's " Selections from Previous 
Works " ; and a MS. of it, which Butler gave to 
Mr. Festing Jones, is now in the Fitzwilliam Mu- 
seum at Cambridge. 

But perhaps it was really written by Francis 

Bacon.

STUDIES OF FREXCH VERS IJIBRISTES.* 

Of the six contemporary French poets dealt 
with in her new volume, Miss Amy Lowell is 
quite right in saying that they are little 
known in America, with the exception of Ver- 
haeren, who has shared the fate of his brave 
country in recently deserving our attention. 
Samain, de Gourmont, de R6gnier, Jammes, ; 
and Paul Fort do not figure in our academic 
programmes, and there is little information to 
be had in English concerning their personali- 
ties and their theories. The book, then, at- 
tracts the reader : the subject, the author, the 
publisher, and the price combine to warrant 
eager anticipation. 

Those who have a fondness for the essay j 
style will be the first to take up the book, 
and the first to be disillusioned. The task 
before the critic was so to interpret the writ- j 
ings of contemporary French poets as to j 
make them seem worthy of attention in Amer- 
ica. The task was attempted first in lectures 
in Boston, and later continued in the stout 
volume now published. Miss Lowell is in 
sympathy with their work, being herself an | 
artificer in verse of a new style, and has had 
the opportunity in Paris of informing herself 
of their lives, their aims, their methods, and 
their message. As for Verhaeren, he is in a 
class by himself: he is a strong personality, ; 
an impressionistic painter of Flemish land- 
scape, and an interpreter of Flemish emo- 
tions; he needs neither Miss Lowell nor any 
one else to insist upon his genius. But for 
the others! The critic favors us with a few 
biographical details, such as can be gleaned in ; 
current French appreciations or in certain 
literary coteries of the capital. All this is ! 
very thin and lacks proportion. But the j 
shock comes when we approach the interpreta- 
tion of this modern poetry, and are greeted 
by the most fulsome praise and exaggerated 
claims. Our interpreter appears to lack all 
background for her estimate of the permanent 
value of these latter-day poets. As has been \ 
often pointed out, French poetry at its best 
is difficult enough for us foreigners to i 
appreciate justly. But with Villon. Marot, j 
Ronsard, La Fontaine, Chenier, Lamartine, 
Musset, Vigny, Gautier, and Hugo in our 
mind, Miss Lowell had a heavy task to arouse 
our enthusiasm for the poets of her choice. In j 
this task she has failed. Despite her claims 
for them now softly insinuating, now posi-

tively hysterical, she leaves us cold, in no 
degree persuaded that we have been missing 
anything vital in the literary expression of 
French genius. We do not recall less judg- 
ment, revealed in airy vaporings and in care- 
less style, in any book of the sort. 

Nor does one have to be an academic fogey, 
bound by the fetters of convention, to deplore 
such a volume of hazarded judgments. For 
"the hair-splitting criticism turned out by 
erudite gentlemen for their own amusement " 
Miss Lowell expresses that disregard which 
artists often affect. But you, who are gentle 
readers, shall judge for yourselves presently 
of the unhappy execution of this attempt to 
exploit a literary field too little known. Miss 
Lowell has a perfect right to her own taste 
in poetry, and to extol the French representa- 
tives of it. But she must prove its superior- 
ity to other French poetry, which we admire 
and love because it has something to say, and 
the harmony of which it will be hard to equal. 
She fails to establish her case for three rea- 
sons : because she does not succeed in dignify- 
ing the philosophy of the artists she treats; 
because she furnishes us with no adequate 
background of the poetic tradition with which 
the vers libristes broke; and because her 
presentation is trivial and vapid, expressed 
in language which is intended to be capti- 
vating, but which causes in the reader the 
pain induced by a perfervid and too often 
slip-shod style. The most valuable part of 
such a shallow book, as La Bruyere long ago 
remarked, consists of the lengthy extracts in 
the original. We may have our own opinion 
of the enduring quality of this sort of poetry; 
but that is beside the purpose. Our protest 
is against Miss Lowell's treatment of it, and 
our regret is that such a new and attractive 
subject should have fallen to the lot of such 
unscientific and uncritical appreciation. 

A reference to each of Miss Lowell's essays 
will do something to warrant the strictures we 
have passed upon her irresponsible judgments. 
" One strange thing about Verhaeren," we are 
told, " is his true greatness. . . No matter what 
Verhaeren does, his work remains great, and 
full of what Matthew Arnold calls 'high 
seriousness.' The purists may rail, that only 
shows how narrow the purists are. A great 
genius will disobey all rules and yet produce 
works of art, perforce" (pp. 37-38). Again: 
" That Verhaeren must have married some- 
time before 1896 is clear, because Les Heures 
Claires, published in that year, is the first of 
a series of love poems, of which Les Heures de 
I'Apres-midi, published in 1905, and Les 
Heures du Soir, published in 1911, are the 
other volumes" (p. 44). If there are no 



204 



THE DIAL 



[ March 2 



other arguments to prove the poet's marriage, 
we are not greatly advanced in our facts; for 
we have heard of poets who wrote love poems 
in single blessedness. However, assuming 
that there is a Mme. Verhaeren, we are put 
off with this empty tribute : " No biographer 
mentions who Madame Verhaeren was, or any- 
thing about her, except to pay her the tribute 
of understanding and cherishing a great man. 
That she has been a helpmeet to him in every 
way these poems prove" (p. 45). Poor lady! 
Why drag her in at all, until someone has 
the rare enterprise to discover her identity? 
One envies the conscience of a critic who can 
refer to persons and facts only to discard 
them in this blithe fashion. 

The second essay, on Albert Samain, who 
died in 1900, is more pleasing. The quota- 
tions make one wish to read more of this 
" graceful, timid, proud, passionate, and 
reserved" genius. In conclusion, our critic 
asks : " Have I evoked a man for you ? Have 
I shown him as he was?" The question is a 
little disquieting, coming from a lady; yet 
on the whole we can answer " Yes." But the 
style is so lurid, so obtrusive, as to spoil the 
aesthetic pleasure one ought to feel when read- 
ing an aesthetic critic who is explaining an 
aesthetic vers libriste. " Paris lured him like 
the Pot 'of 'Gold at the end of the Rainbow" 
(p. 57). Again: "Little dramas, they are, 
sufficient each one to itself with a perfect 
finality. And the delicacy with which they 
are done defies analysis. They are transpar- 
ent, hardly printing themselves upon the 
atmosphere, like egg-shell china held to the 
light. And yet what movement they have ! " 
(p. 90). One should turn to the poems to 
which these remarks refer in order to decide 
whether 'this sort of thing is criticism, or 
whether it does not rather prove that one poet 
ought not to interpret another. 

Remy de Gourmont, who died last year, did 
a little of everything, and Miss Lowell does 
well not to claim first place for him in any- 
thing but in " the aesthetic [sic] of the French 
language," whatever that may precisely mean. 
" But the way he has written, no one can sur- 
pass him there ; and we, who try to write, 
mull over his pages for hours at a time, and 
endeavour to learn the lesson which he has 
analyzed and illustrated for us" (p. 109). 
There is little room for quotation ; but we 
suspect that Miss Lowell, the poet, has mulled 
over de Gourmont, as she says, and that her 
own poems prove her discipleship. In " Six- 
tine," written partly in prose and partly in 
verse, de Gourmont " wishes to prove that the 
world is only a simulacrum, and the perception 
of it hallucinatory" (p. 111). It takes a 



genius to realize that, and "the simple and 
ignorant public " knows that life is neither a 
dream nor a simulacrum. The Master has given 
the wondering layman a definition of symbol- 
isme: " If one keeps to its narrow and etymo- 
logical sense," it means " almost nothing ; if 
one goes beyond that, it means : individualism 
in literature, liberty of art, abandonment of 
existing forms, a tending toward what is new, 
strange, and even bizarre," etc. (p. 119). 
The iconoclasm of the School and the pose of 
its interpreters are well brought out in the 
Master's further definition : " The sole excuse 
which a man can have for writing is to write 
down himself, to unveil for others the sort of 
world which mirrors itself in his individual 
glass; his only excuse is to be original; he 
should say things not yet said, and say them 
in a form not yet formulated" (p. 120) . That 
programme will carry one well along toward 
extravagance, unless one have a strong dose 
of that excellent French quality of raison. 
Miss Lowell is likely to hear from other quar- 
ters of this choice " gaffe " : " The truth 
seems to be that, to most Frenchmen, Catholi- 
cism is more of a superstition than a religion. 
I hardly believe religion, as we conceive the 
term, to be possible to the Latin mind" (p. 
125). That is a pretty large order; but our 
critic has a facility for original announce- 
ments, learned perhaps from de Gourmont as 
above quoted. Such a statement may some- 
times be made of one's personal acquaintance, 
but hardly of an entire race. 

Of de Gourmont 's youth between 1858 and 
1883 we learn nothing, " as the only real 
biography of him I have been unable to get " 
(p. 110). However, we must overlook the 
deficiency, as again in the case of Jammes 
(p. 262), and turn instead to de Regnier, who 
" is universally considered the greatest of the 
syrnboliste poets" (p. 149). Here we have 
two pages of irrelevant family history going 
back so far as the sixteenth century, all calcu- 
lated to show what a very aristocratic gentle- 
man M. de Regnier is. The whole ancestry is 
perfectly banal, and could be matched by 
hundreds of inconspicuous families. We are 
amazed to learn that " he is one of the great 
poets of France," and that "he is an even 
greater novelist. Such a novelist as there can 
be only a dozen or so in any nation's history 
[sic]. Hugo, Stendahl [sic], Balzac, Flau- 
bert, Zola, Anatole France, is he inferior to 
any of these?" (pp. 149-150). Well, most 
people would say so; but we -are afraid to 
admit it, for fear of being condemned as a 
Philistine. Here is further appreciation of 
this wonderful man, expressed in wonderful 
English: "After four hundred years, not of

steady rising, but (much more difficult prob- 
lem) continued arisen, this family has pro- 
duced one of the greatest poets and novelists 
which its country has known. Seven volumes 
of poetry, fifteen volumes of novels and stories 
(and all, mind you, works of the very first 
rank), one play, and three volumes of essays, 
is his tally up to date. And the man is only 
fifty-one! Why! No stevedore could work 
so hard! It is colossal. And this man is a 
scion of an old aristocratic family! " (pp. 153- 
154) . That challenge ought to have made old 
Boston's aristocracy sit up and take notice. 
But in France we have heard of a Voltaire, 
and of a certain Balzac who wrote quite a 
little parcel of pretty good novels and died 
before he was as old as M. de Regnier. 
Really, Miss Lowell is so partial for this pro- 
lific aristocrat that, after quoting the Intro- 
duction of "Les Medailles d'Argile," words 
fail her : "Is any thing in any language more 
lovely than that? If so, I do not know it" 
(p. 192) ; and again: "Oh. they are beauti- 
ful, these poems! I know nothing more per- 
fect in any language" (p. 203). If anyone 
else does, let him hold his peace in the pres- 
ence of this ecstasy. 

The essay on Francis Janimes is our favor- 
ite. This poet has an attractive personality, 
his southern verse is so fresh and vital as to 
deserve to be better known, and Miss Lowell's 
interpretation is more nearly sane. 

Fifty pages on Paul Fort, dramatist and 
lyrist, form the last of the essays. As soon 
as he becomes known, we are told that he " is 
certain to share with Verhaeren the unquali- 
fied admiration of English-speaking people" 
(p. 271). "Whether the proletariat agrees 
or not, Paul Fort is a great poet, a very great 
poet" (p. 323). Believe me! Again, the 
common herd must wait until the scales fall 
from their eyes and they are initiated into 
the mysteries of tortured language and figure. 

The volume is accompanied with striking 
portraits of the six poets, which one is 
tempted to cut out and frame ; it contains an 
English prose translation of the French poems 
quoted in the text an example of pious

cial as to misrepresent the genius of the race 
they are intended to glorify. 

It is rare to find a Macmillan publication

THE JLONG CHILDHOOD OF THE RACE.* 

Pithecanthropus, the ape-man of Java, 
probably lived nearly 500,000 years ago. The 
Heidelberg man, represented by a massive jaw 
from the sands of Mauer, may have existed 
about 250,000 years ago, half-way between our 
time and that of the ape-man. The Chel- 
lean culture-stage is perhaps a hundred thou- 
sand years old. These estimates are not exact, 
but it is at least certain that the period of 
written history represents but a minute frag- 
ment of the whole story of man. Though each 
successive generation has died, the stream of 
life has been continuous, and we of to-day 
represent the fruition of many hundreds of 
centuries of ceaseless endeavor. Before such 
I a record our preconceived ideas are shaken,, 
and we ask ourselves whether some purpose 
j dominated the evolutionary process, or 
whether civilization may be a relatively tran- 
i sient and accidental by-product, destined to 
I perish because too remote from the broad 
! deep currents of animal life. The discoveries 
of anthropologists do not in themselves form 
a basis for philosophy, but they necessarily 
I change and color all philosophical systems. 
We had vaguely known that humanity had its 
roots in the remotest past, but now a large 
portion of that past is unrolled before us, and 
we are able to realize what man has been 
during by far the greater part of his exis- 
tence. Fragmentary as the record is, it begins 
to assume reasonable coherence, and for a 
hundred thousand years or so we may even be 
said to possess a sort of history. 

It is natural to compare the earlier types 
with modern man, and deem them imperfect 
in proportion to their remoteness from our 
standard. In reality each successive form 
represented the apex of development, perhaps 
at least as well fitted for its special environ- 
ment as we are for ours. The ape-man and

the man of Mauer were sufficient unto them- 
selves, surely not mere models in the rough 
of something yet to come. Yet, looking back 
on the story as a whole, it is hard not to see 
what the biologists call orthogenesis, evolu- 
tion having a definite trend and a definite 
fructification, seeming as though designed. 
This is the ideal of progress, the most char- 
acteristic peculiarity of our species as it 
exists to-day. Individually and racially, we 
believe that we are going somewhere. 

The late C. R. Henderson used to say that 
to him perhaps the greatest obstacle to belief 
in a benevolent providence was the fact of the 
late discovery of the microscope. Why had 
so many suffered through the ages for lack of 
the knowledge this instrument might pro- 
vide ? In the case of the earlier human types, 
there is no obstacle to the belief that they 
were living as full a life as their capacities 
permitted; but when we come to the Upper 
Palaeolithic, we find in the Cro-Magnon man 
a being with abilities similar to our own, and 
perhaps only inferior to us in lack of inven- 
tions and traditions. It seems an extraor- 
dinary thing that for thousands of years there 
lived a creature possessing inherent powers 
which could not find adequate development, 
which were destined to remain latent, await- 
ing the slow growth of socially inherited 
knowledge. It is Dr. Henderson's puzzle on 
an infinitely larger scale. 

Professor H. F. Osborn, in his " Men of the 
Old Stone Age," has brought together in 
readable and connected form all the new and 
old information concerning early man, with 
an abundance of excellent illustrations, many 
of them the work of palaeolithic man himself, j 
taken from the caves of France and Spain. 
From his long study of mammalian evolution, 
and his special interest in the glacial period, 
lie has been able to approach the subject in a 
broad spirit, and deal with it as adequately as 
modern knowledge permits. The progress of 
recent years has been so great that all the 
older books are quite out of date, and the 
reader is astonished to find how much real 
information now takes the place of the nebu- 
lous speculations of only a few years ago. In 
place of a confused mass of more or less unre- 
lated facts, we now have a reasonably con- 
nected story, not too difficult to understand. 

In one respect even this new book probably 
stands in need of amendment. An important 
section is given over to the Piltdown race, 
discovered in the gravels of Sussex, and 
described by A. S. Woodward of the British 
Museum as a new genus combining the char- 
acters of man with those of the higher apes. 
This man or animal is considered by Profes- 



sor Osborn as a side branch of the human 
family, which has left no descendants; but 
still more recently, Mr. G. S. Miller of the 
U. S. National Museum has undertaken to 
prove, and apparently with success, that the 
supposed new genus consists of a primitive 
human skull and the jaw of a chimpanzee! 

Whatever may be the ultimate fate of the 
Piltdown race, the general argument pre- 
sented by Professor Osborn is not affected, 
and the more interesting and important part 
of the evidence, resting on quite a different 
basis, cannot be assailed. The now numerous 
discoveries of remains of the Neanderthal race 
prove that this primitive type of man was 
normal in his day, dominant and wide-spread 
over central and western Europe. We have 
an excellent idea of his physical structure and 
of his simple culture. He was not our ances- 
tor, but was displaced at the beginning of 
upper palaeolithic time by the true homo 
sapiens, the Cro-Magnon man, a type "which 
ranks high among the existing types in capac- 
ity and intelligence." The new race came, as 
wise men are supposed to do, from out of the 
East, and somewhere in Asia the true begin- 
nings of our own species of man must be 
sought. A bust, modelled with the aid of the 
skeletal remains, shows a remarkably fine 
type, which would look well anywhere in the 
modern world. The good opinion thus formed 
is fortified and increased when we examine 
the wonderful examples of palaeolithic art left 
in the caves of southwestern Europe. It is 
extraordinary to see the hairy mammoth, with 
characteristic pose, drawn by the man to 
whom it was a familiar object. The master- 
piece of the collection, illustrated by a colored 
plate, is the bison from the ceiling at Alta- 
mira, vividly painted in four shades of color. 
In a sense these figures are crude, but they 
are wonderfully life-like, showing keen obser- 
vation and genuine artistic ability. They are 
as different as possible from the poor picto- 
graphs left by the American Indians. 

The Cro-Magnon man was by no means the 
only variety of homo sapiens which entered 
Europe, but he was the most interesting. The 
modern population is extremely complex, but 
it is a curious fact that the present inhabi- 
tants of Dordogne possess the peculiar cranial 
features of the Cro-Magnon type, which actu- 
ally inhabited the same region in palaeolithic 
days. There are good reasons, it appears, for 
believing that this ancient blood survives lit- 
tle diluted, and herein lies an additional argu- 
ment favoring the view that these men of old 
were not inferior in inherent capacity to those

STRATHCOXA OF C AX ADA.* 

Lord Stratheona or Donald A. Smith, 
as he was known to several generations of 
Canadians was a product of Scotland and 
Canada. Like his cousin, George Stephen 
(afterward Lord Mount-Stephen), Sir Sand- 
ford Fleming, and many another famous 
Canadian, he was born north of the Tweed, 
and in early manhood crossed the seas to seek 
his fortune in the new world. There must 
surely be some peculiar virtue in the combina- 
tion of Scottish character and a Canadian 
environment, if one may judge by the results 
in cases such as these. Physical, economic, 
and other difficulties that might surely dis- 
courage most men, seem but to add zest to the 
lives of those hardy sons of the north. Where, 
indeed, will one find a more extraordinary 
story of sheer determination and will-power 
surmounting all obstacles, than in the life of 
Donald Smith ? He came to Canada a boy of 
eighteen, and can hardly be said to have been 
welcomed with open arms, as he was banished 
to the bleak and inhospitable coast of Labra- 
dor, where he spent more than a quarter of 
a century of his life. Yet he lived to become 
Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, 
Canada's High Commissioner in England, a 
peer of the Empire, and one whom statesmen 
and princes delighted to honor. 

The service of the Hudson's Bay Company 
has from the beginning appealed to the spirit 
of adventure of Scotchmen, and in the case 
of Donald Smith there were special reasons 
why his thoughts should turn to the great fur 
country of the west. John Stuart and Robert 
Stuart, his mother's two brothers, and Cuth- 
bert Grant and Cuthbert Gumming, her 
cousins, were all famous Nor'Westers. Their 
romantic exploits in that wonderful land of 
boundless plains and forests, gigantic moun- 
tains, sea-like lakes, and mighty rivers, with 
its countless herds of buffalo in the south and 
caribou in the north, and its wild Indian in- 
habitants, became familiar to their young 
kinsman ; and it is not surprising to find his 
thoughts turning more and more to the west, 
until he finally made up his mind to answer 
the insistent call. He landed at Montreal in 
July, 1838, and after a characteristic inter- 
view with the cold-hearted but most efficient 
little autocrat of the fur-trade, George Simp- 
son, found himself duly apprenticed to the 
Honourable Company of Adventurers of 
England trading into Hudson's Bay. 

Mr. Beckles Willson. in his very complete

life of Stratheona, tells the story of his quar- 
ter-century or more of service on the Labra- 
dor, his gradual promotion to the charge of 
the important Montreal department ; his visit 
to the Red River Colony as a special commis- 
sioner of the Canadian Government, and his 
exciting experiences with the leader of the 
Rebellion, Louis Riel. This visit to the west 
changed the whole current of Donald Smith's 
life. He became deeply interested in the 
struggling little settlements that were soon to 
develop into the Province of Manitoba, and 
quickly recognized the wonderful agricul- 
tural possibilities of the Red River valley. 
When Manitoba was brought into the Cana- 
dian Confederation in 1870, he became one of 
the first representatives of the province in the 
Dominion Parliament, and so began his career 
as a public man, a career which brought 
him at one time or another into more or less 
bitter conflict with the leaders of both the 
political parties of the country. 

From his visit to Red River may also be 
said to date Donald Smith's interest in the 
i question of transportation, an interest which 
brought him into close contact with such rail- 
way builders as J. J. Hill, Norman W. Kitt- 
j son, R. B. Angus, and his cousin George 
Stephen, and which ultimately had a good 
I deal to do with the organization of the Cana- 
dian Pacific Railway Syndicate and the build- 
ing of Canada's first transcontinental railway. 
There are some rather controversial points 
connected with Donald Smith's career as a 
Canadian politician, and a builder of rail- 
ways ; but it is impossible to enter into them 
here, even if it were desirable. On these and 
many other points, Mr. Willson's book will be 
found an admirable, if a trifle ponderous, foil 
to the somewhat vindictive though unques- 
tionably clever biography of Strathcona by 
i Mr. W. T. R, Preston. The latter pictures 
! Strathcona as the evil genius of his country, 
or something very much like it. Mr. Willson. 
i on the other hand, presents his hero as one to 
whom :t more than to any single other, is due 
[Canada's] material prosperity and much of 
her political temper." Mr. Preston would no 
doubt put his own interpretation on " political 
temper," but Mr. Willson's meaning is wholly 
complimentary. As in so many other cases, 
the truth probably lies somewhere between 
these two extremes. 

Not the least striking fact in the life of 

Strathcona, and one quite characteristic of his 

indomitable spirit, is his acceptance at the 

; age of seventy-six of the important post of 

I High Commissioner : and it was equally char- 

acteristic of the man that he should have

tireless energy and resourcefulness as to trans- 
form what had previously been a rather cum- 
bersome and ineffective office into an agency 
of tremendous usefulness to the Dominion. 

These are but the broad outlines of a par- 
ticularly long life packed with achievement, 
the details of which will be found in Mr. 
Willson's two substantial volumes. If one 
had any criticism to offer of his work, it would 
be that he has sometimes gone out of his way 
to enlarge at great length on the history of 
men and events touching only very indirectly 
the story of Lord Strathcona. However, that 
is a fault that has its redeeming features; 
and on the whole, Mr. Willson's biography is 
an admirable piece of work.

THE CASE AGAINST " SHAKSPERE." * 

The "Bacon-Shakespeare question," which 
has been well characterized as the vainest of 
all paradoxes, seems to exert a peculiar fasci- 
nation on lawyers. This may perhaps be 
accounted for by the fragmentary and desul- 
tory character of the details that have been 
hitherto accumulated concerning the earthly 
career of William Shakespeare and which lend 
themselves with peculiar facility to all sorts 
of jugglery and prestidigitation. The profes- 
sional pride of the biologist bent on recon- 
structing an extinct species from a few fossil 
remains is as nothing compared with the zeal 
of a clever lawyer engaged on a case which, 
because of the unlikelihood of his circum- 
venting the law, tests his ingenuity to the 
utmost. This, we take it, is the explanation 
for Mr. Greenwood's book, " Is There a Shake- 
speare Problem ? " although he would proba- 
bly have resisted the call to write it had not 
Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.P., and the late An- 
drew Lang seen fit to reply to his former 
book, " The Shakespeare Problem Re-stated." 

Mr. Greenwood is not, and we say this 
emphatically, though he once was, a "Baco- 
nian." He resents nothing so much as being 
included among the "Baconians." He is an 
" anti-Willian," i. e. he contents himself with 
maintaining only that Willy " Shakspere " of 
Stratford (1564-1616), actor, money-lender, 
maltster, huckster, and realty speculator, was 
not the William " Shake-speare " who wrote 
the plays and poems known as " Shakespeare's 
Works." In fact, Mr. Greenwood's thesis is 
that "Shake-speare," with or without the 
hyphen, was not the name of the author of 

*Is THERE A SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM? With a Reply to 
Mr. J. M. Robertson and Mr. Andrew Langr. By G. G. Green- 
wood, M.P. New York: John Lane Co. 



those immortal works; that "Shake-speare" 
was only a pen-name or pseudonym, either 
for an unknown individual, a man of rank 
"who had reasons for concealing his iden- 
tity," or for a syndicate of writers who pub- 
lished their poetic and dramatic effusions 
under this name, under some arrangement 
with "Shakspere" the actor, because the 
spear-shaking form of his name "makes an 
excellent nom de plume"! Why it had to be 
the name of a particular individual, especially 
of an individual not otherwise distinguished 
for literary achievements, and what the par- 
ticular virtues of the surname "Shake-speare" 
are, we are not informed. Presumably, 
though we are not told anything about it, no 
other Englishman of that day had such a 
fine-sounding ( ?) name ; or, if he had, would 
have lent it or sold it for such a purpose. 
Presumably, too, no other Englishman but 
the Stratford rustic, not even Bacon, would 
have consented even for a consideration 
to go through life with the stigma of having 
written such unconsidered trifles as "Venus 
and Adonis," "Hamlet," "Lear," "Othello," 
etc. Presumably, too, no other Londoner but 
this country yokel, whose only virtue lay in 
his name (which Mr. Greenwood says he 
could hardly write), would have agreed to 
have " a wretched picture and worse bust," a 
doggerel epitaph and some Latin verses con- 
taining "a howling false quantity," survive 
him. For of course these things must have 
figured in the bargain between Shakspere and 
" the great unknown " or unknowns. To Mr. 
Greenwood so great is the credulity of man, 
especially of lawyers there is nothing inher- 
ently improbable in the assumption that an 
uneducated, semi-illiterate clown, speaking an 
almost unintelligible patois, could be palmed 
off on London, the London of Elizabeth and 
James, as the author of literary works that 
were the wonder and the delight of the day. 
Does Mr. Greenwood really believe that if 
such had been the fact, some member of that 
illustrious syndicate would not have left some- 
where a hint of the transaction, or that some- 
one in that gossipy and curious age would not 
have remarked on the incongruity of a man 
so ill-qualified writing such works, or that 
someone would not have openly questioned 
the reputed paternity of those compositions? 
Not all the king's horses nor all the king's 
men can make us believe that. Furthermore, 
who can believe that the numerous writers of 
that day who wrote Shakespeare's praises, 
such as Meres, Davies, Scolloker, Webster, 
Freeman, Digges, Weever, etc., did not know 
the man in the flesh 1 Or were they all in the 
great secret ? Aware of some of these difficul-

ties, Mr. Greenwood, unlike most Baco we 
beg pardon ! anti-Willians is willing to ad- 
mit that " Shakspere " had some education, 
must have known a little Latin and Greek, 
had a few legal phrases at his command (as a 
result of his business transactions), and even 
had some but very little skill in penman- 
ship. In fact, Mr. Greenwood seems even 
ready to agree with the Rev. Begley, whom he 
quotes without contradiction, that "Willy can- 
not be totally excluded from the immortal 
plays (the poems are not included), and that 
he assuredly had a hand in " working at and 
patching up the various old plays he had 
scraped together." Unless this means that 
" our fellow Will " was permitted to trim the 
manuscripts or bind the loose sheets together, 
we are to conclude that "Shakspere" wrote 
the non-Shakespearean portions of " Shake- 
speare." 

If Mr. Greenwood's book will not convince 
the reading public, nothing else will. It is 
remarkably well written and very readable. 
His humor, his sarcasms, his adroitness, his 
personalities, his cleverness, the earnestness 
and vehemence with which he argues his case, 
prevent him from being dull or uninteresting 
for any unduly long time, notwithstanding 
the repetition of old and hackneyed data and 
overworked, if unsound, arguments. He is so 
shrewd in his analysis of some of the evidence, 
so systematic in the exposition of his thesis, 
so merciless in his exposure of the shallow- 
ness, the absurdities, and the ignorance of 
poorly equipped biographers and commenta- 
tors, that scholarly orthodox Shakespeareans 
must give his book heedful note. If it were 
not for an apparently ineradicable bias in the 
question at issue a bias which utterly dis- 
qualifies him for a genuinely scientific, objec- 
tive study of the evidence, a deep rooted, 
perhaps unconscious, hatred of " Shakspere " 
the man, this would really have been a valua- 
ble contribution to our knowledge of the 
Elizabethan period. 

We can conceive of almost nothing more 
unprofitable than a summary of Mr. Green- 
wood's counts against "Shakspere" would be. 
There is not a single fact by way of commis- 
sion or omission in the annals of " Shakspere " 
and his family that he cannot and does not 
distort into an argument against the Strat- 
fordian's authorship of the writings attributed 
to him by his contemporaries and poster- 
ity. To every point made by Shakespeare's 
biographers he exclaims triumphantly : " Just 
what we should have expected of Shakspere 
the actor! But absolutely inconceivable of 
Shake-speare the poet ! " Sensible of the f act 
that a chain is not stronger than its weakest 



link, and that some of his links are very weak, 
Mr. Greenwood takes refuge in the analogy 
of a rope one of whose fibres is easily broken 
but whose strength is not thereby impaired. 
But every one of the threads in the rope 
woven by Mr. Greenwood is rotten. Speak- 
ing legally, we may say that no judge would 
submit a case to a jury, even where only a 
literary matter is in dispute, in which each 
! single evidential item had been struck from 
the minutes as either incompetent, immate- 
rial, or irrelevant, as would unquestionably be 
the case if Mr. Greenwood had brought his 
action in a court of law instead of in the 
court of public opinion. It is more than 
likely that after the presentation of his case 
a motion to dismiss with costs would immedi- 
ately be granted, and he would be very fortu- 
nate if shortly thereafter he were not himself 
the defendant in several actions for libel and 
malicious prosecution. 

Determined to retain Rowe's fantastic and 
utterly unfounded assertion that William was 
withdrawn from school at the age of thirteen 
to help his father, Mr. Greenwood accepts 
unquestioningly the general belief that John 
Shakespeare had declined into the vale of 
poverty about the year 1577. He gives the 
reader the impression that Mr. Robertson and 
the Rev. T. Carter are the only ones who 
adopt the "baseless" (?) theory that the 
poet's father was not reduced to a state of 
penury. But there are others such honest 
independent investigators as Hunter, Knight, 
De Quincey, who find the evidence of a 
" penniless " Shakespeare not only insufficient 
but contradicted by very positive evidence 
proving that John was fairly prosperous to 
the end of his days. Even Halliwell-Phil- 
lipps repeatedly warns his readers of the in- 
I sufficiency and unreliability of the evidence 
! of pecuniary embarrassment. Rowe invented 
the story to account for William's "small 
Latin and less Greek"; and Mr. Greenwood 
retains it to show that William could not have 
had all the learning that " Shake-speare " dis- 
| plays. Mr. Greenwood's theory requires a 
semi-illiterate, rustic William, and he forces 
everything to that formula. Many of the 
facts relied upon by Malone and his succes- 
sors to prove John's poverty are more than 
probably attributable to his Catholicism. An 
honest consideration of the evidence, by no 
means insignificant either in quality or quan- 
tity, will convince any sane and unbiased 
j student that to the end of his days John 
i Shakespeare not only lived in comparative 
| affluence but enjoyed all those things that 
" should accompany old age, as honor, love, 
obedience, troops of friends." The stories of 



210 



THE DIAL 



[ March 2 



his being a broken bankrupt and a bailiff- 
hunted debtor are figments of the imagination. 

Mr. Greenwood devotes a long chapter to 
proving, by quotations from various Baco- 
nians and some orthodox Shakespeareans, 
that Shake-speare was " a man of the highest 
culture, of wide reading, much learning, and 
a large familiarity with the classics," and that 
therefore he could not have been the William 
who was (?) withdrawn from a filthy village 
school at the age of thirteen by an impecu- 
nious (?) father and who is fabled to have 
been flogged for raids on imaginary deer in a 
park that never existed, and who made a 
hasty marriage at eighteen. But the gram- 
mar school at Stratford, we have good reason 
to believe, was then one of the best in En- 
gland; and, as we have no good reason for 
assuming that he left that school without com- 
pleting the course of education there given, 
it is all but certain that he could there have 
obtained that knowledge of Latin and Greek 
the only subjects taught that he exhibits, 
and that acquaintance with certain writings 
of Horace, Ovid, Virgil, Juvenal, Plautus, and 
Seneca that his critics find. If he was he 
and we see no reason yet for doubting it we 
may rest assured that he loved books too much 
not to continue his reading in the classics 
after he left school. Others have done it; 
why not he? And there is no inherent im- 
probability in the assumption that on his 
arrival in London, whither his genius called 
him, he found himself in an environment that 
induced him to take up the fashionable study 
of French and Italian. 

We cannot resist the opportunity of giving 
the reader a taste of Mr. Greenwood as a 
logician and as an interpreter of Shakespeare. 
He adduces Hamlet's sentence, "Sense sure 
you have, Else could you not have motion," to 
prove that Shakespeare "was undoubtedly 
familiar with the Aristotelian psychology." 
To accomplish this marvel he tells us, after 
many flourishes, that according to Aristotle 
"the faculties of the soul are growth, sense 
(or sensibility), desire, motion, and reason. 
Plants have only the principle of growth; 
animals have sense as well, which is the dis- 
tinguishing faculty of the animal soul. . . 
Motion implies sense, and an animal that has 
motion must necessarily have sense as well." 
Thereupon, backed by his "old friend Dr. 
Jackson, A.M., F.B.A., of Trinity College, 
Cambridge," he exclaims: "That we have 
here the true explanation of Shakespeare's 
words cannot, I think, be disputed." The old 
commentators, he informs us, could make 
nothing of the above passage, and Warburton 
actually proposed to read "notion" instead 



of " motion," " an absurd suggestion, which 
[like all other conjectural emendations] sev- 
eral editors thought worthy of being placed 
on record." But Mr. Greenwood carefully 
suppresses the fact that modern commenta- 
tors give a perfectly satisfactory explanation 
of Hamlet's words without resorting to Aris- 
totle or altering the text. Hamlet, excoriat- 
ing his mother for her choice of a second 
husband, whom he paints in most uncompli- 
mentary colors, says to her: "Mental facul- 
ties [sense] you surely have, else could you 
not have feelings, desires, emotions, i. e. sen- 
sual cravings." The words "sense" and 
" motion " were commonly employed by the 
Elizabethans and by Shakespeare in the 
senses here given. For Hamlet to have told 
his mother then that she must have sensibility 
because she had the power of locomotion 
would be the acme of inanity, and wholly 
inconsistent with what follows. 

A long chapter is devoted to the attempt to 
prove that Shakespeare the poet must have 
" received some special training in the law," 
and that he could therefore not have been the 
Stratford Shakspere who devoted his time to 
killing calves in high style for the purpose of 
rehabilitating his father's fortune. Mr. 
Greenwood accomplishes this, as he thinks, by 
quoting the opinions of various " authorities " 
to the effect that Shake-speare thought as a 
lawyer, that his thoughts took a legal mold, 
that he introduces legal expressions " when 
there is no necessity for them and sometimes 
when they seem not a little out of place, or 
even inartistic, i. e. on occasions when they 
would not suggest themselves to an ordinary 
layman," that he employs legalisms in such a 
manner as to indicate a "real knowledge of 
the rules and technicalities of the law," and 
that according to Sir Sidney Lee and the 
" Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England " he 
was " ever accurate in his legal terminology." 
Mr. Greenwood has apparently never heard 
of a book by the late Mr. Charles Allen 
(Attorney General of Massachusetts, 1867- 
72, and Justice of the Supreme Judicial 
Court of Massachusetts, 1882-98), in which 
it is shown that " Shakespeare " shows no evi- 
dences of a legal education, that his supposed 
knowledge of law has been greatly exag- 
gerated, that many of his legalisms are intro- 
duced in a manner more characteristic of a 
layman than of a skilled lawyer, that he em- 
ploys such legal expressions as a lawyer would 
never employ, that some of his plots are based 
on such bad law that no lawyer would abide 
them, that many of his legal phrases are 
strained, untechnical, and inaccurate, that his 
contemporaries, in accordance with the fash- 



1916]

ion of the day, employed legalisms as freely 
as he did and that some of them introduced 
into their compositions many legal terms and 
allusions to which no parallels can be found 
in his works, and that many of his legal ideas 
are such as a trained lawyer would not be 
capable of. Ben Jonson, I may add, was not 
a lawyer, and yet he introduces into his works 
legalising even more abundantly, more spon- 
taneously, and at least as accurately as Shake- 
speare into his. " Shakspere " had ample 
opportunities to learn the verbiage and techni- 
calities of the law from his own as well as his 
father's experiences. Besides, there is evi- 
dence at hand, as Mr. Greenwood knows, that 
William may have been a student at one of 
the Inns of Court before he left (not "fled 
from") Stratford. 

All recent " anti-Willians," following the 
lead of Sir Sidney Lee, treat their readers 
to frequent sarcastic references to " Shak- 
spere's" application for a coat-of-arms and 
his genuinely English desire to be styled 
" gentleman." To your Baconian, Sir Sidney 
Lee is as unimpeachable as holy writ when 
he says something discreditable to William or 
his family. Mr. Greenwood informs his read- 
ers that in 1599 William had "with great 
difficulty obtained from the College of Arms 
a recognition of his claim to a coat-of-arms." 
There is not a particle of evidence that the 
Shakespeares had any difficulty in obtaining 
this coveted distinction. Furthermore, there 
is extant irrefutable evidence that the appli- 
cation for arms was granted in 1596, not in 
1599. But Mr. Greenwood prefers to accept 
the latter date, so as to create or heighten the 
probability that William Shakespeare was 
caricatured by Jonson in the person of the 
ridiculous Sogliardo (in " Every Man Out of 
His Humour." 1600) who obtained a coat-of- 
arms " after much toil ' among the harrots.' " 
If Jonson had intended maliciously to allude 
to Shakespeare's coat-of-arms he would not 
have waited till 1600, three and a half years 
after the grant, to do so. To further heighten 
the assumed resemblance between Shakespeare 
and Sogliardo, Mr. Greenwood translates the 
latter's motto, "Not without Mustard," into 
the French, " Non sans Moutarde," a form in 
which it never occurs in Jonson's play. Her- 
aldic mottoes with the words "Not without" 
were very common in England and Scotland, 
but they were almost invariably rendered 
" Sine." not " Non sans." Mr. Greenwood's 
assertion that it is now generally admitted 
that in "Every Man Out of His Humour" 
Jonson has a hit at Shakespeare is, to say the 
least, an exaggeration. 

Sir Sidney Lee's wretched account of fraud 



and trickery on the part of William, his 
father, and the officials of the College is, of 
course, accepted in its entirety by Mr. Green- 
wood, notwithstanding that there is not a 
word: of truth in it. All that I said on this 
subject in my review of Mr. Baxter's book 
(THE DIAL, Dec. 9, 1915) applies verbatim to 
the book now under consideration. 

Mr. Greenwood goes beyond recent Baco- 
nians and Shakespeare biographers in his 
comments on a subject that has received but 
little attention at their hands. He says: 
"John Shakspere had made [an application 
to the Heralds' College] once before, viz. in 
1568, while he was bailiff of Stratford, sup- 
porting it by numerous fictions concerning his 
family. The negotiations of 1568, however, 
proved abortive." Mr. Greenwood's confident 
assertion that this application " proved abor- 
tive " is founded on Sir Sidney Lee's opinion 
that " otherwise there would have been no 
necessity for the further action of 1596." 
Inasmuch as this matter has not hitherto been 
elucidated, and as it furnishes an excellent 
illustration of the slovenliness with which 
Shakespeare's biography has been written, we 
append the following explanatory comments. 

The 1568 application for a coat-of-arms is 
not known to be in existence. Mr. Green- 
wood's confident assertion, therefore, that this 
application was based on "numerous fictions 
concerning his [John's] family" is mere fic- 
tion. Whether the 1568 transaction proved 
abortive remains to be seen. In 1599 the her- 
alds made the assertion that "John Shake- 
spere [sic] produce this his Auncyent Cote 
of Arms heretofore Assigned to him whilest 
he was her ma'tes officer & Baylife of [Strat- 
ford]." In the second (1596) draft, a memo- 
randum asserts that " This John sent A 
patierne thereof under Clarent Cooks hand in 
papor," i. e. that John Shakspere presented a 
draft of the wished-for coat drawn and writ- 
ten by Robert Cook, Clarencieux. This is all 
we know about the matter. Halliwell-Phil- 
lipps was of the opinion that "no grant of 
arms was made to John Shakespeare before 
1597, for he is called 'yeoman' in a [Latin] 
deed dated [early] in that year." But this is 
more than offset by the fact that after 1568, 
the year of his bailiffship, John was almost 
invariably accorded the honorable addition of 
" Master " in the Corporation Records, in the 
Parish Register, and in private documents; 
and in 1580 he was included in "A Booke of 
the names and Dwelling places of the Gentle- 
men and Freeholders in the Countie of War- 
wick." 

In the absence of the least particle of evi- 
dence to the contrary, the assertions of the 



212

[ March 2 



heralds concerning- the early (1568) arms are 
entitled to be regarded as truths emanating 
from the highest authority. Fortunately for 
the lovers of the dramatist-poet, John Shake- 
speare applied for arms at the very time when 
the College must have been particularly free 
from all possibility of corruption. During 
the years 1593-5, the quarrels of Dethick, 
Camden, and Brooke, involving all the officers 
of the College in their angry accusations and 
recriminations, reached such enormous pro- 
portions that, in order to save the College 
from utter ruin, the Queen was compelled to 
interfere. She commissioned Lord Treasurer 
Burghley, Lord Howard, and Lord Hunsdon 
to take full charge of the College. For the 
purpose of correcting the abuses complained 
of, and of restoring 1 order among the heralds, 
Sir Edward Hobby and Sir George Carew 
were then authorized to draw up a set of 
ordinances for the government of the officers 
of the College. These lords rendered their 
report on September 28, 1596, less than a 
month prior to the date of the 1596 Shake- 
speare drafts. At such a time the heralds 
would not be likely to imperil their positions 
by referring to a non-existent draft or patent 
in Cook's hand. 

Why, Mr. Greenwood may ask, was it neces- 
sary for John Shakespeare to apply for a 
eoat-of-arms in 1596 if one w r as granted him 
some twenty-seven years before ? The answer 
to this question we conceive to be as follows : 
In 1568 John Shakespeare was elevated by 
his fellow burgesses to the honorable position 
of "bailiff and justice of the peace" of the 
incorporated borough of Stratford, and by 
virtue of that office he achieved the social 
grade of " gentleman " for the rest of his life. 
The effect of municipal honors and dignities 
to advance a yeoman to the rank of gentry 
and to entitle him to coat armor was a note- 
worthy feature of the political system of the 
England of the sixteenth century. Sir John 
Feme ("The blazon of gentrie"), writing in 
1586, says : 

" If any person be advanced into an office or dig- 
nity of publique administration . . the Here- 
aide must not refuse to devise to such a publique 
person, upon his instant request, and willingness 
to bear the same without reproche, a Coate of 
Armes, and thenceforth to matriculate him with his 
intermarriages and issues descending in the Regis- 
ter of the gentle and noble. . . In the Civil 
or Political State divers Offices of dignitie and 
worship doe merite Coates of Armes to the pos- 
sessours of the same Offices, as . . Bailiffs of 
Cities and ancient Boroughs or, incorporated 
townes." 

Sir William Camden, one of the very highest 
authorities on matters of Heraldry, informs 



us that there were in England four sorts of 
Esquires, one of them being " Esquires by 
virtue of their offices, as justices of the peace." 
Smithurst and other old writers on Heraldry 
speak to the same effect. So that John Shake- 
speare may very well have applied to Robert 
Cook for a coat-of-arms in consideration of 
his prosperous circumstances and the impor- 
tant offices he held, and obtained his request. 
From Professor Christian, quoted in var- 
ious editions of Blackstone's Commentaries, 
we learn that those who achieved armorial in- 
signia by virtue of public office had a right to 
that distinction for life. By 1596 John 
Shakespeare was retired from business, his 
son was winning renown in the literary and 
dramatic world and was acquiring wealth. 
Being apprised of William's intention to pur- 
chase New Place, the second best house in 
Stratford, the thought occurred to Master 
Shakespeare, former Bailiff, Justice of the 
Peace, and Chief Alderman, that now was the 
time to elevate the family in the social scale, 
preserve to posterity a record of the achieve- 
ments of his ancestors, and perpetuate his 
own distinguished career. Having succeeded 
in this, he subsequently, in 1599, applied for 
permission to impale the arms of Arden with 
those of Shakespeare, so as to perpetuate the 
gentle descent of his wife; but for some 
unknown reason the transaction was not 
completed. In all this there was absolutely 
nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing incon- 
sistent with the poetic genius of William

ECONOMIC INFLUENCES IN THE FORMATION 
OF AMERICAN PARTIES.* 



Notwithstanding the protests of some 
churchmen against the giving over of all his- 
tory to the heartless hand of " economic deter- 
minism," and of the disciples of Freeman 
against the neglect of "past politics," the 
school of historians who believe in the "eco- 
nomic interpretation of history" is steadily 
gaining in strength. The fact is that practi- 
cally all of our historians have belonged to 
this school, though some do not realize it and 
some would deny it. Even the high-sounding 
phrases of Bancroft about rights and liberty 
and patriotism mean little more than that the 
colonists fought England because they be- 
lieved it to be to their economic interest to do 
so. One does not have to go outside of Hil- 
dreth to find that the struggle between the 
Federalists and the Republicans was in real-

ity based upon conflicting economic interests. 
The whole course of our tariff controversies, 
from. 1789 to 1913, is nothing but the strug- 
gle of conflicting interests. 

The difference is simply this : In the older 
historians the conflict of economic interests is 
a mere incident, often a subordinate one, 
which we only read about between the lines 
made luminous by the heat of conflict over 
the Constitution, the sacredness of the Union, 
and things of like character. On the other 
hand, the historians of the newer school put 
the economic phase of the conflict in bold- 
face- type at the head of the paragraph, and 
then back this up with a strong array of 
facts. The makers of history are also reduc- 
ing it to an economic basis, demanding that 
our education be made " practical," that is, 
made to serve the economic needs of the 
people. 

One of the most enthusiastic and deter- 
mined of the economic interpreters is Pro- 
fessor Charles A. Beard, whose "Economic 
Interpretation of the Constitution " appeared 
more than two years ago. The method used 
in this earlier volume has now been followed 
in tracing the economic influences back of the 
formation of parties. In his earlier volume, 
the author reached the conclusion that the 
Constitution ''was a product of a struggle 
between capitalistic and agrarian interests," 
the financiers, public creditors, traders, manu- 
facturers, and allied groups being for it, the 
farmers and debtors being prominent among 
the opponents. This line of cleavage, he says, 
never was obliterated, and marks the real line 
of difference between the Federalists and the 
Jeffersonian Republicans. a view which 
runs counter to that of some other investiga- 
tors of this period. 

In proof of this thesis. Professor Beard 
submits an array of evidence. One is that 
maps showing a political reversal in certain 
localities between 1788 and 1800 are untrust- 
worthy, owing to the large increase in the 
vote. For example, in Boston only 760 voted 
to express themselves on the adoption of the 
Constitution, but more than 3000 voted in 
1800. In several places every man who voted 
in 1788 might have supported Adams, and 
still Jefferson would have won. Men of that 
day thought that parties were growing up. 
and lamented this fact. No member of the 
convention who opposed the Constitution ever 
went into the Federalist camp, while six oppo- 
nents went into the Republican camp and 
later were joined by twelve who had favored 
adoption. 

Hamilton was the high priest of the Fed- 
eralists. His theorv was that men could be 



governed only by force or interest. Force 
was out of the question in America. With the 
gradual development of his fiscal policy, the 
line of cleavage was brought into bolder relief, 
for men began to align themselves accord- 
ing to their interests. From the musty rec- 
ords of the treasury department, hitherto 
little used, Professor Beard has shown that of 
the fourteen senators who voted for the fund- 
ing bill, eleven were security holders. Of the 
twelve who voted against it, five were security 
holders, but three held only small amounts. 
Of the thirty-two representatives who voted 
for assumption of the state debts, twenty-one 
were security holders, while only eight known 
security holders voted against it. these lat- 
ter, with one or two exceptions, coming from 
states where the holdings amounted to very 
little. 

An examination of the Republican and 
Federalist controversial literature of the 
period also leads to the conclusion that eco- 
nomic interests were at the bottom of party 
divisions. The writers do indeed name politi- 
cal differences; but even such authorities as 
John Taylor and John Marshall, representa- 
tives of the different parties, speak of the 
division as due to the conflict between the 
capitalistic and the agrarian classes. 

That economic interests were largely instru- 
mental in causing divisions on foreign affairs 
has been pretty well recognized: yet even 
here Professor Beard sheds new light, espe- 
cially in showing why Virginia, which im- 
ported more goods than New York or most of 
New England, opposed the Jay treaty and, in 
general, sided against England. 

In the " great battle of 1800 " the question 
of personal freedom, which had been threat- 
ened by the alien and sedition laws, undoubt- 
edly played a part; but both parties frankly 
fought on the economic issue. That, in gen- 
eral, the line of division left "wealth and 
talent" on one side, and the agrarian inter- 
ests on the other, is shown by conclusive evi- 
dence drawn from all sorts of sources, such 
as histories, monographs, pamphlets, news- 
papers, manuscripts, and election returns in 
many localities. Even the Southern slave- 
holders needed to be assured that they had 
nothing to fear from Jefferson, who was 
known to be an abolitionist. 

What is the significance of all this ruthless 
iconoclasm? Are we to believe that the 
Fathers were utterly sordid and corrupt, 
seeking only the advancement of their own 
interests? By no means. It is yet to be 
proved that they were any more self-seeking 
than are the statesmen of to-day. Many of 
them had an eve to the main chance in the 



214 



THE DIAL

funding and bank bills; but who will deny 
that the country profited immensely through 
these acts? It would be very difficult indeed 
to prove that the Fathers profited more in 
proportion than later statesmen who voted for 
their own and their country's welfare in many 
ways, for example, in the bills for Pacific 
railroads and in tariff bills for the protection 
of "infant industries." At least they were 
not " eating one another," as Jefferson said 
they were doing in Europe, where persons 
were " piled upon one another in large cities," 
and as we would be doing here if that condi- 
tion arose. v m

RECENT FICTION.* 



The novels for 1916 have begun long before 
one has finished the novels of 1915, and in 
plunging into them one must leave unnoticed 
many good things of the year gone by. If 
the first appearances are any sign of the sea- 
son, the coming year is going to be a strenu- 
ous one. Mr. H. K. Webster in "The Real 
Adventure," and Mr. W. L. George in " The 
Strangers' Wedding," have both published 
books on the subject of marriage, books with 
an idea, " books that make you think," as they 
say now, or rather did a few years ago. The 
reader must not only enjoy the bounty as he 
may find it, but he must also regulate or 
rearrange his notions of sociology. This last 
is, of course, not so hard, for presumably few 
of us have anything in the way of sociological 
notions more definitely fixed than the bits of 
glass in a kaleidoscope, so that a few shakes 
do not mean as much as might seem. 

It will be a new experience to many to meet 
with Mr. Webster as a real "student of the 
great problems of our day," or whatever else 
one likes to call people who do what he is 
doing now. And it is otherwise hard to give 
him a fair chance in reading his new book, 
for it comes before us so enswathed in bewil- 
dering advertisement and iridescent publicity 
that the real thing is not obvious. Nor under 
the best of circumstances is the real Webster 
obvious, for he has been developing his lit- 
erary ability for the last ten or a dozen years, 
in conditions which to a lesser man would 
surely have been fatal. He began with a fine 
and original idea, namely, that in the great 
industrial enterprises of the America of our 
day might be found material for true ro-

mance. That true romance neither he nor any 
of his numerous followers has succeeded in 
putting into lasting form; and failing (it 
would seem) to realize his early ideal, Mr. 
Webster has thrown himself into the current 
possibilities of bookmaking with a success that 
may be as gratifying to him as it has been 
to thousands of admirers. Now, however, he 
seems to collect himself and make a try at 
something which he thinks more worth while. 
If a man can succeed in such an effort, his 
success should certainly have a hearty 
welcome. 

Everyone knows that Mr. Webster has very 
great ability in seeing interesting possibilities 
in the confusions of current life, and in tell- 
ing a story so that one will want to read it to 
the end. It is perhaps less generally recog- 
nized that he has no especial gift for conceiv- 
ing and rendering character, or for suggest- 
ing the spirit of time and plaee. In " The 
Real Adventure " he takes himself much as 
he is ; his book embodies interesting phases of 
current life, and when one has got once 
started it is certainly interesting. I do not 
make so much of the characters; they seem 
to me little more than abstractions suggested 
by ideas that are very common nowadays. 
The delightful beauty who readily becomes a 
successful designer of stage costumes, the 
keen corporation lawyer who deals so excel- 
lently with big cases that he piles up enor- 
mous fees, the alienist who knows absolutely 
everything about the human mind, the theatri- 
cal producer who brings glittering success out 
of sordid chaos, these people seem to me, 
not mere puppets, but hardly the real thing. 
One follows out the story rather with the feel- 
ing that here are a man and woman doing so 
and so, as they work out an interesting prob- 
lem in married life. It is not that one has 
two absolute people living among others of 
their kind, and doing what seemed obvious 
or necessary. The problem remains ab- 
stract, still a problem; one has always to 
decide whether she was right or wrong, and 
so on. Mr. Webster's whole course of lit- 
erary life makes this sort of thing natural to 
him. His young lady in one place refers to 
the novels of Mr. Robert W. Chambers as 
though they stood for an impossibly wonder- 
ful world, and the remark makes one think 
that Mr. Webster's own world is not so very 
different. It is too splendid a world for ordi- 
nary people: we should be lost in it, at 
least I should. I could not stand the pace for 
a minute: I should feel awkwardly silent in 
the brilliant conversation of those delightful 
dinners: I should find myself pushed into a 
corner at the thought even of those glorious 



1916 j 



THE DIAL 



215 



compellers ef success. The atmosphere is too 
bracing, too smart, too superlative. 

All that makes it rather hard to take the 
book seriously. Mr. Webster certainly does 
one thing worth doing: he takes the real 
woman's view. Not that all women would do 
just what his heroine did. of course not; 
few would do such things, and not many more 
would approve of them. But a woman would 
understand why she does what she does, why 
she feels as she is said to feel. The problem 
is still abstract, but the point of view is right. 
And that (when it comes to thinking) is a 
very important thing. One wants to look at 
the problem rightly ; after all, the sociological 
thinker has to abstract his ideas from the con- 
crete realities of fiction. Should he not be 
glad to have the author do the abstracting for 
him? Perhaps he would, though one might 
ask. "Why the novel ? 

Mr. George is of course a different sort of 
person from Mr. "Webster: he is much more 
of a student of social conditions; he writes 
novels, one is told, to diffuse his social and 
philosophical ideas. He is a student of the 
nature of women and of society in general. 
He comes to his novel from the opposite side. 
Mr. Webster knows all one could desire about 
making novels, and about sociology he knows 
what he has gathered by general or special ; 
observation. When, a few years ago, Mr. 
George turned from journalism to fiction he i 
had given careful study to economic prob- 
lems, and knew in a practical way as much 
about making novels as anybody else on the 
outside. So one has rather a different feeling 
about his handling of problems and questions 
and such things. Mr. George deals with a 
very different world from that of Mr. Web- 
ster. the world of the East End of London. 
And the average reader is less familiar with 
the life of poor people in London than he is ; 
with the life of rich people in Chicago. Still > 
one guesses that Mr. George is a little super- 
lative, too, not sumptuous but still rather 
exciting. Few of us have the experience 
necessary to estimate the truth to life of the 
evening wherein a man comes up from Oxford 
to Paddington. dines unwisely and too well 
with three Oxford men, goes to the "Euro- 
pean " rather flushed, goes somewhere after- 
ward in a cab with a lord proverbially drunk 
and two (perfect) ladies, is thrown out of the 
somewhere into the street minus his watch, 
sees London wake, asks a tramp to have a cup 
of coffee and finds him dead. It may l>e abso- 
lutely true truth, but at first it is a little 
exhilarating. Afterward the atmosphere is 
less exciting (or is it that we get used to it?), ; 
and we follow with appreciation Mr. Roger 



Huncote as he goes to the St. Panwich Lay 
Settlement, and in course of time marries " a 
girl of the people." The last part of the book 
tells how they got on together. 

If Mr. George has a problem or an idea 
(and I presume he has; I think I get it), he 
has been most successful in embodying it in 
forms of life. The life that he presents is not 
familiar to me (except in snatches), and yet 
I think I see how exactly this and that must 
have happened. This daughter of a washer- 
woman who marries a gentleman, how natu- 
ral seems everything that she does, from 
putting on all her jewels at her first dinner 
and going upstairs to take them off when she 
observes that the other women do not wear so 
many, to her sudden escape to Ramsgate 
where she gets kissed by a stray man with 
whom she falls into acquaintance. The book 
is full of life; in fact, it is not at all obvious 
just what idea there is in it. This is quite 
delightful. one can read it without any 
notion of idea. It is not tremendously solid, 
it leaves out a good deal: one has little idea 
what this man and woman did all day to fill 
up the time. It does seem a little casual that 
within a year after marriage he should be 
taking up vague golf-sticks and going off to 
spend the day with no apparent interest in 
what his wife might be doing at home. But 
a novelist cannot tell everything, and Mr. 
George tells a great deal. 

One of these books supplements the other. 
In "The Great Adventure" the woman feels 
that married life, as she and her husband 
understand it. puts her in an unworthy posi- 
tion. With all the devoted love between her- 
self and her husband, she feels that she needs 
to be something really different from what 
she is. She says at first that she is practically 
a mistress, a prostitute. When she comes to 
have some personal acquaintance with mis- 
tresses and prostitutes, she feels that that was 
a very crude and unjust way of putting 
things; but still she feels that the true mar- 
ried life demands more than the kind of love 
she and her husband seem to have. " The 
Strangers' Wedding" presents a man and a 
woman who love each other so that, in spite of 
immense difference in character and habits 
and education, they are sometimes absolutely 
united in spirit. Sue. the daughter of the 
London washerwoman, has none of the ideas 
of Rose, the daughter of the American femi- 
nist. She does not argue about these things 
at all; but she does subtly feel, and so does 
her husband, as time goes on. that the passion- 
ate bond between them is not enough ; even 
their most perfect reconciliations are not per- 
manent. Rose, with a clear head and a loving 



216

[ March 2 



heart, devises a remedy, and carries it through 
in spite of its drastic necessities. Sue does 
not. One should read both books. 

Such things are interesting and absorbing, 
but it is a pleasure to turn for just a moment 
to Mr. Joseph Conrad. Mr. Conrad's latest 
book is a collection of stories written a few 
years ago ; nor is any one of these stories as 
fine as his best. But it is a pleasure to have 
something else by him for all that. It is not 
that one wants to get away from sordid or 
splendid conditions to exotic adventures and 
wide horizons; for in Mr. Webster and Mr. 
George we have quite as desperate adven- 
tures and quite as alluring horizons as may be 
found in the Seven Seas. Nor is it that it is 
a relief to get away from problems and ideas, 
for in Mr. Conrad there is usually a deeper 
problem and a more determined idea even 
than whether women ought to be independent 
in marriage or whether it is wise to marry 
"out of one's class.',' It is perhaps that in 
Mr. Conrad's stories there is almost always a 
vital intensity, an absolute originality, which 
one recognizes at once and likes. These sto- 
ries give us some of those cross-purposes and 
misfits which seem to make up the detail of 
Mr. Conrad's view of life, but they give them 
to us so that we recognize that what they give 

us is life.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The " Essays in Social Justice " 
em * by Professor T. N. Carver of 

Harvard University, will pro- 
vide wholesome food for thought to many 
who are feeling out toward a better under- 
standing of the vexing and perplexing prob- 
lems that face society. But for an obvious 
obsession with the Malthusian doctrine on the 
part of the writer, and an apparent lingering 
belief in the outworn wage-fund theory, there 
is little in the book with which the most lib- 
eral and advanced political thinker could 
quarrel. Professor Carver betrays his Mal- 
thusian leanings in the reiterated affirmation 
that " economic scarcity " is the dominating 
factor in the regulation of human relation- 
ships; and this inevitably invites the opposi- 
tion of a reader who has had opportunities for 
observing that the worst periods of destitu- 
tion and social misery have coincided with 
those in which the granaries have been over- 
stocked with food-stuffs and the warehouses 
stacked ceiling-high with clothing, for all of 
which their owners were eagerly seeking con- 
sumers. In his repeated suggestions, again, 



that by abstaining from consumption and 
investing one's savings in the purchase of real 
capital, i. e. tools, one can best benefit society, 
we seem to hear an echo of the old theory, 
dead and buried as was thought, that the pos- 
sible employment of labor is limited by the 
amount of capital in circulation. The popula- 
tion theory and the wage-fund doctrine have 
been too completely discredited to admit of a 
modern reader reconsidering with patience a 
revival of them in any shape. One regrets 
the more that the author should thus have 
invited opposition in the opening chapters of 
his book, on finding in the later essays a suffi- 
ciently clear elucidation of the root causes of 
that which distresses us all, the persistence of 
poverty amidst abounding wealth. There is 
something not only original but singularly 
convincing in the way in which Professor 
Carver diagnoses the economic maladjust- 
ments and disharmonies in society, and traces 
them to a cause which, when pointed out, vin- 
dicates itself as the true one. If to produce a 
given result in sufficient quantity, the writer 
argues, various factors are necessary, it is evi- 
dent that a restriction of the supply of one of 
the factors will restrict the quantity of the 
product, and to the extent of that restriction 
render the unbalanced surplus of the other 
factors useless or superfluous. " The first 
problem in any system of distribution is to 
search for the limiting factor or factors." 
Here is the central thought upon which the 
essay on " The Cure for Poverty " turns. It 
is shown as the pivot on which "the law of 
diminishing returns" revolves. Its universal 
bearing on the problems of vocational train- 
ing, and on the distribution in their proper 
proportions of administrative ability and un- 
skilled labor, is revealed in a way that carries 
conviction. The light that flows from the idea 
of the limiting factor in production is thrown 
upon the inevitable effect of withholding land 
from use, in a manner that will satisfy the 
most radical of sociologists. If a reviewer 
could feel justified in fault-finding with so 
excellent a book, he might perhaps suggest 
that the author, in common with many other 
sociological writers, betrays a lack of faith in 
the tendency of human affairs to go right of 
themselves under conditions of freedom. The 
true spirit of democracy lies in the stubborn 
conviction that if a solid sub-stratum of jus- 
tice can be discovered in " equality of oppor- 
tunity," the various factors in the production 
of social harmony may be trusted to sort 
themselves out and arrange themselves in 
right proportions, without regimentation or 
external aid of any kind. (Harvard Uni- 
versity Press.)

famil j the Fruit- 
o/ f he concord lands days and immediately 
afterward, with Emerson, Tho- 
reau. Hawthorne, Margaret Fuller, and 
Thomas Starr King, are vividly recalled in 
the boyhood memories of the late Dr. Fred- 
erick L. H. Willis, who enjoys the distinction 
of being the original of Louisa Alcott's 
" Laurie," of " Little "Women " fame. ''Alcott 
Memoirs " ( Badger) is a thin volume, posthu- 
mously edited from the fragmentary notes of 
Dr. Willis by his daughter. Mrs. Edith Willis

only boy playmate of the Alcott girls, except 
William Lane (son of Charles Lane, the 
"Brother Lion" of "Transcendental Wild 
Oats"). Llewellyn Willis, as he was called in 
those days, had exceptional opportunities to 
mingle with the members and friends of the 
Alcott family; and he valued this rare good 
fortune, even though he was too young to 
know just how good it was. Sufficiently im- 
pressed was he, even as a light-hearted boy, 
by the appearance and the utterances of men 
and women like Alcott and Emerson and 
Thoreau. Mrs. Alcott and Margaret Fuller, to 
be able many years later to recall those im- 
pressions and some of those utterances. Of 
such, therefore, is the substance of the book, 
a precious fragment of the designed but never 
completed larger autobiographic volume we 
should like to have had from Dr. Willis's pen. 
He died nearly two years ago at the age of 
eighty-four, with more of varied experience 
and of association with noted men and women 
to look back upon than falls to the lot of many. 
In its unstudied, frank, and intimate way, his 
recollection of the Concord celebrities who 
helped to mould his character at the impres- 
sionable period of his life is a pleasing aid to 
our visualization of those celebrities. 



.4 compendium Of the numerous books on Amer- 
for American {can " preparedness." Mr. Fred- 
eric Huidekopers " The Military 
Unpreparedness of the United States " (Mac- 
millan) is the most ambitious and, as it seems 
to us. the best. It is a massive volume, chiefly 
devoted to the military history and policy of 
the United States. The portion dealing with 
the subject up to 1862 is a recasting of Upton's 
well known book, the portion since that date is 
original. The whole is abundantly buttressed 
with tables, references, and notes, and repre- 
sents a tremendous amount of labor. The 
author's purpose is to urge the need of greater 
land forces. Five chapters are given to the 
lessons of our wars, and some of the conclu- 
sions are that the regular army has always 
been too small, never properly organized, and 



invariably without adequate reserves ; that the 
enlistment period has been foolish, and recruit- 
ing has been made worse by the bounty sys- 
tem; that too much reliance has been placed 
on raw troops, causing needless protraction of 
our wars and corresponding expense: that 
adequate equipment was never on hand when 
war began ; that war cannot be conducted effi- 
ciently unless a government wields its power 
despotically, that is. without a general staff. 
Mr. Huidekoper's programme calls for a regu- 
lar army of 250.000 men, a reserve to the 
regular army of 420,000, besides a continental 
army and the National Guard. He also urges 
the necessity of organizing our national re- 
sources, enlarging the military academy, 
increasing the number of officers, extending 
the system of military training camps, keeping 
track of all available men, and placing mili- 
tary finance under a budget system. The 
effect of such a system, and its compatibility 
with American ideals, is not seriously dis- 
cussed. Indeed, these are questions which may 
quite properly be excluded from a book of 
this character, which is concerned solely with 
the military factors of the case. But, though 
excluded from the book, they cannot be 
ignored in life. The adoption of the reforms 
here advocated would mean a change in the 
American point of view. This point of view 
may now be wrong, indeed, this book con- 
tends in effect that it is. But when the objec- 
tion to our former ideals comes from military 
circles, and when our life and system are to 
be transformed to meet conditions determined 
by men with the martial point of view, we 
cannot ignore the fact that it represents a 
genuine change in our conceptions of the rela- 
tion of the military to the civil power, and of 
the functions of the latter in our institutions. 
When national defence becomes the pivot on 
which our national life turns, we shall have 
something fundamentally different; and this 
is a circumstance that we cannot afford to 
ignore. 



An " hontst 



Shortlv after the termination 

. _ 

of the active career of Joseph 
' Chamberlain, ten years ago, 
there was added to the growing list of biogra- 
phies of the statesman an interesting and well 
informed study by Mr. Alexander Mackintosh. 
A revised and enlarged edition of Mr. Mack- 
intosh's book, under the title " Joseph Cham- 
berlain: An Honest Biography" (Hodder & 
Stoughton) . has lately appeared. Biographies 
of Chamberlain fall into three groups. The 
first consists of those in which, despite its 
apparent glaring incongruities, the career of 
the man is depicted as being fundamentally 



218 



THE DIAL 



[ March 2 



consistent. The second consists of those in 
which the virtue (if it be one) of consistency 
is entirely denied and the man is represented 
as a politician of life-long ambition who 
having failed in one course recklessly tried 
another. The third group is represented by 
Mr. Mackintosh's book, wherein it is shown 
that " the changes in Mr. Chamberlain's case 
were unusually numerous and violent, that 
they affected nearly every great secular sub- 
ject discussed in his time, and that they 
occurred not only in the judgments of his 
youth, but in those of his mature and ripe 
manhood; but wherein, also, the writer, in- 
stead of pronouncing a verdict upon the 
motives involved, undertakes simply to 'pre- 
sent the whole case to the jury.'" Having 
watched Mr. Chamberlain from the gallery of 
the House of Commons for a full quarter- 
century, and having made a diligent study of 
his subject, the author should have been in a 
position to submit the facts both accurately 
and fully. And it must be said that, on the 
whole, he has lived up to his opportunity. 
Praise is accorded here and censure there, but 
most of the time the narrative flows unob- 
structed by the intrusion of personal opinion. 
Appended to the biography proper is a col- 
lection of the statesman's more noteworthy 
expressions of opinion on political matters, 
arranged in parallel columns so that the reader 
may observe at a glance the contrasts which 
appear in utterances of different dates. It 
may be presumed that the pronouncements of 
most political leaders who have been long be- 
fore the public could be culled with results 
also more or less startling. And no judgment 
concerning the honesty, or even the con- 
sistency, of any person should be arrived at 
from the contemplation of disjointed data of 
this character. If utilized in close conjunc- 
tion with his text, Mr. Mackintosh's exhibit of 
" Chamberlainiana " is useful; otherwise it is 
misleading. 

The whimsical Baffling at first, and somewhat 
monologue of a so to the end, is the whimsical I 

n of moods. monologue entitled " The Solilo- 
quy of a Hermit," by Mr. Theodore Francis 
Powys. Not exactly a hermit does he show 
himself to be, after all, for he walks and talks 
with his fellow-men and manifests a lively 
interest in the world about him. Better 
might he have called his book " The Soliloquy 
of a Satirist," since satire of a delightful sort 
crops out on almost every page. Of a cer- 
tain Mr. Thomas (though that is not his real 
name) who inhabits a red house in the village 
of Blank, the author writes : " I cannot say 
that I think that God has expressed His di- 



vine purpose very well in this kind of a man, 
a man that does not even know how to 
treat a tradesman, and who will thank a 
porter for doing what he is paid to do." And 
of himself, his chief theme, he says : " I take 
my life as I find it, and live it to myself as 
everyone does. As I am a priest, I never give 
anything away; it is a natural law of my 
nature not to give, but always to receive." 
Then he amusingly relates with ostensible 
frankness an incident illustrating his own 
alleged stinginess. Again, in characteristic 
vein, he writes : " It is much better, I have 
found, to love a chair than to love a person; 
there is often more of God in a chair." The 
fiction of his priesthood is humorously main- 
tained through the book. "Avoid the good 
ones," he counsels little children, near the 
close of his soliloquy, " and go and dance with 
those that take and eat honestly the lion's 
share. We know that Lion; there is some- 
thing honest and open about him ; the immor- 
tal laughters surround him as he gambols and 
frolics in new-mown hay." Truly, a satirist 
and humorist of a different kidney from the 
ordinary sort is this companionable hermit. 
There is many a chuckle in his little book. 
(New York: G. Arnold Shaw.) 



popularizing Counted by centuries, the his- 
Engiish tory of English law is a long 

one. Only special students of 
the subject are familiar with the story of how, 
out of beginnings crude and fortuitous, there 
has emerged after a thousand years the pres- 
ent status of acts, principles,- and procedure 
which combine to make up the British consti- 
tution. An account of these legal institutions 
has usually been regarded as attractive only 
to that rare student of the law who would 
enrich his professional training by a knowl- 
edge of the complex historical processes which 
created it. The ever-widening reach, of the 
curriculum, however, might very reasonably 
admit an introduction to a side of national 
development so interesting and fundamental 
as the evolution of English law and judica- 
ture. The absence of convenient aids for the 
purpose has doubtless been a leading obstacle 
to such instructors of English history and 
politics as were disposed to supplement their 
course-requirements with knowledge of a legis- 
lative character. Professor James F. Colby, 
of the Dartmouth College law school, has 
helped to supply the gap by the publication 
of "A Sketch of English Legal History" 
(Putnam). He has brought together a series 
of articles on the history of English law con- 
tributed a few years since to Traill's " Social 
England " by those well known authorities,

Frederic W. Maitland and Francis C. Mon- 
tague. The editor has supplemented many 
pages of the text with footnotes, consisting 
for the most part of carefully selected ex- 
cerpts from the more elaborate works of 
Pollock and Maitland and of Professor Ed- 
ward Jenks. The text itself is written in 
language sufficiently clear and untechnical to 
interest the general reader and the student of 
English history. It presents the continuity of 
English legal development from the Saxon 
"Dooms" of Ethelbert. Ine, and Alfred to 
the Insurance Act of 1911. The first three 
chapters consider the genesis of the earliest 
Saxon codes, the Norman adaptation of these 
and their conversion from the vernacular 
into the Latin language; certain borrowings 
from the canon law of the church, the origin 
of trial by jury in the Frankish missi, and the 
foundation of the common law by the king's 
judges, beginning with Henry II. The rest of 
the narrative embraces an account of the de- 
velopment of statutory forms, of the lawyer 
class, and judicial procedure. Few books give 
so forceful an impression of the real character 
of the English people. Their lack of idealism 
in things legal appears from their practical 
satisfaction with what is customary. Never- 
theless, English law with the lapse of time has 
evolved wonderfully beneficent changes. It has 
preferred not to expedite its career through ; 
the light of theory, or to borrow freely from 
sources foreign to its own experience. Pro- 
fessor Colby has distinctly served the needs of 
education by the publication of these valuable 
articles in a single volume, together with his 
own useful selection of supplementary notes, 
chapter-references for further reading, and 
appendices containing the laws of Ethelbert 
and extracts from various sources and com- 
mentaries. .__ 

Mr. Alan Lethbridge's " The 
New Russia, from the White Sea 
""to the Siberian Steppe" (Dut- 
ton) is an unadorned recital of occurrences 
and observations incident to an extended jour- 
ney, in 1914, through the great northern 
stretches of European and Asiatic Russia. If 
the author had any preponderant purpose in 
writing the book, it must have been that of \ 
disabusing his readers' minds of commonly 
prevailing notions concerning the forbidding 
features of this little-visited section of the 
world. In the first place, he describes in detail 
the preparations made by himself and his wife 
for the contemplated journey, and gives prae- j 
tical advice to the prospective traveller, laying 
much emphasis upon the kindliness of the peo- 
ple who will be encountered and the generally 



satisfactory character of the means of trans- 
portation and of entertainment in such regions 
as have any considerable population. In the 
next place, he describes the economic develop- 
ment which is in progress in great districts 
eastward from the White Sea to north-central 
Siberia the opening of oil-fields, the exten- 
sion of the lumber industry, the building of 
railroads, and the growth of trade. And, 
finally, he pictures, with moderation yet with 
earnestness, the future settlement and utiliza- 
tion of vast territories which the world gener- 
ally supposes to be altogether ill-adapted to 
the support of a substantial civilization. 
Among existing cities and towns whose ap- 
pearance and life are described with some full- 
ness are Archangel, Solovetz. Veliki Ustjug 
("the Florence of the north"), Perm, Eka- 
terinburg, and Omsk. . Dealing as it does only 
with the Russian " far north," the volume sup- 
plements in a useful manner the various books 
of Russian travel in which attention is given 
almost exclusively to other portions of the 
Muscovite dominion. The illustrations, from 
photographs by the author, are many and 
excellent. 



Colonization 
as the source 
of war. 



Several well written and sugges- 
tive but loosely related essays 
make up the first part of Mr. 
Walter Lippmann's "The Stakes of Diplo- 
macy " (Holt) . The core of the book, however, 
consists of the second part, in' which are dis- 
cussed the causes of strife between nations 
and the remedies therefor. With convincing 
skill it is pointed out that trouble between 
nations usually arises in the backward parts 
of the earth, where the powers are competing 
for advantage. These parts are designated as 
" arenas of conflict." Conflicts in this field are 
often not susceptible of arbitration because 
they involve a nation's prestige; and no 
nation will consent to a diminution of its posi- 
tion by anything short of force, if for no other 
reason than that any concession would weaken 
its chances when the next difference arises. 
Mr. Lippmann proposes joint control by the 
powers of these arenas of conflict. A basis for 
this suggestion he finds in the arrangements 
made for the Congo in 1885, and in the Alge- 
ciras Conference in 1905. He would have the 
conferences which settle international ques- 
tions as they arise continue as international 
commissions to control the execution of such 
conventions as are agreed upon. Thus, there 
would in due time be a number of international 
commissions, each charged with some interna- 
tional problem. Though no doubt a fruit of 
Mr. Lippmann's independent thinking, his 
proposal is by no means a new one. It is noth- 



220

ing other than the Zweckverband which Alfred 
Fried of Vienna has been urging these past 
twenty years. Indeed, the proposal has been 
an actual fact for some decades in the Danube 
River Commission ; and the principle was ap- 
plied in the joint administration of Crete and 
Samoa, in the control of the Ottoman Debt, 
and as noted by the author in the Congo, 
not to mention other instances. The value of 
Mr. Lippmann's book lies not in its originality, 
but in its popularization and advocacy of the 
soundest method so far discovered for stopping 
war at its chief source. 



The first volume of the now 

Huntresses of 

the insect tamous Souvenirs Entomolo- 

giques" forms the fifth one in 
the series of translations by Mr. Alexander 
Teixiera de Mattos of the works of the illus- 
trious French naturalist, Henri Fabre. It 
appears under the title, "The Hunting 
Wasps" (Dodd, Mead & Co.), and it includes 
an account of Fabre's observations on the 
remarkable habits and instincts of those soli- 
tary wasps whose larvae are hidden in bur- 
rows in the earth, and whose larder the 
mother stocks with insects, with rare beetles 
of a particular species, with crickets, grass- 
hoppers, or with caterpillars. Each species 
of wasp selects a particular kind of prey, 
which it prepares for underground storage by 
paralyzing each victim upon capture by sting- 
ing it in the appropriate nerve centres. The 
helpless captive is thus unable to resist the 
forays of the delicate larva or to do violence 
to it. Fabre's ingenious experiments demon- 
strate that this habit rests upon a series of 
complicated instincts, coming into function in 
a more or less rigid sequence, which the parent 
faithfully continues to the end although the 
experimenter's interference has visibly robbed 
the operation of all value. Instinct thus 
knows everything in the undeviating paths 
marked out for it; it knows nothing outside 
those paths. The book includes a discussion 
of the modern or evolutionary theory of in- 
stinct, which the author's observations do not 
lead him to support. With keen rapier 
thrusts, he finds the weak spots in the elder 
Darwin's observations on these insects, and 
with relentless argument and array of facts 
he undermines Darwin's argument for the 
origin of the reasoning faculty from such 
fixed instincts. The author also pleads at 
length for the existence of an unknown sixth 
sense, beyond human experience, to explain 
some of the unerring and remarkable percep- 
tions of these wasps. While his criticisms of 
the evolutionary significance of the provision- 
ing instinct may well give us pause, in view 



of his extensive and critical observations, and 
make us re-examine our glib explanations of 
these extraordinary phenomena, it is doubtful 
if this suggestion of a mysterious unknown 
sense will bear the test of modern physiologi- 
cal experimentation. This volume will be of 
particular interest to American readers be- 
cause of the more recent investigations of Dr. 
and Mrs. ,Peckham on the American hunting- 
wasps. The subject is itself full of novelty 
and unfailing interest, and is of fundamental 
scientific importance as illustrating one of the 
most highly specialized and complicated series 
of instincts thus far observed. In the hands 
of this master observer, these are revealed to 
the reader in simple yet remarkably accurate 
fashion, with loving enthusiasm and the zest 
of conquest, and with a dramatic power un- 
rivalled in the literature of natural history. 



The essence of the lectures on 
outlines of Belgian history delivered last 

Belgian history. , '' . . r(\ ' 

winter at the University of Chi- 
cago by M. Leon Van der Essen, visiting pro- 
fessor from Louvain, is now made available 
to a wider public in the " Short History of 
Belgium" (University of Chicago Press). In 
no sense a " war book," it traces the story of 
the provinces which form the modern state of 
Belgium from the time when Cassar declared 
that the Belgac were the bravest of all the 
Gauls to the death of Leopold II (57 B.C. 
1910 A. D.). In his preface the author states 
his belief that a knowledge of the past history 
of his country may help to a clearer under- 
standing of " why the Belgian nation of today 
took the stand it has taken in the great war 
and preferred honor in place of dishonor, and 
struggle for freedom in place of ease." He 
concludes with the hope that the reader may 
find historical support for the belief dear to 
Belgian hearts to-day : Belgians never can be 
slaves. " The national culture of Belgium is 
a synthesis, if I may so call it, where one finds 
the genius of two races the Romance and 
the Germanic mingled, yet modified by the 
imprint of the distinctively Belgian. It is in 
that very receptivity the fact that it has 
absorbed and unified the best elements of 
Latin and Teutonic civilization that the 
originality of the Belgian national culture 
resides." Belonging thus by race to two 
nationalities, the whole history of Belgium 
has been a struggle for independence: first 
that of the communes to win recognition of 
their rights from feudal lords ; that of Lotha- 
ringia to free itself from Germany; and that 
of Flanders to shake off the fetters of France. 
United in the fifteenth century under the 
dukes of Burgundy, these provinces had still

to struggle against the Spanish, the Austrian, 
the French, and finally the Dutch rule, and 
won recognition as an independent and per- 
petually neutral state in 1830. A single epi- 
sode must suffice to show the temper of the 
people. In the twelfth century the Count of 
Hainaut, a loyal partisan of Emperor Fred- 
erick Barbarossa, maintained that his first 
duty was to his county. In a war between 
Germany and France he declared that "he 
was not obliged to put his fortresses in the 
hands of the imperial troops and to grant 
them passage through his territory, as that 
would bring devastation to his country. His 
country being located between Germany and 
France, he ought to remain neutral during 
this war." We are irresistibly reminded of 
Verhaeren's verses, 

" Je suis le fils de cette race 
Tenace, 

Qui veut, apres avoir voulu 
Encore, encore et encore plus." 



, unorthodoxy, naughtiness, and many others 
equally inviting. It is a book for the odd 
moments of leisure, not for continuous reading. 



Although three of its pages are 
' dev t e <l to "Books in War- 
Time," the collection of "Mod- 
ern Essays" (Longmans) reprinted from the 
editorial columns of the London " Times " is 
agreeably and intentionally free from matter 
of only ephemeral significance. As Professor 
J. W. Mackail says in introducing the book, 
"the 'third leaders' in The Times of which 
this volume is a selection are meant . . to turn 
the reader from affairs and interests of the 
moment to a consideration ' of man, of nature, 
and of human life ' in their larger, more per- 
manent aspect." Like the essays of the 
" Spectator," " Tatler," " Rambler," and their 
kind, these later bits of daily observation and 
reflection are made to measure and according 
to a pre-arranged plan, maintaining a remark- 
able similarity of style and structure under a 
diversity of authorship. Occasional classical 
allusions or quotations betray, most wel- 
comely, the university man behind the pen. 
Many of England's famous authors have 
served an apprenticeship, after leaving Ox- 
ford or Cambridge, on one or another of the 
great London journals, to the advantage of 
all concerned. Thus it is not improbable that 
many or perhaps most of these well-written 
leaders are the work of promising young uni- 
versity men of whom the world will hear 
more in the future and in less anonymous 
fashion. To tempt the reader, let a few 
headings from the book's contents be here dis- 
played. The essays treat of such themes as 
curiosity, ugliness, paradox, charlatans, prig- 
gishness, childishness, grumbling, the Latin 
genius, practical jokes, philosophy and poetry. 



Luther' ' works 
in English 
dress. 



Probably Martin Luther comes 
nearer than any of his country- 
men to being the typical Ger- 
man. It was his ambition and his pride to be 
and to speak " deutsch." He seems to have 
had a keen sense of the primitive meaning of 
this word, which is, "of the people," "ver- 
nacular." That he was so thoroughly German 
does not make it more difficult to interpret him 
to the English world, since the two stocks and 
languages are so closely kin. Considering the 
persistent vitality of so much of Luther's mes- 
sage to the world, even to the modern world, 
it is a cause of congratulation that a group 
of Lutheran scholars have undertaken to pre- 
sent a large portion of the reformer's work to 
the English public. There are to be ten vol- 
umes, of approximately four hundred pages 
each ; and it would seem that this is none too 
little space for the well informed general 
reader to give on his shelves to so significant a 

; force in the world's development. The two 
volumes already issued extend only to the year 
1522, and include, therefore, theological essays 
chiefly ; although not a few of these, such as 
the famous Address to the German Nobility, 
touch problems of life and society that are still 
vital. Luther was a splendid heretic socially 
as well as religiously, and his utterances on 
profit-taking (Wucher) and commerce, on the 
duties of rulers, on the rights of citizens, 
though often biased by a peculiar clerical 
myopia, will give the upholders of the estab- 
lished order little satisfaction. Rather let it 
be said that advocates of some of the most 

| promising reforms of our day in the direction 
of true Christianity will find his writings a 
rich armory of offence and defence. The 

! translators have done work worthy of their 

1 subject, as have also the publishers Messrs. 
A. J. Holman & Co. of Philadelphia. 



BRIEFER MENTION, 

Up to the present. Middle English literature, 
used as a corpus vile for linguistic dissection, has 
not taken its rightful place either in our college 
curricula or in the estimation of the general culti- 
vated reader. To assist in breaking down our prej- 
udices and removing the difficulties of language, 
Professor Cook has prepared a " Literarv Middle 
English Reader" (Ginn). Here for the first time 
we have a splendidly comprehensive collection of 
the actual texts without learned apparatus, save 
brief introductions and foot-note glossaries. Here 
one with ordinary intelligence may read pre-Eliza- 
bethan texts primarily for enjoyment. This book

THE DIAL 



[March 2 



should do much to bring our students to an enthu- 
siastic appreciation of much in earlier English 
literature. 

In a pamphlet of sixty-six pages, " reprinted for 
private distribution from " Papers of the Biblio- 
graphical Society of America, Volume IX, Nos. 
3-4," Mr. George Watson Cole presents some inter- 
esting facts about " Book-Collectors as Benefactors 
of Public Libraries." Both voluntarily, either in 
their lifetime or after their death, and involun- 
tarily, when their possessions have passed beyond 
their control, collectors have been the means of 
preserving for public use thousands of rare and 
valuable books that would otherwise have been 
lost to the world. Many instances of such benefac- 
tion are cited by Mr. Cole, and he adds much re- 
lated matter concerning the history of books and 
printing and collecting. Portraits of famous book- 
collectors are inserted, and a convenient " syllabus " 
of the entire treatise is appended. 

The papers read before the Aristotelian Society 
during the thirty-sixth session, 1914-5, have been 
gathered into a volume which is issued by Messrs. 
Williams & Norgate of London. Following the ini- 
tial essay on " Science and Philosophy " by Dr. 
Bernard Bosanquet are several papers by members 
of the Society on related subjects. They include: 
" Notes on Berkeley's Doctrine," by Professor C. 
Lloyd Morgan ; " Conflicting Social Obligations," 
by Mr. G. D. H. Cole; " The < ^Esthetic' of Bene- 
detto Croce," by Mr. Albert A. Cock; "The 
Philosophy of Values," by Dr. Tudor Jones; " Phe- 
nomenalism," by Mr. C. D. Broad ; " Mr. Russell's 
Theory of Judgment," by Professor G. F. Stout; 
" The Philosophy of Maine de Biran," by Professor 
Arthur Robinson ; " Complexity and Synthesis," 
by Mrs. Adrian Stephen ; and " Some Theories of 
Knowledge," by Dr. F. Aveling. 

The " Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of 
Biography and Mythology" (Lippincott), edited 
by Dr. Joseph Thomas, has now after twenty years 
of usefulness passed into a fourth edition. Its 
merits as a standard work of reference have long 
been recognized. The publishers announce that it 
has been thoroughly revised; yet tested in the field 
of modern literature the following curiosities, 
among many others, have been disclosed: Booth 
Tarkington (American) is represented as having 
written nothing later than 1909 ; John Galsworthy 
(English), no mention; H. G. Wells (English), a 
list of his novels up to 1908 " and many others," 
together with the misleading statement that his 
novels are highly imaginative in character; Selma 
Lagerlb'f (Swedish), inadequate mention and name 
misspelled; Herman Sudermann (German), men- 
tion of one work only, a drama, followed by the 
worthless, space-filling tag (dear to every reviser or 
hack writer of encyclopaedias) "his novels were 
widely read"; Remain Rolland (French), Emile 
Verhaeren (Belgian), Anton Tchekhoff (Russian), 
no mention. Let us hope we have stumbled upon the 
weakest link in the chain. In fact, we are con- 
vinced that we have, upon turning to the brief but 
thoroughly adequate account of President Wilson, 
which even includes a reference to his policies of 
" watchful waiting " and " strict neutrality." 



NOTES.

translated and edited by Dr. Louise R. Loomis, 
promised for early issue by the Columbia Uni- 
versity Press, will form the second volume in the 
series, "Records of Civilization." 

In Professor Kuno Francke's " The German 
Spirit," which Messrs. Holt announce, the author 
endeavors to present a view of contemporary Ger- 
many which may help Americans to understand 
German achievements and aspirations. 

A new book by Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson will 
shortly be published under the title, " The Euro- 
pean Anarchy." In it the author discusses the 
underlying causes of the war and the possibilities 
of a movement toward better things in the future.

A two- volume translation of Treitschke's " Poli- 
tics " will shortly be issued by the Macmillan Co. 
The Right Honorable Arthur James Balfour has 
prepared an Introduction to this important work, 
which will contribute to an understanding of Ger- 
man philosophy and the German attitude of mind. 

The official biography of William McKinley, 
prepared by Mr. Charles S. Olcott, is one of the 
interesting spring announcements of Messrs. 
Houghton Mifflin Co. The volume presents a com- 
plete record of the late president's achievements, 
and gives an intimate view of his private and offi- 
cial life. 

Two volumes of letters and reminiscences of 
Alfred Russel Wallace, by Mr. James Marchant, 
are to be published during the spring. The author 
knew Wallace personally, and bases his work on 
the intimate recollections of his family and friends, 
as well as upon a mass of unpublished corre- 
spondence. 

" Cicero: A Sketch of His Life and Works," by 
Mr. Hannis Taylor, will be one of the spring pub- 
lications of Messrs. McClurg. The work consists 
in the main of a commentary on the Roman Con- 
stitution and Roman public life, supplemented by 
the sayings of Cicero, arranged for the first time 
as an anthology. 

" War and Society," by Professor Edward B. 
Krehbiel, will soon be ready for publication. The 
volume is designed as an introduction to the 
study of the whole anti-war movement, and is for 
the use of college classes, international polity clubs, 
peace study clubs, women's clubs, and all who wish 
to familiarize themselves with the subject. 

In "A Wiltshire Parson and His Friends," 
which Messrs. Houghton will soon publish, Mr. 
Garland Greever has brought together a large 
body of unpublished correspondence between Cole- 
ridge and the poet Bowles and other well known 
characters of the time. The book promises to be 
one of the most important literary contributions 
of the season. 

Among the topics discussed in Mr. H. G. Wells's 
forthcoming volume entitled " What Is Coming : 
A Forecast of Things after the War," are the pos- 
sibilities of a World State; " Will Peace be Per- ; 
manentf"; "How will mankind stand towards ; 
each other?"; "What will be the position of | 
female suffrage ? " ; and " Will the British Empire 
remain intact?" 

A variorum edition (the first to be attempted) of 
Shakespeare's Sonnets has been made by Mr. Ray- 
mond Macdonald Alden, and will appear next : 
month with the Houghton Mifflin Co.'s imprint. ! 
The text of the quarto of 1609 is printed verbatim 
et literatim, and each sonnet is followed by the j 
variant readings of the most authoritative editions 
and by interpretive notes from the leading com- 
mentators. A full bibliography will be included. 

The expansion of the Russian Empire and after- 
the-war problems will be discussed in Mr. Stephen 
Graham's new book announced under the title, 
" Through Russian Central Asia." Mr. Graham 
was in the heart of Asiatic Russia among the 



Altai Mountains when the first news of the war 
reached him, having journeyed thence from the 
Caucasus by way of the Caspian Sea, Bokhara, 
and the Persian frontier, and the borderland 
between Mongolia and Siberia. 

The new volume of Mr. Bernard Shaw's plays, 
to be issued shortly, will contain "Androcles and 
the Lion," " Overruled," and " Pygmalion." Fol- 
lowing his usual practice, Mr. Shaw has supplied 
to this volume a preface occupying over a hun- 
dred pages, which is entitled "Why Not Give 
Christianity a Trial?" "Pygmalion" is printed 
with a sequel, in which the author, changing the 
dramatic form to that of ordinary prose narrative, 
continues the history of the persons of the drama. 

" Vision and Vesture : A Study of William 
Blake in Modern Thought," by Mr. Charles Gard- 
ner, is announced for spring issue. It discusses 
the question whether modern thought is inspired 
by Blake's teaching, or whether Blake was so much 
ahead of his time that he surpassed at one leap 
" the false dilemmas of the nineteenth century and 
began at those conclusions which are our new 
beginning in the twentieth." In this connection 
the author considers Ibsen, Nietzsche, Strindberg, 
and .other thinkers who have been directly influ- 
enced by Blake, and the lessons which he teaches 
for the world of to-day. 

The Ontario Library Association's annual book- 
list ("A Selected List of Books") for 1915 is in 
two parts, though each part covers the whole liter- 
ary field as mapped out by Mr. Dewey. Part one 
is sub-titled, " Selections from the Books of 1915," 
but part two calls itself " Selections from the 
Books of the First Half of 1915." A hasty exam- 
ination leads one to infer that neither section con- 
cerns itself with the later publications of 1915, 
these doubtless being reserved for future treatment. 
Small libraries especially will find these lists use- 
ful. They are issued by the Department of Educa- 
tion of the Province of Ontario. 

Dr. James Mercer Garnett, former president of 
St. John's College, Annapolis, Md., and an occa- 
sional contributor to THE DIAL for the past ten 
years or more, died at his home in Baltimore 
on February 18. He was born at Aldie, Va., in 
1840, and was graduated from the University of 
Virginia. Dr. Garnett served with the Confed- 
erate army during the Civil War, part of the time 
as a captain of artillery. During 1869-70, he stud- 
ied in Berlin and Leipsic, and in 1870 was ap- 
pointed president of St. John's, which post he 
occupied for ten years. Following this, he taught 
at the University of Virginia and the Woman's 
College in Baltimore. He was a former President 
of the American Philological Association and also 
of the Dialect Society, and Vice President of the 
Modern Language Association. 

Two important contributions to the literature of 
mysticism are soon to appear with the Dent- 
Dutton imprint. " The Book of St. Bernard on 
the Love of God" has been edited and translated 
by Dr. Edmund G. Gardner, who also includes the 
Latin text, an introduction on the doctrine of 
love in mediaeval mysticism, and critical and ex-

planatory notes. The translation is the first into 
English of one of the earliest works of St. Ber- 
nard, written before the political and religious 
controversies of his later years. The other book 
is a collection of the fourteenth century mystical 
works of Jan Van Ruysbroek, translated from the 
original Flemish by C. A. Wynschenk Dom. Only 
one of Ruysbroek's works has hitherto been ren- 
dered into English. The forthcoming volume will 
contain " The Adornment of the Spiritual Mar- 
riage," "The Book of Truth," and "The Sparkling 
Stone." 

Mrs. Sarah Kuowles Bolton, author of the 
" Famous Men and Women " series and numerous 
other books that have attained wide popularity, 
died at her home in Cleveland, Ohio, on February 
21. She was born at Farmington, Conn., in 1841, 
and was educated at the Pratt Street Seminary, 
established by Catherine E. Beecher in 1823. Her 
first published book, a collection of poems enti- 
tled " Orlean Lamar," appeared in 1864. Some 
thirty volumes, mainly biographical in character, 
but including also poetry and fiction, have since 
followed from her pen. "From 1878 to 1881, Mrs. 
Bolton was associate editor of " The Congrega- 
tionalist " ; and the following two years she spent 
in Europe, studying the higher education of women 
and social service movements. She was an active 
and devoted worker in the temperance cause. From 
1907 until her death she served as Vice President 
of the American Humane Education Society. Mrs. 
Bolton's surviving son, Mr. Charles Knowles Bol- 
ton, is librarian of the Boston Athenaeum.

\yRITERS-professional or amateur like THE 
f EDITOR, the fortnightly Journal of Infor- 
mation for Literary Workers. THE EDITOR is 
now in its 22nd consecutive year of publication. 
17ROM the days when Jack London, Mary Rob- 
erts Rinehart, Peter Clark Macfarlane, Albert 
Bigelow Paine, etc., were unknown aspirants, writ- 
ers have made THE EDITOR a great exchange 
through which they have transferred to one an- 
other the results of their valuable experiences. 
V/f ARY Roberts Rinehart has said: "THE 
EDITOR helped to start me, cheered me 
when I was down, and led me in the straight path 
until I was able to walk alone." 
JACK London has said: "The first number of 
* THE EDITOR I read aroused in me a great 
regret for all my blind waste of .energy. I may 
not tell a hundredth part of what I learned from 
THE EDITOR, but I may say that it taught me 
how to solve the stamp and landlady problems." 

IN addition to practical, inspiriting articles on artistic and 
business phases of the art-trade of writing, THE 
EDITOR prints each fortnight news of markets for all kinds 
of literary material. 

UP-TO-DATE news of photoplay markets and of oppor- 
tunities to sell post-card, second serial and other rights 
of already published manuscripts is a feature. 

THE regular departments are "The Literary Market," 
' The Experience Exchange," "The Rhetorical Corner," 
"The Plot and Idea Forum," " Questions and Answers," and 
"Considered Trifles." 

NO writer can afford to be without the pleasant, inspiring 
and profitable fortnightly visits of THE EDITOR.

TRUE Facsimiles from Originals in the Department of Manuscripts, 
British Museum, of Royal, Historic and Diplomatic Documents, 
State and Secret Papers, Letters and Autographs of Kings and Queens, 
Princes, Statesmen, Generals and World-Famous Litterateurs; With 
Descriptions, Translations, References and Editorial Notes, By GEORGE 
F. WARNER, M.A., ASSISTANT KEEPER OF MANUSCRIPTS BRITISH MU- 
SEUM, LONDON, ENGLAND. 

" The Most Valuable Collection of Historical and 
Literary Manuscripts Ever Issued" 

The Manuscripts show the hand-writing, erasures, interlineations and signatures 
an exact facsimile in each case, and in every sense equal to the originals. They are one 
of the greatest curiosities of the age, and the most uncommon and original collection of 
State and literary archives in the world. 

Each of the three portfolios is n x 17 inches. The covers are printed on heavy 
rough paper in two colors: black and red. The first portfolio contains a beautiful 
parchment title-page (to be used in a permanent binding), illuminated in red, gold and 
black. The manuscripts themselves are printed on antique stock in black ink over a 
buff-tinted background, which gives a very realistic antique look. Each manuscript is 
preceded by a title-page giving the title, editorial notes, references, etc., and each portfolio 
contains an index or list of manuscripts as follows :

By MORRIS JASTROW, Jr., Ph.D., LL.D. 

University of Pennsylvania 

Jl 'it A a map and 164 illustrations. Octavo, $6 net. 

Prof. Morris Jastrow. Jr., has devoted his career to the 
study of the ancient Orient, and authorizes us to say that 
this book represents, in a measure, a summary of his life's 
work. Under his guidance readers will be able to follow 
the course taken by the remarkable civilization that ex- 
tended its influence through the entire ancient world. It 
is a comprehensive and complete survey of the subject, of 
deep interest to the general reader, the historian, anthro- 
pologist, and sociologist. The pictures show every aspect 
of this civilization, which alone disputes that of Egypt to 
being the oldest of the world. For bible scholars the com- 
parisons with Hebrew traditions and records will have 
intense interest.

Late editor of THE DIAL 

Compiler of "Bugle Echoes," "Golden 
Poems," etc. 

I2. z With Portraits. $1.75 net. 

The original edition of this book was 
published about twenty years after Lincoln's 
death, and has continued to attract atten- 
tion among the growing circle of Lincoln's 
admirers. 

This book brings Lincoln the man, not 
Lincoln the tradition, very near to us. It 
embodies the reminiscences of over five hun- 
dred contemporaries and friends of Lincoln

A BOOKLOVER'S 

HOLIDAYS IN THE OPEN 

From a cougar hunt on the rim of the Grand Canyon to the washing of the sacred snakes in a Hopi 
underground temple such is the scope of this book. There is a study of primitive man in three con- 
tinents and his association with the horse, the lion and the elephant. There is a chapter on the wild 
hunting companions with whom the author has associated in his wanderings. And there is a chapter 
on the books which have been his companions. 

The book holds together as a splendid expression of Colonel Roosevelt as a naturalist, a lover of and 
adventurer in strange countries, and a man of letters all infused with his marvelous appreciation of 
the best books that have been written.

The End of a Chapter 

By SHANE LESLIE 

This book, by a brilliant young graduate of Cambridge, 
with wide and interesting connections both in Ireland 
and England, is a notable contribution to the memoir 
literature of his generation. The conception, which came 
to him naturally with his view of the great convulsion 
which drew him at once into service at the front, is indi- 
cated in his title. He felt with countless others that he 
was living "at the end of a chapter in history."

This book, by the dean of the diplomatic corps, is a

Which Encyclopaedia Do You Use The Most? 

The following- impromptu answers, taken down secretly, are verbatim : 

" The ' Everyman.' Because it's lighter, and things are under their garden names. 
I always find things there. I never drag out those other dusty old things. In the 
Everyman you get what you want in a minute without having to read through a lot. 

I don't say that it's better than the but it's a lot more useful for people 

that haven't ' library time.' " 

" For what I need I go to the ' Everyman.' I don't think I've ever opened a larger 
one since I've been here. Not for any very scientific reason. Just because it's con- 
venient. And I usually find what I want in it." 

" The ' Everyman.' Because it's so convenient." 

" Oh, I use the little Button one. Things are all together. You don't have to 
look along a whole line of big volumes and get a derrick to take them down." 

"The 'Everyman.' Because it's brief and compact, and in an office of this kind 
you don't want to sit down and read all the afternopn to find a fact." 

None of those interrogated knew they were "speaking for publication." Their 
opinions were entirely unbiased and no dissenting opinion has been omitted. 

Each volume contains 640 pages, 1,200 illustrations in all. 

In cloth, $6; reinforced cloth (especially recommended), $S; full leather, $10; 
quarter pigskin, $12. 

The entire twelve volumes occupy about one foot of shelf room.

Having established the status of the child in what is called "the 
prehistoric period," the author shows the successive steps which 
have been taken since the days of Tyre to the founding of child- 
welfare societies. The result is a faultless background for all 
literature on child-welfare. 

The author of "The Life of Abelard," "Life of St. Augustine," etc., 
presents a striking and absorbing study of the careers of twenty 
famous Popes, who were important in the development of the 
church and history of the world. 

A lucid and lively narrative of events from the death of Louis XL 
in 1483 to that of Henri IV. in 1610. The author's sketches of 
Louis XL, Georges d'Amboise, Francois I., Henry II., Diane de 
Poitiers, Henry IV., Queen Margot and others touch the imagina- 
tion and linger in the memory. 

The author here rounds out the delightful series covering the per- 
sonal and public life of the "Good Queen," which began with "The 
Early Court of Queen Victoria" and followed through "The Married 
Life of Queen Victoria." The author is particularly happy in giving 
a vivid picture to the reader not only of the Queen herself, but of 
those constantly surrounding her. 

This book brings together in one volume the most distinctive poems 
of English writers during the lyric years 1913-1915. The present 
volume supplements another containing the representative poems of 
the years 1912-1913, and gives the general reader, who has not the 
inclination to stray far afield, the choicest cullings of the con- 
temporary muse. 

"A stupendous literary undertaking. The entire history should 
appeal to the general reader no less than to the student, presenting 
an accurate, impersonal, and well-balanced study of the development 
of the English language and literature from its earliest originals 
to the close of the Victorian age." Chicago Record-Herald. 

The ( Sayings of the Master and His Disciples upon the Conduct 
of "The Superior Man," with a foreword by Wu Ting Fang. A 
carefully translated compilation of the sayings of the great master 
and his disciples, which show him to be "the incarnation of common 
sense and clear intelligence." The volume contains the gist of his 
main teachings.

Earlier editions traced European events from the Franco- Prussian 
\\~ar to their status in 1900. This edition in three supplementary 
chapters traces the developments that in the subsequent decade and 
a half kept Europe in a state of agitation and culminated in the 
present war. 



The leading idea throughout this volume is that the political situ- 
ation, especially with reference to foreign affairs, has so completely 
changed in the last generation, that the old ideas of the State will 
have to be corrected, particularly recognizing PUBLIC RIGHT. 

This book will be not only of great practical importance as a guide 
to future work of the same character, especially in the Tropics, but 
also of permanent historic value. Mr. Le Prince was for ten years 
Chief Sanitary Inspector of the Zone. 

The account of a biolgical expedition, during the months of May 
and June, 1914, under the joint auspices of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution and the Cuban Government, to Cape San Antonio and the 
Colorados Reefs of northwestern Cuba. 



The most important volume on the subject which has yet been 
published. Adopted at once, on publication as a text book in five 
leading American Universities. Contains special reference to the 
planning of streets and lots. 

More than 2,000 folk sayings translated from more than seventy 
languages and dialects. The volume is not a mere compilation, but 
also a study of proverb lore which shows the real significance of 
the sayings of the people. 

The book contains three noteworthy achievements : first, a visualiza- 
tion of the Art of Painting in convenient perspective; second, a 
segregation of data heretofore widely scattered; third, misleading 
contentions, often false, displaced with sound material, logical con- 
clusions, and vital theories. A book of vital importance to the 
student. 

Gives the reader, be he jeweler or purchaser, the necessary knowl- 
edge to determine the various grades of excellence of diamonds 
to recognize at their proper values such factors as the quality of 
color, the absence of flaws, the skilled cutting, the graceful mount- 
ing, etc. 

Deals with those enigmatical passages of Scripture of which least 
has been written. The author insists that religion is not founded 
upon a creed, or any metaphysical thesis, but upon a law which is 
revealed in the nature of the human soul itself.

BRILLIANT ESSAYS REPRINTED FROM THE DIAL 

INCENSE AND ICONOCLASM: Studies in Literature 

By CHARLES LEONARD MOORE 



"Mr. Charles Leonard Moore is a writer who 
needs no introduction to the readers of this jour- 
nal. For a score of years his nicely weighed and 
admirably judicious essays in miniature upon 
literary topics have been one of our outstanding 
features. Of Mr. Moore's DIAL essays, thirty- 
nine have now been collected into a volume 
entitled 'Incense and Iconoclasm,' and offer as 
many examples of the art of saying a great deal 
within the limits of a narrow space. The 'thirty- 
nine articles' of this literary confession of faith 
touch upon most of the major themes of literary 
criticism, and are notable for their broad views, 
their penetrative sympathy, and their method of 
direct approach to the very hearts of their re- 
spective subjects." The Dial. 



"At once in these essays one feels the Amer- 
ican mind at work with its characteristic direct- 
ness and singleness of eye. . . . Each one is 
packed with ideas so incitingly set forth that they 
arouse quick response of either agreement or 
dissent in the reader's mind. . . . But the author 
knows how so to state his idea, perhaps it is 
because he expresses it so directly and incisively, 
as to make it strike fire of farther thought, no 
matter how much skepticism it encounters. Mr. 
Moore has deep and wide knowledge of English 
literature, and his judgments show insight, appre- 
ciation, and that mental quality, said to be char- 
acteristic of Americans, which we like to call 
level-headedness. And combined with these is 
that fulness of imaginative flavor without which 
just and readable literary criticism is impossible." 
The Bookman. 



"Do you know this last book will put you in the very first rank, if not in the lead, of our critics 
on literature? It is altogether the firmest, broadest, and has the most marching step, so to speak, of 
anything that has appeared, and should bring you honor, especially from students and teachers of 
literature, for no one can read your essays and not be conscious of a new light on the pages of 
the writers whose works and genius you deal with." General Morris S chaff (in a letter to the author).

Gothic Architecture in France, England, and Italy. By Sir Thomas Graham Jackson, R.A., F.S.A. 
With 191 Plates (six in color) and 229 Illustrations in the Text. (From the Cambridge Univer- 
sity Press.) 

This highly artistic and interesting work by the distinguished British architect, Sir Thomas 
Graham Jackson, is in fact a continuation of the author's Byzantine and Romanesque Archi- 
tecture, which The Nation said would take its place among the standard classics of every archi- 
tectural library. Through these two works the author hopes to give the student a consistent 
idea of mediaeval architecture. Incidentally the new volumes deal with the architecture of 
Reims Cathedral and other Gothic work in France and should be of peculiar interest at the 
present time. 

The author has chosen for description such buildings or parts of buildings as are typical 
of the history and development of the art, and for the purposes of illustration has used original 
sketches rather than photographs.

Byzantine and Romanesque Architecture. By Sir Thomas Graham Jackson, R.A., F.S.A. With 
165 Plates and 148 Illustrations. (From the Cambridge Univerity Press.) 

An account of the development in Eastern and Western Europe of post-Roman architecture 
from the fourth to the twelfth century. It attempts not merely to Describe the architecture, but 
to explain it by the social and political history of the time. The description of the churches of 
Constantinople and Salonica, which have a special interest at this time, is followed by an account 
of Italo-Byzantine work at Ravenna and in the Exarchate, and of the Romanesque styles of 
Germany, France, and England. Most of the illustrations are from drawings by either the author 
or his son, and add great artistic value to the volumes.

A Short History of Belgium. By Le"on Van der Essen, Professor of History in the University oj 
Louvain. 

The world-wide interest aroused in the history of Belgium by its present position in the 
great European war makes especially timely the publication of this volume by a professor of his- 
tory _in the University of Louvain. who recently gave a course of lectures on the history of 
Belgium at the University of Chicago. The history is objective and gives simply an account of 
the past history of the Belgian people, leaving entirely out of consideration their present deeds 
and sufferings.

A Short History of Japan. By Ernest Wilson Clement . 

Because of the intense interest in the present political situation in the Far East this short 
history of Japan will make a strong appeal to readers and travelers who are asking for a better 
knowledge of the background of the struggle for supremacy in the Orient. The author, Ernest 
Wilson Clement, whose long residence in Japan as a teacher, interpreter for the United States 
legation, correspondent, and editor has given him a wide familiarity with the country, has writ- 
ten a brief but discriminating account of both Old and New Japan.

GREEN MANSIONS By W. H. Hudson 



Color Jacket 

Introduction by John Galsworthy, who says of this delightful South American 
Romance : " For of all living authors now that Tolstoi has gone I could least dispense 
with W. H. Hudson. . . . ' GREEN MANSIONS,' a story which immortalizes, I think 
as passionate a love of all beautiful things as ever was in the heart of man. . . . 
In form and spirit the book is unique, a simple romantic narrative transmuted by sheer 
glow of beauty into a prose poem. ... I would that every man, woman and child in 
England were made to read him; and I would that you in America would take him to 
heart. ... As a simple narrator he is well-nigh unsurpassed, as a stylist he has few, 
if any living equals."

GOLDEN 
WOMAN 



R1DGWELL 
C U L LU M 

Strength dominates every page of this 
great story. In Cullum's inimitable por- 
trayal of the primitive American west, in 
his descriptions of the lawless Montana 
mining camp, in the manner he tells of a 
love stronger than disaster, the touch of 
the master is evident. You will like "The 
Golden Woman" as much for its human- 
ness and realism as for its thrills. For it 
has thrills, plenty of them, as it unfolds the 
experiences of Joan Stanmore, who flees to 
the hills of Montana to escape a curse 
which followed her with tragic persistence.

About Miss Mattie Morningglory 




By Lilian Bell 

Author of " The Love Affairs of An Old Maid," 
" The Expatriates," " Hope Loring," " Carolina 
Lee," etc., etc. 

" About Miss Mattie Morningglory " will be eagerly read 
by all lovers of wholesome fiction. 

It is one of the sweetest love stories ever told, fairly 
teeming with humor and pathos. Miss Bell has woven a 
charming narrative about a warm-hearted, impulsive little 
milliner, whose first affections are centered on a worthless 
scamp, who has deceived and robbed her. 

The plot abounds in many delightful surprises, and surely 
nothing could be more entertaining than the Christmas 
shopping of the neighbor women. Here Miss Bell has 
depicted a humorous scene that will make an instant hit 
should the book ever be dramatized. The story unfolds a 
tale of good deeds and good-will to man that will make 
it live forever. 12mo. Cloth. Net $1.35 



"I Conquered*' 

By Harold Titus 

This is a rousing story of the new West; of a real man's 
awakening to the fact that his crop of wild oats was a bit too 
vigorous; of his determination to throw off the hold of city 
habits and readjust himself by life in the open. 

There is so much red blood in the characters that it is impos- 
sible to withhold interest in their every action, while the story 
of the horse, " Captain," a wonderful free-runner of the plains, 
is absolutely enthralling.

Little Phil and his quaint sayings would furnish material for

most delightful and whimsical children in fiction, worthy of a

of a type of mind which, from the founder of 
Mormonism down, has played a prominent part 
in our social life. The "god" is the pro- 
tagonist of the story; Nancy, his deserted 
wife, is the heroine; and she and Squire 
Braile, a mocker as courageous as he is wise 
and humorous, are two of the most beautiful 
and memorable figures of modern fiction. 

Among the other characters are a perfectly 
real and delightful boy; Abel and Sally Rev- 
erdy, a pair of good-natured, shiftless bor- 
rowers it is impossible not to like ; David 
Gillespie, hard and just and splendid ; and 
Jane, his red-haired, blue-eyed daughter, of 
few words, almost ferocious in her loves and 
hates. 

From first to last the narrative is direct and 
moving, quick with sentiment and mellow with 
gracious, kindly humor. The background is a 
forest only slightly cut by the settlers a still, 
huge, live thing which the reader feels in 
every line of the book. 
The novel is an accurate and intensely mov- 
ing reproduction of pioneer Western life, a 
dramatization for to-day of the men and 
women of yesterday who were making Amer- 
ica, a moving narrative of characters mo- 
tivated by powerful, elemental emotions, and 
an index of the growth of America's foremost 
literary figure.

cess of These Books 

GLASGOW 

"Life and Gabriella" 

THE NEW YORK SUN: 

"It is one of Miss Glasgow's great novels; it stands out 
as a fine and capable achievement. There is no doubt 
that with her fine historic sense, her faithful realism, her 
infectious humor, her gentle irony, she will rank as one 
of the first great American novelists." 
THE NEW YORK TIMES: 

"The book is exceedingly well written; it has humor and 
pathos, reality, an exceptional insight into character, and a 
brave and inspiring philosophy of life. It sets a very high 
standard for the novels of 1916; those that measure up to 
it will be notable ones indeed." 
THE NEW YORK EVENING POST: 

"In 'Life and Gabriella' the central conception is unique, 
and it is one of great strength."

TRUDEAU 

"An Autobiography" 

By EDWARD LIVINGSTON TRUDEAU, M.D. 

Pioneer in the Open-Air Treatment of Tuberculosis 

NEW YORK SUN: 

"An absorbingly interesting revelation of a remarkable

THE DIAL: 

"Rich in human interest. If the life-story of such a 
man, with its interspersed commentary on the significant 
occurrences in that life, is not well worth reading, where 
shall we find a book that is?" 
THE PHILADELPHIA EVENING TELEGRAPH: 

"A record of magnificent unselfishness that cannot fail to 
inspire thousands." 

2nd printing. Illustrated. Net, $2.00. 

CONRAD 

"Within the Tides" 

THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS: 

"These stories are the finest of their kind offered today; 
Conrad is the supreme story-teller of this generation." 
THE NEW YORK SUN: 

"Another volume of four enthralling tales. These stories 
stand far above any other short stories now being produced. 
The supreme greatness seems to lie in the profound con- 
ception of character, the beauty, restraint and accuracy of 
expression, that give Conrad the power to set forth 
passion as did Sappho in the second fragment, and to tell 
a tale of horror and pity such as the Greek tragedians 
might have told." 

4th printing. Net, $1.35; leather, net, $1.50.

"The present-day discussion of the question of the 
liability of Trade Unions is hampered by the constant and 
unwarranted implication that liability on the part of the 
principals and employers for the wrongful acts of those 
who are employed by them is a sort of natural law. . . . 
It has therefore been thought well to examine with some 
care the history and limits of the doctrine thus elevated 
to the pedestal of an axiom." From the Preface.

LIST OF NEW BOOKS . 301 



The death of Henry James takes from the 
literature of our time one of its chief figures. 
A generation ago, when that great movement 
in favor of seriousness and sincerity called 
" realism " was at its height, James was one 
of the most able and most representative lead- 
ers. He stood for the aims of dozens of the 
younger writers, for the interests of thou- 
sands of readers. Then came that change in 
sentiment which followed the earlier work of 
Stevenson; then came Kipling, Conan Doyle, 
Anthony Hope, and how many others ; every- 
one delighted in stories of adventure, of mys- 
tery, of romance, indeed of all sorts of excite- 
ment and extravagance. The earlier stories 
were left on one side under the name of 
' ' psychology ' ' ; even fine things of the day, 
like Hardy's " Jude the Obscure," and the 
books of George Gissing and George Moore, 
were " repulsive and depressing." James was 
acknowledged a master, but other masters 
were more alluring. Then that enthusiasm 
waned ; people began to recover themselves as 
though getting home from some delightful 
summer holiday ; the charms of Zenda-stories 
I and of Sherlock Holmes paled and were left 
to the popular magazines. Arnold Bennett 
turned from his fantastic imaginations and 
wrote " The Old Wives' Tale "; Mr. Wells 
turned from his wonderlands of pseudo-science 
and wrote " Tono-Bungay. " Once more peo- 
ple could find interest in the familiar circum- 
stances of every day. A host of younger men 
sprung up, looking at current life with a fresh 
but penetrating eye. Then it appeared that 
Henry James was still the master that he had 
always been, that his eye for life was as 
keen and, in spite of his three-score years, as 
fresh as in earlier days. He could do (as he 
; always had done) what everybody else was 
now trying to do. There was no one who stood 
as he did among the younger spirits of the 
day. 

This is a fine and an extraordinary career, 
and if we have any sense of regret at the de- 
parture of Henry James, it is because he did 
not himself do what he doubtless had in mind 
and review his own artistic career in its rela-

tion to the artistic history of its time. The 
two volumes of his autobiography carried his 
revaluation of his own life to the point where 
he was just making his beginnings in what the 
world thinks of as his life. But from that 
point, though in his recent prefaces he offered 
many remarks and notes, he never gave a gen- 
eral estimate of what he knew he had at- 
tempted and felt he had done. 

Yet, however it might seem to himself, it 
was plain to all that James was from the very 
beginning a master in his art, that he had gone 
directly on in the path that his genius had 
made clear to him in spite of the ebbs and 
flows of popular sentiment, that he was at the 
end of his life a greater figure even than in 
those early days when he was felt to be so 
absolutely fine. He had stood always for the 
same thing, and the currents of the time had 
turned away from him and run off in various 
directions, and then had turned to the older 
ways again, and there had found him going on 
ahead as he had been all the time while other 
people had been making a long detour. When 
people began to realize him again, however, 
they began to realize that he was not the 
Henry James whom they had known. It 
might have been that he had changed, it 
might have been that they had changed; 
however it was, many of the earlier admirers 
of Henry James could not endure his later 
works, and most of the admirers of his later 
works felt that his earlier writing was a little 
slight or thin. 

There was undoubtedly a change, and it 
would have been strange had there not been. 
The point of interest was, What was the dif- 
ference ? Was it for better or for worse ? 

Many felt the difference chiefly as it showed 
itself in the matter of style, in the form of 
the language, in the way in which James put 
in words what he wished to say. The latter 
James was " obscure." This was obviously 
the case; indeed, it has been the case with 
a good many men, with Walter Pater, for 
instance, and with Robert Browning. In the 
effort to make the written word more exactly 
express the movement, often very subtle and 
growing more subtle with years, of the flow- 
ing thought, men will sometimes become ob- 
scure even to those who are used to their 
earlier writing and their earlier thought. 

But this was not the only thing in James's 
case. There was a difference, a complication, 
not merely in his expression but in his way 



of looking at things. That, too, is often the 
way with an artist, and that has been so in 
a large way with the recent development of 
almost every art. In the music, painting, 
poetry of to-day the technique of any artist 
is likely to be more complicated (and so, to 
many, more obscure) than the technique of 
half a century ago. It was so with James both 
because of his own change in artistic feeling 
and because of the time in which he lived. 
His earlier work say, ' ' The American ' ' 
was refined, but it was and was meant to be 
clear. But his later work was often not meant 
to be clear ; in fact, it was deliberately meant 
to be not clear, meant to be something else, 
something that James (whatever we may like) 
liked better than clearness. Along in the 
nineties his work takes on a quality something 
like that which he at one time noted in the 
plays of Maeterlinck, there was an aspect as 
of twilight in the scene, a feeling almost as 
of dusk, which reminds one of the delicate, 
often thrilling, coloration that musicians see 
in the work of Maeterlinck's contemporary 
Debussy, or indeed of the atmospheric vibra- 
tion (not clear even in its brilliancy) in the 
landscapes of Claude Monet. In each case 
the technical means was the same, namely, 
an addition of notes, of details not called for 
by the definite outlines of the idea, indeed 
often not in harmony with them, making a 
" richness " of effect as it was sometimes 
called, which had its quality, but certainly was 
not clear. 

But these things, often felt or mentioned, 
were not everything, and if they had been 
would have left us far more in doubt as to 
the true position and value of the work of 
Henry James than we need be now. These 
things are technical, even mechanical one is 
tempted to think; and however they may 
make us feel as to Henry James as an artist, 
they could hardly have added to our feeling 
for his general value as a great novelist. 
People, artists as others, do think and feel in 
such and such a way, doubtless, but in such 
matters as those we have been speaking of 
there will always exist in many minds a doubt 
as to whether that way is good, whether it is 
really artistic, or often whether the thing said 
is worth the trouble of such saying, or worth 
one's trying to appreciate such complications. 

The real thing was evidently not there, 
indeed evidently could not be there, for where 
thought and expression of thought are so

closely related as in the work of a man like 
Henry James, there can never be a question of 
style alone, unless in the case of minor man- 
nerisms, which he certainly had like many 
lesser men, or indeed more than they. 

No, the thing was deeper, and in the way 
it showed itself was often felt. It was not 
merely that his sentences were complicated, 
his art complex. It was often said that James 
seemed to make it his aim not to mention the 
matter of main importance which he appar- 
ently set out to speak of. If it were a story, 
he did not tell it; if it were a situation, he 
did not say what it was ; if it were an atmos- 
phere, he did not describe it. He seemed to 
take for granted the very thing one would 
have thought he meant to say. This was 
something many noticed, and it was explained 
in various ways. It evidently lay deep in 
James's manner of thought, in his way of 
looking at life. 

Why not say clearly and definitely what is 
the most important thing? Why, indeed? 
Who, we may ask, ever does, or ever can in 
life? 

There are two ways of thinking of the 
things of this life, and all of us think some- 
times in one way, sometimes in the other. 
Sometimes we think of life as made up of a 
vast number of particular beings who with 
their combinations and relations are all that 
there is to think of. There may be super- 
natural beings, but as far as this world is 
concerned it consists of all sorts of individ- 
uals, people, animals, stones, cells, electrons, 
and whatever else we may think of, exist- 
ing in all sorts of reactions and associations. 
Such is a common enough view, but common 
also is another. We often think that there is 
a vague something beside all this. We think 
about ourselves that there is something beside 
the grand total of our actions and reactions; 
we think about the combinations of things 
that there is something beside the things com- 
bined ; we think of the relations of one thing 
and another that there is something beside the 
beings related, and the different phases made 
up by their interaction. Myself and your- 
self; family, church, country; love, honor, 
patriotism; these and many other things we 
feel (or at least so we often say) are more 
than " mere words." There is a " some- 
thing " really existent beyond the word. 

Such a statement in a nutshell of two well- 
known ways of thinking (and probably each 



one of us thinks sometimes one way, some- 
times another) is to the point just here be- 
cause it indicates the way James used to think 
in his first books and the way he thought in 
his later books. He used to present what peo- 
ple felt, thought, did, and there was the whole 
thing. But in his later years he had come to 
feel that in addition to whatever people felt, 
thought, and did, there was something beyond, 
and that this something was quite as real as 
anything else, indeed more real, and so more 
important. 

If you get that point of view you can read 
his last novels. Many who read them felt that 
they were but infinitely refined and subtle 
divagations about things not worth talking 
about. But looked at otherwise, viewed as 
attempts at making us feel the reality of 
much that can never be given directly, they 
were most impressive renderings of life. Take 
" The Golden Bowl," for instance, here we 
have a very intense and poignant story of 
something that occurred in the lives of four 
people. Yet the real thing is never absolutely 
told; it seems as though it never could be 
told. Everybody seems to take it for granted 
as it goes on, and two or three times one or 
another says or does something that makes it 
absolutely clear as day, or rather as clear as 
though lit by a flash of lightning. But it is 
never told ; it is there, conditioning or mould- 
ing or making every act, every word, just what 
it is, but it is never told. People may not like 
that sort of thing, but after all that is like 
life itself as we know it, so like life itself 
that the book as one reads it seems the veriest 
transcript, and after one reads it the most 
consummate achievement. 

To do this sort of thing may or may not 
be great art, but it is certainly to view life 
in a certain manner. And that manner is 
quite different from the way the earlier gen- 
eration viewed life, the generation to which 
Henry James, Jr., belonged. Henry James 
changed, it would seem; he remained in the 
present while his day receded into the past, 
he remained still of to-day while that day be- 
came successively yesterday, the day before 
yesterday, and so on. For our day, our 
" now " is very different from that earlier 
period and mode of art. Henry James moved 
on ahead, not following the ideas of his times, 
but aware of them and keeping well on in the 
lead. New notions and new fashions appeared 
and disappeared ; he continued in his course.

And in time people got back to his line, and 
then they found him well in advance. He 
had gone forward with other great minds of 
the time while we had been amusing our- 
selves. 

That was certainly a great thing to do, a 
great achievement. Few men of our time 
have done anything like it. 

EDWARD E. HALE. 



THE ACADEMIC CONSCIOUSNESS. 



From the interesting collection of neglected 
commonplaces which modern enlightenment 
cherishes in theory and disregards in practice 
may be selected apt texts for public reminder. 
The pertinent one * for the occasion is that 
professions must determine their standards 
from within and be responsible for the temper 
and conditions of service; of such origin is 
esprit de corps. The "American Association 
of University Professors" has been referred to 
(commonly by administrative officials of aca- 
demic institutions) as the "Professors' 
Union"; the jibe may be transformed into a 
compliment. A growing academic conscious- 
ness is responsible for the organization. The 
saving remnant of the esprit survives in the 
sensitiveness of professors to any encroach- 
ment upon "academic freedom," to any limi- 
tation of speech or professional activity. The 
scholar must be free to think and speak and 
act by precept and example. Gagging is out 
of fashion; but tethering is still regarded as 
a useful device to check excursions into "un- 
desirable" domains. The document defining 
the professors' conception of "academic free- 
dom and academic tenure" is a notable one; 
as a bill of rights, it promises to acquire his- 
toric importance. It sets forth the danger 
that inheres in any suspicion that "college 
and university teachers in general are a re- 
pressed and intimidated class, who dare not 
speak with that candor and courage which 
youth always demands in those whom it is to 
esteem." It emphasizes that the professor, 
although "with respect to certain external 
conditions of his vocation, [he] accepts a re- 
sponsibility to the authorities of the institu- 
tion in which he serves, in the essentials of 
his professional activity his duty is to the 
wider public to which the institution itself is 
morally amenable." The professor's opinions 
must be the "uncolored product of his own 
study or that of his fellow specialists" ; "they 
should be conclusions gained by a scholar's

Freedom and Academic Tenure " issued by The American 
Association of University Professors. December, 1915. 



methods and held in a scholar's spirit"; and 
more particularly these opinions should not 
be "echoes of opinion of the lay public or of 
the individuals who endow or manage univer- 
sities. ' ' 

The public learns of "academic freedom" 
when a professor loses his place, and the issue 
is unpleasantly entangled with the conflict of 
opinion and action between the scholar and 
the more or less private interests of those 
responsible for the action. In such issues, 
with commendable vigor and unreserve, the 
academic consciousness protests, and in recent 
years protests to a purpose. High-handed 
overriding of these unwritten rights is no 
longer in favor; though from time to time, 
under stress of private or political interests, 
it is bound to occur. As a rule, the " in- 
terests " act more discreetly, and affect 
opinion that is on its way to affect appropria- 
tions or endowments. It is eminently proper 
that the first pronouncement of the "Ameri- 
can Association of University Professors" 
should furnish an authoritative statement of 
the rights and responsibilities of the profes- 
sion in this aspect of its public service. Vital 
as this issue is, it is but part of a principle 
of wider scope. The true source of grievance 
is this: that it is "unsuitable to the dignity 
of a great profession that the initial respon- 
sibility for the maintenance of its professional 
standards should not be in the hands of its 
own members." 

When the academic consciousness is fully 
awakened, it will proceed to the completion 
of its programme, and to the removal of the 
restrictions that beset the University career. 
Freedom of speech and security of tenure 
represent the first steps; the professor's fit- 
ness is to be judged and his advance deter- 
mined by the judgment of his peers. The 
demand is explicitly made that his removal 
from office shall follow only upon the verdict 
of his professional associates. The same logic 
requires that his election to office shall depend 
likewise upon a professional verdict : and such 
a step has a far wider bearing than appears. 
For in the actual status, the professor's opin- 
ions, labors, and outlook are in danger of 
being determined not merely by the phase of 
control expressed by privately elected trus- 
tees or publicly appointed regents, but more 
intimately and directly by the phase of au- 
thority represented by presidents and deans. 
The immediate sense of accountability may 
not be irksome, while yet it is hampering, and 
in its morale depressing. For, like the more 
obvious pressure from legal control, it is a 
rule imposed from without and not developed 
from within. Deans and presidents are con- 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



263 



spicuously useful officers of institutions of 
learning; but whatever be the source of their 
eonspicuousness, their utility depends entirely 
upon the manner in which their activities 
further the academic welfare of the institu- 
tion. No body of men is as capable to judge 
the value of measures designed to protect and 
advance the intellectual interests as that re- 
grettably unorganized group spoken of as the 
Faculty. It should not be within the power 
of the president to determine whether he 
shall consult the Faculty or ignore it. 

There is but one adequate way in which the 
professional responsibility of the professor can 
be safeguarded; and that is, to place in his 
hands the maintenance of professional stand- 
ards, which implies nothing less than his au- 
thoritative participation in the control of the 
institution upon which his career is intimately 
dependent. Faculties must elect their deans 
and presidents, and not have them imposed 
upon them from without, even though the 
choice would frequently fall upon the same 
men. Faculties must determine what types 
of functions deans and presidents shall 
perform, so that with the leadership of 
their executives they shall express a joint 
wisdom, with a singleness of purpose. These 
steps in the programme may be remote; 
but indications of actual movements in that 
direction are unmistakable. They are taking 
the form of legislation to check the unfor- 
tunate practice that has grown up unduly, 
and divided academic opinion into "adminis- 
trative " and " professorial " factions. The 
administration represents one type of interests 
and one cast of mind ; it establishes a peculiar 
perspective of the desirable and the expedient 
from one end of the opera-glass; while the 
professor (more loyal to optical principles) 
inverts the instrument. The practical conse- 
quence is that the professor (in spite of his 
outlook) thinks one way and votes another; 
and his academic consciousness is dissociated 
more rapidly than it grows together again. 
The attitude of compromise is fatal, not be- 
cause expediency is always tainted, but 
because it makes a sham of responsibility. As 
a fact, the professor is encouraged or in- 
structed or tempted to shift responsibility 
upon the administration, and will continue 
to do so until his official rights make it clear 
to him that, as a member of a respectable 
profession, it is his duty to exercise the duties 
of his calling not merely by professing, but 
by controlling the conditions of his profession. 

The world respects those who respect them- 
selves. The American professor can hardly 
be said to enjoy the social and public esteem 
that attaches to his calling in other lands. 



His services are too commonly thought of in 
clerical fashion; and the consciousness of his 
subordination to higher officials and lay direc- 
tors affects the estimate of his station, and 
subtly weakens the significance of his posi- 
tion and his utterances. For it takes but little 
friction to impede, but a slight roughness to 
dull the edge; not that the professor is a 
sensitive plant, but that freedom is. The 
academic declaration of independence is a 
document yet to be written. It will not be a 
radical one; but it must be as plain and 
outspoken as this preamble upon academic 
freedom, which will bring to many the first 
i intimation that the "American Association of 
University Professors" is an actual consum- 
mation. The professor has become so accus- 
tomed to be trusteed and deaned and 
presidented that his initiative, like his prin- 
ciples, is all tattered and torn. His social 
sense remains; affiliated with his kind, and 
strengthened by reinforcements of encourag- 
ing colleagues, his academic consciousness is 
certain to revive. The "Professors' union" 
is significant as an organized expression of 
the survival, through years of needless ac- 
quiescence in an unreasonable status quo of 
the academic consciousness.

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN PARIS. 



RECENT LOSSES IN FRENCH JOURNALISM. THE 
" REVUE DBS DEUX MONDES " AND ITS MANAGE- 
MENT. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
Since the opening of the year, we have lost 
here in Paris three remarkable journalists 
who were peculiarly interesting from several 
points of view. I refer to Mrs. Emily Craw- 
ford, M. Francis Charmes, and M. Robert 
Mitchell. Of the three, the woman was the 
most picturesque, the most original, and more 
of the modern journalist, though the mention 
of this last characteristic does not mean that 
it is to be considered a special honor ; and in 
certain directions she was unquestionably 
superior intellectually to her male confreres, 
who, however, were men of no ordinary parts. 
| The dissimilarities and the similarities, but 
I especially the former, between these journal- 
ists are worth pointing out, particularly as 
these differences and likenesses were not gen- 
erally commonplace. Though Mrs. Crawford 
spent her whole adult life in Paris and knew 
French exceedingly well, she never caught the 
French accent, and mingled with her spoken 
French a bit of the brogue of her native Ire- 
land, which rendered her conversation as racy

to the ear as it was to the mind. And her 
ways of thought were as foreign to France 
as was her tongue. "With the years, she seemed 
even to grow more British and Irish. But 
Robert Mitchell, though his father was an 
Englishman and his mother a Spaniard, early 
became an out-and-out Frenchman. He fol- 
lowed for a time his profession in London, 
which may account for his good command of 
English, especially spoken English, for he 
quite forgot every thing Spanish, even his 
Spanish relatives; and finally all that was 
left of the foreigner in him was his name, and 
even here it was only his patronymic which 
was not French. " I only wish," he said on 
one occasion, "that my cognomen were as 
French as my praenomen, ' ' and he would add 
that his father once told him that, as the boy 
was born in France and might become a 
Frenchman, a Christian name which was the 
same in both languages was purposely chosen. 
"If I had been baptized Cadwallader, or 
Eliphalet, or Humphrey, or Increase, I would 
promptly have dropped the abomination for 
humble Jean, or Jules, or Jacques." In a 
word, Robert Mitchell was as typically French 
in thought, manner, and even dress, as Mrs. 
Crawford was English in all these respects. 
But the Frenchman was Francis Charmes. 
He was even almost a Frenchman of the old 
school, and remained such to the end, though 
he became a republican, of a moderate type, 
however, a " republicain vague," as a com- 
mon friend put it. He even carried the trait 
into a total ignorance of all the modern lan- 
guages, except the vernacular, and a perfect 
indifference to foreign travel, he who at- 
tained high rank as an official in the French 
Foreign Office, who won the grade of Minister 
Plenipotentiary, and thought for a moment 
of entering the active diplomatic service; he 
who was an acknowledged authority in 
France and beyond its borders on interna- 
tional affairs, and who contributed not a little 
by his pen to mould the foreign relations of 
his own country and of Europe in general. 
And yet the short trips which he very occa- 
sionally made abroad were confined to Aus- 
tria, Belgium, and Italy, and were, his brother 
once told me, "little else than mere pleasure 
tours, ' ' while the only modern tongue, besides 
French, of which he had the slightest smat- 
tering was English, which he could scarcely 
read and which he never ventured to try to 
speak. 

I first met Mrs. Emily Crawford in the 
early summer of 1874. She was then in the 
prime of life, and was already known in the 
newspaper world for her remarkably versa- 
tile qualities. At this time she was associated 



with her husband in all her more important 
journalistic work, and it is to him that she 
owed her best training. In fact, it is impos- 
sible to speak of Emily Crawford's career 
without giving some space to George "W. 
Crawford. He was a man of marked ability. 
He began life as a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, 
where he got to know intimately Thackeray, 
who later took him as the model for George 
Warrington in "Pendennis"; there are, in- 
deed, many close resemblances between the 
pressman of fiction and the pressman of Paris. 
When the London "Daily News" was founded 
by English Liberals as an offset to "The 
Times," from the very start Mr. Crawford 
became its correspondent at the French capi- 
tal, at a time when the newspaper correspond- 
i ent, especially the British, was very different 
from ' ' the bright young man ' ' type of to-day. 
Dickens was his editor-in-chief and his friend. 
But the great novelist soon saw that he was 
not meant for daily journalism, and, while 
retaining a financial interest in the paper, 
retired. But Mr. Crawford remained at his 
post until his own death. Though not a uni- 
versity man, he was more scholarly than many 
a don. He was especially versed in the Latin 
classics. Virgil was his favorite author, and 
he knew by heart whole passages of the chief 
Latin writers. In his closing years, when I 
first made his acquaintance, he had the pecu- 
liar habit of borrowing school books on Latin, 
which he would examine with intense interest 
in order to see if he could discover any new 
rules of grammar or construction. As a young 
man he had also read deeply of Dante and 
Tasso. "I have seen tears fill his eyes," his 
son Robert, also a journalist of ability, once 
said to me, " on reading passages of Shakes- 
peare, so keenly did he feel their beauties. ' ' 

It was with such a husband by her side that 
Emily Crawford finished her newspaper 
schooling, and she so well learned the lessons 
that the venerable teacher was, as so often 
happens, little by little thrown into the shade 
by the bright pupil. "This my mother al- 
ways thought unfair, ' ' her son has said to me 
since her death, " for she would say, ' I owed 
so much to his guidance, as his literary taste 
was unerring and his erudition very great.' 
But I never detected in him a spark of literary 
jealousy of his wife, while she on her side 
valued his style, which was pure and crystal- 
line, scholarly, and free from all 'journalistic 
humbug,' as somebody has said. 'It is too 
good for cheap daily papers, ' my mother used 
to say. ' ' And when Mr. Crawford died, early 
in the eighties, Mrs. Crawford succeeded him 
and represented in Paris "The Daily News" 
until only about ten years ago.

It was no easy task for a man to hold his 
own in the Paris group of Anglo- American 
journalists of those days ; and for a woman to 
do so, with, in addition, three young children 
to care for, was still more remarkable. For 
at that period Laurence Oliphant and de Blo- 
witz stood for "The Times," Eichard White- 
ing for the New York "World," Theodore 
Child was on the staff of "The Daily Tele- 
graph, ' ' William Henry Huntington was here 
for the New York "Tribune," which, by the 
way, Mrs. Crawford represented later; while 
Hely Bowes was the news-gatherer of the old 
London "Standard" when it was a famous 
Conservative organ, Clifford Millage of "The 
Daily Chronicle ' ' ; Emily Blackwell of the 
famous Anglo-American family she was the 
sister-in-law of Lucy Stone and the Rev. An- 
toinette Brown Blackwell, and the sister of 
Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, and, I may add in 
passing, the first professor in journalism of 
Emily Crawford before her marriage, fol- 
lowed by Edward King, the correspondent of 
' ' The Evening Post ' ' ; and last but not least, 
Dr. John Chapman, editor of "The West- 
minster Review," who then made Paris his 
home and who used to enliven our weekly 
correspondents' dinners held in the old Hotel 
Brighton under the arcades of the Rue de 
Rivoli (these gatherings were planned and 
conducted by Whiteing) with anecdotes of 
Mill, George Eliot, ' Louis Blanc, Mazzini, 
Dickens, Herbert Spencer, and a host of other 
celebrities whom he knew during the London 
period of his checkered career. Such were 
the chief figures I may have overlooked 
some of the English and American fourth 
estate at the French capital about the time 
when Emily Crawford took over the respon- 
sible duties of representing here a great Lon- 
don daily. 

In these same days Francis Charmes was 
making his first efforts in Parisian journalism 
in the columns of the venerable "Journal des 
Debats, ' ' which had not then been ousted from 
its leadership among the afternoon papers by 
the "Temps." But it was when he became 
editor of the ' ' Revue des Deux Mondes ' ' that 
M. Charmes attained his highest honors in the 
public press, for his work on this ponderous 
I use the word in its earlier sense periodical 
was largely of a journalistic nature, as he 
always closed each number with a chronique, a 
review of the fortnight's events in the French 
and foreign world of politics and diplomacy. 
And here one saw that Francis Charmes was 
indeed a journalist. When the day came 
round to give the printers the manuscript of 
this chronique, he would arrive rather earlier 
than usual at the office of the "Revue" in the 



Rue de TUniversite, close his door to all visi- 
tors, and, not once leaving his desk, slowly 
but without a stop fill sheet after sheet of 
what was really the leader of that number of 
the periodical ; and when the lunch hour came, 
the copy was ready for the composing-room. 
Though, at the end, he reviewed what he had 
written, so clearly was the whole article fixed 
in his mind before he took up pen that the 
changes made were as slight as they were few. 
In fact, it was materially almost impossible to 
make any, for never have I seen such fine 
writing and the lines so close together as in 
the manuscript of Francis Charmes 's chron- 
ique. It is really a literary curiosity, so 
curious in fact that I once asked him to give 
me one of these manuscripts when it came 
back from the printers. It is written on let- 
ter-size paper, ninety lines to the page and 
some fourteen words to the line, so that each 
written page contains about 1,200 words 
the equivalent of about three printed pages of 
the "Revue." The chirography is clear, 
otherwise no printer would be able to decipher 
it without a magnifying glass ; and even as it 

| is, the strain on the eye is very severe. A 
further oddity in this connection is that in his 
ordinary correspondence M. Charmes 's hand- 

1 writing was like that of everybody as regards 
the size of the letters. I once asked him why 
he wrote his press articles in this peculiar 
fashion, and his answer, which was not ex- 
plicative, was, "Oh, it is a habit." 

The internal affairs of the "Revue des Deux 
Mondes" have always been wrapped in con- 
siderable mystery. However, the capital of 
the periodical consists of eighty-three shares 
of 5,000 francs each, more than a third of 
which is owned by the Buloz family. Their 
value is far greater than the invested capital ; 
and at times, but this is not the case to-day, 
they have paid a dividend greater than this 
capital. The decline in the value of the shares 
is due to several causes, the first being the 
mismanagement of Charles Buloz, the son and 
successor, until 1893, in the editorship of the 
founder, Francois Buloz ; and the second being 
the general tendencj* in France today away 
from review reading. But the broader and 
more modern views of Francis Charmes were 
doing much to revive the material prosperity 
of the periodical. " I am trying to get it back 
where it once was, ' ' he said to me one day. 

Another important factor in the manage- 
ment of the "Revue" is the Committee of 
Surveillance, which represents the share- 
holders, and is composed of M. Paul Leroy- 
Beaulieu, the celebrated political economist 
and member of the Institute, chairman; 
Comte d'Haussonville, of the French Acad-

emy, vice chairman; Mme. Bourget-Pailleron, 
who, I may say, is not related to Paul Bourget, 
but is the daughter of the author of "Le 
Monde ou Ton s'ennuie" and the grand- 
daughter of Frangois Buloz; Vicomte 
d'Avenel, who has travelled in the United 
States and whose first wife, an American, was 
burnt to death in the disaster of the Bazar 
de la Charite; and M. Aubry-Vitet, whose 
family and he himself have long been con- 
nected with the ' ' Revue ' ' as shareholders and 
contributors, a staunch monarchist, whose 
daughter is married to Comte de Rohan- 
Chabot. 

Last month this board voted four to two 
in favor of M. Rene Doumic, of the French 
Academy, as M. Charmes's successor, and at 
the beginning of the present month this nomi- 
nation was confirmed at a general meeting of 
the share-holders. M. Doumic has been the 
regular literary or dramatic critic of the 
"Revue" since 1893, and has had large ex- 
perience in editorship. He has travelled in 
the United States, and was the first of those 
French professors who now lecture so fre- 
quently before our universities. It is highly 
probable that M. Doumic will invite M. 
Charles Benoist, conservative deputy and 
member of the Institute, to continue as 
chroniqueur. He used to take M. Charmes's 
place when, at very rare intervals, the latter 
was prevented from furnishing his article, 
and he has been performing this duty during 
the present interregnum, while M. Joseph 
Bertrand, secretary general, has been acting 
editor. And the doyen of the staff, who has 
served under every editor, gave me the other 
day the following interesting souvenir of the 
founder : 

" I knew personally and fully appreciated the 
admirable qualities of Frangois Buloz, who 
brought to the support of his new venture the 
elite of talents then rife in France, which he 
managed with tact and cleverness. I saw at work 
the intelligence, taste, initiative, and energy of the 
man who was thoroughly imbued with the grandeur 
of his enterprise, whose life was a continual labor 
and a perpetual combat; who was one of those 
wrestlers, born to be the founder of something, 
who united in himself the most diverse faculties, 
a strong will, a good judgment, and a passionate 
and indefatigable attention to details. Such was 
Francois Buloz, the creator of this periodical, 
which has had many imitators but no equal, whose 
fortunes were linked with the movements of the 
last century, a sort of State Institution, as Gam- 
betta said, an accredited organ of high intellectual 
culture, bearing to every corner of the world the 
language and the ideas of France. Though not 
himself a writer or a politician, not even an 
academician, the distinction of his life was to have 
created one of the most influential and active 
centres of politics and letters." 



And now, in closing, a final word about th< 
third of my trio of dead journalists, Rober 
Mitchell. I knew him very slightly, for hii 
Bonapartist proclivities and his implacabL 
opposition to the Third Republic, both as edi 
tor and deputy, naturally did not tend t( 
awaken the sympathy of an American. Bu 
all his friends and fellow-workers dwell or 
the kindliness of his disposition, which seem; 
to have been the most prominent feature o: 
his character. That veteran of the Parii 
press, M. Gaston Jollivet, confirms in a not< 
to me this statement; and M. Arthur Meyer 
editor-in-chief of the "Gaulois," wher< 
Mitchell was the principal leader-writer fo] 
so many years under the signature of "L 
Desmoulins, ' ' writes me apropos of his death 
' ' In him I lose more than a contributor ; it ii 
a comrade of all our staff who has passec 
away, the oldest member of the 'Gaulois' cir 
cle. He was so affable and agreeable, so easily 
approached by all ; and he possessed the gif 
of knowing how to make himself liked. ' ' Anc 
in a subsequent note, M. Meyer adds: "Ai 
regards the French language, you know wha 
a master he was of it. French and gooc 
French he used both with his pen and in th< 
rostrum. ' '

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE REWARDS OF BOOK-REVIEWING 

not, maintain the publishers, include any 
pecuniary profit from the sale of the boob 
reviewed. On this vexed question some con 
trasting utterances, editorial and from corre 
spondents, have lately appeared in ' ' The Pub 
lishers' Weekly," a periodical that naturally 
sides with the manufacturers of books ir 
condemning their sale on the part of review 
ers, while from the latter 's point of view sucl 
sale is not infrequently defended as a legiti 
mate transaction in an affair that is primarily 
commercial to all the parties concerned. Here 
as in most disputes, neither side is wholly 
right or wholly wrong, and a reasonable con 
cession from each ought to bring about i 
modus vivendi. Neither offensive action or 
the one side, in the way of stamping title 
pages or otherwise rendering review copies 
unsalable (and perhaps also unpresentable) 
nor excessive greed of gain on the other if 
commendable. Perhaps the course adopted ir 
this matter by a certain reviewer intimately 
known to the present writer may be of interesl 
if not also usefully suggestive in this con 
nection. Hundreds of books have passed

through his hands for review, and for some 
time he was scrupulously careful not to offer 
any of these for sale, contenting himself with 
averting the threatened congestion of his 
bookshelves by giving away the best and most 
acceptable and making such room as he could 
for the others. But in course of time the 
accumulation began to assume formidable pro- 
portions, and a change of policy became neces- 
sary. Therefore he adopted the practice of 
making his friends the recipients of as many 
books as he well could without annoying them, 
of giving to the local public library a good 
many of the remainder, with the suggestion 
that they be placed either on the shelves or 
in the furnace or on the dump-heap, as might 
best conduce to the public good, and of offer- 
ing for sale what were left. These were many, 
it is true, but he fixed a price that should not 
bring about any suicidal cutting of rates in 
the book-market, and if the dealer to whom he 
offered the lot refused to pay this price in 
any instance, the book was retained. If, as 
the publishers aver, the sale of a review copy 
at a reduced price tends to lower the market 
value of the work, its free gift ought to have 
a still more disastrous effect. Who knows how 
many sales were prevented by this reviewer's 
giving away so many of his books to friends 
and to the local library? But it would have 
been unreasonable to expect him to cumber his 
modest quarters with hundreds of volumes of 
no surpassing worth, and he could not bring 
himself to destroy them. If his action in sell- 
ing a part of his accumulated stock lost a few 
dollars to the publishers, may not those dollars 
have been more needed by the reviewer? If 
publishers have rights, so possibly have re- 
viewers. Their work in passing judgment 
upon and giving publicity to the products of 
the press is not richly rewarded. Not uncom- 
monly it is its own reward (with the books 
themselves that have been reviewed), and not 
even the satisfaction of having promoted the 
circulation of a good book or retarded that of 
a bad one will go far as a substitute for food 
and raiment and shelter. When publishers 
issue books out of pure philanthropy, review- 
ers will review them in the same self-denying 
spirit. . . . 

THE QUEEN-POET OP ROUMANIA. known in 
literature as Carmen Sylva, a pen-name tes- 
tifying to her love of song and of forests, died 
on the second of this month in her seventy- 
third year. Pauline Elizabeth Ottilie Louise, 
as she was christened, with royal profusion 
of sounding names, was the daughter of Prince 
Hermann of Wied and Princess Maria of 
Nassau. A simple and wholesome early life 
seems to have been hers in the modest prin- 



cipality to which her later fondest memories 
always reverted; and she had no desire to 
change her lot by marriage unless, as she 
fancifully added, she could be Queen of Rou- 
mania. As there was no such kingdom then 
on the map her declaration was equivalent to 
a vow never to marry. But Prince Charles of 
Roumania persuaded her in 1869 to become 
his bride, and twelve years later Roumania 
was made a kingdom and Elizabeth was 
crowned queen. In her new life she had 
shown herself a loyal Roumanian, learning 
the language of the country and spending 
herself and her private means in good works 
for its benefit. In 1882 she was elected a 
member of the Academy of Sciences of Buch- 
arest, and soon afterward became known be- 
yond the borders of her adopted land as a 
writer of poems, fairy tales, novelettes, and 
plays. Among her more important works are 
"Thoughts of a Queen," "Edleen Vaughan," 
"Shadows on Life's Dial," "A Real Queen's 
Fairy Book, ' ' and ' ' From Memory 's Shrine, ' ' 
the last-named being an informal and frag- 
mentary autobiography, published five years 
ago. Her first and most fondly cherished pos- 
session in the way of a novel, as she tells us 
in that book, was "The Wide, Wide World" 
"the only book in the least resembling a 
novel which I was allowed to read while in 
my teens. I was so fond of it that I used to 
hide it tinder a chair whence I could fetch it 
out and devour a few pages, in the hours 
when I ought, perhaps, to have been commit- 
ting lines of Horace or Ovid to memory, or 
writing an essay on some period of Church 
history." Heartbreaking sorrows in plenty 
came to her in the course of her earlier and 
later life, and these it may well have been 
that taught her to speak the language of the 
heart in poems and tales that have appealed 
to a wide circle of readers. 



HUMOR'S PLACE IK POETRY has not been rec- 
ognized by all poets. While Chaucer, Shakes- 
peare, Burns, Tennyson, Browning, Lowell, 
Holmes, with many others dear to us, have in 
varying degrees indulged in playful humor in 
their verse, an almost equally impressive list 
of poets in our language includes no name 
associated with this legitimate and, in its 
proper place, pleasing element of poetry. The 
lofty Milton one never expects to see descend 
(if it be a descent) to anything approaching 
playfulness, though his two pieces of verse on 
Hobson (the original of "Hobson's choice"), 
the university carrier, do exhibit a certain 
gentle humor of their own. In the serious 
Wordsworth we find an occasional uninten- 
tional touch of the comic, notablv in "Peter

Bell ' ' ; but beyond this, Wordsworth is em- 
phatically not a humorist. Neither Shelley 
nor Keats, neither Rossetti nor William Mor- 
ris, neither Longfellow nor Bryant, was a 
humorist in verse. On this head the late 
Theodore Watts-Dunton had something inter- 
esting to say in his obituary sketch of Morris, 
now included in a volume reviewed elsewhere 
in this issue. He writes : "It was this bois- 
terous energy and infinite enjoyment of life 
which made it so difficult for people on meet- 
ing him for the first time to associate him 
with the sweet sadness of 'The Earthly Para- 
dise.' How could a man of such exuberant 
spirits as Morris so hearty, so noisy often, 
and often so humorous have written those 
lovely poems, whose only fault was an occa- 
sional languor and a lack of humour often 
commented on when the critic compares him 
with Chaucer? This subject of Chaucer's 
humour and Morris's lack of it demands, 
however, a special word even in so brief 
a notice as this. No man of our time not 
even Rossetti had a finer appreciation of 
humour than Morris, as is well known 
to those who heard him read aloud 
the famous 'Rainbow Scene' in 'Silas 
Marner' and certain passages in Charles 
Dickens 's novels. These readings were as 
fine as Rossetti 's recitations of 'Jim Bludso' 
and other specimens of Yankee humour. 
And yet it is a common remark, and one 
that cannot be gainsaid, that there is no 
spark of humour in the published poems of 
either of these two friends. Did it never 
occur to any critic to ask whether the anomaly 
was not explicable by some theory of poetic 
art that they held in common? It is no dis- 
paragement to say of Morris that when he 
began to write poetry the influence of Ros- 
setti 's canons of criticism upon him was enor- 
mous, notwithstanding the influence upon him 
of Browning's dramatic methods. But while 
Rossetti 's admiration of Browning was very 
strong, it was a canon of his criticism that 
humour was, if not out of place in poetry, a 
disturbing element of it. ' ' 



EARLY LITERARY LIKINGS OF HENRY JAMES 
are entertainingly described by him in his 
story of his boyhood, "A Small Boy and 
Others, ' ' and they naturally have for us now, 
just after his death, an especial interest. Per- 
haps we are tempted to read into them a sig- 
nificance that they do not hold. He says in 
his seventh chapter: "An absorbed perusal 
of The Lamplighter was what I was to achieve 
at the fleeting hour I continue to circle round ; 
that romance was on every one's lips, and I 
recollect it as more or less thrust upon me in 



amends for the imposed sacrifice of a ranker 
actuality that of the improper Mr. Robin- 
son, I mean, as to whom there revives in me 
the main question of where his impropriety, 
in so general a platitude of the bourgeois, 
could possibly have dwelt. It was to be true 
indeed that Walt Whitman achieved an im- 
propriety of the first magnitude ; that success, 
however, but showed us the platitude return- 
ing in a genial rage upon itself and getting 
out of control by generic excess. There was 
no rage at any rate in The Lamplighter, over 
which I fondly hung and which would have 
been my first ' grown-up ' novel it had been 
soothingly offered me for that had I con- 
sented to take it as really and truly grown-up. 
I couldn't have said what it lacked for the 
I character, I only had my secret reserves, and 
! when one blest afternoon on the New Brigh- 
| ton boat I waded into The Initials I saw how 
right I had been. The Initials was grown-up 
and the difference thereby exquisite ..." 
More in the same vein, but too artistically 
elaborated (in the finest James manner) for 
reproduction here, awaits the reader who will 
turn back to that very characteristic volume 
of just three years ago this month. Not only 
the intoxicating delights of one's first grown- 
up novel, but other bookish pleasures of child- 
hood are there depicted. If the picture is by 
no means such as the child himself could have 
drawn or even remotely imagined, it is none 
the less interesting, and probably much 
more so. ... 

THE MUCH-EDITED HORACE (also much 
translated and imitated, annotated and biog- 
raphized) has more editions to his credit than 
all but a few of the world 's great writers. In 
fact, the editions are so many that Horatian 
scholars seem timid about venturing an esti- 
mate of their number. Of manuscript copies 
alone, complete or partial, there are about 250, 
though none of these is of earlier date than 
the ninth century of our era. From the editio 
princeps of 1470 to the latest school edition is 
a period of nearly four and one-half centuries, 
in which great classical scholars like Lam- 
binus, Cruquius, Heinsius, Bentley, Kiessling, 
Miiller, Wickham, and Schiitz have lavished 
their learning and 'their critical acumen on 
the poet's works and given to the world valu- 
able editions of those works. Translators into 
English, from Sir Philip Francis and Lord 
Ravensworth and Sir Theodore Martin, to 
John Conington, Lord Lytton, Sargent, and 
Bennett, have been innumerable and often ad- 
mirably skilful, though the Horatian special- 
ist dismisses them all as falling far below 
the original in their attempts to translate the 
untranslatable. Within the last few* days

there has come word from the Widener Li- 
brary at Harvard that a notable Horatian col- 
lection, one hundred and five volumes in all, 
has been received from the estate of the late 
William C. Williamson, Harvard '52, and is 
soon to be placed on exhibition. Many valu- 
able editions of the poet are in this collection, 
notably an Aldine of 1501 and an Elzevir of 
1676. Bequests of this sort to college libraries 
are both of interest to the library world and 
are likely to have an effect, however small, in 
strengthening the resistance against the grow- 
ing tendency to abolish all classical studies. 



THE THREATENED PAPEB FAMINE IN ENG- 
LAND, by reason of the proposed prohibition 
on imports of certain bulky and not immedi- 
ately indispensable goods, such as wood-pulp, 
paper, and all paper-making material, natur- 
ally causes apprehension among printers and 
publishers in that country, and strong protest 
from the Publishers' Association and the 
Master Printers' Association is to go, or 
already has gone, to the President of the 
Board of Trade. Increased cost of pro- 
duction in every department of publishing 
has been one of the inevitable results of 
the war, and even with the importation of 
paper unrestricted by government action 
the price of that commodity has prac- 
tically doubled; "and what it will reach if 
the worst comes to the worst," says the 
""Times" in a tone of gloomy foreboding, 
"it is impossible to say." After predicting 
the effect on general publishing it further 
remarks: "The crisis is more serious still 
where educational books are concerned. It 
will be a strange commentary on our war 
against German Kultur if we adopt as one of 
our weapons a prohibitive price on the educa- 
tional apparatus of our own rising genera- 
tion." American importations of books may 
be seriously affected. The same editorial 
writer continues: "Unless the proposals be 
modified many new books prepared for the 
spring are likely to be postponed, even by 
those publishers who ordered their paper in 
time." Thus it is that on every side and in 
every relation we are confronted by some 
baleful aspect of what threatens to become in 
literal truth a world-consuming conflagration. 



THE NOVELIST'S PRIME OP LIFE, according to 
Lockhart in his sketch of Cervantes, is not an 
early prime. Lockhart 's own words are : "I 
shall conclude what I have to say of the author 
of Don Quixote with one remark namely, 
that Cervantes was an old man when he 
wrote his masterpiece of comic romance ; that 
nobody has ever written successful novels, 



when young, but Smollett; and that Hum- 
phrey Clinker, written in the last year of 
Smollett's life, is, in every particular of con- 
ception, execution, and purpose, as much 
superior to Roderick Random as Don Quixote 
is to the Galatea." Cervantes was probably 
fifty-seven or fifty-eight when the first part 
of his great work appeared, and ten years 
elapsed before it was followed by a second 
part, which some critics rate higher than the 
earlier portion. But both Cervantes and 
Lockhart lived before Oslerism had wrought 

| a change of mind on the subject of man's 
prime. At any rate, there have been many 
modern examples of good work in literature, 
including fiction, in the first flush of man- 
hood or womanhood. An editorial in the 

1 "Wisconsin Library Bulletin" voices the sur- 
prise with which "some of us" learned that 
Mr. Kipling had but recently crossed the 
half -century line, his stories having been read 
and enjoyed from a time so seemingly remote 

| in the past as to have produced a vague 
general impression of his comparative senility. 
The truth is, man's productive years seem, 

i with the advance of medical science, of sani- 

; tation, of domestic and public hygiene, and of 
a dawning perception of the significance of 
eugenics, to have been extended at both ends, 
certainly at the latter end ; and good work in 
fiction, as in some other branches of litera- 
ture, may be looked for in the entire half 
century or more from the writer's legal ma- 

I jority onward. Mr. Howells is still produc- 
ing excellent fiction at seventy-nine, and Mr. 

i Kipling wrote some of his most striking tales 

| in his early twenties.

A CALL FOR CHEERING LITERATURE COmeS 

from the lately formed White Cross Union, a 
society organized in London for giving spir- 
itual aid, as the Red Cross gives physical aid, 
to the wounded soldiers in hospitals. Lady 
Lumb, 7 Langford Place, St. John's Wood, 
London, N.W., is the presiding officer, and 
Princess Mary Karadja, 49 Onslow Gardens, 
London, S.W., the secretary. In addition to 
gifts of money, annual membership subscrip- 
; tions (two shillings and sixpence), and per- 
sonal service, good books or other suitable 
reading-matter will be gladly received. In 
fact, the sending of such matter is one form 
of personal service and entitles the sender to 
associate membership in the Union. Even 
more than for amusing or merely entertaining 
literature, there seems to be a present demand 
for what may in general terms be called up- 
lifting or spiritually strengthening literature. 
Miss Lilian Whiting, in a recent newspaper 
communication, suggests that an occasional

also that typewritten selections of special ap-

cheer and comfort to some hungry soul. Fur-

COMMUNICATIONS. 



THE ' ' AKABIAN NIGHTS ' ' AND THE 

ENGLISH NOVEL. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The magic of Oriental story has lent charms to 
poets of English, from the age of Chaucer to our 
own ago of Kipling. Chaucer and Marlowe, 
Southey and Coleridge borrowed beauty from the 
wisdom east of Suez. The drama, the essay, and 
the novel have known the influence of the mysteri- 
ous East. Concerning the special Persian influence 
upon European literature in general, readers of 
THE DIAL have recently received a considerable 
amount of information from the pen of Mr. 
Charles Leonard Moore. Attention attracted by 
his article may give value to the following group 
of notes concerning his subject in one of its 
phases, the relation between the thousand and 
one stories of Scheherazade and the rodent-like 
breed of English novels. 

Among the terror novels of the wild-oats youth 
of the Romantic Movement, " The Arabian Nights' 
Entertainments " walked not so heavily as to leave 
their trail conspicuous; on the other hand, it is 
far from invisible. " The History of the Caliph 
Vathek " is one unmistakable footprint. Horace 
Walpole himself made use of the characters of 
the frame of the oreatest of story sequences in 
his " Hieroglyphic Tales." Published a year be- 
fore Henley's English edition of " Vathek," Wai- 
pole's satirical stories show, rather than the influ- 
ence of writers of Eastern tales in English, that 
of the brilliant Oriental narratives of Count 
Anthony Hamilton. Matthew Gregory Lewis, next 
in importance to Walpole in the history of the 
terror novel, derived the outline for his obscene 
triumph, "Ambrosio, or The Monk," from one of 
Richard Steele's presentations of " Turkish Tales " 
in " The Guardian." And in his series of " Ro- 
mantic Tales," Lewis borrowed Count Anthony 
Hamilton's " Four Facardins," and made use of 
characters from the " Arabian Nights " for an- 
other story, "Amorassan, or The Spirit of the 
Frozen Ocean." William Godwin, in his " Lives 
of the Necromancers," mentioned the " Arabian 
Nights" as a source of Oriental enchantments. 
Mrs. Shelley, the last and best of the novelists 
of terror, was considerably indebted to the 
" Arabian Nights " and to "Vathek " ; passages in 
"Frankenstein," "The Last Man," and " Perkin 



Warbeck " show her appreciation of the charm 
of Eastern story. 

The group of English novels of avowedly East- 
ern setting has long been a source of interest 
to joyous readers. After the long series of pseudo- 
Eastern " moral " tales, of which Dr. Johnson's 
" Rasselas " and Maria Edgeworth's " Murad the 
Unlucky " are fair examples, Thomas Hope's 
"Anastasius, or The Memoirs of a Greek " comes 
as a delightfully non-moral relief. Reminiscent of 
" Gil Bias " and the Abbe Barthelemi's " Anachar- 
sis," "Anastasius " is a long narrative of the wan- 
derings of an unchivalrous Don Juan in Egypt, 
Assyria, and Turkey. In 1824, only four years 
after "Anastasius," appeared the first English 
realistic Oriental tale, " Haj ji Baba of Ispahan." 
Its author, James Justinian Morier, had studied 
Persia at close range. He knew the actual land 
of the Shah ; he knew also the " Arabian Nights," 
as he showed clearly in his later and more roman- 
tic novels, "Zohrab, the Hostage" and "Ayesha,. 
the Maid of Kars." 

The greatest novelists of the last century admit- 
ted their debt to the " Arabian Nights." Sir 
Walter Scott recorded his boyhood delight in these 
and other Eastern tales; and he many times drew 
upon the " Arabian Nights " for touches of 
color with which to adorn his Scotch novels. This 
sentence of tribute appears in the Dedicatory 
Epistle prefixed to " Ivanhoe " : " No fascination 
has ever been attached to Oriental literature equal 
to that produced by M. Galland's first translation 
of the Arabian Tales." 

M. Victor Chauvin, in his " Bibliographic des 
ouvrages arabes," mentions Charles Dickens and 
Harriet Beecher Stowe as English novelists who- 
were influenced by the " Arabian Nights." Casual 
allusions in several of Dickens's stories do indicate 
that he read in childhood and remembered in man- 
hood two collections of Oriental tales, the " Ara- 
bian Nights " and Dr. John Ridley's " Tales of the 
Genii." Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield, 
owed the suggestion for his " Alroy " to Beck- 
ford's " Vathek," or perhaps to the unpublished 
episode of " Vathek " called "Al Roui." Himself 
a native of Bengal, Thackeray was not especially 
susceptible to Oriental influences; yet he, too, like 
Dickens, read the " Arabian Nights " in his boy- 
hood and, when he came to write stories, sometimes 
mentioned those persistent Eastern tales. Char- 
lotte Bronte gives evidence that the " Arabian 
Nights " were a source of pleasure and profit to 
the unusual little girl who was to write " Jane 
Eyre " and " Shirley." Charles Kingsley, in "Al- 
ton Locke," pays repeated compliment to Lane's 
"Arabian Nights." How many novelists of our 
own day would not, if they thought back to the 
lazy hours of late childhood, smile an acknowledg- 
ment of the magic power of " The Arabian Nights' 
Entertainments " ? Soon we shall discover Persian 
influences in this year's best sellers, as we have 
already caught the incense of the " Arabian 
Nights " in the tales of Francis Marion Crawford 
and that chief of story-tellers, Robert Louis 
Stevenson.

SHAKESPEARE PROBLEMS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Dr. Tannenbaum, in your number of Feb. 17, 
attempts to reply to my letter in the issue of 
Jan. 20. Although he does not hesitate to say that 
I am not telling the truth, yet he does not indi- 
cate where I am at fault, and I have no hesitation 
in adhering to my previous statements. 

The learned doctor's attitude reminds me of dear 
old Dr. Furnivall, who used to get quite angry 
when he saw nail after nail of modern reasoning 
and research driven into the coffin of the man of 
Stratford. 

Dr. Tannenbaum gives his case away when he 
admits that the body of the deposition in the 
BeHott-Mountjoy lawsuit and the signature are in 
the same handwriting. The body of the deposition 
is always written by the law clerk, whereas the 
signature is written by the deponent, if he is 
able to write. In this case the signature is written 
by the law clerk, and the mark (dot or cross is 
immaterial) is added by the illiterate deponent 
Shakspere. 

I am not aware that the actors application for 
a coat of arms has been regarded by Baconians 
as evidence that he could not write the plays. My 
opponent gains some satisfaction by erecting an 
imaginary argument, and proceeding to knock it 
down. However, the fact of the application was 
a subject of mirth at the time, as is proved by Ben 
Jonson's play, and that it was regarded as incon- 
gruous must count for something in the present 
controversy. 

Dr. Tannenbaum appears blind to my point that 
no amount of contemporary praise of the Shakes- 
peare plays and poems can be regarded as evi- 
dence of the authorship. If we examine the other 
contemporary references, it is seen that many 
persons were in the secret ; for instance, the " up- 
start crow beautified with our feathers " indicates 
the paltry actor strutting about decked out as a 
dramatic author; and Thomas Nash's statement 
that some " leave the trade of noverint whereto 
they were born " to write plays, is a hit at Bacon, 
a lawyer (" noverint " meaning lawyer) and the 
son of a lawyer, turning playwright. 

Dr. Tannenbaum places absolute confidence in 
the commonly accepted meaning of Ben Jonson's 
verses. When two clever men like Bacon and 
Jonson were composing the " Leonard Digges " 
and other verses for the folio and the Stratford 
monument, to put the public on a wrong scent, it 
is not at all likely that the truth should be patent 
to the man in the street ; but Dr. Tannenbaum may 
console himself with the knowledge that he errs 
in a goodly company, including quite possibly some 
of the actor's contemporaries. 

The theory that the Terence plays were the 
work of Caius Laelius, is dismissed by Dr. Tannen- 
baum with a sneer. A genuine literary student 
would be interested to know what Cicero and other 
contemporary writers tell us of the subject. 

The Stratford actor's name " Shakspere " has 
the a short as in " Jack," and the middle s is part 
of the first syllable, as may be proved by the alter- 
native spelling " Shaxpere." The name may per- 



haps be derived from the French " Jacques Pierre." 
The author's pseudonym has the a long as in 
" take," and the middle s is part of the second 
syllable, as is proved by the alternative " Shake- 
speare." The obvious derivation is supported by 
Ben Jonson's authority, brandishing a spear at 
ignorance.

FURTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF 

" UNTENTED." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I am not a Shakespeare scholar, and the sug- 
gestion I make may be very naive. It would seem 
to present itself at the outset of any inquiry, and 
has probably been duly considered. It is simply 
that " untented " is a misprint for " untended." 
The passage from " King Lear " quoted by Dr. 
Tannenbaum in your issue of Jan. 20 reads : 
" The un ten ted woundings of a father's curse pierce 
every sense about thee." What is meant by 
" woundings " is any evil resulting from a father's 
curse, disease, injury, misfortune of any kind. 
What Lear wishes is that in her sufferings, mental 
and physical, she shall find no aid, medical or 
otherwise, and no sympathy. 

I do not believe that Lear, in the tumult of his 
passion, would have thought of the niceties of 
medical practice. I think the critics are prone to 
find deep or recondite meanings when Shakes- 
peare's thought was in reality very simple and 
natural. 

H. E. WARNER. 

Washington, D. C., March 4, 1916. 



(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have been much interested in the communica- 
tions explaining the word " tent " as used by 
Shakespeare and others, and have wondered that 
no one has given the meaning of the word as used 
in Yorkshire and also in Cheshire. I recall its use 
many times in my childhood, and always with the 
same meaning, that is, " hinder " or " prevent " : 
" I will tent thee doing it," " He tented me from 
it," etc., always in the sense of " hinder." In 
Halliwell's " Dictionary of Provincial and Archaic 
Words," this is the first definition given. 

The word is also used in Yorkshire in the sense 
of " scare," or " frighten," and many times in the 
sense of "guard"; but the first mentioned use is 
very common. 

Whether any of these meanings can be applied 
to the passage from " King Lear " is a matter of 
opinion. I certainly think that " the unhindered 
woundings of a fathers curse," or " the unguarded 
woundings," gives as good an interpretation as any 
yet stated. Is it out of possibility to assume that 
King Lear meant that nothing could hinder the 
woundings of his curse from piercing every sense 
about Goneril? 

At least it may interest some to know that the 
word "tent " is still in use in parts of England in 
the same sense as given by Halliwell.

AND HIS CIRCLE.* 



A bore has been wittily defined as a person 
who wants to talk about himself when you 
want to talk about yourself. The reason why 
it fell to the lot of the late Theodore Watts- 
Dunton to enjoy so many close and lifelong 
friendships with the poets and other notable 
men of his time is, one suspects, very largely 
because he was so little eager to impress him- 
self upon them and upon the world as a poet, 
or as a writer of any sort, and so generously 
appreciative of others ' achievements in litera- 
ture. With but little of what would be called 
creative or imaginative work from his own 
pen, we have in some abundance essays and 
sketches that have been prompted by the 
lives and works of others; and it is with a 
recent collection of such occasional pieces 
that the present article will concern itself. 
''Old Familiar Faces" contains eight chap- 
ters of personal reminiscence originally con- 
tributed to "The Athenaeum" and intended 
by the author for republishing in book-form, 
though this intention was not carried out in 
his lifetime. An anonymous friend has now 
done the work for him, and introduced the 
volume with a pleasing and most welcome, 
though too short, account of the author, with 
some equally interesting passages concerning 
the latter 's thirty years' house-mate, the 
poet Swinburne. 

The eight articles have to do with Borrow, 
Rossetti, Tennyson, Christina Rossetti, Dr. 
Gordon Hake, Lord de Tabley, William Mor- 
ris, and Francis Hindes Groome in the 
order here given. Except in the Tennyson 
and Hake chapters, the author shows that he 
writes with the intimate personal knowledge 
of old friendship, but in all there is the 
genial glow of cordial understanding and ap- 
preciation. In Tennyson we are made 
acquainted with the poet rather than, as 
would have been peculiarly agreeable and 
more in harmony with the general tone of 
the book, the man and friend. In Dr. Hake, 
a considerably older man than Watts-Dunton, 
in fact, almost exactly coeval with Tennyson, 
we see the friend of George Borrow rather 
than the friend of the writer. A record of 
friendship, however, the book mainly is, from 
first to last; and it strikingly illustrates, 
among other truths, that though things equal 
to the same thing are equal to one another, 
friends of the same man may not be friends 
of one another. The preface calls attention 



* OLD FAMILIAR FACES. By Theodore Watts-Dunton. Illus- 
trated. New York: E. P. Button & Co. 



to the cordial relations that existed between 
Watts-Dunton and so many of his celebrated 
contemporaries, differing vastly among them- 
selves in temperament, yet all temperamen- 
tally congenial to Watts-Dunton; " and as 
they, one by one, passed away, to him was 
left the sad duty of giving to the world by 
far the most intimate picture of their various 
personalities." The writer thus continues: 

" There was obviously some subtle quality in 
Watts-Dunton's nature that not only attracted to 
him great minds in the world of art and letters; 
but which seemed to hold captive their affection 
for a lifetime. Even an instinctive recluse such 
as Borrow, a man almost too sensitive for friend- 
ship, found in Watts-Dunton one whose capacity 
for friendship was so great as to override all 
other considerations. Watts-Dunton was ' the 
friend of friends ' to Rossetti, who wished to make 
him his heir, and was dissuaded only when he saw 
that to do so would pain his friend, who regarded 
it as an act of injustice to Rossetti's own family. 
During his lifetime Swinburne desired to make 
over to him his entire fortune. The man to whom 
these tributes were paid was undoubtedly possessed 
of some rare and strange gift." 

Choosing for quotation a few of the remi- 
niscent and personal passages in the book 
rather than any of its literary criticism or 
purely bookish talk, let us present, first, the 
author's graphic description of Borrow in 
his hale and hearty seventies : 

"As a vigorous old man Borrow never had an 
equal, I think. There has been much talk of the 
vigor of Shelley's friend, E. J. Trelawny. I knew 
that splendid old corsair, and admired his agility 
of limb and brain; but at seventy Borrow could 
have walked off with Trelawny under his arm. 
At seventy years of age, after breakfasting at 
eight o'clock in Hereford Square, he would walk 
to Putney, meet one or more of us at Roehamp- 
ton, roam about Wimbledon and Richmond Park 
with us, bathe in the Fen Ponds with a north- 
east wind cutting across the icy water like a razor, 
run about the grass afterward like a boy to shake 
off some of the water-drops, stride about the park 
for hours, and then, after fasting for twelve hours, 
eat a dinner at Roehampton that would have done 
Sir Walter Scott's eyes good to see. Finally, he 
would walk back to Hereford Square, getting home 
late at night. And if the physique of the man 
was bracing, his conversation, unless he happened 
to be suffering from one of his occasional fits of 
depression, was still more so. There is a kind of 
humour the delight of which is that while you 
smile at the pictures it draws, you smile quite as 
much or more to think that there is a mind so 
whimsical, crotchety, and odd as to draw them. 
This was the* humour of Borrow." 
These and other pen-strokes depicting the 
"Romany Rye" are, we feel, not only vivid 
but true to life ; for the writer was conscious 
of qualities in himself that made it possible to 
break through the other's reserve and gain an 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



273 



intimate knowledge of him such as probably 
no one else could claim. Few were the friends 
that Borrow thus took to his heart, but those 
few realized " how lovable was his nature, 
with all its angularities how simple and 
courageous, how manly and noble. ' ' 

In the next portrait sketched by the au- 
thor's deft hand occurs the following touch 
of quiet humor, prompted by the publication 
of Rossetti's letters under Dr. George Birk- 
beck Hill's editorship. Rossetti's friend says : 
" It is a sweet and comforting thought for every 
poet that, whether or not the public cares during 
his life to read his verses, it will after his death 
care very much to read his letters to his mistress, 
to his wife, to his relatives, to his friends, to his 
butcher, and to his baker. And some letters are 
by that same public held to be more precious than 
others. If, for instance it has chanced that during 
the poet's life he, like Rossetti, had to borrow thirty 
shillings from a friend, that is a circumstance of 
especial piquancy. The public likes or rather 
it demands to know all about that borrowed 
cash. Hence it behoves the properly equipped 
editor who understands his duty to see that not 
one allusion to it in the poet's correspondence is 
omitted. If he can also show what caused the 
poet to borrow those thirty shillings if he can 
by learned annotations show whether the friend 
in question lent the sum willingly or unwillingly, 
conveniently or inconveniently if he can show 
whether the loan was ever repaid, and if repaid 
when he will be a happy editor indeed. Then 
he will find a large and grateful public to whom 
the mood in which the poet sat down to write ' The 
Blessed Damosel' is of far less interest than the 
mood in which he borrowed thirty shillings." 

One of the too few personally reminiscent 
touches in the Tennyson chapter relates to a 
conversation with the poet on nightingales, 
wherein the author claimed an ability to dis- 
tinguish one nightingale's note from another's 
among a number of his favorites along the 
banks of the Ouse. "And if this infinite 
variety of individualism," he concludes, "is 
thus seen in the lower animals, what must it 
be in man ? ' ' Then he continues : 

" There is, however, in the entire human race, 
a fatal instinct for marring itself. To break down 
the exterior signs of this variety of individualism 
in the race by mutual imitation, by all sorts of 
affectations, is the object not only of the civiliza- 
tion of the Western world, but of the very negroes 
on the Gaboon River. No wonder, then, that 
whensoever we meet, as at rarest interval we do 
meet, an individual who is able to preserve his 
personality as Nature meant it to live, we feel an 
attraction toward him such as is irresistible. Now 
I would challenge those who knew him to say 
whether they ever knew any other man so free 
from this great human infirmity as Tennyson. 
The way in which his simplicity of nature would 
manifest itself was, in some instances, most re- 
markable." 



A few pages later there occurs a surprising 
I because so unexpectedly depreciatory, if not 
1 contemptuous, reference to Longfellow. The 
i writer's genial manner and charitable judg- 
ment had not prepared one for the slur he 
puts upon our best-loved poet. After point- 
ing out the two obvious classes of poetry, the 
popularly appreciated and the kind that ap- 
peals to a more cultivated taste, he says that 
"of the one perhaps Byron is the type, the 
exemplars being such poets as those of the 
, Mrs. Hemans school in England, and of the 
! Longfellow school in America." To rate 
Longfellow no higher than "the Mrs. 
Hemans school," whatever the undeniable 
popularity of his "Psalm of Life" and other 
i earlier (with possibly some later) poems, does 
! not show the soundest of judgment, and can 
be excused only on the supposition of unac- 
quaintance with the poet's work as a whole. 

As a final extract from this assemblage of 
familiar portrait studies, let the following on 
the too early death of William Morris be 
given: 

" It is difficult not to think that the cause of 

] causes of his death was excessive exercise of all 
his forces, especially of the imaginative faculty. 
When I talked to him, as I often did, of the peril 
of such a life of tension as his, he pooh-poohed 
the idea. ' Look at Gladstone,' he would say; 

! ' look at those wise owls your chancellors and your 
judges. Don't they live all the longer for work* 
It is rust that kills men, not work.' No doubt he 
was right in contending that in intellectual efforts 
such as those he alluded to, where the only faculty 
drawn upon is the 'dry light of intelligence,' a 
prodigious amount of work may be achieved with- 

i out any sapping of the sources of life. But is this 
so where that fusion of all the faculties which we 
call genius is greatly taxed? I doubt it. In all 

j true imaginative production there is, as De Quincey 
pointed out many years ago, a movement not 

, of ' the thinking machine ' only, but of the whole 
man the whole ' genial ' nature of the worker 
his imagination, his judgment, moving in an evolu- 

: tion of lightning velocity from the whole of the 
work to the part, from the part to the whole, 
together with every emotion of the soul. Hence 

i when, as in the case of Walter Scott, of Charles 

i Dickens, and presumably of Shakespeare too, the 
emotional nature of man is overtaxed, every part 
of the frame suffers, and cries out in vain for its 
share of that nervous fluid which is the true vis 

I vita." 

Portraits of all the leading characters in 
the book, including the author but excluding 
Borrow and Lord de Tabley, are appropri- 
ately inserted. A Rossetti likeness of Mrs. 
Morris "the most lovely woman I have ever 
known," declares the author serves for a 
frontispiece.

[March 16 



THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE :LORI>.* 



The manner of the first half of Mr. Vachel 
Lindsay's "The Art of the Moving Picture" 
befits the subject. You might expect as much 
from a literary gent and a movie fan. The 
"gentle and kindly," "dear and patient" 
reader of the benevolent and enthusiastic 
author's mingled and kaleidoscopic succession 
of information, gossip, comment, fancy, criti- 
cism, exhortation, and prophecy leaves off 
with his brain as full of confusion, flickering, 
and fever as it is after the five-reel show, 
which lasts, according to this book, one hour 
and forty minutes. The manner of the other 
half befits the age and the optimistic public 
for which it is written. 

In the second half, Mr. Lindsay, who writes 
with Springfield, Illinois, as a background, 
"a photoplay paradise" where "the spoken 
theatre is practically banished" (most of us 
live in paradises of the sort, and the rest 
are on the way) in the second half, Mr. 
Lindsay limits himself mostly to the role of 
progressivist and prophet. Having classified 
the photoplay into Action Film, Intimate 
Film, and Splendor Film, further defined as 
Sculpture-in-motion, Painting-in-motion, and 
Architecture-in-motion, suggesting respec- 
tively red (hot), blue (colder and quieter), 
and yellow (the hue of pageants and sun- 
shine not the consecrated yellow of every- 
day speech), he draws aside the curtains of 
the west and discloses the rainbow-lighted 
future. The reader who came to be informed 
remains to be inspired. 

For, even now, the art of the moving pic- 
ture is all but a substitute for the saloon. 
" The things they drank to see, and saw but 
grotesquely, and paid for terribly, now roll 
before them with no after pain or punish- 
ment." This seems to mean that the moving 
picture is a cheap and convenient substitute 
for delirium tremens. It sounds plausible. 
But that isn't all. The moving picture is 
going to be a substitute for, or at least a vari- 
ant upon, all sorts of long-winded and obscure 
text and reference books. Along with other 
changes, "there will be available at certain 
centres collections of films equivalent to the 
Standard Dictionary and the Encyclopedia 
Britannica." Still further, the moving pic- 
ture is suggested as a new medium for " the 
new sect of poets, called the Imagists," of 
whom " all the world is talking." " The 
Imagist photoplay will put discipline into the 
inner ranks of the enlightened and remind 
the sculptors, painters, and architects of the

movies that there is a continence even beyond 
sculpture and that seas of realism may not 
have the power of a little well-considered 
elimination." The Church also, in her own 
way, will "avail herself of the motion pic- 
ture, wholeheartedly, as in mediaeval time she 
took over the marvel of Italian painting. ' ' 

But all this is as nothing in comparison with 
what follows: 

" The scientific museums distribute routine 
pamphlets that would set the whole world right 
on certain points if they were but read by said 
world. Let them be filmed and started. Whatever 
the congressman is permitted to frank to his con- 
stituency, let him send in the motion picture form 
when it is the expedient and expressive way. 

" When men work for the high degrees in the 
universities, they labor on a piece of literary con- 
spiracy called a thesis which no one outside of the 
university hears of again. The gist of the research 
work that is dead to the democracy, through the 
university merits of thoroughness, moderation of 
statement, and final touch of discovery, would 
have a chance to live and grip the people in a 
motion picture transcript, if not a photoplay. It 
would be University Extension. The relentless 
fire of criticism which the heads of the depart- 
ments would pour on the production before they 
allowed it to pass would result in a standardiza- 
tion of the sense of scientific fact over the land. 
Suppose the film has the coat of arms of the 
University of Chicago along with the name of the 
young graduate whose thesis it is. He would 
have a chance to reflect credit on the university 
even as much as a football player." 

Surely, after this there is no further need 
of justification for ' ' the fourth largest indus- 
try in the United States, attended daily by 
ten million people, and in ten days by a hun- 
dred million, capable of interpreting the larg- 
est conceivable ideas that come within the 
range of the plastic arts. ' ' 

Mr. Lindsay's enthusiasm grows greater 
with each successive demonstration of the 
splendiferous effect of the moving picture 
upon future civilization. By the time his 
space runs out, he is able clearly to descry in 
the before-mentioned rainbow-lighted vistas 
The Acceptable Year of the Lord. He thus 
entitles his concluding chapter, which reaches 
its climax in this exalted strain : 

" Scenario writers, producers, photoplay actors, 
endowers of exquisite films, sects using special 
motion pictures for a predetermined end, all you 
who are taking the work as a sacred trust, I bid 
you God-speed. Let us resolve that whatever 
America's to-morrow may be, she shall have a day 
that is beautiful and not crass, spiritual, not ma- 
terial. Let us resolve that she shall dream dreams 
deeper than the sea and higher than the clouds of 
heaven, that she shall come forth crowned and 
transfigured with her statesmen and wizards and 
saints and sages about her, with magic behind 
her and miracle before her.

A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO THE STUDT 
OF LITERATURE.* 



To very few men is granted the achieve- 
ment of a systematic structure embodying the 
results of productive scholarship. Most of us 
laborers in the literary field add our few 
researches to the body of knowledge: we j 
re-examine a great writer or some feature of 
his work; we study a type or a period: we 
write the history of one literature, or (if our 
name happens to be Saintsbury) we may 
attempt the history of two. Few of us. prob- 
ably, feel the need or the desire. few have 
the ability, the time, the daring. to range 
over wider areas. But Professor Richard G. 
Moulton is one of the chosen who has hunted 
indefatigably up and down the length and 
breadth of areas whose confines lie beyond the 
vision of most. He has started game often- 
times from obscure or unsuspected coverts. 

* THE MODERN STUDY OF LITERATURE. An Introduction to 
Literary Theory and Interpretation. By Richard Green Moul- 
ton. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 



He has triumphantly arranged his many 
varied trophies with careful design in a vast 
hall, which he calls " The Modern Study of 
Literature." 

To one without at least speaking acquain- 
tance with Professor Moulton's previous work, 
the inelusiveness of this book is almost stag- 
gering. But the author explains at the out- 
set that this is the synthesis of at least six 
different volumes, representing the thought 
of more than forty years. And when one 
compares the present book with these former 
ones, he observes how the author has merely 
condensed, rearranged, expanded his source, 
in this case himself. Morphology, evolution 
of the various types, literary criticism, litera- 
ture as philosophy and art, all these are 
treated from the standpoint of world litera- 
ture and its place in our culture. All in all, 
the result is a most impressive guide to the 
study of literature. 

Fortunately, a book is not like the prover- 
bial chain, it may be far stronger than its 
weakest part. Otherwise, many thoughtful 
readers would not give Professor Moulton due 
credit for his achievement as a whole. In this 
case, the weakest part is his championing of 
inductive criticism. As far back as 1885, in 
his " Shakspere as a Dramatic Artist/' he 
launched this theory ; and in 1889, Mr. J. M. 
Robertson, in his "Essays toward a Critical 
Method," quite demolished it. But Professor 
Moulton stands by his guns with real heroism. 
Through almost a quarter of the whole vol- 
ume, he hurls the same bombs at us, while 
they explode nothing but themselves. It is, 
nevertheless, important to see how they have 
cleared the air. 

" The paradoxes of criticism have," he says, 
" come to be enrolled among the curiosities of 
literature." The "law underlying fluctua- 
tions of literary judgements . . is the continu- 
ous triumph of creative literature over the 
criticism that has opposed it. Traditional 
criticism is a thing of confusion because its 
foundation has been built upon the sand." 
Judgment is prejudice, that is, in the terms 
of Hogarth, everyone is a judge of painting 
except the connoisseur. Therefore Professor 
Moulton concludes "that art is made legiti- 
mate by refusing to obey laws." A " fault " 
is merely a " unique effect." Therefore " the 
result" of applying standards to art "has 
been a critical chaos." 

There is something sadly familiar about all 
this, particularly in our own time: but it 
does not generally come from persons of Pro- 
fessor Moulton's learning and intellectual 
power. The obvious difficulty with such a 
position is that it does not recognize either

the facts of literary history or the constitu- j 
tion of the human mind. " The history of 
judicial criticism " is far more than " the con- 
tinuous triumph of authors over critics " : it 
is just as much the advance of critics over 
critics. Moreover, his contention that " Shak- 
spere criticism has been a series of retreating 
attacks" is an astonishing contradiction of 
the facts; and by implication he elevates 
stray derogatory remarks about Spenser and 
Milton into wholly false importance. But 
more fundamental and unescapable are the 
facts of human nature and the mediums of 
human expression. In his defence of Shake- 
speare, Spenser, and Milton, in his very attack 
on judicial criticism, he is uttering judg- 
ments himself in a perfectly regular and 
inevitable way. In trying to escape from judi- 
cial criticism his only way is by using judi- 
cial criticism. Thus the despised instrument 
says to him, "When me you fly, I am the 
wings." In such a predicament, Professor 
Moulton has good reason to say, "the idea of 
measuring still clings to us " ! 

But how shall we answer his contention 
that " in no field of thought can be found any 
considerable body of discussion which pre- 
sents such a mass of inconsistencies, contra- 
dictory positions, advancing and retreating 
argument, as in the history of literary criti- 
cism since the Kenaissance " ? The obvious 
answer comes to us from the defenders of 
philosophy: truth and standards of judg- 
ment can be reached only by the conflict of 
opposing opinions through the centuries. But 
the simple and final answer to Professor 
Moulton's whole attack is the constitution of 
human nature which makes judgment of val- 
ues instinctive, involuntary, inevitable. Our 
author, on the contrary, explains that "the 
popular craving for judgement rests partly 
on this fallacy of values, and in part is the 
product of our history in which accident 
[italics ours] at one time made classical art 
a fixed standard by which everything else 
could be measured." 

" This fallacy of values " Professor Moulton 
cannot endure. For relief he turns joyfully 
to what he calls inductive, or interpretive, 
criticism. Here at least is the grand refuge 
from the shifting sands of judgment ; here is 
the pure light of scientific observation, dis- 
pelling the darkness of chaotic valuations. 
" Inductive criticism has in its favor . . the 
fact that inductive science is drawing all 
fields of thought to itself." Such a method 
merely discerns and notes distinctions, but 
does not assay them. As he says in the 
widely used University Extension pamphlet 
entitled "Literary Criticism and Theory of 



Interpretation," "the whole conception of 
'merit,' 'value,' 'higher and lower,' is inher- 
ently judicial and outside science such 
comparisons of merit tend to paralyze lit- 
erary conception." Valuing, it seems, must 
be thrown out because it takes place in a falli- 
ble human mind. But how about the substi- 
tute, so-called interpretation? Is this not 
also the product of a fallible human mind, 
and therefore subject also to error? To take 
a perfectly typical example, is Professor 
Moulton's division of the book of "Ecclesi- 
astes " into five essays, prologue, epilogue, etc., 
valid as a botanical classification is valid? 
This particular division of his is plausible 
and, as we happen to believe, admirable ; but 
we have a right to cast the same book into 
quite different literary form. " Interpreta- 
tion" does not, then, remove the probability 
of "personal error." 

Now our author has unquestionably ren- 
dered great service by emphasizing the 
necessity of our approaching a piece of litera- 
ture with minds as free as possible from 
prejudice. He insists that we should study 
this work of art to find out all it reveals 
about itself. And in these days we need the 
special admonition to study details only for 
better appreciation of the whole. Then, 
strangely forgetting that he has damned 
judicial criticism irrevocably, Professor Moul- 
ton declares that when we have read a book 
to see what it says, in a spirit of " friendly 
hostility," "we can proceed to estimates of 
value without risk of misjudgement " ! And 
at the end of the book we read : " In all that 
has been said there is nothing derogatory to 
the idea of judicial criticism," and " Nothing 
that has been said is hostile to the use of 
a priori reasoning in the discussion of litera- 
ture " ! After a few statements like these we 
rub our eyes, and wonder if we merely 
dreamed those hundred pages which dispose 
of judicial criticism as " chaos," " shifting 
sands," and the greatest enemy of art. But 
judicial criticism, we learn, may gain inde- 
pendent value as literature by revealing an 
interesting personality. This, then, becomes 
"subjective criticism." Professor Moulton 
again blurs his terms here. We can only be 
thankful that he did not reprint the state- 
ment in the pamphlet just alluded to, that 
" the critical writings of Matthew Arnold are 
valuable, not because they are true, but be- 
cause they throw light on Matthew Arnold." 
Thus is Matthew Arnold dumped into the 
same pile with Lamb and Hazlitt ! 

The fundamental error in this reasoning is 
now apparent. It is essentially a consequence 
of the prevalent philosophy of flux, and is more

or less directly a result of the old romantic 
revolt which did not substitute principles for 
the rules which it discarded. In his theoreti- 
cal formulations, at least, Professor Moulton 
illustrates beautifully the two manifestations 
of the age in which we have lived for over 
three generations, naturalism and impres- 
sionism. In the one, scientific observation 
replaces judgment ; and in the other, individ- 
ual and more or less irresponsible reaction 
drives out a common literary conscience. We 
do not mean that Professor Moulton stands 
personally for this insidious relativity; but 
that by discounting judgment and by exag- 
gerating temperamental differences in men, 
his theory supports the pervasive lawlessness 
which threatens to undermine our whole 
thought. Neither a theory of criticism nor a 
philosophy of life based on eternal change 
can satisfy our intellectual and spiritual 
needs. 

On only one other important point shall 
we quarrel with Professor Moulton. In his 
endeavor to keep our eyes steadily on the 
literary work itself, he arbitrarily shuts us off 
from the assistance of biography and history. 
If he means that "the greatest disturbing 
force to the pure study of literature is biog- 
raphy," then the method which finds its high- 
est expression in Sainte-Beuve is valueless. 
If, according to Professor Moulton. our pri- 
mary concern is to find out what the author 
has said, to grasp the form in which he has 
written, how is it possible to understand the 
"Romance of the Rose," much of the Bible, 
and the Elizabethan drama, without knowing 
the social milieu which gave them birth? In 
spite of the dangers of being sidetracked, 
most of us will seek all the biographical and 
historical light that we can get. 

Passing now from these points at issue, we 
find Professor Moulton's work as a whole so 
splendid in its sweep, so stimulating, that we 
scarcely know how to characterize its excel- 
lence. Without trying to appraise him as one 
of the large influences in American literary 
study, we may remind ourselves of his pio- 
neer and epoch-making work in " The Modern 
Reader's Bible," the method of which he sets 
forth in the volume before us. We owe to 
him significant emphasis on "world litera- 
ture " as a unit of study. He has given us, as 
no one before, a dazzling array of charts and 
diagrams illustrating relationships of the most 
varied kind. And he prevents these from 
becoming rigid and mechanical, and so mis- 
representative, by insisting on the endlessly 
varying combinations of elements in actual 
examples. Few writers, moreover, can give 
us happy allusion, illustration, brilliant for- 



mula, on almost every page ; few scholars can 
show equal insight into so many forms of 
literature. 

With all its extreme and erroneous posi- 
tions, " The Modern Study of Literature " 
commands admiration for the sheer daring 
and the completeness of its range. It is 
" humane " in its method and inspiring in its 
results. The crowning work of a long and 
useful life, it points the way to the best in 

literary study.

INTER ARM A CARITAS.* 



If any remnants of human wisdom survive 
the era of murder and hysteria through which 
the world is now passing, it will be universally 
recognized that one great task must take 
precedence over all others, the task of inter- 
nationalism. Somehow, and soon, the ideal of 
human fraternity must be brought to prevail 
over the outworn creeds of nationalism and 
individualism. In that remote past of less 
than a score of months ago, we prided our- 
selves that progress had been made on that 
road, and that certain seemingly powerful 
influences Christianity, Socialism, the com- 
ity of literature and art and science were 
working on our side. What a ghastly jest 
now seems that belief ! Almost with the first 
call to battle, we saw all the basic tenets of 
Christianity flouted and denied by the great 
majority of its followers, its Master de- 
graded to the office of a regimental chaplain, 
blessing the men and weapons that went forth 
to violate His injunction, "Thou shalt not 
kill!" We saw international Socialism, 
founded in the faith that the workers of all 
nations are comrades in a common cause, go 
down like a house of cards, its adherents as 
ferocious as any in the work of mutual exter- 
mination. We saw the intellectuals of every 
country, poets, novelists, philosophers, scien- 
tists, ail who labor to keep alive those impar- 
tial fires that light and warm the spirit of 
man in its upward struggle, we saw these 
consecrating their gifts to the fostering of 
hatred and bitterness, selling their intellectual 
birthright for the pottage of a recruiting ser- 
geant. > And for those who still hold faithful 
to the vision of human brotherhood, it is these 
things no less than the bloody interminable 
harvest of the machine gun, the broken hearts 
and ruined lives, the desolated towns, the 
starving millions that over-run the cup 
of tragedy in these black days.

But the cause of internationalism, though 
for the moment defeated, is far from being 
crushed. The very disaster which seems to 
overwhelm it will yet prove its mightiest ally, 
for it will unseal the sight of even the dullest- 
witted to the utter impossibility of going on 
with the old system of sectional rancours and 
jealousies and misunderstandings which has 
resulted in this cataclysm. From every cor- 
ner of Europe are beginning to be heard the 
voices of those who believe with Jaures that 
"the need of unity is the profoundest and 
noblest of the human mind, ' ' those who will 
not be swept off their feet by the whirlwind 
of popular passions, who will not hate their 
fellows at the command of government or 
press, who will not turn traitor to their own 
ideals in the hour when those ideals are in 
direst peril. 

Of these free and firm spirits of Europe, 
the foremost is Romain Rolland, whose scat- 
tered writings on the war are now brought 
together and published, in adequate trans- 
lation, under the title, "Above the Battle." 
Readers of " Jean-Christophe " will recall the 
prophecy in that book of the present debacle, 
and know with what earnestness M. Rolland 
has striven to rouse the young men of Europe 
to a realization of their danger. Aware of 
the gathering tempest, he prepared himself to 
meet it; and while it has raged, almost alone 
among the intellectual leaders of the day, he 
has kept his moral integrity without taint of 
compromise, in the face of calumny and insult 
unstinted. From the neutral ground of 
Switzerland, where he gives the greater part 
of his time to the beneficent work of the 
Agence Internationale des prisonniers de 
guerre, he looks down upon the battle with 
spirit purged of hatred, endeavoring to 
understand and to make his fellows under- 
stand its significance and its lessons. 

We have said that M. Rolland has suffered 
insult and calumny at the hands of his coun- 
trymen. "Worst of all, he has been condemned 
without a hearing. For nearly a year, as he 
tells us, "no one in France could know my 
writings except through scraps or phrases ar- 
bitrarily extracted and mutilated by my 
enemies. ' ' But these scraps and phrases were 
sufficient to show that he had not surrendered 
his ideals and his intelligence, that he refused 
to be blindly implacable toward the enemy, 
and so the hue and cry was roused against 
him. The time is surely coming when every 
generous Frenchman will blush with shame 
at the memory of such treatment accorded to 
the man whom France should most honor. 
No indictment of German militarism could be 
less compromising, no praise of the noblest 



French traditions more just, than M. Rol- 
land 's; his crime, in the eyes of his country- 
men, is that he refuses to hate wholeheartedly, 
and to renounce all allegiance save that to the 
French cause. But to M. Rolland, the tragedy 
of this war is the tragedy of humanity as a 
whole. He believes that "each of the nations 
is being menaced in its dearest possessions 
in its honor, its independence, its life." His 
heart goes out to the young men, not of his 
own country only, but of all countries, who 
immolate themselves upon a common altar. 

" young men that shed your blood with so 
generous a joy for the starving earth! heroism 
of the world! What a harvest for destruction to 
reap under this splendid summer sun! Young 
men of all nations, brought into conflict by a 
common ideal, making enemies of those who should 
be brothers; all of you, marching to your death, 
are dear to me. Slavs, hastening to the aid of 
your race; Englishmen fighting for honor and 
right; intrepid Belgians who dared to oppose the 
Teutonic colossus, and defend against him the 
Thermopyla3 of the West; Germans fighting to 
defend the philosophy and the birthplace of Kant 
against the Cossack avalanche; and you, above all, 
my young compatriots, in whom the generation of 
heroes of the Revolution lives again ; you, who for 
years have confided your dreams to me, and now, 
on the verge of battle, bid me a sublime farewell." 

And as a complement to this, let us quote 
one more passage, which we of this country 
now need to take to heart even more than 
those for whom the words were written: 

" While the war tempest rages, uprooting the 
strongest souls and dragging them along in its 
furious cyclone, I continue my humble pilgrimage, 
trying to discover beneath the ruins the rare hearts 
who have remained faithful to the old ideal of 
human fraternity. What a sad joy I have in col- 
lecting and helping them! 

" I know that each of their efforts like mine 
that each of their words of love, rouses and turns 
against them the hostility of the two hostile camps. 
I The combatants, pitted against each other, agree 
I in hating those who refuse to hate. Europe is like 
I a besieged town. Fever is raging. Whoever will 
not rave like the rest is suspected. And in these 
hurried times when justice cannot wait to study 
evidence, every suspect is a traitor. Whoever in- 
sists, in the midst of war, on defending peace 
among men knows that he risks his own peace, his 
reputation, his friends, for his belief. But of what 
value is a belief for which no risks are run ? 

" Certainly it is put to the test in these days, 
when every day brings the echo of violence, injus- 
tice, and new cruelties. But was it not still more 
tried when it was entrusted to the fishermen of 
Judea by him whom humanity pretends to honor 
still with its lips more than with its heart ? The 
rivers of blood, the burnt towns, all the atrocities 
of thought and action, will never efface in our tor- 
tured souls the luminous track of the Galilean 
barque, nor the deep vibrations of the great voices 
which from across the centuries proclaim reason as

man's true home. You choose to forget them, and 
to say (like many writers of today) that this war 
will begin a new era in the history of mankind, a 
reversal of former values, and that from it alone 
will future progress be dated. That is always the 
language of passion. Passion passes away. Reason 
remains reason and love. Let us continue to 
search for their young shoots amidst the bloody 
ruins. 

" I feel the same joy when I find the fragile and 
valiant flowers of human pity piercing the icy crust 
of hatred that covers Europe, as we feel in these 
chilly March days when we see the first flowers 
appear above the soil. They show that the warmth 
of life persists below the surface of the earth, that 
fraternal love persists below the surface of the 
nations, and that soon nothing will prevent it 
rising again." 

There is little in all this which a recruiting 
sergeant or a leader-writer would find to his 
purpose; but the spirit embodied in these 
lines is one that shall yet redeem mankind, 
and make of the earth something nobler than 
an abattoir. 

Those who read about the war for the pur- 
pose of feeding their prejudices and nourish- 
ing their hatreds will find small sustenance 
in M. Holland's pages. Their spirit is as 
remote from the great mass of war literature 
as a star is remote from the sputtering gas- 
lights of a city. No saner counsel has yet been 
heard above the turmoil of the conflict. Here 
is a book which proves that the tradition of 
Goethe and Carlyle is not yet dead, that 
at least one man lives in the world who can 
speak out with something of their eloquence 
and their wisdom in behalf of the eternal 
claims of humanity. 

" For the finer spirits of Europe there are two 
dwelling-places: our earthly fatherland, and that 
other City of God. Of the one we are the guests, 
of the other the builders. To the one let us give 
our lives and our faithful hearts; but neither 
family, friend, nor fatherland, nor aught that we 
love has power over the spirit. The spirit is the 
light. It is our duty to lift it above tempest, and 
thrust aside the clouds which threaten to obscure 
it; to build higher and stronger, dominating the 
injustice and hatred of nations, the walls of that 
city wherein the souls of the whole world may 



assemble.'

THE WRITINGS OF JOHN QCTNCY AI>AMS. 

The first volume of Mr. Ford's edition of 
the "Writings of John Quincy Adams," re- 
viewed some time ago in THE DIAL (May 16, 
1913), covered the first twenty-eight years of 
Adams's life, from 1767 to 1796. In the lat- 
ter year Adams, commissioned by President 
Washington as Minister to Portugal, was still 
at The Hague, where he had been for two 
years Minister Resident. He did not enter 
upon this Portuguese mission, however, for 
before he could leave for that country his 
father, President John Adams, appointed him 
Minister Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of 
Prussia. He reached Berlin on November 7, 
1797. On his journey from the Netherlands 
to his new post he went to London ; and there 
on July 26, 1797, he was married to Louisa 
Catherine Johnson, of a distinguished family 
of Maryland. A delicate portrait of this lady, 
made in this year by Barber, is placed at the 
front of the second volume. The Prussian 
mission lasted until 1801, when Adams was 
recalled by his father and returned to the 
United States. The second volume closes with 
this change in his affairs. The five years, 
1796-1801, which it covers, coincided roughly, 
as to American history, with the last year of 
the presidency of Washington and with the 
administration of John Adams ; upon the con- 
tinent it witnessed the progress of Napoleon 's 
campaign in Italy, the Peace of Campo For- 
mio, the Egyptian expedition, the coup 
d'etat of Brumaire, and the war against the 
Coalition, to the Peace of Amiens. 

The documents which make up the third 
volume disclose activities no less varied. In 
1801, Adams resumed the practice of law in 
Boston. The next year he was elected to the 
Senate of Massachusetts, and failed of elec- 
tion to the national House of Representatives. 
This defeat was compensated for when, in 
February, 1803, Adams was elected to the 
Senate of the United States. Two years later 
he was appointed to the lately founded Boyl- 
ston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory in 
Harvard University. Because Adams had 
pursued in the Senate a course displeasing to 
Federalist Massachusetts, in 1808, another 
person was chosen to succeed him, whereupon 
he resigned his seat and prepared to devote 
his entire time to his professorship and to the 
practice of law. But President Madison, in 
due recognition of this important acquisition 
from the Federalist ranks, soon nominated 
Adams as Minister to Russia, and after a pre- 
liminary failure the appointment was con-

firmed. He left Boston in August and, after 
experiencing no little trouble with British and 
Danish cruisers, he reached Norway in Sep- 
tember and St. Petersburg in October, 1809. 
From St. Petersburg were written several 
letters found in the latter part of the third 
volume, all those contained, in the fourth 
(which covers the years 1811-1813), and a few 
of those in the fifth. 

About the end of April, 1814, however, 
Adams departed from St. Petersburg for 
Gothenburg in Sweden, where with the other 
commissioners appointed by the Government 
of the United States he was to enter into nego- 
tiations looking toward the termination of war 
between Great Britain and his own country. 
These negotiations were removed, however, to 
Ghent a change of which Adams 's judgment 
disapproved, but which he accepted. He ar- 
rived at Ghent on June 24, 1814, continued 
there until January 2, 1815,.and then travelled 
by way of Brussels to Paris. The latter city 
he had not visited since his stay there as a 
boy in 1785. Though he had been appointed 
in February Minister to Great Britain, the 
news of this new honor had not reached him, 
and he was still in Paris when the Emperor 
Napoleon entered the city upon his return 
from Elba. Shortly after this, Adams went 
to London and took up his residence in the 
country at Boston House, Little Baling. The 
last letter of the fifth volume is dated March 
31, 1816, when Adams was still at this place. 

Of widest interest, perhaps, are the letters 
written by Adams to his father and mother, 
to his wife, to his brothers, and to friends who 
were regular correspondents, especially Wil- 
liam Vans Murray, Rufus King, Timothy 
Pickering, William Plumer, and W. H. Craw- 
ford. In the third volume is included a series 
of political letters published under the pen 
name of Publius Valerius. Here Adams ap- 
pears as the sectional New Englander and the 
party man, exhibiting a point of view much 
modified after his breach with the Federal- 
ists. To a surprising degree he kept in close 
touch with the course of party politics in 
America, even when he was himself separ- 
ated by the Atlantic from active participa- 
tion in them. The dispatches which he wrote 
from his various diplomatic posts, to the sev- 
eral Secretaries of State under whom he 
served, are weighty documents, always of high 
value for the history of the period when the 
neutrality of the United States, as at the pres- 
ent time, was under great strain from the 
violations of it by the belligerent powers, and 
for the yet darker years in which the United 
States was a combatant. His capacity for 
close observation made him a skilful reporter 



of what he saw and heard in Europe: his 
comments on the course of the war on the con- 
tinent are highly instructive. But of par- 
ticular interest to American readers of the 
present day is the account which he gives of 
the peace negotiations at Ghent, and of his 
activities in Great Britain in the early part 
of 1816. Almost the last letter in the fifth 
volume, written from London, is concerned 
with the relations of the United States to 
Spain. Thus we are brought to the develop- 
ment of the Florida matter, with which 
Adams later had so much to do. For the 
account of this we must await the publication 
of the succeeding volumes.

RECENT FICTION.* 



There have always been women among the 
novelists, sometimes of the best, sometimes 
of the most popular, from the days of Mrs. 
Behn, Mrs. Manley, and Mrs. Heywood. They 
were, in the early days of the English novel, 
as widely read as anyone else, perhaps more 
widely. A century later and now about a 
century ago, three women were among the 
notable workers in the field, Miss Austen, 
Miss Edgeworth, and Miss Ferrier. Miss 
Austen has long had a secure place among the 
few immortals; Miss Edgeworth is still re- 
membered and read, and in her own day had 
the distinction of suggesting to Sir Walter 
Scott that he should try to do what she had 
done ; Miss Ferrier, in spite of great apprecia- 
tion in her time, has slipped from sight. 

One would not select Miss May Sinclair, 
Miss Ellen Glasgow, and Mrs. Gertrude Ather- 
ton as the three representative woman novel- 
ists of the present day, and yet all are well 
known and widely read. They group them- 
selves together now, only by the chance of 
publishing books at about the same time. Yet 
if not the chief women among the novelists 
of to-day, they are certainly representative 
enough to allow a comparison to run through 
the mind for a moment. 

One would at first say, How times have 
changed ! Here we have nowadays a detective 
story, a story with an idea, a character study, 
where a hundred years ago we had simply 
those pictures of life and manners that seemed 
to Sir Walter so well worth while, and of 
which the best are so interesting to-day. Or 
else we might say, What different women!

Imagine this modern business woman, this 
club-leader and society-woman, not to say 
this rebel against the conventional life of the 
cathedral close; compare them with those 
rather prim young ladies of the earlier, 
Georgian days. It is not worth while to pur- 
sue the parallel ; a suggestion is enough to 
show that there is much in the books of one 
time that is characteristic. We must not make 
too much of it. They had novels with an idea 
a hundred years ago; Miss Ferrier, for in- 
stance, wrote one called " Marriage." I do 
not remember it in the least, but I doubt not 
that her view was very different from Miss 
Glasgow's. They were as intent on character 
then as now, indeed, I think more so; Mr. 
Collins and Mrs. Bennet are still delightful. 
I do not remember any detective stories; 
though there were mysteries perhaps as deep 
as that of the Long Island town unravelled 
by Mrs. Atherton. 

I am more struck by the other difference 
as I think of an earlier date. Those books 
at least those by Miss Austen, Miss Edgeworth, 
Miss Ferrier were more alike in method 
and intention than are these. They were all 
novels of manners, all views of the world 
around those keen-eyed ladies which they 
thought would be interesting to those about 
them. These three books are very different 
from each other. Miss Sinclair's is a picture 
of a character, a temperament, that reminds 
one of her first success, " The Divine Fire." 
Miss Glasgow's is the realization of an idea 
which perhaps she has had in mind ever since 
" Virginia." Mrs. Atherton, with her rang- 
ing view, has hit upon the idea of writing a 
detective story which should illustrate some of 
the foolishnesses and weaknesses of American 
democracy. 

Miss Sinclair has been eminently successful, 
and that in a way in which many of the nov- 
elists of our day entirely fail. She has suc- 
ceeded in creating character. Her people are 
not merely the abstractions demanded by the 
plot; they have a " real " existence, as we 
are apt to say; they make for themselves 
about all the plot there is. They are simply 
a group of people, and we follow out the story 
because we are interested in them and want 
to see what they will do. In the long run the 
ability to do this sort of thing is the great 
gift in fiction; no power as a story-teller, no 
gift at portraying manners or atmosphere, will 
keep a book alive so long as a vital character. 
People remember characters and talk about 
them ; they remain in their mind. Strangely 
enough, character alone does not seem to be 
able in itself to carry us through a book; we 
want a story. But after we have had the story 



we often forget it. People remember very lit- 
tle of the stories of Dickens and Thackeray in 
comparison with their people. So, indeed, it 
is with Miss Sinclair herself; almost every- 
body remembers the poet in " The Divine 
Fire," but few, I fancy, remember the story 
in which we were so interested when we first 
read it. So it will be, perhaps, with " The 
Belfry " : it has an idea, as is indicated by 
its title; it has an atmosphere, at the end at 
least, that of the tense and fervid days of 
August, 1914. And these things may have 
been more interesting to Miss Sinclair than 
anything else ; certainly every one should have 
his eye open to them. But the thing that 
stands in one's mind is this man Jimmy, as 
he is commonly called. He is a striking per- 
sonage; the mind in vain says that he is im- 
possible, that there has never been any such 
wonderful master of fiction and the drama 
and everything else, that it is simply an in- 
vention of Miss Sinclair's that one could so 
calculate beforehand and so perform. Those 
facts (as probably they are) seem to lose sig- 
nificance in the view of this tense, concen- 
trated person who seems unlike anybody we 
ever saw, and yet very natural as well. He 
was a reporter bent on being a great man of 
letters; of a vivid, excited energy when he 
was himself; bent on success, calculating his 
chances with an infernal omniscience (espe- 
cially of things other people give up, such as 
women, the future of books, and so on) ; de- 
termined to have this or that in three weeks 
or six months, and finally attaining inordin- 
ate success. He was to the ordinary eye 
something of a freak, rather vulgar (he never 
got over some things) : but there was another 
side to him, he had a grave tenderness, an 
unselfish delicacy of feeling, an immediate 
comprehension of things that were fine. In 
fact, in the main a man who was spiritual (if 
one word will do it) in that he cared only for 
what are now somewhat vaguely called the 
things of the spirit. 

To create such a personage is no slight mat- 
ter, but Miss Sinclair goes a bit further. This 
man and the other lesser figures who group 
themselves around him, the woman who first 
understands him, the man who reports his 
career perhaps without understanding even at 
the end, they embody somehow a view of 
life, a way of looking at life that is stimulat- 
ing and that arouses us out of our accustomed 
modes of thought in an effort to get at what 
is worth while. Perhaps they did not them- 
selves wholly attain it, there is certainly no 
systematic evolution of an idea; but even if 
they did not, we may get it perhaps better 
than any one of them did. This man who at

first had the specific power to see what was 
worth seeing in the Belfry of Bruges, and 
who afterward seemed to lose himself in pre- 
occupations as to social relations with the 
county and the possibilities of a new automo- 
bile, did he keep his hold on the essential 
things? Such a question and others come to 
mind as we follow the complications and de- 
velopments of his career. But the main thing 
is rightly done; and however it was with 
him, we fqel that we see in his life something 
that made it worth while to put that life 
before us. 

Miss Glasgow is a bit more definite. We 
should find it hard to say whether she had 
first in mind Gabriella or the idea that Gab- 
riella finally gained from her experience of 
life. We rather think the latter. ' ' Virginia, ' ' 
a few years ago, was the story of a woman 
whose life appeared a failure because it had 
been too definitely moulded by old ideas, set- 
tled by forces that were no longer effective in 
the world to-day. Virginia was true to the 
conventions of a passing era, and could not 
really live on into the new atmosphere of a 
changing world. Gabriella is a different 
woman. She is a product of the same era, is 
born and brought up in the same conventions, 
but she gets away from them or (more ex- 
actly) is gotten away from them and forced 
to live in new conditions and keep alive in 
new currents of existence. 

Whatever be the fact of creation, the result 
in impression seems clear enough. We feel 
the thing that Gabriella does more distinctly 
than we feel Gabriella herself. She is a South- 
ern girl, living in " reduced circumstances " 
in Richmond, taken from the South to New 
York by an emotional marriage and stranded 
there to make her own way in the world. She 
makes her way, makes a life for herself as a 
modern business woman, looks out successfully 
for herself and successfully brings up her 
children. Accompanied all along by a vague 
dream of past idealism, she finally attains a 
surer reality and a more logical reward. The 
idea seems the main thing, and hence there is 
a certain hardness of touch in the presentation 
of character. All this may be in keeping: 
Miss Polly says of Gabriella that there was 
always a hard streak somewhere down in her, 
and that she got no softer ; and she says her- 
self that if she had been " soft " she would 
have long been broken. But it is not really a 
question of hardness of character or hardness 
of touch. It is rather a question of whether 
we have here a generalization from life or a 
rendering of a bit of life itself. With Miss 
Sinclair, as has been said, we have a rendering 
of an impression so vivid that the generaliza- 



tion (left to us if we choose) is not always to 
be got at. With Miss Glasgow we never miss 
the idea : we always feel clearly that women 
like men must make their own lives (whether 
as dress-makers or otherwise), and not drift 
along as chance and men may will or allow. 
We always have that, but we rather miss the 
effective reality that we should like to have 
too. It is not that Miss Glasgow lacks the 
ability to describe, to present people or situ- 
ations; she has a considerable gift in such 
things. One feels rather that one is following 
a preconceived idea rather than being shown 
some of the strangely complex workings of 
the human spirit. 

Mrs. Atherton's book seems something of a 
new departure, at least for her. On the face 
of it, it is a pure detective story. A woman 
is driven to plan to murder her husband; 
then her husband is murdered; then every- 
body takes hold in the effort to unravel the 
mystery, with a result which (of course) is 
highly unexpected and natural. It may be 
that Mrs. Atherton was merely trying her 
hand at a form of literature in which some 
striking successes have been attained. It is 
more likely, however, that with her mystery 
and its solution well in mind Mrs. Atherton 
was a good deal interested in a curious mat- 
ter suggested thereby, namely, the singular 
way in which democracy deals with crime. 
She has written a good deal about all sorts of 
phases of American life, and would be rather 
likely to see an opportunity in such a topic. 
Whatever she saw, the thing is more or less 
there the case tried by the community led 
by an earnest band of reporters for the New 
York papers. That is a curious study, and 
worth a little thought. There is, further, a 
suspicion that Mrs. Atherton may feel that she 
is portraying a great character, a character 
really great in spite of the insignificant cir- 
cumstances in which it exists ; she invites com- 
parison with that stock horror Medea. But 
whatever there be, it has eluded me, or else 
I have not been clever enough to get it. I do 

j not feel the " woman and the glory " that 
seem to be alluded to in the motto ; nor does 

j Mrs. Balfame seem terrible in her story. But 

I that it is a minor matter; if she is terrible, 
then so much the better for the readers. 

Take it all in all, I feel that Miss Sinclair 
is the one who has really made the hit. What- 
ever the charm in a good story, whatever the 
fascination in the real appreciation of ideas to 
the life of to-day, neither has quite the excit- 

| ing thrill of that contact with actual life itself 
that one gets, or feels one gets, in a set of good 
characters.

Essa -s in the ^ ^ e v l ume > ' ' The Greek Tra- 
reconst ruction of dition, " (Macmillan Co.), Mr. 
lought - J. A. K. Thomson presents eight 
papers, with the captions: " On an Old 
Map." "Thucydides," "Greek Country 
Life," "Alcestis and Her Hero," "A Note 
on Greek Simplicity," "Lucretius," "The 
Springs of Poetry, ' ' and ' ' Some Thoughts on 
Translation. ' ' With these is included a play- 
let, "Mother and Daughter," dealing with 
the Persephone myth. Unfortunately, there 
is no such unity in the work as is implied by 
the general title ; but the sub-title, ' ' Essays in 
the Reconstruction of Ancient Thought," 
would have been fairly descriptive of the 
contents, if our author had omitted the arti- 
cles on "Lucretius" and "Translation," 
which have a very doubtful value in any case. 
Now one is always grateful to a writer who 
essays to approach old problems with a new 
torch in his hand; and on this ground Mr. 
Thomson deserves our thanks. There is a dis- 
tinctly stimulating atmosphere of freshness 
about most of these pages. It is a pleasure 
to view Heracles in the "Alcestis" as a 
"komic" hero, or to trace the kinship of the 
poet with his primitive forbears. It is de- 
lightful to sympathize with old geographers, 
or to share the thought and feeling of the 
Greek dweller in the country. And yet one 
would hesitate to recommend the volume ex- 
cept to classical scholars who are in a posi- 
tion to check the author 's contentions by their 
own knowledge and investigation. However, 
most other readers will be warned off by the 
general title, although it ought to be most j 
attractive ; so we need not worry on that score, j 
Readers of the prescribed type will enjoy the i 
book ; but will always be under arms. 






High discourse Not onl y bv a strong general re- 
many semblance in thought and style, i 

but also by innumerable little > 
self -betrayals in such details as favorite sole- ! 
cisms and tricks of expression, does the anony- 
mous book, "Father Payne" (Putnam), | 
declare itself to be from the same pen that ! 
wrote "The Upton Letters," "Beside Still I 
Waters, ' ' and the many other volumes of that ; 
agreeable series with which Mr. Arthur 
Christopher Benson has for the last dozen 
years or more been enriching our literature. 
Through the medium of Father Payne, a 
genial and cultivated layman who has gath- i 
ered half a dozen young and devoted disciples ; 
about him. and of other characters in the 
book, the author gives free and full utterance 
to a multitude of his own thoughts and opin- ! 



ions, with skilfully interwoven shreds of 
personal experience, all strung loosely on a 
thread of narrative that helps to hold the 
attention and enhance the interest. Of Father 
Payne himself, admirably conceived and 
clearly and consistently presented, we are told 
he was not "a perfect character, with a 
tranquil and effortless superiority, or with a 
high intellectual tenacity, or with an unruf- 
fled serenity. He was sensitive, impatient, 
fitful, prejudiced. He had little constructive 
capacity, no creative or dramatic power, no 
loftiness of tragic emotion. . . . But he 
was vital, generous, rich in zest and joy, 
heroic, as no other man I had ever known. 
He had no petty ambition, no thirst for rec- 
ognition, no acidity of judgment. He never 
sought to impress himself : but his was a large, 
affectionate, liberal nature, more responsive to 
life, more lavish of self, more disinterested 
than any human being that had crossed my 
path. He had never desired to make dis- 
ciples he was not self-confident or self- 
regarding enough for that. But he had con- 
tinued to draw us all with him into a vortex 
of life, where the stream ran swiftly, and 
where it seemed disgraceful to be either list- 
less or unconcerned. ' ' With such a character 
as leading figure, and with others more or less 
cognate and sympathetic, and with an author 
of Mr. Benson's wealth of thought and sug- 
gestion to develop these several characters and 
record their utterances, how could the book 
fail to please ? 



of Japan. 



The recent coronation of the 
123rd Mikado of Japan has 

. 

stimulated interest in that 
unique imperial line. A real opportunity for 
research and critical appraisement was af- 
forded to some scholar to study the influence 
of the Mikados throughout the entire history 
of Japan. But it cannot be said that Dr. 
William Elliot Griffis has made the most of 
this opportunity in his latest volume, " The 
Mikado: Institution and Person" (Prince- 
ton University Press). First of all, the work 
is entirely uncritical. Two quotations indi- 
cate the point of view. The dedication reads : 
"Believing, with all loyal Japanese, that the 
glory of Japan's triumphs in peace and war 
is due to 'the virtues of the Mikado's ances- 
tors,' each one of whom was 'the son of 
Adam, the son of God.' the author dedicates 
this work to all lovers of truth in Everlasting 
Great Japan." And later we note : " In the 
vista of the twentieth century, how vast the 
changes! . . The supreme influence in the 
transformation has been that of the Man of 
Peace, Mutsuhito, Emperor of Divine, Uncon-

querable Everlasting, Great Japan." Al- 
though, it seems too much to expect Japanese 
scholars to scrutinize over-carefully the impe- 
rial traditions and myths, yet a foreign 
scholar should assert a reasonable indepen- 
dence. Dr. Griffis does set aside the prehistoric 
claims, yet he falls into almost as unrea- 
soned glorification of the late Emperor. It 
detracts little from the high opinion in which 
we may hold Mutsuhito to recognize that he 
was, after all, human, and that he was most 
fortunate in the advisers whom he gathered 
around him. The present volume, therefore, 
contains a brief resume of Japanese history 
before the accession of Mutsuhito in 1867, a 
fuller account of the early years of his reign, 
many interesting details about his life and 
character, but, unfortunately, a very brief 
account of his later years, when his influence 
must have been at its height. Throughout, 
the author maintains a personal note, throw- 
ing into relief the period of the early seven- 
ties, when he was in Japan. But a more 
serious over-emphasis lies in the undue impor- 
tance attached to the foreign teachers and 
advisers, Dr. Verbeck, for instance, being 
mentioned more often than Prince Ito, the 
greatest of Japanese statesmen, and non- 
American advisers are rarely included. How- 
ever, notwithstanding certain inaccuracies in 
details, and the other features already men- 
tioned, many readers will find this contribu- 
tion distinctly interesting and suggestive. 



A Russian 
on Russian 
literature. 



Under the new title of "Ideals 
and Realities in Russian Litera- 
ture, " Mr. A. Knopf reissues 
Prince Kropotkin's Lowell Lectures of 1901, 
originally published in 1905 as "Russian 
Literature." The reprint is not a new edi- 
tion, for the matter and even the paging is 
identical in the two volumes; yet the value 
of the book is so genuine that the critic ac- 
cepts it with no more than a passing wish 
that into the bibliography, at least, might 
have been introduced some notes of recent 
publications in the field. Prince Kropotkin 
accepts quite evidently, though perhaps sub- 
consciously, Tourgenieff's philosophy of art: 
"A truly talented writer is the condensed 
expression of life ' ' ; and consequently he does 
not fall into the easy abstractions which so 
often lighten work for our own critics. He 
refuses to classify his poets and novelists as 
' ' realists, " ' ' naturalists, " " romanticists ' ' ; 
and he studies Gogol, Tolstoi, Tourgenieff, 
Goncharov, and their various followers, with 
the aim not of appraising each man's place 
in a scale of Slavic values, or even the con- 
tribution of each to the definition of Russia, 



but rather of discovering the peculiar quality 
of every one of these men and of the special 
revelations of human life which he makes. 
The only common trait he finds in all of them 
is a fearless love of experience that brings 
beauty out of terror and significance out of 
pain ; the Russian pessimism of which so much 
has been written means no more to this critic 
than other catch terms, for he keeps his eye 
so fixed upon the concrete facts of expression 
that he finds no importance in a general term 
that ignores all specific differences in the 
works of art it groups together. He studies 
accurately and fully Tolstoi's novels and re- 
ligion as mutually inter-active, just as he 
interprets Tourgenieff's relation to the social 
revolutions of his time as conditioning the 
characters in ' ' Fathers and Sons, " " Rudin, ' ' 
and "Virgin Soil." Carrying his analysis 
back into folk-lore and forward into modern 
journalism, Prince Kropotkin brings to his 
subject a large comprehension much to be 
desired in every writer of such a handbook; 
his method results in turning every reader 
of his lectures to some of the many transla- 
tions of Russian novels, tales, and plays 
therein described.

Babylonian .cipherers have staged in the 
Mesopotamia!! valley one of the 
most marvellous civilizations of ancient times. 
Seventy years have sufficed to resurrect, from 
the ruinous mounds and wastes of that valley, 
peoples and cultures that have already revo- 
lutionized our interpretation of ancient his- 
tory. Professor Jastrow's "The Civilization 
of Babylonia and Assyria " (Lippincott) aims 
to present a popular survey of the civiliza- 
tion which arose in the Euphrates valley in 
the dim twilight of history, and to sketch its 
growth and vicissitudes down through time 
almost to the Christian era. It is an ambi- 
tious scheme of an intrepid scholar. The task 
has been fairly successful. Of the eight chap- 
ters into which the large volume is broken up, 
the second, on the ' ' The Decipherment of the 
Cuneiform Script," and the fifth, on "The 
Cults and Temples of Babylonia and Assy- 
ria," are the least considerate of the popular 
reader. In these chapters the author discusses 
many details that have no interest for the lay 
reader, and will tempt him to drop the book. 
The freshest chapter is that on " Law and 
Commerce," where large use is made of the 
" Code of Hammurabi " and the contract 
tablets which have been found by the thou- 
sands from the earlier periods of Babylonian 
and especially Sumerian history. The volume 
is tastefully and appropriately illustrated by

seventy-eight "plates, which add greatly to the 
interest that will be aroused by the text. Tak- 
ing text and illustrations together, we have 
here, without doubt, the best single volume 
yet issued on the nations who for about three 
thousand years occupied the Babylonian valley. 



A very interesting study of the 
Canadian people and their prob- 
lems, internal and external, is 
furnished by Miss Agnes C. Laut in her 
''Canadian Commonwealth" (Bobbs-Merrill 
Co.). During the last few years a number of 
books have appeared on Canada and her peo- 
ple, but all have been more or less conventional 
in treatment and superficial in scope. Miss 
Laut has attempted, with at least a measure of 
success, to get underneath the surface of 
things, and discover the national consciousness 
of this young people; what more or less con- 
sciously it is striving for ; its ideals, and where 
they are likely to lead. Miss Laut sees ele- 
ments of weakness as well as of strength in 
the Canadian character, but her final judg- 
ment is optimistic. She believes that Canada 
possesses both the ability and the energy to 
handle wisely the really serious problems that 
confront her, such as "the amalgamation of 
the foreigner through her schools: a working 
arrangement with the Oriental fair to him as 
to her; the development of her natural re- 
sources; the anchoring of the people to the 
land ; and the building of a system of power- 
ful national defense by sea and land"; and 
that her ultimate destiny is to become a 
Greater Britain Overseas. 



The American During the celebration of the 
college: a one hundredth anniversary of 

the founding of Allegheny Col- 
lege, a conference on the American college 
was held. Educators well qualified to deal 
with the subject were selected to discuss vari- 
ous topics, with the understanding that they 
should speak out their minds freely. The 
topics were chosen with care to avoid dupli- 
cations and yet broadly to cover the whole 
field. "In short, it was aimed to include . . 
the essential things pertaining to the Ameri- 
can college as a present-day institution and 
as an institution of promise for the future 
educational development of America." The 
papers that were read at this notable sympo- 
sium have been collected by President Craw- 
ford of Allegheny College and published by 
Messrs. Holt. In stating that they measure 
up to the occasion, the reviewer feels that he 
is bestowing upon them the highest praise. 
Among the themes dealt with are the place in 
the curriculum of the languages and literature, 



: of the social sciences and history, and of the 
physical and natural sciences ; the function of 
the college as distinct from other institutions 
of learning; the college as a preparation for 
professional study and for practical affairs; 
and the present status and probable future of 
the college in various sections of the country. 
Among the speakers were President Faunce 
of Brown, Professor Shorey of Chicago, Dean 
Haskins of Harvard, President Thwing of 
Western Reserve, and President Meiklejohn 
of Amherst. Peculiarly significant is the 
attention given to the service rendered by the 
stronger type of privately endowed college, 
such as Trinity and Colorado, whose presi- 
dents (Messrs. Few and Slocum) participated 
in the discusssion. Commissioner Claxton, 
last on the programme, made a suggestive 
plea for contraction rather than expansion of 
effort by colleges proper; for junior college 
work by some (two years of instruction by 
really capable teachers), and for limitation 
of courses by others to a few well-organized 
groups of subjects. 



Mr. M asefieid's ^ work on the mysterious and 
recollection* of unfathomable Synge, incarna- 
we - tion of the spirit of the Celtic 
revival, by Mr. John Masefield, a sort of 
exemplar of modern English poetry, promises 
largely of piquancy and interest. Somehow 
the thing does not quite come off. Mr. Mase- 
field insists that there was a great deal in 
Synge's face, that his silence was very expres- 
sive, that his very preoccupation and aloof- 
ness hinted at genius. As to just why these 
things were so, we are not given any illumi- 
nating enlightenment. The picture of Synge 
on the Aran Islands, as the uncrowned poetic 
king of that strange people, fades out before 
the picture of Synge as a sort of itinerant 
musician, Jack-of-all-trades, or playboy, 
now fiddling away tentatively, now making 
penny-whistles for nothing, now doing tricks 
to astonish and confound, now telling stories 
to amuse all for the strange people who 
thought he was paying the debt of conscience, 
that he was one who had once committed some 
great crime and fled thither from the heart 
of Europe to expiate in solitude. It is cer- 
tainly worth remembering that Synge's favor- 
ite author, for the greater part of his life, 
was Racine according to the impression 
which Mr. Masefield received. Ironic spirit 
seeking refuge from the embittered conscious- 
ness of self and century in the simplicity of 
the primitive this was Synge. Mr. Mase- 
field well says of this man who died of the 
dread malady : " He covered his tragedy with 
mockeries." (Macmillan Co.)

printed books, and illuminated manuscripts of the 
fifteenth century; and from the estate of Mr. 
E. Dwight Church, early English rarities, first 
editions of Shelley, Tennyson, and Racine, and a 
long line of Grolier Club publications. 

Lovers of Wordsworth everywhere will feel a 
sense of personal loss in the death of Professor 
William Angus Knight, which occurred at his home 
in Keswick, England, on March 4. He was born in 
Scotland, within a week or two of eighty years ago, 
and received his education in the High School and 
the University of Edinburgh. For more than a 
quarter-century (1876-1902) he occupied the chair of 
moral philosophy in the University of St. Andrews. 
His literary labors, original and editorial, have 
resulted in a long list of publications, beginning 
in 1863 and continuing almost to the present time. 
An important edition of Wordsworth, including a 
life of the poet, appeared under his sponsorship 
in 1881-9; and later he edited the well-known 
" Eversley Edition " of William and Dorothy 
Wordsworth's complete writings. Eight volumes 
of the " Transactions of the Wordsworth Society " 
published 1880-86, bear his name as editor: while 
his further contributions to Wordsworthiana are 
numerous and valuable. Of the extent and variety 
of his other works, some idea may be gained by 
the following titles : " Studies in Philosoohy and 
Literature," " Principal Shairp and His Friends," 
" Stories and Rhymes of Golf," " The Philosophy 
of the Beautiful," " The Christian Ethic," " Early 
Chapters in the History of the University of St. 
Andrews and Dundee," " Some Nineteenth Century 
Scotsmen," "Memorials of Thomas Davidson."

A^STNOTTXCEMEXTS OF SPBIXG BOOKS. 



However it may be abroad, the activities of 
publishers on this side the water seem little 
curtailed, if at all, by the war. THE DIAL'S 
annual List of Books Announced for Spring 
Publication, presented herewith, is in length 
and general interest fully up to the average of 
our similar lists for several years past. 
Between eleven and twelve hundred titles, 
representing the output of nearly sixty pub- 
lishers, are included. No effort has been made 
to list works of strictly technical interest in 
any field ; and new editions are not included 
unless having new form or matter. The 
advance information supplied by the publish- 
ers for our use in compiling this list is neces- 
sarily somewhat tentative in character, and 
not always complete; but with such reserva- 
tions as that fact implies, the following classi- 
fied list is an accurate and comprehensive sum- 
mary of American publishing plans from the 
beginning of February until well into the 
summer.

IN the April number of the Open Court 
magazine, Professor Lindley M. Beasley 
of the University of Texas analyses the 
conditions which have caused the Balance of 
Trade to swing west from Alexandria, 200 
B. C. to London, 1916 A. D. and also present 
conditions which are now swinging the Bal- 
ance of Trade from London to Constantinople. 
The history of money and of the balance of 
trade shows that the center of exchange has 
shifted from Babylon to Tyre and Sidon, 
Corinth and Athens, Alexandria and Rome; 
then back again to Constantinople, then west 
to Venice and Genoa, up the Danube and down 
the Rhine to Hamburg and Antwerp and 
Amsterdam, and finally to England. 

The time has come for the pendulum to 
swing again. Lombard Street, London, is the 
key to the present world struggle. There are 
evidences of an impending change. It is an 
inexorable law that exploitation allows ineffi- 
ciency and tends to diminishing returns ; pro- 
duction requires efficiency and tends toward 
increasing returns. 

Quoting Professor Beasley : 

"The colossal struggle between England and 
Germany is a contest for the control of the 
center of exchange but whether or not Ger- 
many wins this war, England will be the loser. 
If Germany wins, the center of trade goes to 
Constantinople. If Germany loses, the center 
of trade goes to America. 

"I am not in the least prejudiced in behalf 
of the Teutons," says Professor Beasley. "The 
facts themselves establish my claims that Aus- 
tria and Germany are the legitimate succes- 
sors and modern representatives of the pro- 
ductive activities of the ancient and medieval 
world. * * * * 

"Geographic and ethnic antecedents always 
induce, economics and political consequences. 
If we understand this colossal struggle between 
Germany and England we must descend from 
the heights of philosophical speculation to the 
depth of economical analysis. 
* * * * 

"Having unduly extended her exploitative 
base and unwisely restricted her productive 
activities, Great Britain is facing just such a 
disaster as confronted the Alexandrian Em- 
pire of old. 

"One of the effects of a disturbance in the 
balance of trade is to arouse the resistance of 
inferior folk both at home and abroad. So 
it was with Rome of old. So it is with Eng- 
land today. 

"On the verge of revolt are the laboring 
classes in England, the Irish, the Egyptians, 
the Indians and others across the sea. The 
Colonials are still loyal to be sure, but the 
disaster is only imminent as yet."

MEDITATIONS OF A JACOBITE. 



The persistent admirer of Henry James has 
long ago become hardened to the ridicule and 
the more serious criticism of those who adhere 
to the de facto dynasty in fiction, and he may 
even have become reconciled to the thought 
that the advocacy of his candidate for univer- 
sal favor is a hopeless cause. Yet now, in par- 
ticular, he can hardly refrain from making his 
profession of faith. Three of the criticisms 
that have of late been most frequently brought 
against the novelist concern the lack of action 
in his narratives, his moral tone and purpose, 
and his later prose style. 

The paucity of striking events in the novels 
is, as has often been said, a necessary con- 
sequence of the author's conception of prose 
fiction. James 's plan for a novel is something 
like this : to take a few interesting but usually 
not freakish or eccentric characters; to place 
them in a setting where they may be seen 
from different angles, or at least viewed in a 
particular character chosen as a "reflector"; 
to show them in situations which lead to com- 
plicated mental experiences ; and to trace this 
inner experience through a course of exter- 
nal action; the whole being bound, fused, 
unified for no one figure quite expresses the 
process into an artistic whole. The tone of 
such a composition is naturally subdued, and 
the action and the portrayal of character are 
presented by means of small suggestive inci- 
dents rather than by large dramatic ones. "It 
is an incident," says the author, in "The Art 
of Fiction," "for a woman to stand up with 
her hand resting on a table and look out on 
you in a certain way." It is by means of little 
things, in themselves almost as trivial as the 
one he mentions, that his narrative proceeds ; 
and for this reason the movement is slow. 
Even the passages that seem most charged 
with dramatic significance are quiet and sub- 
dued as far from violence and shrieks and 
weeping as we have found most weighty 
moments in our own lives. There are many 
of these scenes that one remembers long, each 
perfect in its tone, its quiet impressive atmos- 
phere, and its calm vividness. Such, in "The 



314 



THE DIAL 



[March 30 



American," is the death of Valentin, after the 
duel in the little village across the Swiss 
frontier. A comparison of this scene with 
Dickens 's death of Little Nell, and another 
with a death scene from some vivid naturalist, 
might afford a short and convenient test of a 
reader's probable enjoyment of James. There 
are those who want to be brought to tears by 
a compelling pathos, and these will condemn 
the author of "The American," as he has so 
often been condemned, for having nothing to 
do with the heart. There are others who 
would get the full terror of death, and feel 
the physical pangs with which body and spirit 
are torn apart, and perhaps gather a little 
pathological information on the side. These 
are they who complain that the author knows 
nothing of elemental human life, but wastes 
his time on mere conventional existence. 
Meanwhile Valentin dies like a gentleman 
and a brave man, as most of us probably hope 
to die, and his friends talk cheerfully as they 
breakfast in the sunny inn parlor, and await 
the event with genuine but sensible decorum, 
just as we hope our friends will do when the 
end comes for us. And those who find that 
this latter scene touches with greatest cer- 
tainty the springs of their emotions, and leaves 
them with the most perfect realization of what 
life and death means, will probably become 
itrue Jacobites. 

Unforgettable pictures are found in the 
earlier work "The Portrait of a Lady" has 
several of them, and they are even more ad- 
mirable in the later novels. Two of the finest 
are in "The Wings of the Dove" both scenes 
between Milly Theale and Lord Mark, one 
before the portrait in the English country- 
house, the other in the Venetian palace. In 
"The Golden Bowl" is another, more a-tingle 
with suppressed tragedy, and even more alive 
with the air and manners of to-day, that in 
which the Princess looks in through the open 
window during her moonlight walk on the 
terrace, and sees the others at their game of 
bridge. 

Henry James's moral tendencies have come 
in for a full measure of discussion. His ear- 
lier work kept clear of questionable topics, 
and the worst fault that the puritanically 
minded could find was that it did not point 
an obvious moral. In his later novels he has 
been much more free in his choice of subjects. 
Part of the bewilderment which this has 
brought to his critics is due to the fact that 



he has introduced wickedness, not for its own 
sake, but as the cause, condition, or accom- 
paniment of something else. Adultery con- 
stitutes a great part of the stock in trade of 
recent novelists, even of English and Ameri- 
can novelists. It may be condemned though 
this treatment is now considered weak and 
old-fashioned, or it may be made attractive 
in the particular instance, and used as the 
basis of theories on the reorganization of 
society. James follows neither of these plans, 
but uses it incidentally in his situations. It 
is not the wickedness itself that forms the 
story of "What Maisie Knew," or "The 
Golden Bowl," or "The Ambassadors," but 
the existence of the wickedness makes the 
story possible. This acceptance of evil as a 
natural and expected phenomenon of modern 
life, like illness or bankruptcy, seems to some' 
readers cynical, and far more shocking than 
a frank defence of two guilty but interesting 
parties. 

It is another source of complaint that he 
presents this sin by implication. No doubt 
most of us have found to make again the 
trite appeal to our own experience that in 
ordinary circles of society the existence of this 
particular offence against the social order is 
usually inferred, rarely known from explicit 
proof. All of us have been so unfortunate 
as to know of suspected sinners, and perhaps 
to feel certain of their guilt, yet perhaps few 
of us have ever had definite knowledge that 
would carry weight in a court of law. But 
English and American novelists, acting with 
the frankness natural to an Anglo-Saxon 
when he treats a questionable subject at all, 
have generally put their readers in full pos- 
session of the facts. James's usual method 
is to give much the same sort of circumstantial 
evidence that might be apparent in real life. 
The reader, unaccustomed to such a treat- 
ment in literature, hardly knows how to 
interpret the vague indications, and is hor- 
rified at his own uncertainty. More than 
one critic, afraid, perhaps, of being judged 
by the formula, "evil to him who evil 
thinks," has hesitated over the question 
whether Mrs. Verver and the Prince or 
Merton Densher and Kate Croy really sinned 
or not; and it is those who in their puzzled 
innocence have inclined to answer the ques- 
tion in the negative that have most blamed the 
author for his suggestiveness.

It is with something of fear and trembling 
that one approaches even for the briefest con- 
sideration the matter of Henry James's later 
prose style. Nobody now would be so rash 
as to deny that, in the descriptive and auto- 
biographical works at least, it is often obscure, 
and few of the author 's most ardent admirers 
will say that it is always wholly pleasurable. 
But like other peculiarities that grow out of 
a friend's personality, it has something that 
may be said in its defence. For it does, 
clearly, grow out of the personality of the 
man. Only the most superficial commenta- 
tors will accuse him, as Browning was some- 
times accused, of puzzling his readers for the 
mere fun of the thing. Certainly he was 
genuine in feeling and action after August, 
1914, and the last place where he would wil- 
fully have been obscure is in his writings on 
the war ; yet it was amusingly pathetic to note 
the perplexity of the English press, which 
seemed anxious to pay full respect to his 
utterances, but troubled to know just what 
they meant. 

None of the theories to account for the 
change in style is wholly satisfactory. It has 
been ascribed to the author's habit of dictat- 
ing his later work; and in support of this is 
offered testimony that his lectures, not the 
easiest of reading, seemed to those who heard 
them perfectly lucid. But this explanation 
hardly holds. A dictated style might be sup- 
posed to be a natural spoken style, to run on, 
and to be bewildering, if at all, because of 
undue looseness. These sentences are highly 
organized, carefully and artificially wrought. 
They differ from normal written English in 
just the opposite way from that in which con- 
versation differs. It is this sentence structure, 
not the diction, which is the most striking 
peculiarity of the later prose. With advanc- 
ing years the author came, if anything, to 
depend more and more on the brief and simple 
word. Take the well-known passage from 
"The Wings of the Dove," in which Lord 
Mark brings Milly Theale to the Bronzino, 
which all say that she resembles : 

She got with her companion into the house; 
they brushed, beneficently, past all their accidents. 
The Bronzino was, it appeared, deep within, and 
the long afternoon light lingered for them on 
patches of old color and waylaid them, as they 
went, in nooks and opening vistas. 

It was all the while for Milly as if Lord Mark 
had really had something other than this spoken 
pretext in view; as if there were something he 



wanted to say to her and were only consciously, 
yet not awkwardly, just delicately hanging fire. 
At the same time it was as if the thing had prac- 
tically been said by the moment they came in sight 
of the picture; since what it appeared to amount 
to was "Do let a fellow who isn't a fool take care 
of you a little." The thing somehow, with the aid 
of the Bronzino, was done; it hadn't seemed to 
matter to her before if he were a fool or no; but 
now, just where they were, she liked his not being ; 
and it was all moreover none the worse for coming 
back to something of the same sound as Mrs. 
Lowder's recent reminder. She too wished to take 
care of her and wasn't it what all the people 
with the kind eyes were wishing? Once more 
things melted together the beauty and the his- 
tory and the facility and the splendid midsummer 
glow: it was a sort of magnificent maximum, the 
pink dawn of an apotheosis coming so curiously 
soon. What in fact befell was that, as she after- 
ward made out, it was Lord Mark who said 
nothing in particular it was she herself who said 
all. She couldn't help that it came; and the 
reason it came was that she found herself, for the 
first moment, looking at the mysterious portrait 
through tears. Perhaps it was her tears that made 
it just then so strange and fair as wonderful as 
he had said: The face of a young woman, all 
splendidly drawn, down to the hands, and splen- 
didly dressed; a face almost livid in hue, yet 
handsome in sadness and crowned with a mass of 
hair, rolled back and high, that must, before 
fading with time, have had a family resemblance 
to her own. The lady in question, at all events, 
with her slightly Miehael-angelesque squareness, 
her eyes of other days, her full lips, her long neck, 
her recorded jewels, her brocaded and wasted reds, 
was a very great personage only unaccompanied 
by a joy. And she was dead, dead, dead. Milly 
I recognized her exactly in words that had nothing 
I to do with her. "I shall never be better than 
this." 

With the habit of occasional obscurity came 
the power to write prose like this. Even in 
the most confusing sentences, the vocabulary 
is often almost as simple. Now a writer's 
sentence structure is indicative of his habit 
of mind, and the growth in the complexity of 
sentences may come from the growth of a 
tendency to see a subject in all its subtle 
relations, and to present all these relations at 
one stroke. This is a difficult matter in an 
uninflected language, which must show the 
connection of ideas chiefly by the position of 
words. When there are so many conditions 
and modifications and exceptions to each prin- 
cipal idea, the phrases which express them 
cannot be placed in close juxtaposition to the 
central term. A sentence so involved seems 
clear when delivered orally, because the voice 
shows grammatical relationships, as the word- 
endings do in an inflected language. In the 



316 



THE DIAL 



[March 30 



essay on Flaubert occurs one of the few 
passages in which the author allowed himself 
to speak disrespectfully of his mother tongue : 

What would have become of him and what of 
his wrought residuum, had he been condemned to 
deal with a form of speech consisting, like ours, 
as to one part, of "that" and "which"; as to a 
second part, of the blest "it," which an English 
sentence may repeat in three or four opposed ref- 
erences without in the least losing caste; as to a 
third face of all the "tos" of the infinitive and 
the preposition; as to a fourth of our precious 
auxiliaries "be," and "do"; and as to a fifth, of 
whatever survives in the language for the precious 
art of pleasing? 

This outbreak may be significant. Would 
the author be as obscure if he worked in a 
different medium? This suggestion surely 
does not explain all the phenomena of the 
later style; but certainly the basis of these 
phenomena is psychological. It is chiefly in 
the essays that perplexities are to be found. 
Passages in the novels that trouble an atten- 
tive reader are relatively few, and occur not 
in the narrative, but in passages of expository 
analysis. 

The use of pet words and phrases of 
"wonderful,"' and "beautifully," and "There 
you are," is only a mannerism, to be half 
enjoyed and half regretted, as a friend's man- 
nerisms usually are. More significant is the 
great use of adjectives and adverbs, not 
thrown at random after the manner of the 
amateur who hopes that one of many may hit 
the mark, but each chosen with careful pre- 
cision. This use of modifiers undoubtedly 
comes from the feeling that greatest signifi- 
cance attaches, not to bare objects and actions, 
but to the light in which we see these, the 
associations they have for us, their subtle 
suggestiveness. Whether this is the proper 
view, whether it is the primrose by the river's 
brim in its yellow and four-petalled self or 
something less tangible that is the important 
thing, whether the habit of looking at any- 
thing but the essential object does not lead to 
vaporing and foolishness, these questions are 
too fundamental to discuss. It is certain that 
James has always made much of the emotional 
significance of wind and weather, of light and 
shade, of color and temperature, and still more 
of the differences of mood and manner in 
human action. His early productions abound 
in descriptions which, though realistic, make 
the feeling greater than the object, and in his 
later work he has refined oh this emotional 



presentation more and more. The narrative 
passages that impress us most, like the death 
of Valentin, or the scene just quoted from 
" The Wings of the Dove, " owe much of their 
charm to what has come to be called "atmos- 
phere." This atmosphere is not created by 
the mere enumeration of objects ; objects, like 
the characters themselves, are seen in a 
"reflector" chosen by the author. The English 
afternoon, the country-house, the Bronzino, 
are presented not as a camera might have 
portrayed them, but as they seem to Milly 
Theale; and for such a presentation no mere 
list of substantives would suffice. A teacher 
of composition whose most frequent advice is 
"Use fewer adjectives," hesitates long over a 
sentence like this from the lecture on "The 
Novel in The Eing and the Book" : 

Greatest of all the spirits exhibited, however, 
is that of the more than octogenarian Pope, at 
whose brooding, pondering, solitary vigil, by the 
end of a hard grey winter day in the great bleak 
waiting Vatican, ''in the plain closet where he 
does such work" we assist as intimately as at 
every other step of the case, and on whose grand 
meditation we heavily hang. 

Yet it is plain that every one of these modi- 
fiers was chosen with care, and was meant to 
do its individual work. When all is said, it 
must be admitted that most readers find 
greatest pleasure in the style of the earlier, 
say the early middle, period; but there are 
many passages in the later prose which the 
younger man, even at his best, could not have 

equalled. _, r

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
It is difficult to write about the ordinary 
current topics when Henry James has just 
died. It would be impertinent to send an 
estimate of him to the country which had the 
honor of producing him ; but one cannot help 
dwelling on him a little, for he was ours as 
well, 'like (to lapse into a grotesque simili- 
tude to which he would not have objected) 
the Atlantic Cable. As an interpreter his 
position had long been unique ; and lately we 
have also been tempted to imagine and hope 
him a symbol of a process which is bringing

the home of his immediate ancestors and that 
of his remoter ones to realize the immensity i 
of that which they have and feel and think ' 
in common when set against their local idio- 
syncrasies. 

Henry James excepting Mr. Hardy, one 
can scarcely think of another modern 
example was one of those extraordinary 
men whose powers go on strengthening in old ; 
age. The "young old man" whose enthusi- 
asms remain active, who preserves his vivacity 
and eagerness to learn, is comparatively 
common: Samuel Butler would have still 
been an undergraduate had he lived to a 
hundred. But there is almost always a 
diminution of intensity. Henry James not 
merely remained young in the ordinary sense, 
but at seventy his attention to life was unre- i 
laxed, he was still refining his perceptions, | 
adding to his accumulations of experience, 
and adapting his instrument to new purposes, i 
With all his unique sensibility and curiosity, 
he could not have done the work he did at the 
last without something still more remarkable : I 
a prodigious will-power. Though he did not ' 
socially play the hermit, he was as much a | 
Monk of Literature as Flaubert, a self- \ 
dedicated artist who deliberately chose to j 
regard his genius as a wonderful thing held 
in trust; and the last fruits of his self-dis- 
cipline were astonishingly unlike the usual 
exercises of the superannuated great writer, i 
-The Golden Bowl" at sixty ; at sixty-six "The 
American Scene," one of the greatest things 
he ever did ; and at the end some of his best 
criticisms and the two perfect autobiographical 
volumes: the collected product of this last 
period compares favorably with that of any j 
other period of his career. 

What it is impossible not to regret is the | 
unfinished state of the memoirs, of which a 
third, half-written, volume remains in manu- | 
script. They were begun as a memorial to a ! 
dead brother; they were growing into some- 
thing more. In his retrospect Mr. James had 
just reached, I believe, the stage at which he \ 
began to make the acquaintance of Europeans, 
and particularly Frenchmen, of eminence. It | 
makes one think of what we have missed. The 
record of actual events and actual personages 
is usually left to second-rate authors. Even 
the finest biographies and books of "reminis- 
cences" that we have are mostly written by 
men. who, whatever their merits, have not 
great minds and are not artists of the first 
rank. What an extraordinary book we might 
have seen if James 's memoirs had run on into 
six or eight volumes, if that "visiting 
mind," that scrutinous eye, had made per- 
manent their impressions of all they saw and 



assessed in France and England in the 
seventies, eighties, and nineties. The Gon- 
court Journal would have been superficial and 
scrappy beside it. But men, and especially 
men of creative power, usually (and for sev- 
eral comprehensible reasons) postpone work 
of this kind until too late. 

Mr. James left also an unfinished novel. 
His latest published work is his introduction 
to Kupert Brooke's prose which has just 
appeared under the title of "Letters from 
America." You will already, I suppose, have 
seen the book on your side. The earlier of 
Brooke's own letters betray, more in the 
choice of words than in constructions, a strong 
James influence : in this, and in the charming 
manner of Mr. James's tribute, one has some 
indication of the relation in which the novel- 
ist stood to many of the younger English 
writers. The most enthusiastic of his devotees 
were to be found amongst his fellow-artists; 
and it is significant that the poets in particu- 
lar read him. A wide public he did not reach. 
It appears likely that his early "Daisy Miller" 
had a larger circulation than any of his other 
works. The indifference with which some of 
them were received might have depressed a 
man less certain of his ability to do well a 
thing well worth doing; one of the most im- 
portant of his later books sold, I believe, fewer 
than a thousand copies in England and 
America. Many who should have been were 
not familiar with that large body of fine 
literature, so rich in beautiful detail, so full 
of revelations concerning the human mind 
and heart, and, one may add (for it is some- 
times missed), of an implicit moral nobility. 
Yet, in a sense, in his later years his greatness 
was recognized here. He slipped quietly, 
characteristically quietly, into an "established 
position" ; and the Order of Merit which was 
given him on his death-bed was bestowed as 
his natural due and not at all as a mere com- 
pliment in return for the fine compliment he 
paid the country of his domicile when he 
became a naturalized British subject. His 
books, in spite of his alleged obscurity, 
which, where it exists, is always the defect of 
his unique qualities, may safely be commit- 
ted to Posterity. 

Rupert Brooke's posthumous volume is 
being followed by a good many other collec- 
tions of the "remains" of young soldiers who 
have died in the field. They are mostly, how- 
ever, of interest mainly as memorials of 
promise (not necessarily poetic) cut short. 
Though there is naturally a temptation to see 
signs of unmatured genius in every volume 
of the sort, candor must confess that no artis- 
tic creation of permanent value has as yet

come to light in these collections. Most of 
the other verse that is appearing bears on the 
war; and as a whole the effusions, however 
sound in doctrine and humane in feeling, of 
those who are inspired (if that is the word) 
by a sense of the bestiality and futility of 
the military view of life are neither better nor 
worse than the screeds of those who, from the 
seclusion of Hampstead and Bayswater, sing 
the Glories of the Flag and urge their com- 
batant compatriots to give the Hun what he 
deserves. The only interesting volumes of 
poems to appear recently have been two small 
ones by F. S. Flint and Richard Aldington. 
These young writers belong to the Anglo- 
American coterie which, for some reason best 
known to itself, describes itself as "Imagist." 
It is no more a school than I am: the only 
thing its members have in common is a revul- 
sion against the conventional stanza. Mr. 
Flint carries his reaction against the tradi- 
tional to excess. Like the gentleman in 
Moliere, he often talks prose without knowing 
it. But he works hard with his brain, and 
frequently makes one feel that he may do 
something good. "Imagism" as a name 
originated, I think, with your entertaining 
export, Mr. Ezra Pound. Mr. Pound's muse 
appears to be rather inactive nowadays ; but 
he has just written a memoir of his friend 
Gaudier-Brzeska, the young Franco-Polish 
sculptor who was killed last year at Neuville 
St Vaast. 

The spring novels have not been very excit- 
ing, though a number of authors of some 
repute have gone through their paces. The 
only one who has sprung a genuine surprise 
is Mr. Hugh Walpole, whose book "The Dark 
Forest," the fruit of his emotions at the front 
in the Eastern Theatre, is by universal admis- 
sion easily the best thing he has written. It 
is hardly credible that it comes from the same 
pen as his previous book, a stream of most 
viscous sentiment about children. Nothing 
much is announced for the near future, but a 
large public will be interested to know that 
the official life of the late Robert Hugh Benson 
is ready for publication. It has been written 
by Father C. C. Martindale, S. J., who has 
several peculiar qualifications for the work. 
The most critical period in Monsignor 
Benson's life will certainly have been sym- 
pathetically described; for, like him, Father 
Martindale (as a too impetuous speaker once 
put it) "renounced the errors of the Church 
of England for those of the Church of Rome." 
Father Martindale is himself the author of 
several books. The last, "The Goddess of 
Ghosts," has some extremely effective classical 



sketches in it, particularly two of Euripides 
and Simonides in the throes of composition. 
His style inclines rather to the precious; but 
his best passages almost reconcile one to Fine 
Writing. j. C- SQUIRE.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A YEAR'S WORK OF OUR GREATEST PUBLIC 
LIBRARY, as reduced to figures and statistically 
exhibited on the opening page of Director 
Edwin H. Anderson's "Report of the New 
York Public Library for 1915," is impres- 
sive. With a central building and forty-three 
branches engaged in supplying the literary 
needs of our largest city, the record of attend- 
ance, of books circulated, of books used in 
reference rooms and reading rooms, and of 
other like activities, must be of no insignifi- 
cant proportions. "During the year 1915," 
we read, "there entered the Central Building 
of the Library 2,558,717 persons" many of 
them "repeaters," undoubtedly, and a great 
number mere sight-seers; but there are still 
left hundreds of thousands who made written 
application for books, and probably other 
hundreds of thousands who consulted refer- 
ence works that required no written applica- 
tion. In plain figures, "827,664 readers in 
the Central Building called for books," and 
the volumes thus called for numbered 2,289,- 
436. Meanwhile the branches were busily 
lending their books for home use, to the num- 
ber of 10,384,579, an increase of more than 
860,000 over the preceding year. "At the 
end of 1915 there were 996,574 books and 
312,853 pamphlets in the Reference Depart- 
ment (Central Building), in all 1,309,427 
pieces. There were 1,100,952 volumes in the 
Circulation Department. The total number 
of pieces in the whole Library was, therefore, 
2,410,379. The number of employes at the 
close of the year was 1248." It is safe to 
surmise that the office of Director of this vast 
system, any one of the branches being equal 
to an average city library, to say nothing of 
the magnitude of the central establishment, is 
no sinecure. 

"FALLEN AT THE FRONT" comes back, more 
or less tardily, the last sad word concerning 
many a young writer of promise who has 
dropped the pen for the sword or rifle and 
hastened to the defence of his country or, 
enlisting in the Foreign Legion, has entered 
the trenches for the love of fair France with- 
out owing her the allegiance of a son. The 
"Bulletin des Ecrivains," published monthly

in Paris and sent gratuitously to all writers 
in the French service, brings us the sad tidings 
of the death in battle, last June, of Mr. Ken- 
neth Weeks, a New England volunteer in the 
Legion that has covered itself with glory and 
suffered losses amounting almost to extinc- 
tion. Mr. Weeks was in the First Regiment, 
and in an attack somewhere north of Arras, 
on the seventeenth of June, he fell. When 
last seen, he was running forward, face to the 
foe. His obituary, by Mr. Theodore Stanton, 
appears on the front page of the February 
" Bulletin." with other similar tributes to 
writers who have given their lives for France. 
From Mr. Stanton 's notice we learn that Ken- 
neth Weeks was born in New England in 
1889, travelled much in France in his youth, 
and early conceived a warm affection for that 
country. His first book, significantly named 
"La Victoire de Sedan," Mr. Stanton speaks 
of as "a little curtain-raiser," whether liter- 
ally or figuratively, and says it was full of 
fervent admiration for France. It was pub- 
lished when its author was but seventeen 
years old. In 1911 Mr. Weeks took up his 
abode in Paris for the purpose of continuing 
his architectural studies already begun in 
America ; but these he gradually dropped in 
favor of literature. In 1912 he issued a vol- 
ume of sketches and essays, but his most ambi- 
tious work, and also his last, "Science. Senti- 
ments, and Senses," he was not destined to 
see in print, though it was going through the 
press when the war broke out. He was of an 
old and distinguished family, and his loss is 
widely mourned.

WHERE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BRINGS THE 
GREATEST RETURNS has for some time been 
recognized by the intelligent and fair-minded | 
observer to be the public library. No other j 
municipal department can compare with this 
in extent and value of service rendered and 
smallness of cost to the tax-payer. On this 
head the librarian of the Mankato (Minn.) I 
Public Library gives some striking facts and j 
figures in her current Report a document ! 
that comes to us in typewritten form, perhaps i 
in further illustration of careful economy on ; 
the library's part. Mankato library service 
cost last year not quite four and one-third 
cents per capita, the public schools requiring 
in the same period an outlay of $4.14 per | 
capita, the fire department $1.05, the police 
department five cents and seven mills, and the 
public parks five cents and nine mills. The 
two last-named departments make a good < 
showing in respect to moderate expenditure, i 
but the service of neither is comparable with 
that of the library in either quantity or qual- i 



ity. The spirit in which service is rendered 
by the library is well illustrated by the fact 
tersely entered in the Financial Report 
that the Sunday-afternoon attendance re- 
quired of somebody in order that the working 
class may enjoy the library privileges to 
which this portion of the citizens is entitled, 
is given without pay by the librarian and her 
assistants. For the entire year except two 
months in the summer the doors are opened 
three hours on Sunday afternoon. And for 
expert library service from a librarian and 
two assistants less than two thousand dollars 
a year is expended. Surely, the satisfactions 
of the profession are not to be found in its 
tangible emoluments. 



HALF A CENTURY A DRAMATIC CRITIC, and 
still uttering in vigorous terms his opinions 
on affairs of the stage, Mr. William Winter 
received on the fourteenth of this month a 
testimonial of regard and esteem at the Cen- 
tury Theatre, New York, from members of 
the craft which he has made his lifelong study. 
The celebration was in anticipation of his 
entrance upon his eighty-first year, which will 
not take place until next July a season less 
convenient for such an observance than the 
present. Fifty-one years ago he became 
dramatic critic of the New York "Tribune," 
a position held by him until seven years ago, 
or, rather, still held by him as critic emeritus, 
to borrow an academic term. His works in 
prose and verse form an imposing list, and 
the list is still lengthening. His stage remin- 
iscences of late years have revealed the wealth 
of his experience as a critical student of the 
acted drama and as the friend and confidant 
of eminent actors; they also illustrate the 
retentiveness of his memory and the firmness 
of his adherence to the best traditions of the 
dramatic art. Little use and small esteem has 
he for the frivolities and innovations of the 
passing hour. All his friends and readers 
must wish him continued health and strength 
to finish the series of reminiscent volumes on 
actors and acting which he is now writing. 



THE GEOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION OF FIC- 
TION, such as is attempted in theory by the 
Dewey decimal system, but is seldom carried 
out in practice, can never hope to attain scien- 
tific accuracy or to be of much use in library 
service. How, for example, would one geo- 
graphically classify the novels of Maarten 
Maartens, of Henry James, of F. Marion 
Crawford ? The country of an author's birth, 
breeding, and citizenship, that of his later 
residence, that to which his scenes and char-

acters belong, and that whose language he 
uses in writing, may all be different from one 
another, to the confusion of any attempted 
geographical classification. A somewhat simi- 
lar difficulty confronts one in endeavoring to 
name the distinctively national novel of sur- 
passing merit in any country's literature. 
In the current issue of "Branch Library 
News" (New York) the editor speaks to the 
point in discussing "The Great American 
Novel," showing the absurdity of expecting 
any such impossible book to be produced. 
Even countries smaller and more nearly ho- 
mogeneous than ours, he says, have brought 
forth no similar creation of the novelist 's art ; 
how, then, can our broad land with its mul- 
tifarious and often mutually repellent ele- 
ments serve as fit soil for the germination and 
growth of anything worthy of being called 
the great American novel, as distinguished 
from all other American novels? Still it 
must be admitted that some of the older coun- 
tries do have each its outstanding master- 
piece of prose fiction. "Don Quixote," "I 
Promessi Sposi," "Les Miserables, " "Wil- 
helm Meister," enjoy a repute, whether 
always deserved or not, that remains, on the 
whole, undisputed in each instance. But with 
us some half dozen or more novels jostle one 
another for preeminence in the sense indicated 
by the heading of Mr. Pearson's essay. And 
may it not be a piece of good fortune that 
no one "great American novel" is possible, 
since for that reason there is the more room 
for many great American novels? 

THE OVERWORKED SUPERLATIVE has long 
been clamoring for better terms from its 
employers for less exhausting and unceas- 
ing demands upon its services, and for more 
generous recognition of its true value and of 
its dignity in the vocabulary of every-day 
speech and of printed prose and poetry. Never 
has the temptation to excess of vehemence 
been stronger than in these passionate times; 
and never, therefore, has there been greater 
need of caution and restraint in both speech 
and writing. Edward Everett Hale's advice to 
young writers, to strike out their adjectives 
and adverbs and let their nouns and verbs do 
the fighting, is a counsel of perfection which 
his own printed page would show to be hardly 
practicable; but it is possible, without loss 
of either strength or grace, to prune one's 
sentences of their superlatives. Theoretically 
there is but one best or worst, largest or small- 
est, most beautiful or most hideous, object of 
any given kind; and consequently the occa- 
sions demanding the use of the superlative are 
extremely rare, and the chances that in a 



whole book it will not once be needed are a 
thousand to one. And if this be so in regard 
to legitimate superlatives, what shall be said 
of those false superlatives, those absurd for- 
mations, like "most unique," "most singular," 
"most perfect," "most correct," "most com- 
plete, " and those less absurd but still illogical 
forms, "most satisfactory," "most adequate," 
"most truthful," "most convincing," and the 
like? We squander our verbal wealth when 
we indulge in exaggerative or meaningless 
superlatives, and even the most careful of us 
need to be cautioned against heedlessness in 
this particular. We are all poor miserable 
sinners, in a linguistic if not also in a moral 
sense, and cannot (to change the metaphor) 
afford to throw stones. It is not the intention 
here to cast even the tiniest (the superlative 
is here used advisedly) pebble, but rather to 
call attention to Mr. Arthur Waugh's little 
essay on "The Abuse of the Superlative," in 
his latest book, "Reticence in Literature." 



AN ANECDOTE ABOUT CARMEN SYLVA, illus- 
trating the extent and variety of her literary 
accomplishments, is told by Pierre Loti in the 
volume of sketches bearing her name as its 
chief title,. At the castle of Sinaia, where the 
French author seems to have been a welcome 
and favored guest, he had the pleasure of 
hearing the Roumanian Queen read both from 
her own writings and from those of others. 
After a brief reference to "a heart-rending 
little tale, written with rare dramatic power," 
and read from one of her own books by 
Carmen Sylva in a manner that thrilled the 
hearer with emotion, he describes her read- 
ing something else to her attendant maids 
of honor her "daughters" he called them, 
though her one and only child had long been 
dead. He continues : " I was sufficiently close 
to Her Majesty to see the words of the book 
as she turned over the pages, and great was 
my surprise to discover that what she was 
reading in French was written in German. 
It would have been impossible to guess it, 
for there was not the slightest hesitation in 
her charming diction; even the phrases she 
improvised were always harmonious. . . On 
another occasion I heard her perform the 
same wonderful feat in translating from the 
Roumanian. She was reading aloud an old 
mountain ballad, transposing it right off into 
rhythmical, poetical French. It would appear 
as though it were a matter of indiffer- 
ence to her which language she used as the 
vehicle of her thoughts. In this respect she 
resembles those accomplished musicians who 
play a piece of music in any key with like 
facility and intensity of feeling. " In the same 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



321 



chapter he says : " Carmen Sylva, reading her 
own works, is the only person who ever stirred 
me, with fiction, to the point of making me 
weep ; perhaps this is the strongest praise of 
her talent that I can give, for even at the 
theatre, where men are so frequently moved 
to tears, I am never affected in the slightest 
degree." 



BOOKBINDERS* TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS in 
these days of unavoidable curtailment of 
supplies from abroad are exemplified in the 
following record of experience at the bindery 
attached to the Newberry Library of this city. 
Dr. Carlton, the Librarian, writes in his cur- 
rent Report : " Owing to conditions arising out 
of the Great War, we have been unable to 
replenish certain portions of our stock of leath- 
ers and cloth used in binding. Our stock of 
imported English imperial cloth is nearly 
exhausted in the red, maroon, and brown col- 
ors, and the manufacturers cannot at present 
fill orders for the material in these colors. 
Consequently we are using a high-grade 
Holliston library buckram to match sets previ- 
ously bound in the imported cloth. The first 
quality morocco leather which we have been 
accustomed to import from Germany is of 
course no longer obtainable. Our stock of 
this maroon color is entirely exhausted and we 
are using cloth of a corresponding color in 
binding current volumes of sets previously 
bound in leather. We endeavored, but with- 
out success, to secure a Turkey morocco in the 
maroon color; the other colors do not match 
our former stock." In other particulars, too, 
this annual record of notable library work 
reveals the injurious effect of the war; but 
the substitution of honest buckram for other 
and perhaps less durable material ought not 
to furnish cause for unqualified regret. 

NUTSHELL CRITICISM, criticism carried to 
the extreme of pithy brevity, formed one of 
the diversions of the Papeterie Club to which 
Mrs. Julia Ward Howe belonged in later life, 
and of which she was the animating spirit. It 
was jocosely known as "Mrs. Howe's Vaude- 
ville," and the system of literary criticism 
credited to its inventive genius one suspects 
to have been the offspring of Mrs. Howe's 
clever brain. Here are some of the symbols 
used to commend or condemn the "paper 
novels" (whence the name of the club) read 
and passed around among the club mem- 
bers : "B. P. By the pound ; M. A. S. May 
amuse somebody ; P. B. Pot-boiler ; F. W. 
B. For waste-basket ; U. I. Uplifting in- 
fluence ; W. D. Wholly delightful ; U. T. 



Utter trash. " This is from Mrs. Howe 's biog- 
raphy by her daughters, more formally dis- 
cussed on a later page. Of the same club and 
its "delicious fooling," and Mrs. Howe's part 
in that fooling, the book adds further details. 
"Merrymaking was her safety-valve. Brain 
fag and nervous prostration were practically 
unknown to her. When she had worked to 
the point of exhaustion, she turned to play. 
Fun and frolic went along with labor and 
prayer; the power of combining these kept 
her steadily at her task till the end of her 
life. The last time she left her house, six days 
before hep death, it was to preside at the 
Papeterie, where she was as usual the life of 
the meeting! The club still lives, and, like 
the New England Woman's Club, seems still 
pervaded by her spirit." In no man or woman 
of genius has the imperishable child, with all 
its frank and free fun and playfulness, more 
delightfully or more lastingly shown itself 
than in this ever-youthful woman. 



A PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH A DISTINCTIVE 

NAME something less common than the 
Smithville Free Library, or the Tompkins 
Memorial Library of Jonesborough, or the 
Carnegie Library of Johnson Centre, or even 
the Littlefield Athenasum is a rarity that 
commends itself if only by reason of its unusu- 
alness. Such an institution has recently 
opened its doors on Niagara Street in Buffalo. 
It is called the Jubilee Library, surely a name 
of glad omen. It is a branch of the city's 
main library, but seems to be a completely 
equipped establishment in itself. From the 
Buffalo librarian's Nineteenth Annual Report 
we learn that "the Jubilee spring on Delaware 
Avenue was for many years the water supply 
of the village of Black Rock, now a part of 
the city of Buffalo, and was used more or less 
by the residents of that section (known as the 
Parrish Tract) until the service was ordered 
discontinued in the year 1898. A bill was 
passed by the State Legislature in that year 
which provided for the sale of the property 
of the Jubilee Water Works, and for the erec- 
tion of a branch library building. In 1912 
this bill was amended to provide for a build- 
ing which could be used for other purposes, 
in addition to the Library." It was built 
under the direction of the Jubilee Water 
Commissioners, has an auditorium in the base- 
ment, a gymnasium in an annex, and devotes 
its main floor to library purposes. It is a 
community centre, stands in a thickly-settled 
district, serves a considerable Polish and Hun- 
garian population, maintains a collection of 
Polish and one of Hungarian books, has an 
assistant who speaks the language of Kosci-

uszko, and doubtless lives up to its name by 
spreading gladness among its patrons, old and 
young. 

A HOPEFUL VIEW OP THE BOOK BUSINESS, of 

its fortunes after the war, and of the general 
attitude toward literature in this country, is 
taken by one of our oldest and best-informed 
publishers, Mr. George Haven Putnam, in a 
thoughtful article contributed by request to 
"The New York Times Review of Books." 
An improvement in the American book trade 
he already sees as compared with conditions 
in 1914 and the first half of 1915, and this 
recuperation he thinks will continue, with a 
drawing together, in mutual understanding 
and in literary sympathies, of the three great 
democratic nations of the earth as soon as the 
present absorption in warfare shall have given 
place to revived interest in the pursuits of 
peace. England, France, and the United 
States will find themselves cherishing ideals 
and aims in common and producing works of 
literature that will appeal to readers in all 
three countries. Nearer, too, shall we be 
drawn in our sympathies to the Latin-Ameri- 
can republics, he prophesies, and this also will 
have a stimulating effect on our literature and 
on theirs. In fact, it is a note of optimism, 
intelligent optimism, that Mr. Putnam strikes 
in his well-informed utterance on the literary 
outlook. 



NAUSEATING PRESCRIPTIONS are not the 
monopoly of those who administer pills and 
powders, ipecac and rhubarb, cod-liver oil 
and sulphur and molasses. Prescribed read- 
ing has a way of exciting distaste on the part 
of the intended reader, whereas a forbidden 
book possesses a charm beyond the power of 
words to express. "Greater diplomacy is 
needed in presenting a literary masterpiece 
acceptably to children of high-school age," 
wisely observed Miss Alice M. Jordan, of the 
children's department of the Boston Public 
Library, at a late meeting of the Massachusetts 
Library Club. "Bearing with them the list 
of outside reading prepared by the school to 
stimulate their reading habits and develop 
their tastes, these boys and girls say to you: 
'I want one book to read for school and one 
good book for myself.' Propose to them to 
look at the reading list and they reply: 'If 
it's good, it isn't on the list.' We are still 
in the place where literature and interesting 
books are far asunder in the minds of many 
young people. One principal tells us that his 
' experience proves that lists do not encourage 
reading.' In his school, a large technical 
school, they have ceased to use reading lists 



for this reason." As with growing children 
who so often clamor the loudest for the food 
they have been forbidden to eat, so with 
young readers a little innocent wile has more 
than once been found effective in whetting 
the appetite for wholesome diet. But rules to 
this end are as futile as all cut-and-dried 
instructions for winning the confidence and 
affection of young people. Personal influence 
alone can achieve the desired result. 



PREPARATION (NOT "PREPAREDNESS") FOR 
1919, a centennial year not incomparable, in 
the literary world, with the wonderful year 
1909, may perhaps with profit be preached 
even thus early. At any rate, it may be worth 
while to glance down the list of great names, 
and of some less great, that will be conspic- 
uous in public print three years from now, 
especially as it is our own country that fur- 
nishes the greater number of these illustrious 
names. Since the order of greatness in which 
they should be mentioned is open to dispute, 
let us follow the order of their birthdays, 
thus : Ruskin, Feb. 8 ; Lowell, Feb. 22 ; Julia 
Ward Howe, May 27; Walt Whitman, May 
31 ; George Eliot, Nov. 22. Among the minor 
literary celebrities born in 1819 are found the 
following, which are here named with no 
attempt at chronological or any other order: 
Clough, Kingsley, E. P. Whipple, J. G. Hol- 
land, Herman Melville, Susan Warner, W. W. 
Story, Gottfried Keller, Theodore Fontane, 
and Wilhelm Jordan. These for the present 
will be enough for us to read up in anticipa- 
tion of the day when we shall be glad and 
proud to be able to talk fluently and intelli- 
gently about them and their works. Already 
the centenary biography of Mrs. Howe a 
complete, authoritative, and remarkably inter- 
esting account of her life, by her daughters, 
Mrs. Richards and Mrs. Elliott has ap- 
peared, and is reviewed elsewhere in this issue. 

AN AVERTED PAPER-FAMINE must be the 
heading to this paragraph, which itself will 
serve as a sequel to the recent announcement 
in these columns of a threatened shortage in 
England of the indispensable raw material 
of books, magazines, and newspapers. The 
British government seems (or seem, as our 
English cousins prefer to say, not liking to 
think of the ruling power as a mere unit, an 
insignificant singular number) the British 
government seem to have repented themselves 
of their purpose to bar out importations of 
wood-pulp and other paper-making material 
for the sake of cutting down the tonnage 
of imports in these days of hazardous seafar- 



1916]

ing. At any rate, word now comes that the 
scare among paper-makers, printers, publish- 
ers, and (to some extent) authors, has passed 
like a fleeting cloud on a summer day ; for the 
prohibition is to be but partial, one-third of 
the usual tonnage, the other two-thirds being 
admitted, and this is held to be quite enough 
in a season of restricted activity among the 
users of paper. The preponderance of influ- 
ential sentiment against the threatened meas- 
ure, in its full severity, has evidently pro- 
duced an effect. But the sad fact still remains ' 
that paper and all the materials that go to 
its making and finishing and to the produc- 
tion of printed matter generally are abnor- 
mally scarce and consequently high in price i 
throughout a great part of the civilized world, 
our own country not excepted. 



A DAY AT THE TELEPHONE OF A MUNICIPAL 

REFERENCE LIBRARY in a city of considerable 
size is likely to subject the listener to a string ' 
of questions as varied and bewildering as | 
those embalmed in the sprightly and amusing 
verses that have gone the round of the library 
publications and some other periodicals, with ' 
and without acknowledgment to the author, 
Mr. Edmund Lester Pearson. At the Munici- 
pal Reference Library of New York City some 
of these questions by telephone in a single 
day were as follows: Do you know of any 
publication entitled "New York City"? What 
is the best book on hospital construction? 
Who are the new members of the Board of 
Aldermen? How many miles of paved and 
unpaved streets are there in New York City? i 
What can you tell me about the Chapin Home 
for the Aged and Infirm? What is the busi- 
ness address of Justice Samuel Greenbaum? , 
In order to secure a marriage license does one ; 
need to take a birth certificate to the Marriage 
License Bureau f When is the next civil serv- 
ice examination for stenographer to be held, i 
and what speed is required ? These and other 
miscellaneous inquiries are printed in the cur- 
rent Report of the New York Public Library, 
a fat pamphlet of 118 variously interesting 
and instructive pages. 

ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT, broad acres of it, 
still remains is our answer to the follow 
ing from "The Pyoneer ov Simplifyd Spel- 
ing ": "The seupreem test ov eni sistem ov 
simplifyd speling iz its reedabiliti at syt. The 
chain jez ov speling reesentli adopted in THE

include such forms as "tauc, tank; wauc. 



wauk; fliing, flying; endyuer, endeur, licwid, 
likwid; cil, Ml, salyut, saleut," and twice as 
many more, which do seem to show, on the 
whole, a move in the right direction. "It is 
kleer, then," continues the writer, "that the 
reesent chainjez ar much mor reedabel than 
the oalder S. S. formz, and the thaut aryzez 
if a stil ferther improovment kud be maid." 
Yes, easily. Continue the return to recognized 
orthography already begun in such words as 
"flying" (an improvement on the earlier 
"fliing"), and in course of time the spelling 
of our fathers, the spelling we learned in our 
childhood, and the spelling which we hope will 
cheer our bespectacled eyes in old age, will be 
safely and, it is to be hoped, permanently 
reached.

The latest volume issued in the "Loeb Classical 
Library," that series whose sponsor is placing the 
literary world so irredeemably in his debt, is that 
devoted to "Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns and 
Homerica," and contains, in conformance with the 
previous volumes of the Library, the original texts, 
with parallel translations, the latter by Hugh G. 
Evelyn- White, M.A., sometime scholar of Wadham 
College, Oxford. I leave the task of adequate 
appreciation of the manner in which the translator 
has acquitted himself to your reviewer, but wish 
to call attention to the following transcript of his 
version of the Eighth of the Homeric Hymns, as 
follows : 

To ARES. 

ARES, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden- 
helmed, doughty in heart, shield-bearer, Saviour of 
cities, harnessed in bronze, strong of arm, unwearying, 
mighty with the spear, O defence of Olympus, father 
of warlike Victory, ally of Themis, stern governor of 
the rebellious, leader of righteous men, sceptered King 
of manliness, who whirl your fiery sphere among the 
planets in their sevenfold courses through the aether 
wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above 
the third firmament of heaven; hear me, helper of 
men, giver of dauntless youth! Shed down a kindly 
ray from above upon my life, and strength of war, 
that I may be able to drive away bitter cowardice 
from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses 
of my soul. Restrain also the keen fury of my heart, 
which provokes me to tread the ways of blood-curdling 
strife. Rather, O blessed one, give you me boldness to 
abide within the harmless laws of peace, avoiding 
strife and hatred and the violent fiends of death. 

As to the literary beauty of this version, there 
can be no argument, nor as to its fidelity to the 
original. But that of which I wish to speak is the 
beautiful spirit which it breathes. There are many 
passages in the Greek writers in which Ares is 
depicted as careering wildly over the field of 
battle, rioting in slaughter and drenched with gore. 
In the "Iliad" itself he is exhibited in the light of 
a barbarouslv cruel divinitv. But in this Hvmn

what a different conception is presented and it 
is worth while to remember that it is the only 
one to Ares among the thirty-three different invo- 
cations of the gods in the Homeric catalogue. As 
we know, the Homeric Hvmns were not written 
by the author of the "Iliad." That they are of 
later date seems certain. The Ares of the "Iliad" 
we may regard as the conception of a popular 
minstrel, who, in his depiction, was presenting a 
figure calculated to dovetail into his epic scheme. 
On the contrary, the Ares of the Hymn is, unmis- 
takably, a religious conception, and it a strik- 
ing fact, pointed out by Mr. Evelyn-White in his 
Introduction, that of the entire corpus of thirty- 
three Homeric hymns, that to Ares is the only one 
which can be regarded as truly devotional or litur- 
gical. Greek scholarship concludes that the others 
were composed for recitation at religious cere- 
monies by rhapsodes, etc. 

At this juncture, when the world's greatest war 
is dragging its slow length toward its third year, 
and all the great powers of Europe are arrayed 
against each other, sacrificing million after million 
of their most priceless manhood in an insensate 
struggle, their clergies are invoking the Christian 
God, to whom they one and all at least hypo- 
thetically bow down, with prayers and adjurations, 
how different from that addressed to this pagan 
war-god of an era antedating the birth of Christ 
by many centuries! They pray for the success 
of their arms, for the power to so successfully 
prosecute the slaughter in which they are engaged 
that their enemies may be brought defenceless into 
the dust before them. For greater strength to 
slay is their constant prayer. But what asks the 
pagan of his battle-deity? "Strength of war" he 
supplicates, but for this purpose "that I may 
be able to drive away bitter cowardice from my 
head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my 
soul." Not for fury with which to prosecute the 
task of blood-shed, but for force to "Restrain 
. . the keen fury of my heart, which provokes 
me to tread the ways of blood-curdling strife. 
Rather, blessed one, give you me boldness to 
abide within the harmless laws of peace, avoiding 
strife and hatred." 

What a lesson in humanism! What a rebuke, 
to a supposedly civilized and Christianized world, 
from a supposedly semi-barbarous and pagan 
one! What a powerful presentation of the truth 
that from the most ancient of the classics,, which 
modernity so scornfully flouts, we may derive 
concepts and precepts of a nobility which moder- 
nity, apparently, knows no more.

"AN ALMOST FOEGOTTEN ENGLISH 
WRITER." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
" Good wine needs no bush," but when a recent 
volume of " Everyman's Library " was mentioned 
as being "by Juliana Horatia Ewing, an almost 
forgotten English writer of fiction," we gazed 
incredulously at one another across " The Boston 
Transcript." We knew we were inconspicuous 



people whose literary loves did not count; but we 
took heart, remembering that Mr. Kipling, whose 
literary judgments are a deal steadier than his 
politics, had set the mark of his approval on " Six 
to Sixteen." And anyhow, it is always a pleasure 
to give testimony in favor of an old friend. 

Shall we ever see rose-colored tulips without 
thinking of John Broom's progress down the long 
walk, or the yellow May marshes without a fellow 
feeling for Timothy? (For kingcups shine as 
bright in our New England meadows under the 
name of cowslips, or marsh marigolds, as in a 
Yorkshire bog.) And how often have we checked 
one another in the pleasant occupation of castle- 
building with the comment of the Weeding 
Woman, " It don't become 'ee to forecast au- 
tumns." 

Mrs. Ewing is always classed as a writer for 
children. To be sure, most children are said to 
care little for her. It is hardly likely that a young- 
ster who has been fed with the works of Miss 
Nina Rhodes, for example, would find any interest 
in an author who never talks down to her small 
audience. Yet Hans Andersen might be proud to 
claim " Timothy's Shoes," "Amelia and the Dwarfs," 
and that whimsically pathetic " Land of Lost 
Toys " ; while " Benjy in Beastland " stands hardly 
second to " Black Beauty " as a plea for kindness 
to animals. If Mrs. Ewing does not always escape 
the charge of too often pointing a moral, it can 
be said that, like her "Aunt Penelope," she wraps 
it like a Christmas motto in plenty of bright paper. 
She entirely avoids another pitfall which our own 
Miss Alcott, with all her humor and common sense, 
does not escape: Mrs. Swing's young folks are 
too busy with their lessons, their dogs, their gar- 
dens, and their sketches to bother their heads over 
precocious love affairs. 

And what nice young people most of them are ! 
Cattishness, super-piety, a tendency to advise their 
elders, are at a discount. In " Mary's Meadow " 
the little heroine takes her mother's place, and 
carries a difficult task to a triumphal end; but 
the girl never seems disagreeably virtuous, in spite 
of the story being told in the first person. This 
bookish, flower-loving Mary, the Arkwrights, Jan 
the descendant of Dutch painters, these are a 
few that come to mind; but best of all is large- 
headed, notional Chris, a veritable masterpiece of 
child portraiture. And when Mr. Merwin wrote 
his essay on " Dogs and Men " why did he not 
mention Mrs. Ewing among the writers who knew 
dogs? We beg him to begin at once and make 
the acquaintance of Saxon and Rubens and the 
rest. 

Yet when all is said, the very best of her work 
falls into the class which includes " The Golden 
Age " and our own " Little Jane and Me," books 
about rather than for children. There is no 
earthly reason why at least two of her stories, 
"Daddy Darwin's Dovecot" and "Lob-lie-by-the- 
Fire," should not take their place among the little 
masterpieces of English. 

For Mrs. Ewing is a master of English style. 
Read the description of the midsummer evening in 
"Lob-lie-by-the-Fire." Read the opening pages 
of "Daddy Darwin's Dovecot," or the passage

where Jack Marsh listens to the choir, -and you will 
find an effortless perfection which makes this 
woman the little sister of the great writers of 
English. 

Perhaps the contempt for ''south of England" 
"softness" which Mrs. Ewing attributes to one 
of her characters was part of the nature whose 
sympathies seem to have turned to the country 
of Jean Eliot and Lady Nairn. Certainly, " soft " 
she never is. Pathos she has in plenty, but her 
shrewd common sense, her humor, and her reti- 
cence keep her from sentimentality. The treat- 
ment of a death scene is a fair test of an author's 
freedom from mawkishness. In the dying of Mc- 
Alister, Mrs. Ewing has written one such scene 
which comes nearer than most to the chapter in 
which Colonel Newcome says "Adsum." 

Two little English books given long ago are 
among our most cherished possessions. They are 
thin, card-bound little books, " Daddy Darwin " 
and " Lob," and " Mary's Meadow." Mrs. Ewing 
had the good fortune to find a most sympathetic 
illustrator for " Jackanapes " and the Yorkshire 
tales in Kandolph Caldecott. Who could have bet- 
tered such sketches as that of the baby John 
presenting the tulips to Miss Betty, or that of the 
nankeen rears of Jackanapes and Tony as they 
indulged in their first dissipation ? But in the col- 
lected edition the picture for "Lob-lie-by-the- 
Fire " is by Cruikshank, and never was a more 
unfortunate choice. Those loose-lipped squat 
women, who have stepped out of one of the artist's 
comic almanacs, are no more like her little ladies 
" than I to Hercules." 

Mrs. Ewing never wrote a novel. Probably she 
was not master of the variety which could people 
a large stage. Though she had an innate sense of 
form, plot must always have been a secondary 
matter to her. No doubt she wrote her north 
country stories just for the sake of drawing the 
landscape and characters she loved. When her 
little tales were told, she left them with no desire 
for a larger canvass. Perhaps, because like her 
peasant she was " no ways presuming," her work 
will outlive manj' more ambitious productions.

THE SHAKESPEARE TERCENTENARIES OF 
1916 AND 1864. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The approaching Shakespeare tercentenary 
celebration by our branch of the English-speaking 
race, to whom must fall the large share of the 
commemoration on account of England's pre- 
occupation with war, suggests the reversed circum- 
stances of these two great nations in 1864, on the 
occasion of the tercentenary of Shakespeare's 
birth. Then it was America that was embroiled in 
war, while England was free to celebrate the 
victories of peace, not the least renowned of which 
was the production of her greatest genius. 

In a tribute from America to Shakespeare 
offered on that occasion, Oliver Wendell Holmes 
answers England's challenge to the share of 



'warring aliens" in "her holy task" of keeping 
'her two-fold Saint's-day": 

O land of Shakespeare! ours with all thy past, 
Till these last years that make the sea so wide, 

Think not the jar of battle 's trumpet-blast 
Has dulled our aching sense to joyous pride 

In every noble word thy sons bequeathed 
The air our fathers breathed! 

War-wasted, haggard, panting from the strife, 
We turn to other days and far-off lands, 

Live o'er in dreams the poet's faded life,* 
Come with fresh lilies in our fevered hands 

To wreath his bust, and scatter purple flowers, 
Not his the need, but ours! 



In this dread hour of Nature's utmost need, 

Thanks for these unstained drops of freshening 

dew! 

O, while our martyrs fall, our heroes bleed, 
Keep us to every sweet remembrance true, 
Till from this blood-red sunset springs new-born 

Our Nation's second morn! 

Now that the tables are turned, so that it is 
England and not America that must answer the 
challenge, this recognition by a war-convulsed 
nation of the need of the master-mind of a 
Shakespeare seems as appropriate for England 
now as it was for America then.

ONE READER'S REACTIONS TO 
"SPOON RIVER." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

For perhaps the tenth time I have just closed 
that orgie of verse-prose, the "Spoon River 
Anthology." The first reading was the horrible 
experience of a nightmare. I rubbed my bewil- 
dered eyes, and asked the four walls of my stud}', 
"Is this poetry?" After the second reading I firmly 
concluded, "No, this is not poetry, nor is it prose; 
but it is life." Last night I was certain that 
"Spoon River is not life, it is death." To- 
morrow I shall reread parts of the book, and I may 
not know whether it is life or death. 

But this I do know: Great poetry must not 
merely reflect life, it must breath the air of a 
high idealism. It must present life truly, but 
wholesomely. This work does not satisfy the 
demands of the poetic nature. It is too earthy. 
It creeps like a reptile through slime and evil. 
We cannot turn to the pages of this book and 
become inspired by that "high seriousness" that 
dignifies the masters of verse, nor find the whole- 
some tone that graces the work of .those who sit 
on the mid-slopes of Parnassus. Rather, we are 
depressed; our imagination is destroyed, and we 
close the book with a disgust for its vulgarity. 

Nevertheless, there is life in this book, say what 
we will. It contains none of the "noble and pro- 
found application of ideas to life," rather, a 
description of life as naked and analytic as we 
might find between the covers of a work on sexual 
psychology. QRVIS B. IRWIX.

A MAXY-GIFTED WOMAN.* 



In closing her "Reminiscences" of eighty 
years, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe very modestly 
acknowledged what she called her failures, 
and with equal modesty summed up what she 
regarded as her chief successes. "It was a 
great distinction for me," she noted first of 
all, "when the foremost philanthropist of the 
age chose me for his wife. It was a great 
success for me when, having been born and 
bred in New York City, I found myself able 
to enter into the intellectual life of Boston, 
and to appreciate the 'high thinking' of its 
choice spirits. I have sat at the feet of the 
masters of literature, art, and science, and 
have been graciously admitted into their fel- 
lowship. I have been chosen poet of several 
high festivals, to wit, the celebration of 
Bryant 's seventieth birthday, the commemora- 
tion of the centenary of his birth, and the 
unveiling of the statue of Columbus in Cen- 
tral Park, New York, in the Columbian year, 
so called. I have been the founder of a club 
of young girls, which has exercised a salutary 
influence upon the growing womanhood of my 
adopted city, and has won for itself an honor- 
able place in the community, serving also as a 
model for similar associations in other cities. 
I have been for many years the president of 
the New England Woman's Club, and of the 
Association for the Advancement of Women. 
I have been heard at the great Prison Con- 
gress in England, at Mrs. Butler's convention 
de moralite publique in Geneva, Switzerland, 
and at more than one convention in Paris. I 
have been welcomed in Faneuil Hall, when 
I have stood there to rehearse the merits of 
public men, and later to plead the cause of 
oppressed Greece and murdered Armenia. I 
have written one poem which, although com- 
posed in the stress and strain of the civil war, 
is now sung South and North by the cham- 
pions of a free government. I have been 
accounted worthy to listen and to speak at the 
Boston Radical Club and at the Concord 
School of Philosophy. I have been exalted to 
occupy the pulpit of my dear church and that 
of others, without regard to denominational 
limits. Lastly and chiefly, I have had the 
honor of pleading for the slave when he was 
a slave, of helping to initiate the woman's 
movement in many States of the Union, and 
of standing with the illustrious champions of 
justice and freedom, for woman suffrage, when

to do so was a thankless office, involving 
public ridicule and private avoidance." 

To this impressive list of achievements she 
might have added others hardly less memor- 
able. She spoke with fluency and correctness, 
four or five modern languages, and had a 
scholar's acquaintance with Greek and Latin. 
She was successful, even brilliant, in many 
forms of literary composition, and if she had 
been contented to confine her abundant ener- 
gies to poetry or fiction or the drama she 
might have made her name still more illus- 
trious than it is in American literature. In 
music, both instrumental and vocal, she early 
developed talents that won for her high praise 
from those whose praise was more than empty 
flattery. And, not least of all, her beauty 
and grace and charm marked her from the 
first as one destined to shine in society and to 
impress by her endowments of person as well 
as by her gifts of mind and heart. 

Such was the woman whose "complete 
and authoritative and intensely interesting 
biography," as the publishers announce with- 
out overstepping the bounds of truth, is now 
offered to the reading public by her three sur- 
viving daughters. Its two volumes of about 
four hundred pages each are largely made up 
of extracts from Mrs. Howe's letters and 
diaries, so that the total effect is almost that 
of an autobiography, and the years surveyed 
in the "Reminiscences" are here, with much 
greater detail, many variations of emphasis, 
additions having to do with the last decade 
of her life, and not a little that could hardly 
be admitted by Mrs. Howe into her own story 
of herself, again passed in review. In a 
manner not fully .illustrated in the earlier 
work the precocity, one might almost say the 
ominously alarming precocity, of the child 
Julia is made evident by her faithful biog- 
raphers. From the solemn priggishness of an 
early letter to her cousin Henry Ward she 
happily recovered in good season. In that 
letter, written at eight years of age, she had 
said: "I hear with regret that you are sick, 
and it is as necessary as ever that you should 
trust in God ; love Him, dear Henry, and you 
will see Death approaching with joy. Oh, 
what are earthly things, which we must all lose 
when we die to our immortal souls which 
never die ! " A manuscript volume of original 
verse dedicated to her father by the twelve- 
year-old poet has been preserved. This is the 
dedication : 

To Samuel Ward. Beloved father, expect not to 
find in these juvenile productions the delicacy and 
grace which pervaded the writings of that dear 
parent who is now in glory. I am indeed conscious 
of the many faults they contain, but my object in 
presenting you with these (original) poems, has been

to give you a little memorial of my early life, and 
I entreat you to remember that they were written 
in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth years of my 
life. Your loving daughter Julia. 

What merriment in after years must have 
been aroused in Mrs. Howe by the remem- 
brance of that exhortation to her cousin (who 
had a good half-century of life before him) to 
view with joy the approach of Death, and 
how she must have relished the intense serious- 
ness of her dedicatory letter to her father! 
Not in every respect was the child the mother 
of the woman in her case. A keener sense of 
humor was seldom shown by man or woman, 
a greater freedom from pose and from the 
tendency to take oneself too seriously, than 
by this same Julia Ward of maturer years. 
The traditional theology of such childish 
effusions as her solemn entreaty to her cousin 
Henry fell away and gave place to a reasoned 
faith of quite another complexion. Her 
father, whom she fairly idolized, but who kept 
her under rather severe restraint at home, died 
when she was twenty-one, and thenceforth 
she was free to expand and develop as the 
wholesome promptings of her nature dictated. 
Brothers and sisters, cousins and uncles and 
aunts, with other relatives and friends 
innumerable, formed no unimportant part of 
her environment; masters of music and 
dancing and the languages contributed to the 
training and developing of her natural apti- 
tudes; and the pleasures of society, indulged 
in with moderation and discrimination, were a 
further factor in ripening her powers. Long- 
fellow, Sumner, Hillard, Horace Mann, Mar- 
garet Fuller, Emerson ,and others of note, 
were her friends, in some instances her close 
friends. With Dickens she became acquainted 
even before her wedding journey took her to 
London and introduced her to the best Eng- 
lish society. A significant reference to "Boz" 
occurs in a Boston letter of hers, written to 
her sisters in 1842. She says: 

Last night I went to a party at Miss Shaw's, 
given to Boz and me, at least, I was invited before 
he came here, so think that I will only give him an 
equal share of the honor. I danced a good deal with 
some very agreeable partners, and talked with 
Summer, Hillard, Longo [Longfellow], etc. I was 
quite pleased that Boz recognized Fanny Appleton 
and myself, and gave us a smile and bow en passant. 
He could do no more, being almost torn to pieces by 
the crowd which throngs his footsteps, wherever he 
goes. I like to look at him, he has a bright and 
most speaking countenance, and his face is all 
wrinkled with the lines, not of care, but of laughter. 
His manners are very free and cordial, and he seems 
to be as capital a fellow as one would suppose from 
his writings. He circulates as universally as small 
change, and he understands the art of gratifying 
others without troubling himself, of letting himself be 
seen without displaying himself now this speaks 



for his real good taste, and shows that if not a 
gentleman born and bred, he is at least a man, every 
inch of him. 

From those early visits to Boston dates her 
spiritual growth, we are told ; for those visits 
were not "given wholly to gayety, even in the 
days when she wrote, after a ball: 'I have 
been through the burning, fiery furnace, and 
it is Sad-rake, Me-sick, and Abed-no-go ! ' The 
friends she made, both men and women, were 
people alive and awake, seeking new light, 
and finding it on every hand." It was in 
Boston, naturally, that she first met Dr. 
Howe, and, as her biography adds, "at her 
side was now one of the torch-bearers of 
humanity, a spirit burning with a clear flame 
of fervor and resolve, lighting the dark places 
of the earth. Her mind, under the stimulus 
of these influences, opened like a flower; she 
too became one of the seekers for light, and in 
her turn one of the light-bringers." In this 
connection her first meeting with Emerson 
must be related in the words of the book : 

On every hand she met people, who like herself 
were pressing forward, seeking new light. She heard 
Channing preach, heard him say that God loves bad 
men as well as good; another window opened in her 
soul. Again, on a journey to Boston, she met Ralph 
Waldo Emerson. The train being delayed at a way- 
side station, she saw the Transcendentalist, whom 
she had pictured as hardly human, carrying on his 
shoulder the child of a poor and weary woman; her 
heart warmed to him, and they soon made acquaint- 
ance. She, with the ardor of youth, gave him at some 
length the religious views which she still held in the 
main, and with which she felt he would not agree. 
She enlarged upon the personal presence of Satan on 
this earth, on his power over man. Mr. Emerson 
replied with gentle courtesy, " Surely the Angel must 
be stronger than the Demon ! " She never forgot 
these words; another window opened, and a wide one. 

Illustrating the buoyancy and optimism that 
seemed to grow in strength with Mrs. Howe 
as she advanced in years, this little anecdote 
is told of her by her daughters : 

Our mother was once present at a meeting where 
there was talk of ancestry and heredity. One of the 
speakers dwelt largely upon the sins of the fathers. 
He drew stern pictures of the vice, the barbarism, 
the heathenism of the "good old times," and ended 
by saying with emphasis that he felt himself, "bowed 
down beneath the burden of the sins of his ancestors." 
Our mother was on her feet in a flash. "Mr. 
So-and-So," she said, "is bowed down by the sins of 
his ancestors. I wish to say that all my life I have 
been buoyed up and lifted on by the remembrance of 
the virtues of mine ! " 

Fortunate in her birth, happy in her mar- 
riage, blessed in her children, Mrs. Howe is 
now once more smiled upon by fortune in 
having as her biographers daughters so 
accomplished and in every way so fitted for 
the work as Mrs. Richards, Mrs. Elliott, and 

Mrs. Hall.

THE DIAL 



ANNALS OF A FAMOUS INDIAN TRIBE.* 



No one is better qualified to write of the 
American Indians than Mr. George Bird 
Grinnell. He has known many tribes inti- 
mately through the years. His " Blackfoot 
Lodge Tales" and his "Pawnee Hero-Stories 
and Folk-Tales" are standard contributions 
to the best ethnological literature that Amer- 
ica has produced ; his " Indians of Today " is 
one of the best popular presentations ever 
given of our aborigines. In " The Fighting 
Cheyennes," he makes a serious contribution 
to Indian history. 

Few realize that under the name American 
Indian great diversity exists. There are pro- 
digious differences in character and tempera- 
ment between different tribes. There are 
tribes that are noble, brave, progressive ; there 
are others that are ignoble, cowardly, stag- 
nant. Among the finest of our Plains tribes 
were the Cheyennes. They were rather 
sharply divided into Northern and Southern 
Cheyennes; and while Mr. Grinnell deals 
with both, his book is mainly the story of the 
northern branch. They are here considered 
specifically as fighters. They were actually 
among the bravest and most fearless of war- 
ring Indians. The story of their fighting is 
traced from the old days of their natural life 
down to their final battles of little more than 
twenty-five years ago. The story is told from 
the Indian standpoint, and as received from 
the mouths of the Indians themselves par- 
ticipants and witnesses of the events. 

The story covers three well marked phases 
or periods: that of inter-tribal wars with 
Indian enemies neighbors, rivals, trespas- 
sers on the buffalo-range; that of the strug- 
gle against white encroachment against set- 
tlers, path-finders, and soldiers of the United 
States; that of the fighting for us and with 
us, as scouts during the time when we were 
trying to bring about quiet and security in 
the northwest. Mr. Grinnell says : " The 
old time Cheyennes possessed in high degree 
the savage virtues of honesty, trustworthiness, 
and bravery in the men, and of courage, devo- 
tion, and chastity in the women. Of the older 
people who took part in the fighting with the 
white troops some are still living and to-day 
are the only sources of original information 
concerning the former ways of the wild Chey- 
ennes, the old free life of the Western plains." 
In his book, he first presents a sketch of " the 
ways of warriors " by a few selected cases. 
During their first fighting days, as we know 
them, their enemies were the Crows, Kiaways,

and Comanches ; with the two last tribes they 
ultimately formed peace, and the three peoples 
in their later war history were often fighting 
side by side as friends; the Arapahoes were 
usually their friends; the Sioux, in their later 
wars, were often with them, but were not 
always reliable or helpful allies; through 
practically the whole history of their contact, 
the Pawnees were their foes, and during their 
wars with American white troops the Pawnee 
scouts who accompanied and aided our sol- 
diers showed themselves implacable enemies. 
To the war contact between ourselves and the 
Cheyennes, Mr. Grinnell devotes the major 
part, of his book. Dealings with whites, some- 
times friendly, sometimes not, extended over 
the period from 1832, when Gantt carried 
whiskey to them, up to the council of 1856 at 
Fort Pierre, when Colonel Harney recom- 
mended that an expedition should be sent 
against them. The first real collision came in 
the summer campaign of 1857. From that 
time on until 1879 battles took place fre- 
quently between United States soldiers and 
Cheyennes. Most of these engagements were 
inglorious affairs for us, although generally 
victory was ours. Most of these troubles 
might have been avoided : many of them were 
due to our aggressions; some of them were 
acts of flagrant injustice on our part. The 
Indians were usually fighting in legitimate 
defence of their rights, natural or guaranteed. 
The story is an interesting, though often a 
sad one. Such an event as the Sand Creek 
Massacre (1864) is a lasting disgrace to any 
people. The most interesting chapters in the 
book are undoubtedly those entitled "Little 
Wolf and Dull Knife, 1876-1879 " and " The 
Fort Robinson Outbreak, 1879." A remnant 
of the Cheyennes had been sent south to the 
Indian Territory. 

They had come from the high dry country of 
Montana and North Dakota to the hot and humid 
Indian Territory. They had come from a country 
where buffalo and other game were still plenty to a 
country where the game had been exterminated. 
Immediately on their arrival they were attacked by 
fever and ague, a disease wholly new to them. Food 
was scanty and they began to starve. . . . The 
Indians endured this for about a year, and then their 
patience gave out. They left the agency to which 
they had been sent and started north. Though troops 
were camped close to them, they attempted no con- 
cealment of their purpose. Instead, they announced 
that they intended to return to their own country. 

We have heard much in past years of the Nez 
Perces' march under Chief Joseph, but little is 
remembered of the Dull Knife outbreak, and the 
march to the north, led by Little Wolf. This march 
was over an open country, where there was no oppor- 
tunity to avoid pursuers or to hide from them so as 
to get a little rest and respite. The story of the 
journey has not been told; but in the traditions of 
the old army this campaign was notable, and men

who were stationed on the plains forty years ago are 
likely to tell you if you ask them that there 
never was such another journey since the Greeks 
marched to the sea. 

Troops sent after them from Fort Keno overtook 
the little band before it had gone a hundred miles. 
The Indians were ordered to return to the agency. 
They refused to do so, and a fight took place. The 
troops left them, and the Indians went on. The 
fugitives pressed constantly northward, while orders 
were flying over the wires and special trains were 
carrying men and horses, cavalry and infantry, to 
cut them off at all probable points on the different 
railway lines they must cross. Of the three hundred 
Indians, sixty or seventy were fighting men. The 
rest were old men, children, women and boys. An 
army officer once told me that thirteen thousand 
troops were hurrying over the country to capture or 
kill these few people who had left the fever-stricken 
south, and in the face of every obstacle were steadily 
marching northward. 

The War Department set in operation against 
them all its resources, but they kept on. If troops 
attacked them, they stopped and fought until they 
had driven off the soldiers, and then started north 
again. Sometimes they did not even stop, but marched 
along, fighting as they marched. For the most part 
they tried and with success to avoid conflicts 
and had but four real hard fights, in which they lost 
half a dozen men killed, and about as many wounded. 

Mr. Grinnell gives the full details of this 
remarkable affair. The fugitives reached the 
north and divided into two bands. Nothing 
could be more different than the fates these 
met. Little Wolf and his people chanced to 
have to deal with Lieutenant W. P. Clark and 
General Miles, men of heart and men of brain, 
and were won to our cause ; Dull Knife and 
his band were so unlucky as to deal with Cap- 
tain "Wessels, and the result was the Fort 
Robinson outbreak. The event is only second 
to the Sand Creek Massacre, and its stain is 
indelible. 

The "fighting Cheyennes" are a thing of 
the past, but it is well that they have found 
their chronicler. An interesting thing about 
the chronicle is the fact that when an official 
report or an army record comes into conflict 
with the simple story as told by the red-man, 
it is found that truth regularly lies with the 
latter.

A MOXTJMENTAJ. HISTORY OF 
ARCHITECTURE* 



Rich in facsimiles and in printed extracts is 
the second part, as was also the first, of Messrs. 
J. Pearson & Company's catalogue of holograph 
letters and other manuscripts from "the world's 
most eminent actors, actresses, artists, authors, 
composers, poets, poetesses, scientists, soldiers and 
statesmen." Illustrious names fairly monopolize 
the pages of this attractive catalogue, and make 
of it a volume that book-lovers will wish to pre- 
serve for its literary interest, apart from any other 
considerations. 



It devolved upon the present writer to 
review for THE DIAL (March 1, 1907) the first 
volume of a proposed three-volume "History 
of Architecture," by Mr. Russell Sturgis, the 
second and third instalments of which were 
to be immediately forthcoming. A little over 
three years later the second volume appeared. 
Before the proof-reading on this volume had 
been completed, even, I believe, before all 
the material had been made ready for the 
printers, the man who had undertaken the 
gigantic task of writing this History passed 
into the beyond, and the work of completing 
that volume fell to his son. It was then 
announced that Mr. Arthur L. Frothingham, 
who had assisted the younger Sturgis, would 
undertake the preparation of the third volume 
and, from Mr. Russell Sturgis 's existing notes 
and data, complete the History. And now, 
at last, the third volume appears, accompanied 
by a fourth, made necessary in order that the 
ground be covered fully and the end be made 
consistent with the beginnings. 

Mr. Frothingham 's task has been no ordi- 
nary one. To write a monumental history is 
difficult enough when the writer has a clear 
field to survey, and is permitted to lay down 
the base lines himself. But when another has 
laid down the lines and determined the direc- 
tions, the task of carrying the work along 
harmoniously and consistently is indeed a 
heavy one. But Mr. Frothingham has accom- 
plished this task, and the entire effect is one 
of unity, although fortunately he has not 
altogether eliminated his own personal predi- 
lections or yielded entirely his own point of 
view. 

Readers of the History will remember that 
Mr. Sturgis, in his preface to the second vol- 
ume, attempted to explain why architectural 
history could not be written from the ethnic, 
social, and psychological standpoints, which 
THE DIAL'S review of the first volume had sug- 
gested as a most interesting method of attack 
and one employed by modern writers of 
history in other fields. Mr. Frothingham is 
very evidently of the same mind as the writer 
of the review referred to, for he states clearly 
in his interesting introduction to the final vol- 
umes that were he starting with a free rein 
he would proceed along the lines referred to. 
And although in the interests of unity and 
consistency he has conformed to the plan

established for him by Mr. Sturgis, yet be- 
neath it all one feels the pulsing of the deeper 
running under-current. 

This is particularly noticeable in the dis- 
quisitions upon the Gothic. One could wish 
that it were equally apparent in the treat- 
ment of the Renaissance, especially in the 
initial chapter. The Renaissance began in 
Italy and marked, among other things, a revul- 
sion in favor of art, as against what the more 
or less decoratively inclined Southern people 
considered science. The art of the Gothic 
really was art, and did not serve to cover up 
the science but to adorn it. The art of the 
South was sufficient if it covered up the real 
and basic thing, or so it would seem. The 
feeling for the horizontal, as against the ver- 
tical, was ingrained in the Latin peoples, and 
an application of classic forms so near to 
their hearts ministered more readily to an 
aesthetic expression of that feeling than could 
any further development of the Gothic prin- 
ciple, however it might be modified by the 
bands and string-courses or any means of hori- 
zontal accentuation. The Italians never had 
been able to express themselves in Northern 
Gothic terms, nor could they reconcile them- 
selves to the forms which the Southern Gothic 
assumed. Therefore, the Renaissance in Italy, 
and the reason for its slow spread toward 
the North. 

These final volumes, which enlarge the bulk 
and enhance the value of the History beyond 
the first design, deal with the Gothic and 
Renaissance and Modern periods. As to the 
origin of the Gothic, which he sets forth very 
fully, Mr. Frothingham is in accord with 
most students except those who ascribe a 
Teutonic origin to everything continental, in- 
cluding even the cultural spirit of the Renais- 
sance in Italy ! The story of the development 
of the styles in the various localities is instinct 
with life, and is fascinating to one interested 
in ethnic and social evolution. 

From Mr. Sturgis 's pen we might have ex- 
pected a well-nigh unabridged study of 
modern expression, for he was alive to the 
newer movements. But it is perhaps just as 
well that Mr. Frothingham concluded to deal 
with modern architecture in a few swift 
strokes, for after all, we are too much in the 
picture to recognize its true perspective value, 
and the things we can be sure of placing 
properly can be so placed because we rec- 
ognize their relation to some fixed point in 
the past. 

And now that Mr. Frothingham has accom- 
plished this task so successfully and accept- 
ably, is it too much to ask of him that he 
undertake the further task of writing a short 



and spirited history of architecture from the 
standpoint of ethnics and racial psychology? 
Such a work would not compete with the 
present History, and would find a warm 
welcome in many quarters.

RECEXT POETRY.* 



The verse of Mr. Alfred Noyes differs in 
several respects from that most characteristic 
of the present hour. For one thing, it is 
soundly and steadily rhythmical. And for 
another, it is largely objective even when 
lyrical whatever the theorists say; the sub- 
ject is rarely, if ever, Mr. Alfred Noyes and 
his highly personal reactions upon life. 
Again, it moves with a kind of colloquial 
freedom, not giving the impression of being 
wrought by one who seeks chiefly to be a 
maker of either images or phrases. And 
lastly, much of it is frankly moral and 
religious, and does not balk or boggle at the 
common traditions of the English race. Those 
who have heard Mr. Noyes read it before an 
audience are better aware than others can be 
of the meaning of these qualities : they have 
perceived the directness, the sturdiness, and 
the simplicity of the writer, his frank joy in 
his own melodies and musings, yet with abso- 
lute freedom from self-exploitation or pose, 
whether it be a sermon or a story that he has 
to communicate. For myself, I like all these 
characteristics, and am glad to have another 
book animated by them. Yet I must admit 
that they show their drawbacks. When one 
has a very strong liking for simple rhythms, 
a ready flow of words, and plenty to say, with 
no marked disposition to pause and ponder 
the more complex nuances either of thought 
or phrasing, we all know what is likely to 
happen. And with Mr. Noyes it does happen. 
Sometimes the rhythm seems to be running 
away with writer, reader, and all, not an 
unpleasant sensation altogether, but not quite

the pace for getting anywhere. I dare to 
hope much as I have enjoyed it in times 
past that Mr. Noyes will write a whole new 
volume without an instance of that garrulous 
repetitive effect of which he is so fond 
When like a sun-lit sea-wave, 
A green and crimson sea-wave, 

and the like, with its limitless possibilities for 
saying a little more than is needful. I also 
venture to hope that he will consider more 
curiously the values of concentration, of work- 
manship more closely wrought, which it is 
hardly thinkable that he should ever overdo. 
There are some signs, in the present volume, 
of a desire to give larger place to poetic think- 
ing, as compared with the charm of story and 
song ; but the results are not altogether happy, 
because either of insufficient emphasis on 
structure and form, or of a lack of concern 
for the values of single lines, sentences, and 
images. My meaning may be made clearer by 
a reference to Coleridge's rather unmanage- 
able definition of poetry as an art which 
proposes "such delight from the whole as is 
compatible with a distinct gratification from 
each component part." Almost every poem 
of Mr. Noyes 's is excellent in its leading 
idea; almost never does he fashion a truly 
memorable line except in the haunting 
simplicity of purely songlike utterance such 
as the much-loved "Come down to Kew in lilac 
time.'' The most pretentious poem in the 
present volume is that read before the Har- 
vard chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, and it well 
exemplifies what I have said ; for though noble 
in conception and spirit, it is singularly lack- 
ing both in firmness of structure and charm 
of detail. Even a patient Phi Beta Kappa 
audience must have found it taxing. But with 
all this by way of caveat, the book is a good 
and pleasant thing. The title poem is another 
of Mr. Noyes 's studies in the folk-spirit of the 
Elizabethan age, and combines, in his familiar 
manner, both narrative and lyrical zest. War- 
themes have their place in other pages, and 
are treated with dignity and sincerity. For 
reasons which I have tried to state, it is not 
easy to represent this poet's work by brief 
selections ; choosing rather at random, let me 
quote these caroling verses from a little song 
called "Older than the Hills": 

Older than the sea, older than the moon, 
Older than the heart of the May, 

What is this blind refrain 

Of a song that shall remain 

When the singer is long gone awayf 

Older than the moon, older than the stars, 
Older than the wind in the night, 

Though the young dews are sweet 

On the heather at our feet 

And the blue hills laughing back the light, 



Till the stars grow young, till the hills grow 

young, 

O, Love, we shall walk through Time, 
Till we round the world at last, 
And the future be the past, 

And the winds of Eden greet us from the 
prime. 

I do not know whose soul Miss Irene 
McLeod 's volume was designed to save ; for it 
scarcely shows sufficient unity of purpose to 
accomplish that high end for either author or 
reader. But it is none the worse reading on 
that account; it is, indeed, the poet's versatil- 
ity of mood and style which attracts one's 
attention almost at first glance. A part of 
the contents seems distinctly youthful, espe- 
cially in a tendency to use words for the sake 
of quaint or odd effects, and to shock either 
taste or attention by trifling impudences ; and 
some, on the other hand, show a mature 
simplicity which wins the attention by its 
intrinsic worth. Since I find nothing tempt- 
ing to discussion in the collection as a whole, 
I shall take space for representing two of Miss 
McLeod 's poems, which give honest pleasure 
in very different ways. Here is surely a fine 
little study of both rhythm and temperament, 
called "Lone Dog" : 

I'm a lean dog, a keen dog, a wild dog, and lone; 
I'm a rough dog, a tough dog, hunting on my own; 
I'm a bad dog, a mad dog, teasing silly sheep; 
I love to sit and bay the moon, to keep fat souls from 
sleep. 

I'll never be a lap dog, licking dirty feet,- 
A sleek dog, a meek dog, cringing for my meat, 
Not for me the fireside, the well-filled plate, 
But shut door, and sharp stone, and cuff, and kick, 
and hate. 

Not for me the other dogs, running by my side, 
Some have run a short while, but none of them would 

bide. 

O mine is still the lone trail, the hard trail, the best, 
Wide wind, and wild stars, and the hunger of the 

quest! 

And here are the closing lines, only, from 

"Mother to Son": 

Think you that life can give you pain, 

Which does not stab in me again? 

Think you that life can give you pleasure 

Which is not my undying treasure! 

Think you that life can give you shame 

Which does not make my pride go lame? 

And you can do no evil thing 

Which sears not me with poisoned sting. 

Because of all that I have done, 

Remember me in life, O son! 

Keep that proud body fine and fair, 

My love is monumented there. 

For my love make no woman weep, 

For my love hold no woman cheap, 

And see you give no woman scorn 

For that dark night when you were born. 

Beloved, all my years belong 

To you go thread them for a song.

THE DIAL 



[March 30 



Being a faithful admirer of Mr. James 
Stephens 's writings, I record with regret my 
suspicion that his publishers set aside for him 
more white paper than he has matter to fill. 
At any rate, "The Kocky Road to Dublin" 
is not the first book of his which seems to have 
drawn on every last scrap to be found in his 
current portfolio; and in this case it would 
be quite safe to skip the larger half of the 
contents. From time to time, however, one is 
rewarded by his familiar elf-like humor, 
peering by preference into the ways of clouds, 
winds, children, old folks, and other irregular 
creatures. Perhaps most characteristic, of the 
Irish sketches in the present collection, is this 
meditation called "Dunphy's Corner": 

Pacing slowly down the road 
Black horses go, with load on load 
Of Dublin people dead, and they 
Will be covered up in clay. 

Ere their friends go home, each man 
Will shake his head, and drain a can 
To Dublin people we will meet 
Not again in Grafton street. 

(Query : is the uncertainty concerning "will" 
and "shall," which Mr. W. R. Thayer has 
lately observed is found in the western and 
southern portions of this country, also trouble- 
some in Dublin?) But nothing in the book is 
so pretty as the little prologue on the Cherry 
Tree, with its odd echo of Elizabethan 
naivete: 

Come from your bed, my drowsy gentleman! 

And you, fair lady, rise and braid your hair, 
And let the children wash, if wash they can; 

If not, assist you them, and make them fair 
As is the morning and the morning sky, 
And every tree and bush and bird in air. 

Of American verse I note first two addi- 
tional volumes in the "New Poetry Series." 
Mrs. Grace Hazard Conkling has brought 
together for "Afternoons in April" some fifty 
lyrics, of which by far the greater number 
are attempts to reproduce the pleasure she 
has felt in sound and color. She is rather 
curiously disposed to describe the one type 
of experience in terms of the other, as if one 
were to seek to communicate the beauty of a 
poppy to the blind or that of a song to the 
deaf. Thus ' 

If form, could waken into lyric sound, 
This flock of irises like poising birds 
Would feel song at their slender feathered 

throats, 

And pour into a gray-winged aria 
Their wrinkled silver finger-marked with pearl. 
This flight of ivory roses high along 
The airy azure of the larkspur spires 
Would be a fugue to puzzle nightingales 
With too evasive rapture, phrase on phrase. 
Where the hibiscus flares would cymbals clash, 
And the black cypress like a deep bassoon 
Would hum a clouded amber melody. 



Or, reversing the process, on the Mexican 

nightingale : 

Clarin, from what glens of air 
Chime your cameo-colored bells? 
When they ring, I know them rare, 
Fluted like the lips of shells 
For the tone to ripple down, 
Honey-pale or amber-brown. 

It is certain that Mrs. Conkling 's technical re- 
sources, for such purposes as this, are notably 
rich and are dexterously used; and if her 
sensuous joys and unconcealed revelling in 
the arts of fine phrasing tend to pall on the 
taste, and to make one cry out for a bit more 
of thinking, it is easy to lay the book aside 
and come back to it another day. After all, 
it is still permitted to enjoy what is merely 
beautiful. 

Quite otherwise is it with Mr. Paul Shivell 's 
"Stillwater Pastorals." One of these is ad- 
dressed "To a Crooked Stick," whose mean- 
derings in the stream are taken as symbolic 
of the drifting but predestined ways of human 
life ; and there is no danger that we shall be 
lulled by this volume to merely sensuous 
pleasure. Witness this cacophonous opening 
of a sonnet addressed to a photographer: 

Never hard light full on thy subject streaming 
Our carnal cruelty exaggerates; 
But as a painter with himself debates, 

And chooseth values by instinctive scheming. 

But throughout the volume there is the direct 
recording of a sound and winsome personality. 
The pastoral element is rendered in the 
manner of Cowper or Wordsworth, that is, 
not by literary inheritance, but through the 
reappearance of their desire to celebrate the 
homely joys of sober and simple living. On a 
winter morning 

Ere yet these grounds and buildings loom from night, 
Or when by the waning moon kept visible 
Earth seems to anticipate the winter dawn, 
And cocks are crowing near and far, I wake, . . . 
Enter the house, light lamp, build fire, strip, bathe, 
Dashing my body with water fresh from the spring; 

. . . and after I have swallowed 
A few deep drafts of water I light my lantern 
And go out under the stars, in the dim moon, 
Or through black darkness, while the frozen world 
Is very still. 

One can imagine the amazement, not to say 
the amusement, with which lines like these are 
likely to be read in quarters where pleasures 
or pains of a more thrilling sort seem essential 
to poetic feeling. It was so with Words- 
worth's ballads and with Millet's peasant 
pictures. And I admit that, taking the col- 
lection as a whole, I cannot quite share the 
enthusiasm of Mr. Bliss Perry, who introduces 
it, for the poet's art; it is restricted, some- 
times tamely didactic, far from unerring in 
technical taste. Yet at times it is singularly 
rewarding, not merely in simple transcripts

THE DIAL

of life like the one just quoted, but even under 
such, rigorous formal demands as those of the 
sonnet. Witness this serene and noble 
example : 

What if my strength prevail not: is our flesh 
All there is of us? Have I fallen quite? 
Is nothing yet reserved to my delight 
Of all I once enjoyed? Still cool and fresh 
I feel the dew that never vanisheth 

From Love's green hills where youthful poets 

write ; 

And still at evening as at morning light 
I '11 flute and listen and await my death. 
Fair in high noon out on the purple seas 
Majestic argosies and clouds I watch 
And marvel at their glory, like a boy 
Dreaming, who never tires of mysteries, 
But feels upon his hair his father's touch, 
And in his heart shareth his father's joy. 

Of all the volumes on our list. Miss Sara 
Teasdale's "Rivers to the Sea" represents 
the closest approach to technical perfection. 
This poet knows the value of concentration; 
she knows the nature of a lyric that in order 
to seem poignantly personal it need not assume 
an air of shameless self-exposure; and she 
knows how to use the imagination as a means 
of thinking, not merely of feeling. All these 
things deserve wider dissemination. Here is 
a typical little lyric which unpretentiously 
exemplifies all three: 

Strephon kissed me in the spring, 

Bobin in the fall, 
But Colin only looked at me 

And never kissed at all. 

Strephon 's kiss was lost in jest, 

Robin's lost in play, 
But the kiss in Colin 's eyes 

Haunts me night and day. 

And here one of tragic import, called "The 
Poor-House" : 

Hope went by and Peace went by 

And would not enter in; 
Youth went by and Health went by 
And Love that is their kin. 

Those within the house shed tears 

On their bitter bread; 
Some were old, and some were mad, 

And some were sick a-bed. 

Gray Death saw the wretched house 

And even he passed by 
" They have never lived, ' ' he said, 

"They can wait to die." 

I wish, too. that I might take space to quote 
the delightful little allegory of "The Star," 
who counted a wooded pool more profound 
than the restless sea. because it reflected her 
face more steadily ; until 

out of the woods as night grew cool 
A brown pig came to the little pool; 
It grunted and splashed and waded in, 
And the deepest place but reached its chin. 

But I restrain myself. It is the quality of 
verse like this to be quotable, while its author 



may, on the other hand, never give us the 
special pleasure stirred by the extended and 
resounding narratives (say) of Mr. Noyes. 

It is to narrative poetry that we return in 
the next volume, Mr. Neihardt's "Song of 
Hugh Glass," where "song" is intended to be 
reminiscent of the Song of Roland and the 
epic mood. A very interesting experiment 
this, to treat the adventures of an early 
trapper of the American Northwest with 
something of epic largeness and against the 
wide background of the plains and the Mis- 
souri Valley. The story is one of friendship 
of man and boy, presented with a fine sense 
of romance and pathos blending with the 
rugged virility of the hero, and I at least seem 
to have been moved by it as the writer wished 
his readers to be. The Missouri River, he tells 
us in his preface, was to his own boyhood 
something like what the sea must have been to 
Greek boys of antiquity, and "as I grew older 
and came to possess more of my inheritance, 
I began to see that what had enthralled me 
was, in fact, of the stuff of sagas, a genuine 
epic cycle in the rough." It is no easy task 
to fit a style to such a purpose as this of Mr. 
Neihardt's, maintaining the dignity of his 
larger conception together with veracity of 
homely detail, and I cannot say that he seems 
always to have succeeded wholly; there are 
incidents and descriptions which somehow 
seem to have been enswathed, half muffled, 
in the conventional literary phrasing and the 
couplet verse. A little more of Mr. Masefield's 
daring directness may have been needed. But 
these instances are not many. And the natural 
setting is sketched in with skill, all the more 
notable because of its comparative flatness and 
want of color. Thus 

Snorting, a-haunch above a breakneck hill, 
The horse stopped short ; then Jamie was aware 
Of lonesome flatlands fading skyward there 
Beneath him, and, zigzag on either hand, 
A purple haze denoted how the Grand 
Forked wide 'twirt sunset and the polar star. 

(Is this a reminiscence of the ancient Oxus. 

that "flowed right for the polar star"?) And 

here is the reign of winter in the north 

country : 

'Twas warmer now; the sky grew overcast; 

And as Hugh strode southwestward, all the vast 

Gray void seemed suddenly astir with wings 

And multitudinary whisperings 

The muffled sibilance of tumbling snow. 

It seemed no more might living waters flow, 

Moon gleam, star glint, dawn smoulder through, bird 

sing, 

Or ever any fair familiar thing 
Be so again. The outworn winds were furled, 
Weird weavers of the twilight of a world 
Wrought, thread on kissing thread, the web of doom. 
Grown insubstantial in the knitted gloom,

[March 30 



The bluffs loomed eerie, and the scanty trees 
Were dwindled to remote dream-traceries, 
That never might be green or shield a nest. 

The central achievement of the whole volume, 
however, is its portrait of Hugh Glass, at once 
typical of the winners of the West and highly 
individual in the episode that makes this 
poem ; and none of this can be represented by 
extracts. 

Miss Widdemer's "The Factories" takes us 
from the plains to the heart of the city, and is 
concerned' with child labor and other social 
sores. It is also devoted in some degree to 
the new womanhood of this age, which is inter- 
preted with genuine imaginative insight. 
I who labored beside my mates when the work of the 

world began, 
The watch I kept while my children slept I will keep 

to-day by Man: 
I have crouched too long by the little hearths at the 

bidding of Man my mate 
I go to kindle the hearth of the world, that Man has 

made desolate! 

This is Miss Widdemer's version of the new 
social sense of her sex. She also realizes its 
potential tragedy as voiced, for instance, by 
"The Modern Woman to her Lover" : 
I shall not drag at your bridle-rein 

Knee pressed to knee shall we ride the hill; 
I shall not lie to you ever again 
Will you love me still? 

It would be easy to cavil at the art of these 
poems, to remark the strongly editorial 
character of some, and the obvious and ques- 
tionable effort to stir up pathos by others; it 
would be not unreasonable to suggest that Miss 
Widdemer depend less largely, for her effects, 
upon rhetorical refrains in italic type. But 
the earnestness of her purpose to call poetry 
to the service of a great movement, sometimes 
with unquestionable success, rebukes such a 
response. And, as if to show us that, if we 
wish more traditional themes of verse, they 
can be furnished, she adds a number of lyrics 
in the more conventional manner, poems of 
love, youth, and death, which are in some 
danger of being neglected because they seem 
almost to be the work of another author than 
her of the title poems. One of the best of 
them is the last, called "Wind-Litany," clos- 
ing thus : 

God, when all of earth shall lie 
Stripped and new beneath Thine eye, 
And Thy gold stars fall unstrung, 
And Thy curtain-sky down-flung, 
And Thy seas are lifted up 
Whole from out their empty cup, 
Grant me still, in Heaven 's place, 
Sweet swift winds across my facet 

Contemporary America is again very much 
to the fore in Mr. Lincoln Colcord's "Vision 
of War." It is also disapproved quite as 
strongly as by Miss Widdemer. 



The papers, of course, are run to make money, like 

everything else; 
But the trouble is, their income is not derived from 

their public support; 
This is the day of advertising the advertisement is 

master, not servant, of news; 
The advertisers are friendly with the financial crowd 

of course we have to cut out what they don't 

like; 
Most of the papers are owned, one way or another, by 

the financial crowd; 
It raises the devil with the whole idea. 

I have deliberately, though not maliciously, 
chosen for this first specimen of Mr. Colcord's 
verse as unbeautiful a passage as I could easily 
find, in order to represent the frankly exposi- 
tory, not to say didactic, nature of his work. 
He is not at all afraid of preaching and 
neither am I; but in the days when it did 
not take so much courage to regard poetry 
as somewhat different from prose, one might 
have had misgivings. At times, however, this 
book is genuinely imaginative, as well as 
marked by a sturdy eloquence which may cap- 
tivate the reader against his will. Thus, for 
instance, is the finer aspect of war defended: 
There no illusions about the body, no sorrowing or 

regret; 

The body seen in its true place, and given its just due. 
(Hustle it off, bury it quick, dig a shallow hole; 
Dust to dust it will help the next year's crops; 
No time for foolish ceremonies, no ammunition to 

spare for a parting volley; 
It is only death the man is done with his body now 

it is no more use to him or any one else; 
It was never very important not half so important 

as he himself imagined; 
Now it is the least important thing in the world.) 

There no mistakes about the spirit; 

The spirit alone esteemed, the man appraised by his 

spirit; 
All trappings, treasures, accruements, cleared away. 

Despite the crudity of style and the over-loud 
tone, I find more of poetry here, because more 
of idealism, than in the insignificant dabbling 
in sensations of some of the Imagists or the 
morbid naturalism of the "Spoon River 
Anthology." Mr. Colcord, as I have just 
hinted, talks too loud. John Stuart Mill once 
said that the difference between poetry and 
eloquence is that the latter is meant to be 
heard, the former overheard. It is impossible 
to think of Mr. Colcord's utterances as being 
merely "overheard." He has the dogmatism 
of orator, editor, and poet oddly mixed, and 
the mixture is not a sound one, for while all 
three are rightly dogmatic, they are dogmatic 
on totally different grounds. But his talk 
seems to me worth hearing ; he sets one think- 
ing, in a gusty fashion; and his vers libre is, 
I believe, better adapted to his grotesque 
blend of meditation, editorial, and harangue 
than it is to lyrical utterances, which one may 
rightly wish to find under control. Both his

verse and his spirit have more of Whitman in 
them than have any of Whitman's imitators 
that I know, and he presents a nobly spiritual 
concept of Americanism which is akin to Mr. 
BjTiner's in "The New World." 

In the last place we come to Mr. Braith- 
waite 's American Anthologj- for 1915, a 
book which may now be said to have become 
an institution. Mr. Braithwaite has amply 
proved himself gifted as an anthologist; and 
any man who is willing to read seven hundred 
and seventy-two pieces of magazine verse in 
the year, and to say with definiteness that 
three hundred and ten of them are poems of 
distinction, must command our respect, if not 
something akin to awe. A minor matter con- 
cerning these statistics is revealed in the 
present volume, namely, that the poems in 
"The Atlantic Monthly" are not included in 
the count because the editor refuses Mr. 
Braithwaite complimentary copies. Mr. 
Braithwaite, however, magnanimously reads 
at least an occasional number, to which he has 
access presumably in library or club, and 
includes some of the contents among his selec- 
tions ; for the first one in the book before me 
is Judge Stafford's noble national hymn, 
"Invocation." To review the contents of the 
Anthology would be to repeat the editor's task 
without his industry or equipment; I shall 
therefore only say that I doubt if any of us 
who might question his principles of selection 
would prove able to do it better. Mr. Braith- 
waite 's taste is catholic, and he includes some 
poems for which I could hardly find a place 
among the elect, just as Miss Monroe could 
find no place for Bryant in the magazine, 
"Poetry." But we of more fastidious tastes 
should learn to be liberal ; and because I wish 
to practise this teaching in all sincerity, I 
choose for special notice here a poem which I 
confess I should not cull out for an anthology, 
but which is distinctly interesting to students 
of current poetry. It is by one Mr. Richard 
Glaenzer, is addressed to Mr. Masters on the 
subject of his poems about Spoon River, and 
was published in the same periodical in which 
the latter first appeared. Mr. Glaenzer tells 
that Spoon River came to him as Chapman's 
Homer came to Keats, and, so feeling, he turns 
upon the critics who, like the present writer, 
spoke unappreciatively of it because of liter- 
ary prejudices: they 

are still squinting, 
And humming and hawing. 
"Is this poetry, or is it prose f" 
Life must be branded for the market! 
Art must be labelled like a mummy! 
And what of Truth? . 



The rhymers are still mumbling, 

And invoking Euterpe. 

"This is not poetry, nor is it prose." 

Art must be shapely, gemmed a reliquary! 

Life must be tuneful, like a caged canary! 

And what of Truth? 

This is an extremely significant expression of 
a certain point of view, and especially of a 
certain complete misapprehension of the atti- 
tude of those who seek to test new poetical 
| phenomena by principles which have been 
acquired in the past. But I have no space to 
discuss it here, and therefore leave Mr. 
Glaenzer to speak for himself, without grudg- 
ing his joy in Spoon River, but humbly wish- 
ing that he may hereafter climb Darien peaks 
that look further into the "pure serene." 
Returning to Mr. Braithwaite, I might cite 
him as a very positive witness in behalf of 
an assertion which I made in these columns 
some months since, that the present state of 
poetry is far from discouraging. His enthu- 
siasm for the living poets of America is 
inspiriting; I only wish that it were coupled 
j with more critical discretion. It is good to 
I err on the side of praise, but Mr. Braithwaite 's 
| judgments, as found in his collected reviews 
of current poetry at the close of the Anthol- 
ogy, are so lyrically generous that the coinage 
of his praise must inevitably depreciate. Mr. 
Colcord's poetry, we are told, reveals "a Pen- 
tecostal tongue of fire"; Mr. W. S. Johnson's 
"touch is always sure"; Mr. Thomas Jones's 
verse "comes to the reader as the essence of 
a spiritual experience which quickens the 
pulse to realization"; in Miss McLeod's "is 
the echoes [grammar to the contrary] of a 
mystery that troubled the dreams of the earli- 
est of authentic singers"; "pure lyricism was 
never more perfectly wrought in our day" 
than in the poems of Mr. O'Sheel; and "on 
the topmost peak" of American poetry "the 
place is occupied by the silent and lordly 
figure of this singer" viz., Mr. Arlington 
Robinson. (What it is to be a silent singer 
Mr. Robinson himself has perhaps desired to 
know.) It is hard to say whether the matter 
or the style of these dicta is the more sopho- 
moric. The Anthology, which is beyond 
question a useful book and a notable labor of 
love, would be much better off with much less 
of its editor's critical prose. 

All of which leads one to wonder what 
posterity, our only court of appeal, will say 
to all these men and things. As to how it will 
judge our poets I do not even presume to 
guess; but I am perfectly certain that it will 
find cause for many a merry smile in our 
poetic criticism both Mr. Braithwaite 's and 

mine.

RECENT FICTION.* 



The reader who is beginning on the new 
novels this spring may sigh just a little on 
finding that Mr. Basil King's new book is 
about a husband and wife who could not get 
on with each other. So was Mr. Webster's 
"The Great Adventure"; so was Miss Glas- 
gow's "Life and Gabriella"; so was Mrs. 
Atherton's "Mrs. Balfame," except that there 
the husband disappeared early in the business. 
So was Mr. George's "The Strangers' Wed- 
ding," for it would seem that such matters 
attract attention in England as well as with 
us. The novelists of the moment are giving 
deep thought to the great question (is it so 
especially characteristic of our time?) of how 
to be unhappy though married. The results 
of their speculation are in one respect the 
same; in each case it is the woman who does 
something about it. Mr. Webster has the wife 
vanish away, make a career, and come back; 
Miss Glasgow's wife, released from an un- 
faithful husband, also makes a career, and 
finds a more suitable mate; Mrs. Atherton's 
lady plans to murder her husband, but is 
saved the trouble by a kind friend; Mr. 
George's Sue merely can't stand it, and goes 
back to an earlier young man. Mr. Basil 
King's heroine (if she be one) waits around 
till her husband, having gone through the 
mills of the gods, recognizes her excellence. 

Such flippant and would-be smart mention 
(I wish I could do it better) may seem a very 
unworthy way to speak of so much sincere 
effort spent in handling so serious a matter. 
But really, so much of the same sort of thing 
is not serious, but almost ridiculous. A novel 
of this sort carries little conviction unless it 
is clearly a first-hand impression of life, a very 
intense appreciation of some of the conditions 
that make such things necessary. Why other- 
wise should a novelist's view of anything be 
more worth considering than yours or mine? 
If it be only that he has an idea, and con- 
ceives his plot and people to express it, he is 
but availing himself of people's willingness 
to read a novel to give publicity to whatever 
ideas, notions, views, fancies, or what not he 
has picked up by reading or thinking, just as 
any one of us may pick up such ideas. Mr. 
Basil King's book is as good a peg for a dis- 
course like the above as any other, for it has 
less character as a novel than his earlier work ; 
and people will like it or not as they may or 
may not be taken by the idea. It has not

much of a story; what it has is imagined to 
sustain the thesis. Its chief characters are not 
very good; the people are too much like the 
abstractions needed for the situation. It has 
some charming atmosphere or setting, prob- 
ably because here Mr. King felt unconstrained 
and could express freely and sincerely his 
true and delicate feeling for the beautiful 
things of nature. Its idea, or rather one of 
its ideas, that real goodness will in course 
of time have more effect on a man than a 
pretty face, is sound and very generally 
known and agreed to. 

I should say that Mr. Basil King, going 
from his idea to the life which shall present 
it, does not sufficiently realize his subject. 
There is too much "telling" in the author's 
method. The people appear before us saying 
and doing the things they would naturally say 
and do, but the author apparently has to tell 
us the important things about them. We 
lear~n that Thor held beauty in some scorn, 
that Len Willoughby could see he was not 
wanted in the banking-house, that Mrs. Mas- 
terton was a person of ostensible native refine- 
ment, that in Rosie's mind Claude stood for 
rest, that Claude loved Rosie for her pretty- 
face only ("of nothing else was he able to take 
cognizance") ; and other such matters. Per- 
haps the author could show reason for all such 
bits of information; but such things seem to 
be a reason for the lack of reality in the 
book, and if in the book, of the idea too. 
The things in the book that are good and 
there are a number of them come rather by 
the way. The old minister, for instance, is 
exactly right. He may not come directly out 
of life, but Mr. King would seem to have so 
true an idea of what real religion may be in 
life that he is quite safe in trusting to his 
imagination. It seems as if his main concep- 
tion were not so well-assured. 

"The Accolade" offers a considerable con- 
trast to such books as have been mentioned. 
Miss Sidgwick is possessed by no abstract 
generalization, that is, by no obvious one. 
One has, of course, a sort of sinking of heart 
on beginning a book called "The Accolade"; 
but one recovers at once on finding oneself 
safe in that inner ring, that better-than-aris- 
tocratic society, that idle moneyed world, 
which has rarely been better presented than in 
this book and its predecessors. On the face 
of it, the book is a story of people who spend 
their time doing nothing in particular; but 
actually, there is much more to it than the 
clever observation of an indulgent satirist. 
There may undoubtedly be some idea, ques- 
tion, view of life implicit in the story, but it is 
there as it is in life itself, and comes to us 



1916]

with the authority not of the author 's general- 
ization, but of our own. Life, as Miss Sidg- 
wiek sees it, mostly goes on with good houses, 
servants, clothes, and so forth, with dinners 
and dances in the season and breakfasts and 
walks in the countiy, everybody having as 
good a time as possible in a light-minded way, 
talking more or less cleverly all the time but 
never saying anything of much importance. 
Occasionally, however, life offers a clash of 
great "sentiments"' Miss Sidgwick curi- 
ously says (curiously, because in speaking of 
John she tells us that the Ingestres "had 
violent passions but were not sentimental"). 
Then there is a blaze of the real thing, and 
that is worth while, redeeming ages of rag- 
ging and idle talk and writing memoirs about 
one's ancestors and going to concerts and to 
theatres. Or else for sometimes it seems 
different at other times life is only a cyni- 
cal (not to say brutal) but disguised battle 
between men and women, constant decep- 
tion, constant cruelty, constant pain in which 
now and then (O wonderful and immortal 
gift of otherwise iron gods!) a man and a \ 
woman sometimes really love. 

Such varying views Miss Sidgwick may per- I 
haps have on life; but if so, she rarely 
explains her opinions to the reader. She 
naturally enough belongs "to her own class," 
and uses its language, of which the main 
principle is that the one thing never to be 
mentioned is the thing that one is talking 
about. Not that her feeling in the matter is 
simply the English assurance that it isn't 
done. Of course it isn 't done, and she doesn 't 
do it; but the fact is quite in keeping with j 
what I conceive (modestly and at a distance) i 
are her conceptions of the novel-writer's art. i 

Miss Sidgwick 's people are the natural 
product of an old and limited culture, and 
as a result they have a perfectly astound- \ 
ing knowledge of their own civilization, j 
-astounding, that is, to outsiders. They 
know people at a glance, or indeed without 
a glance ; such and such kinds of people (army 
people, for instance) are stupid, others not; j 
such and such people are perfectly obvious j 
types; such and such social customs, having 
acolytes and that sort of thing, are perfectly 
understood; everybody can be put in some 
class or other. That makes it unnecessary to 
say anything that conveys information, for I 
all is naturally known beforehand, by all at ! 
least who do know. Hence conversation is 
likely to be merely idle entertainment. It is 
not one of the necessities in the transactions 
of life, but one of its embellishments. 

All this (which is little exaggerated) is not 
as absurd as it may appear to many ; that sort 



of thing is merely the putting into rather 
conventional form of one of the well-known 
facts of life. We none of us can talk well 
about what we deem most important ; of course 
people do have "long and serious talks" with 
each other, but they must be chiefly had for 
the pleasure of talking, which is great; life 
goes on without much regard to them. And 
so it is, naturally enough, in some fiction. 
Some novelists want to tell us everything, 
and that may be a very good thing for people 
who need to have everything told. But for 
people in general it is better for the novelist 
not to tell us everything. If he presents 
phases of life that make us appreciate its 
poignancy, its delights, its tragedies, its 
cynicisms, its other things, he is doing all he 
need do; there is no call for him to stand by 
with a pointer delivering a lecture on the 
subject, like Browning in "Sordello." 

Indeed, the general idea about Miss Sidg- 
wick is probably not that she does not tell us 
enough, but that, like Mr. King, she tells us 
too much. John Ingestre, an artistic, brutal, 
clever, young Englishman, married to a 
stupid, respectable, and selfish wife, spends 
most of the time they are together in bally- 
ragging her. After he has done so for some 
ten years, Miss Sidgwick tells us that he has 
an eager and simple desire to have children. 
Now either this is not so, or else it is a matter 
of no importance, or else we somehow should 
have found it out before the book was half 
over. We are told other things about John, 
that as time went on he knew better and 
better what he wanted even though he knew 
it was foolish, that he was not one who lived 
by reason, that he charged himself to blast all 
obstacles to his heart's desire, and other such 
things about him. Here again if such im- 
portant things are true, we should not need to 
be told, and if we are told it is because Miss 
Sidgwick has not presented her man suffi- 
ciently from the first. 

Such little flaws, however, in a piece of 
refined and exquisite work need not be 
insisted upon; they are, indeed, only an 
uncouth way of disguising one's more usual 
pleasure. Life itself (when we get a good 
look at it) is so amusing, absorbing, delight- 
ful, exciting, stirring, thrilling, in fact so 
beautiful, that one must be immensely the 
debtor to anybody who is willing to give it to 
us by itself without the accompaniment of 
whatever theories, opinions, ideas, solutions 
of problems, convictions may happen to have 
resulted as a by-product of one ; s appreciation. 

Canon Hannay's "Gossamer" knocks all 
the foregoing disquisition on methods in 
fiction into a cocked-up hat, so far, at least, 



338 



THE DIAL 



[March 30 



as he is concerned himself. He is intent 
on pursuing his own object in his own way; 
and as he has a very especial gift, the reader 
is easily charmed into allowing and desiring 
him to follow his own object in whatever way 
he sees fit to use. His publishers give us the 
information that this book is more serious 
than his earlier stories, and add that it is the 
author's purpose to present the financial sys- 
tem of the world which spreads from one 
royal financier to another like a web of 
gossamer threads in an autumn field. Doubt- 
less Canon Hannay had this idea in mind 
when he wrote page 135, though he probably 
had quite a different one when he wrote page 
280. At one time or another he was presum- 
ably possessed by the enormous purpose of 
rendering plausible the conception that the 
immense system of finance by which the world 
gets along may be really fine, admirable, and 
beneficial. He at least succeeds in making us 
feel, now and then, what is meant by such a 
conception. But one can hardly believe that 
his thoughts did not branch out far beyond 
this rather academic view. He seems to have 
been impressed by something even more im- 
portant (to most of us), and fundamental. 

To present this important and fundamental 
something, he chooses a very absurd combina- 
tion of very characteristic people, who become 
involved first in the promotion of a new and 
improved cash register, then in a new develop- 
ment of the moving picture, and finally in 
the war. An Irish gentleman, a member of 
Parliament, a financier, his artistic wife, an 
inventor, what will one imagine from so 
jumbled a combination? Canon Hannay 
appears to use them to present what might 
even be called a criticism of life. 

This criticism is expressed in various ways. 
Sometimes it is stated, perhaps very simply, 
as when the politician remarks wisely : "Won- 
derful thing, life, keeps going on. Don't 
know why it should but it does. Nothing 
seems to make any difference." Sometimes it 
is put very wonderfully, as when the wife of 
the financier (in bidding good-night) says: 
" There is a spirit which moves the multitudi- 
nous blind gropings of humanity. It moves 
all unseen and unknown by men, guiding their 
pitiful endeavors to the Great End. That 
End is Duty. That Spirit is Art. To rec- 
ognize it is Faith." It takes a great humorist 
to make such utterances appe.ar even for a 
moment to be significant of deep truths. But 
Canon Hannay is not satisfied with any such 
independent statements. We might almost 
say of his people, as Sir James said of the 
exhibition of Tim's new cinematograph, "I 
do not know and at the time I did not care 



in the least what the figures were supposed 
to be saying or doing. It was sufficient for 
me that they were there." 

It would probably be ill-advised and cer- 
tainly impossible to state in a few words 
what Canon Hannay has taken a book to say. 
It is better to follow the example of the 
favorite landscape of Mr. Ascher, who chose 
for his picture "the moment while the mys- 
tery of dawn endured." It must be enough 
just here to say that "Gossamer" is the book 
of a man who has thought and felt deeply 
on many matters besides high finance per- 
haps even beyond it, and who has devised a 
singularly perfect way to suggest to us his 
thinking and his feeling.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



European Among the already large num- 

dipiomacy prior ber of books dealing with the 
diplomatic history of Europe 
immediately prior to the outbreak of the 
present war, Mr. Arthur Bullard's ''The 
Diplomacy of the Great War" (Macmillan) 
is easily the most interesting and in some 
respects the most valuable. It is the work 
of a widely-trained and remarkably well- 
informed man, one who is not only familiar 
with the extensive literature of European 
foreign policy (an excellent bibliography of 
which forms not the least valuable part of his 
treatise), but who is a keen observer of 
political affairs in Europe and who has known 
personally many of those who have had a 
share in the conduct of the foreign policies of 
Europe. As a starting point, Mr. Bullard 
begins with the Congress of Berlin of 1878, 
which he characterizes as a body having been 
composed largely of incompetents; and he 
reviews in turn Bismarck's foreign policy, 
which brought Austria and Italy into alliance 
with Germany, the recovery of France from 
the effects of the war of 1870-71, the growth 
of Anglo-German antipathy, the origin and 
history of the Entente Cordiale between 
England and France, the Franco-Russian alli- 
ance, the Algeciras crisis, the Agadir and 
Cassablanca incidents, the diplomatic results 
of the Turko-Italian and Balkan wars, and 
the other events which ultimately created a 
situation needing only the touching of a match 
to start the tremendous conflagration which 
is now sweeping over Europe. The point of 
view of the author is singularly fair and 
judicial. It is not difficult to discover where 
his sympathies lie in the present conflict, yet 
he has endeavored to be just in his conclu- 



19161 



THE DIAL 



339 



sions, and he has not hesitated to criticize 
both sides where criticism is clearly justified. 
He blames the Germans for pursuing their 
"grandiose ideal" of Deutschtum to the point 
of wishing to Germanize Europe when the rest 
of Europe did not want to be Germanized; 
he accuses the English of jealously disputing 
Germany's ambition to become a maritime, 
colonial, and commercial rival of Britannia; 
he charges France with treating the Algeciras 
convention as a "scrap of paper" and of con- 
tinuing "blithely as they had been doing in 
the past undermining the authority of the 
Sultan [of Morocco], fostering a kind of dis- 
turbance which would give a pretext for 
armed intervention, and by all sorts of dis- 
creditable tricks trying to drive out their 
commercial rivals." Mr. Bullard thinks that 
from 1913 on the rulers of Germany were 
planning for war in defense of Deutschtum, 
but he believes it was largely intended as 
bluff, and that they hoped to get what they 
wanted without fighting. Their criticism of 
British sea power, he thinks, would be unan- 
swerable if there were any reason to believe 
that they objected to any such arbitrary 
power per se.

islands of Melanesia, principally to the Banks, 
Torres, New Hebrides, Santa Cruz, and Solo- 
mon Islands, with supplementary visits to 
Fiji, Tikopea, Tonga, Samoan and Hawaiian 
Islands, are set forth for the expert and for 
the general student of sociology and of social 
evolution in Mr. W. H. R. Rivers's "History 
of Melanesian Society" (Putnam). Each of 
the two substantial volumes treats of a differ- 
ent aspect of the problem. The first is a 
detailed account of the survey work of the 
author in Melanesia and elsewhere in Oceania. 
This was directed especially toward the accu- 
mulation of data regarding kinship, mar- 
riage, and descent, and regarding other social 
institutions which would assist in their analy- 
sis. This was based upon the belief that we 
have in systems of relationship, which in 
Melanesia are far more complex and utterly 
different from those of Occidental civiliza- 
tion, like fossils, the hidden indications of 
ancient social institutions, and that their 
study is essential to the solution of problems 
in prehistoric sociology. They offer trust- 
worthy objective data incapable of modifica- 
tion by the collector's bias or preconceived 
hypotheses, and are therefore trustworthy. 
The second volume contains an analysis of 
the data thus assembled, and a theoretical 



i discussion of their significance. The author's 
; main thesis is that social progress results from 
I the inter-action of peoples, that migrations 
not only bring new factors and new features 
into the material culture, and new elements 
i into the social organization, but that the con- 
tact and inter-action of the peoples themselves 
have furnished the starting points for all the 
great movements in human history which we 
are accustomed to regard as Progress. He 
does not, however, consider individuals as 
mere automata for the transmission and the 
I recombinations of ancestral types of culture, 
but suggests that contributions may also 
| spring directly from the ideas, beliefs, emo- 
tions, and sentiments which serve as motives 
for the actions of man. These do not belong 
to any one culture, but are natural to man- 
kind. The author finds Melanesian culture 
complex, but derivable from three sources, 
a primitive society of dual organization con- 
sisting of two exogenous moieties with matri- 
lineal descent, upon which two successive 
waves of immigration from the Malay Arehi- 
i pelago engrafted many of the characteristic 
; institutions of Melanesia. The intricacies of 
the systems of human family relationships 
of Melanesia are traced to the social adjust- 
ments consequent upon these migrations. The 
study of these still persisting primitive cul- 
tures, surviving to our day because of their 
isolation, is destined in the opinion of the 
author to be not only of greatest value in 
the ethnography of the South Seas, but also 
of fundamental significance in studying the 
origins of human culture in Eurasia. The 
advance of civilization, and the migrations of 
laborers from these islands to and from Aus- 
tralia, bid fair to destroy forever all trace of 
these savage societies; hence our author's 
plea for prompt and searching investigation 
to rescue these evidences of the origins of 
human culture ere they vanish. The treat- 
ment is comprehensive, scholarly, candid, and 
logical. The work is well illustrated and well 
indexed, and both in method and in content 
forms an important contribution to the scien- 
tific literature of human social origins. 



The public The function of the survey 
school system not the old-fashioned sort, with 
mdm theodolite and measuring-chain, 
but the modern process so designated is in- 
creasing every year in range and importance, 
so that now not only have we municipal sur- 
veys, educational surveys, industrial surveys, 
economic surveys, and innumerable others, but 
there is also a widely circulated periodical 
bearing the name of this wonder-working 
operation. Not the least of the surveys at

present in process is that in which the city of 
Cleveland is engaged for the purpose of learn- 
ing all about its educational system and then, 
if possible, making it better, or, in the words 
of the Survey Committee, " to create a strong, 
well informed public opinion in support of an 
adequate school policy." A company of ex- 
perts captained by Dr. Leonard P. Ayres is 
studying each a different subdivision of the 
great educational problem, and the results are 
to be presented in twenty-five small volumes 
published a Aveek apart by, and obtainable 
from, the Survey Committee of the Cleveland 
Foundation. The first few numbers are al- 
ready out, and they make a favorable im- 
pression by their business-like brevity and 
directness. Opening at random one of these 
treatises, that entitled "What the Schools 
Teach and Might Teach," by Professor Frank- 
lin Bobbitt, we chance upon the following: 
" How one reads has received an undue amount 
of attention; what one reads in the school 
courses must and will receive an increasingly 
large share of time and thought, in the new 
evaluation." Again, in " Health Work in the 
Public Schools," by Dr. Ayres and Mrs. (or 
Miss) May Ayres, this sentence arrests atten- 
tion : " Dr. William Osier, the distinguished 
English physician, is credited with saying. ' If 
I were asked to say whether more physical 
deterioration w r as produced by alcohol or by 
defective teeth, I should say unhesitatingly, 
defective teeth.' " One other volume, " Child 
Accounting in the Public Schools," by Dr. 
Ayres, is at hand. On the whole, and to an 
inexpert outsider, this Cleveland educational 
survey promises well. 



The study of the history of 

Jefferson and . , . , , -,-, 

the Virginia American architecture may still 
be said to be in its infancy. 
Hitherto it has been left either in the hands 
of amateurs or in those of otherwise busy 
practising architects. In neither case has 
the close study of documents and the systema- 
tic search for new sources of evidence been 
given to the subject, so essential to arriving 
at definitive results. In "Thomas Jefferson 
and the First Monument of the Classic Kevival 
in America," Mr. Fiske Kimball has not only 
subjected the known material relating to 
Jefferson's work as an architect, and more 
especially to the authorship and design of 
the Virginia state Capitol, to the methods of 
modern scholarship, but he has succeeded in 
deciphering a mass of documentary evidence, 
the importance of which had not been sus- 
pected. While it has long been known that 
when he was Minister to France, Jefferson was 



asked, by the Committee in charge of the 
Capitol, to obtain a design for the building, 
and that he consulted with the French archi- 
tect, Clerisseau, there have been until lately 
no data on w r hich it was possible to base an 
intelligent opinion as to the probable propor- 
tion of influence of the two men on the 
character of the design. Through the dis- 
covery of some autograph drawings and 
memoranda, clearly by Jefferson, one is now 
able to trace with* reasonable certainty the 
influences which combined to bring about the 
final result. Unfortunately the drawings 
made by Clerisseau 's assistants were sent to 
Washington for the use of L 'Enfant in pre- 
paring a plan for the National Capitol. As 
L 'Enfant fell out with the authorities, and 
retained all the drawings for the plan of the 
city of Washington, the strong presumption 
is that he kept the plans for the Virginia 
Capitol as well. These drawings the final 
link in the chain have not so far been found. 
However, a minute comparison of Jefferson's 
drawings with the completed building would 
seem to show, beyond reasonable doubt, that 
the building, and consequently Clerisseau 's 
drawings, followed very closely the original 
studies by Jefferson. Mr. Kimball has made 
a careful study of subsequent monuments to 
determine the historical influence of this first 
building of the Classic Revival first not 
only in America but, an attempt at least, at 
a closer following of Classical precedent than 
had yet been attempted abroad. This work, 
which is a detailed study of one monument, 
is but a part of a comprehensive study of 
Jefferson's work as an architect by the same 
author, soon to appear, which will serve to 
clarify the history of a period of American 
architecture which has hitherto been very 
obscure. The chief significance of the mono- 
graph lies in the fact that it is one of several 
similar studies of early American buildings, 
in which scholarly methods have been used, 
and from which authoritative results may be 
expected. 

., The most significant of the points 

Disguise in the ~ J 

Elizabethan developed in Dr. Victor 0. Free- 
burg's " Disguise Plots in Eliza- 
bethan Drama" (Columbia University Press) 
is that the use of disguise may serve as a 
criterion for judging the technique of a play, 
as well as for fixing its place in the develop- 
ment of the drama. The modern demand for 
realism, which forbids the easy methods of the 
Elizabethan playwright in transforming a 
character from one sex to the other, or from 
one station or function in life to another, is 
such that the device has virtually gone out of 



1916J

use, except in the surprising disguise that 
appears, for example, in " The Servant in the 
House," or the very different " Seven Keys 
to Baldpate." And this does not come under 
the definition of Dr. Freeburg, who limits his 
theme to " a change in personal appearance 
which leads to mistaken identity," and who 
also excludes such disguise as that of the 
twins in the " Comedy of Errors " or of Vol- 
pone in Jonson's comedy. In his chapter on 
technique the author shows that even within 
the comparatively narrow period down to 
1616 treated in this book, there was an ad- 
vance in the desire for realism. In the morali- 
ties it was enough to change the name, and 
the audience imagined the rest; later an at- 
tempt was made to produce as complete an 
illusion as possible to eye and ear. With 
boys or men playing the parts of women, it 
was easy for the Elizabethans to accept the 
supposed transformation from one sex to the 
other, the one change which we to-day find 
most difficult; and with its abundant oppor- 
tunities for serious and amusing complica- 
tions, it is not surprising that it should be the 
most frequent of all the disguises. Dr. Free- 
burg considers it especially in its manifesta- 
tions of the girl masquerading as a page and 
the boy as a bride; the former for romantic 
purposes, the latter for the sake of a joke or 
extortion. The other most frequent manifes- 
tations were those of the spy and the lover, 
both of which might also make use of the sex 
disguise as a means to an end. The technical 
development of the device is seen in the rela- 
tion which complication bears to resolution, 
some plays never revealing the disguise, others 
using the revelation as the means of resolving 
the complication. Signs of decay in the 
drama are seen in such sensational extensions 
as the retro-disguise, or the disguise of the 
disguised; and the disguise concealed from 
the audience till the close of the play, when it 
comes as a complete surprise. Shakespeare 
avoids this latter device, which Jonson uses in 
" Epicrene," and he lets character truly and 
inevitably reveal itself through all its trap- 
pings and assumptions. Kosalind and Portia 
never cease to be women for all their doublet 
and hose. A bibliography of authorities and 
of plays, novels, romances, ballads, etc., is 
appended to Dr. Freeburg's volume. 



this interesting people as a distinct unit. 
From time to time during the past decade 
there has appeared in various historical pub- 
lications a notable series of articles dealing 
with important problems in Norman history, 
written by Professor Charles H. Haskins, 
dean of the Harvard graduate school, who is 
also dean of American mediaevalists. In 
February, 1915, Dean Haskins presented the 
more important results of his Norman studies 
in the form of a series of lectures deliv- 
ered before the Lowell Institute. These lec- 
tures have now been published in a volume 
bearing the title, " The Normans in European 
History" (Houghton). In eight brilliant 
chapters, Dean Haskins tells how the Norman 
race came into existence, what it achieved in 
the two centuries of its greatest activity and 
importance, and what impress it has left on 
the history of Europe. Beginning with a dis- 
cussion of the Norman land and people, Dean 
I Haskins tells briefly of the coming of the 
Northmen to the Seine valley in the tenth 
century, and then proceeds to trace the activi- 
ties of the new Norman-French people outside 
the French kingdom, in the British Isles, in 
Naples and Sicily, and in the Orient. An 
interesting and highly informing chapter 
deals with Norman life and culture, and with 
the extant monuments of Norman civilization. 
In one important respect Dean Haskins has 
introduced a change in historical terminology : 
what in the past has been called the "Angevin 
empire," from the controlling dynasty, he 
calls the "Norman empire," from the con- 
trolling race. It is likely that this suggestion 
will be accepted. The volume possesses cer- 
tain excellences of literary style which are all 
too rare in historical writing. 



The history of the Normans and 

^nd"lnflitence ry th 6 * 1 " reat achievements in 
mediaeval Europe has been told 
many times as a part of the history of France, 
of England, and of Italy; but not until re- 
cently has a serious effort been made to study 



The American Negro continues 

Two views of . 

the Negro. to be an object of peculiar inter- 

est to the traveller from abroad. 
Mr. Maurice S. Evans's "Black and White in 
the Southern States" (Longmans) is the work 
of one who from long residence in South 
Africa has become vitally interested in race 
problems. Realizing fully the pitfalls that 
beset the path of the hasty observer, he has 
labored earnestly to make no deductions that 
are not warranted by his data. On the whole, 
he seems to have succeeded fairly well, and 
he has considered every phase of the problem. 
Among the more interesting chapters are 
those on "Negro Organization Church and 
Lodge," "The Negro before the Court," and 
one at the end entitled "For South Africa," 
which is intended primarily to give the 
author's old acquaintances some suggestion 



342 



THE DIAL 



[March 30 



for the solution of their difficulties in the light 
of his American experience, and which, 
simply because it shows the writer on ground 
of which he has real command, is likely to be 
of more interest to American readers than 
some of the other chapters. Mr. Evans shows 
a decided leaning toward the practical and 
opportunist school of Negro thought, and for 
this reason (as in such a chapter as that 
headed "The Two Schools") he finds it hard 
to be fair to those who are more idealistic in 
their thinking. Sometimes, too, we could wish 
that he had continued his investigations a 
little further before making his conclusions. 
On the whole, the book contains little that is 
new. Such a volume as Mr. Evans's falls all 
too easily into a consideration of the Negro as 
a problem rather than as a human being. Just 
here is the point that distinguishes from it 
such a book as Dr. C. V. Roman's "American 
Civilization and the Negro" (Philadelphia: 
F. A. Davis Co.), a work somewhat below 
it in literary form, though neither is especially 
strong in that quality. At least one feels here 
that in large measure the soul of a man has 
gone into his book. Dr. Koman is a physician 
of standing in Nashville, and he very frankly 
makes a plea, to some extent along biological 
lines, for his people. His book, we are told 
(p. 377), is "a brief, not a credo; primarily 
it is a summary and an analysis of the testi- 
mony of others," being only incidentally an 
expression of the author's personal opinions 
and beliefs. As in Mr. Evans's work, there 
are frequent quotation marks, and sometimes 
one wonders if the numerous citations of his- 
tory and literature are really relevant or 
necessary. However, because the author has 
lived with the things of which he writes, and 
because his work has evidently taken its own 
time in maturing, his book somehow furnishes 
endless food for thought. It shows, moreover, 
an excellent acquaintance with the literature 
of the subject, and is well illustrated. 



Ford Hall, named for and owing 
Seven years its existence to the late Daniel 

Sharp Ford, of "Youth's Com- 
panion" fame, has been aptly called by one 
of the constant attendants at its Sunday even- 
ing meetings, "the cradle of fraternity," 
just as Faneuil Hall in the same city was 
long ago styled "the cradle of liberty." The 
fraternal weekly gatherings at Ford Hall, to 
listen to some speaker with a message to the 
people, have for eight years been attracting 
wider and wider attention, until now the 
Ford Hall idea and open forum movement are 
known throughout the country. Mr. George 



W. Coleman, to whose inspiration and un- 
selfish zeal these meetings owe their origin 
and continuance, has planned, compiled, and 
edited "a symposium" having as its title 
"Democracy in the Making" (Little, Brown 
& Co.), and sub-titled, "Ford Hall and the 
Open Forum Movement." Its purpose is "to 
give the facts about Ford Hall, to set forth 
its spirit, and make plain its mission, in the 
hope that others will undertake the establish- 
ment of similar meetings elsewhere." The 
four parts into which the book is divided 
"tell in turn how the work is done, what is 
thought of it, who are in the audience, and 
what is the character of the addresses deliv- 
ered there." The various chapters are volun- 
tary contributions from persons prominent in 
Ford Hall activities, notably Miss Mary 
Caroline Crawford, Executive Secretary of 
the meetings, who gives a breezy sketch of 
"dramatic incidents" and an interesting "roll 
of personalities." Profits from the sale of the 
book will go to the Ford Hall Foundation. 



Africa as the battle-ground of 
8es li v i n o languages in the making- 
is the fascinating picture one 
gets from Professor Carl Meinhof 's " Intro- 
duction to the Study of African Languages " 
(Dutton), recently translated by Dr. A. 
Werner. An accompanying map by Bern- 
hard Struck exhibits the following astounding 
linguistic resources of the continent : Semitic. 
10 languages and 12 dialects ; Hamitic, 47 lan- 
guages and 71 dialects ; Bantu, 182 languages 
and 119 dialects ; Sudanic, 264 languages and 
114 dialects; Bushman, 11 languages and 3 
dialects; besides Hottentot, which investiga- 
tion has barely touched. The book is an 
elementary and profoundly significant con- 
tribution to the science of comparative lan- 
guage study. As such it will be of prime 
interest to every student of any language, 
whether or not he has the slightest direct 
concern with African tongues. The author 
stoutly maintains that "the linguist working 
at primitive languages has to deal with much 
better and more trustworthy materials than 
the ordinary philologist." The discussion of 
well known linguistic phenomena, such as 
Grimm's Law, Ablaut, the i umlaut, as well as 
the general remarks on Phonetics, Grammar, 
and Morphology, are of absorbing interest. 
To the amateur, the most remarkable feature 
of these strange agglutinative tongues is the 
part which melody or pitch plays in word 
meanings. Even more important than accent 
to us is pitch to the Bantu peoples. For in- 
stance, in Ewe, the two words ele afi may be

intoned to mean either "he is here," or ''he 
rubbed himself with ashes,'' or "he caught a 
mouse." The present reviewer, reading from 
the angle of a student of Old English, finds a 
number of curious resemblances to primitive 
phenomena in that tongue ; and no doubt stu- 
dents in other fields would note similar coinci- 
dences. The author's honest zeal is shown by 
the fact that he has studied the Bantu lan- 
guages for twenty-five years, and has so far 
refrained from writing his contemplated 
" Comparative Grammar." He has published 
only the " Outlines " ( Grundziige, Berlin, 
1906) . It is noteworthy that during the pres- 
ent suspension of scholarly work in Europe, 
lectures by a German can still be translated 
by one connected with an English University, 
and published by an English house. However, 
nothing could be more dispassionate and neu- 
tral than comparative philology. 



A new 

student's 

manual. 



"How to Study and What to 
Study" (Heath), by Mr. Rich- 
ard L. Sandwick, principal of 
the Deerfield-Shields High School, Highland 
Park, Illinois, is a well written volume the 
perusal of which will stimulate and otherwise 
improve the average reader of high school 
or college age. A few of the elder generation 
will be reminded by it of the Rev. John Todd 's 
"Student's Manual" of thirty years ago, a 
work characterized by deep and effective 
moral earnestness. Mr. Sandwick 's manual is 
directed solely toward intellectual ends. The 
first part, entitled "The Principles of Effec- 
tive Study." treats of such subjects as study- 
ing aloud, the value of a synopsis, when and 
how to read rapidly, and study and fatigue. 
The second part, on "What to Study and 
How." is not, as might be supposed, devoted 
to a plea for any particular course or branch 
of study, but presents concisely, and probably 
as impartially as possible, the ordinarily ac- 
cepted reasons for the study of the branches 
usual in the high school, including chapters 
on the vocational studies and the older pro- 
fessions. Methods of study are also recom- 
mended. The author bases his work on thirty 
pedagogical works cited in the preface. Its 
prevailing tone is nevertheless that of reality 
and common sense. 



Chapters of 

anecdotal 

biography. 



Mrs. A. M. W. Stirling's re- 
searches among musty memoirs 
have borne fruit in a collection 
of anecdotal biographies the reverse of musty, 
entitled "A Painter of Dreams, and Other 
Biographical Studies" (Lane). The painter 
referred to is the late Roddani Spencer Stan- 
hope, uncle of the author. The seven studies 



in the book treat of Diana Bosville's "Book 
of Extracts," an old-fashioned scrap-book of 
the Georgian era; her son William Bosville, 
introduced to us as "A Friend of Freedom"; 
the autocratic William Anne Keppel, second 
Earl of Albemarle; the beautiful Elizabeth 
Patterson, afterward Madame Bonaparte, "A 
Dupe of Destiny," as she is called in the 
chapter-heading; her even more beautiful 
sister-in-law, Mrs. Robert Patterson (Mary 
Caton), "A Favorite of Destiny" ; the eminent 
painter of horses and other animals, John 
Frederick Herring, "A Painter of Realities"; 
and the artist who, as "a painter of dreams," 
supplies the book with its title. More truly 
descriptive of the volume would have been the 
heading to its first chapter, *'A Georgian 
Scrap-Book," but Mrs. Sterling ably defends 
her choice of a title, and surely she has a right 
to christen the offspring of her brain. It is an 
entertaining and often amusing book. A por- 
tion of its contents has already found favor 
with the editor and the readers of a leading 
English review. Fifteen full-page illustra- 
tions are inserted. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



11 The American Whitaker Almanac and Ency- 
clopedia " is published in a new edition for 1916, 

i with its nearly six hundred pages of indexed facts 
regarding the United States and the other coun- 
tries of the world brought thoroughly up to date. 
A useful summary of events in the great war, from 

I the beginning to the present time, is appended. 

| " The American Whitaker " promises to become as 

; indispensable in this country as its English proto- 
type has long been abroad. The Macmillan Co. 
publishes the volume. 

An attractive volume with the captivating title, 

! "Legends of Gods and Ghosts," is published by 

; Messrs. G. H. Ellis & Co. The author, Mr. W. D. 

; Westervelt, who is also the author of " Legends of 

| Old Honolulu," has lived for many years in the 

I Hawaiian Islands, and this interpretation of 

i Hawaiian mythology shows a depth of sympathy 

I commensurable with that of Lafcadio Hearn for 

the Japanese. Some of the stories, as for example 

the last in the volume, u The Bride from the 

Under- World," are told with spirit and charm. 

The details of newspaper desk-work, especially 
copy-reading, and after that headline-writing, 
proof-reading, make-up, and what are known as 
"re-write" and "follow-up" "stories," witjfc 
chapters on printing machinery and processes and 
" small publication work," will be found in the 
compact and attractive manual entitled "News- 
paper Editing (Appleton), by Mr. Grant Milnor 
Hyde, formerly on the staff of a New York City 
daily, and now instructor in journalism at the 
University of Wisconsin. The book supplements

Correspondence," and gives to editorial and other 
desk-work a careful attention that is found in 
few of any previous handbooks for the use of 
prospective journalists. A useful chronology of 
the printing art and of newspaper development is 
appended, also a " style sheet," with general direc- 
tions for the preparation of copy. A good index 
closes the book. 

Mr. Ernest A. Bench's " Making the Movies " 
(Macmillan) is a crisply written and neatly printed 
little book of forty diminutive chapters on such 
subjects as: Putting on a Photoplay, Do the 
Players Drink Intoxicants in Motion Pictures, 
Movie Stars Who Risk Their Lives, Motion Picture 
Making Towns and Estates, How Railroad Photo- 
plays Are Made, Aviation in the Movies, Filming 
Earthquakes, Floriculture by Motion Pictures, 
Making Films under the Sea, In a Film Factory. 
As the forty chapters amount to only one hundred 
and seventy-six pages, whose content is besides, 
after the manner of stage talk, somewhat gossipy, 
the reader who is led by the title and chapter- 
headings to expect detailed and thorough informa- 
tion should not be surprised to find the book dis- 
appointingly slight. 

To their excellent "Musicians Library," the 
merits of which must by this time be well known 
to every music lover, Messrs. Ditson have lately 
added a two-volume collection of "Modern Rus- 
sian Piano Music" edited by Constantin von 
Sternberg, and a book of "Sixty Irish Songs" 
selected and edited by Mr. William Arms Fisher. 
The present Russian renascence makes the first- 
named work particularly timely and welcome. Pro- 
duced in similar form and equally irreproachable 
in external details, though not part of the same 
series, are two other recent publications of Messrs. 
Ditson "My Favorite French Songs," selected by 
Madame Calve, and "My Favorite Songs," selected 
by Miss Julia Gulp. Each of these collections is 
in two volumes, and together they provide the 
soprano singer with infinite musical riches in a 
little room. 

Notwithstanding heavy difficulties which the war 
must impose upon its editors and publishers, the 
" Loeb Classical Library " (Macmillan) continues 
to make steady and satisfactory progress. The 
latest instalment of half a dozen volumes is evenly 
divided between the Greek and Latin sections. In 
the former, we have " The Odes of Pindar," trans- 
lated by Sir John Sandys; the second volume of 
Lucian, in the translation by Professor Harmon of 
Princeton; and Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and 
Homerica, comprising in a single volume prac- 
tically all that remains of the post-Homeric and 
pre-academic epic poetry, translated by Dr. Hugh 
G. Evelyn- White. For the two additions to the 
Latin section, the editors have wisely had recourse 
(not, however, without considerable redaction) to 
translations which have become as classic in their 
way as the originals, that of William Melmoth 
for the two-volume edition of Pliny's Letters, and 
that of W. Adlington for " The Golden Ass " of 
Apuleius. The support and encouragement of this 
splendid series on the part of scholarly readers 
cannot be too often or insistently urged. 



Distinctly inferior in quality to certain of its 
predecessors is Mr. Eric Fisher Wood's plea for 
greater defences, entitled "The Writing on the 
Wall" (Century Co.). It is not less modest, how- 
ever, in its views of what constitutes adequate 
defence, for it declares that unless we secure our 
coasts by a navy virtually twice as large and 
effective as that of any other nation, we need a 
minimum of 2,500,000 men to defend our territory 
against invasion by any single great power. These 
estimates might well have been suspected to be 
those of military men, without Mr. Wood's 
acknowledgment to that effect. They rest upon a 
comparison of our military establishment with 
those of potential adversaries; it is like comparing 
the fists or teeth of two persons, and from these 
determining their relative strength. Happily, 
there are things besides teeth and fists that make 
for strength ; and in such our rating is not hopeless. 

A curiosity in limited editions is Mr. Charles N. 
Elliott's "Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and 
Friend" (Badger), being the result of nearly 
twenty years of occasional letter writing to Whit- 
man's friends and admirers, soliciting some auto- 
graph reminiscence or anecdote of the poet or 
some tribute to his genius. More than two-score 
replies are here reproduced in facsimile, with 
appropriate quotations, prose and verse, from 
Whitman himself, from Mr. Horace Traubel, and 
from other Whitman-lovers. Inevitably the fac- 
simile plan of the book has involved the printing 
of much atrocious handwriting, while there is (in- 
evitably also) no great amount of really valuable 
new literature on the man, poet, and friend, 
Whitman; but the whole forms a pleasing and 
uncommon souvenir of the imperishable " Walt," 
its constituent parts signed by men so diverse in 
character and tastes as Andrew Carnegie and 
John Vance Cheney, Whitelaw Reid and Peter 
Doyle, Professor Dowden and Elbert Hubbard. 

Of chief interest among the latest additions to 
" Everyman's Library " (Dutton) is a two-volume 
edition of Green's "Short History of England," 
edited and revised by Mr. L. Cecil Jane, with an 
appendix by Dr. R. P. Farley continuing the his- 
tory from Waterloo (where Green left it) to 1914. 
Welcome, also, is a volume of William Penn's 
collected writings, leading off with the " Essay 
toward the Present and Future Peace of Europe, 
by the Establishment of an European Parliament, 
or Estates," as timely to-day as when it first ap- 
peared in 1693. Two volumes of Mrs. Ewing's 
stories ought to do something toward reawakening 
the spell which that writer exercised upon youthful 
readers of an earlier generation, particularly when 
" Jackanapes " is given the added charm of Ran- 
dolph Caldecott's illustrations. In addition to 
these volumes, we have Balzac's " Ursule Mirouet " ; 
George Macdonald's " Phantastes " ; Ibsen's " Lady 
Inger," "The League of Youth," and "Love's 
Comedy," in a single volume; Cardinal Newman's 
" Scope and Nature of University Education " ; 
Dickens's " Edwin Drood " and " Master Humph- 
rey's Clock," in one volume, with a preface by 
Mr. Chesterton; and the Duchess of Newcastle's 
writings.

Compton Rickett, is an interesting item among the

can stretcher-bearer in the Belgian army, is an- 
nounced for early publication by the Century Co.

By the Yellow Sands," devised and written by Mr. 
Percy MacKaye for the tercentenary celebration, 
will be published immediately by Messrs. Double- 
day, Page & Co. 

The influence of the war upon marriage and 
the birth-rate, and the general position of mar- 
riage in modern life, are discussed by Mr. Walter 
Gallichan in a work entitled "The Great Unmar- 
ried," to be published this spring. 

A study of "Samuel Butler, author of ' Ere- 
whon ' : The Man and His Work," by Mr. J. F.

bibliography and a portrait of Butler taken shortly 
before his death, will be included.

A novel by Mr. Vance Thompson, entitled "The

and Man," the authorized life of the great theatri- 
cal magnate, by Messrs. Isaac F. Marcosson and 
Daniel Frohman, will be brought out in book form 
early in the autumn by Messrs. Harper. A 
portion of this biographical material is now 
appearing in serial form. 

A work by Professor R. A. Gregory entitled 
" Disco very: Or the Spirit and Service of Science," 
is announced by Messrs. Macmillan. The authors 
purpose is to show that scientific research has not 
only added to material welfare and increased the 
comforts of life, but has also inspired the highest 
ethical thought and action. 

"Present-Day China: A Narrative of a Nation's 
Advance," being a short study of the problems, 
the achievements, and the prospects of the Chinese

the friendship of many leaders of the New China 
and enjoyed unusual advantages for observation 
and study. 

Within the next few weeks the Century Co. will 
publish "Principal English Plays," edited by 
Professor John S. P. Tatlock, of Leland Stanford 
University, and Mr. Robert G. Martin, of North- 
western University. The volume will contain a 
collection of about twenty-five representative plays, 
showing the development of the drama from ear- 
liest times to the present day. 

"Shakespeare the Player and Other Papers 
Illustrative of Shakespeare's Personality," by Mr. 
Alexander Cargill, will be published in time for 
the forthcoming tercentenary celebrations. The 
author has gathered all the accredited facts relating 
to Shakespeare's career as a player, and endeav- 
ored to discern something of his form and 
personality from the evidence of his contem- 
poraries. 

Among other forthcoming publications of the 
University of Chicago Press are: "Essays in 
Experimental Logic," by Professor John Dewey; 
"Principles of Money and Banking, Developed in 
a Series of Readings," edited by Mr. Harold G. 
Moulton; "The Story of the New Testament," by 
Dr. Edgar Johnson Goodspeed; and "The Nulli- 
fication Controversy in South Carolina," by Mr. 
Clarence S. Boucher. 

For nearly three years Mr. Fremont Rider, 
editor of "The Publishers' Weekly," has been 
supervising the preparation of an entirety new 
series of guide books, which aim to do for 
America (the United States in particular) what 
the Baedeker guides have done for Europe. In 
form they will resemble Baedeker, and will con- 
tain no illustrations other than maps and plans. 
The first volume, "Rider's New York City," is 
now in press. Messrs. Holt are the publishers of 
the series. 

A correspondent of the London "Times" sends 
to that journal the following note on the funeral 
of Henry James: "Many besides Mr. Gosse of 
those who on Friday paid their last tribute to 
Henry James must have been penetrated with the 
extraordinary appropriateness of the setting to 
the occasion. Nothing- could have been more con-

sonant with his own feeling and genius than this 
wonderful old London church, by some miracle 
probably the most unspoilt in all England, from 
whose aisles and monuments a thousand associa- 
tions rise like incense, and whose speaking silence 
seems to teach in all its deep humanity, compunc- 
tion, and understanding the very ' lesson of the 
Master.' The green wreath lay on the pall, but 
there was an irresistible conviction that the ardu- 
ous spirit was persistent and communicant in the 
very air. A rash suggestion had been somewhere 
put forward that the funeral of Henry James 
should be celebrated in the Abbey. How thankful 
those who most reverence his memory must be that 
we have been spared any discussion or differ- 
ence on such a point, and that in Chelsea Old 
Church all voices and all thoughts have been in 
unison, nothing but well and fair, and the last 
scene so felicitous and worthy of its hero." 

In connection with the Shakespeare Tercenten- 
ary the Oxford University Press will publish, in 
two volumes, a work entitled " The England of 
Shakespeare," containing an elaborate account of 
the life, society, customs, institutions, and recrea- 
tions of the Elizabethan age, the materials for 
which have been collected, with the assistance of 
many collaborators, by Sir Sidney Lee. Thus 
Dr. Henry Bradley deals with Shakespeare's 
English, Sir E. Maunde Thompson with hand- 
writing, Sir Walter Raleigh with the Elizabethan 
age, Mr. J. W. Fortescue with the chase, Sir W. 
Thiselton-Dyer with plants, and Professor Firth 
with ballads. Other chapters deal with authors 
and patrons, booksellers, printers, and the station- 
er's trade, the playhouses, rogues and vagabonds, 
the Court, the Army and Navy, voyages and ex- 
ploration, religion, learning and scholarship, etc., 
the whole object being to familiarize the reader 
with the background and atmosphere of Shakes- 
peare's plays. The two volumes are now passing 
through the press under the general editorship of 
Mr. C. T. Onions.

The Martyr's Return 

By Percival W. Well* 
One of the greatest literary successes of the age 

"A year or &o ago Percival Wells wrote 'The Major of the 
Kettledrum,' a brilliant satire on picayune politics; a work 
which interested discriminating readers all over the coun- 
try. Now he has appeared in a role other than satirist or 
poet (both of which he has graced- heretofore) and in a 
small volume entitled 'The Martyr's Return* he has dis- 
cussed with keen insight and criticism some of the para- 
monut issues of today." OAKLAND (Cal.) TKIBCNE 

"The work has come out at an opportune time to help 
guide national thought into serious channels. It is worthy 
an hour or two of any loyal American's time." 

PASSAIC HERALD 

"Mr. Wells has resorted to a novel method in the conveyance 
of his ideas and one that is unusually impressive."

been hindered in the attainment of democracy, or the rule of the majority, by the form of gov- 
ernment through which they have been compelled to act. . . . The suggestion is_here made that 
the modification of our government must be in the direction of greater simplicity if we would 
secure efficiency and responsibility to the will of the people." From the Preface.

THE END OF A CHAPTER 

By SHANE LESLIE 

Mr. Shane Leslie, a brilliant young graduate of Cambridge, with wide and interesting con- 
nections both in Ireland and England, has written in this book a notable contribution to the 
memoir literature of his generation. The conception, which came to him naturally with his 
view of the great convulsion which drew him at once into service at the front, is indicated in 
his title. He felt, with countless others, that he was living "at the end of a chapter in history." 

As a grandson of the veteran Sir John Leslie, who had known half the famous Englishmen 
of his century, from the Duke of Wellington down; as the nephew of Lady Randolph and the 
cousin of Winston Churchill, and with a wide acquaintance among the leaders of_ his own gen- 
eration, he has a remarkable store of reminiscence and anecdote to draw upon, and has brought 
a keen and exceptional mind to bear on the questions of his time. The titles of his chapters 
suggest something of the book's attractions: "Links with the Past," "Eton College," "The 
Dynasty of Hanover," "Cambridge University," "The Religion of England," "The Politicians," 
"Ireland," "An Empire of Sport and Freedom," "Society in Decay," "Post-Victorianism."

This vital book pursues the quest of per- 
sonality and its relation to the universe not

into the scientific facts at our disposal. A 
most fascinating analysis done in the simplest

Why War 

By FREDERIC C. HOWE. 
A significant passage from this book: 
"Wars are not made by peoples. . . . Wars 
are made by irresponsible monarchs, by ruling 
aristocracies, by foreign ministers and by dip- 
lomats. Wars are made by privileged inter- 
ests, by financiers, by commercial groups

The Symphony Play 

By JENNETTE LEE. 

A play made up of one-act plays, "not 
merely 'linked together by intervals of silence' 
and a dropped curtain," as the author explains, 
"but plays related in color and tone and pro- 
gressive meaning." These plays, "Billy Boy," 
"The Mother," "The Brother," and 'The 
Lady with Wings," form a perfect whole as 
the movements of a sonata form a symphony.

Ways to Lasting Peace 

Nowhere else may so compact, so clear a consensus 
of the thought of nations on this all-important subject

of Contentment, of which the dove is the symbol; 
the Armed Peace, which is a condition of balanced 
hatred the watchful hyena; and the Permanence of 
Law the guardian St. Bernard. And to this last his 
hopes are bent.

THE FAMILY 

As a Social and Educational 
Institution 



By WILLYSTINE GOODSELL 

Teachers' College, Columbia University 

A scholarly and highly interesting review 
of the conditions and changes in the 
family from early Greek and Roman days 
to our own times, dealing in particular with 
the laws and customs of marriage, the treat- 
ment of children and the economic progress 
of woman. 

" I find It to be a scholarly book which brings out 
the relation of the family to society and to the 
social position of the sexes better than any book 
with which I am acquainted." Professor E. A. Ross, 
University of Michigan.

IDEAS, SEX, AND THE NOVEL. 



We have been hearing a good deal lately 
about the novel of ideas. It is understood 
to be a comparatively recent product ; not at 
all the same thing, for instance, as the problem 
novel we used to be hearing of. To put it 
concretely, one is to the other as Mr. H. G. 
Wells to Mrs. Humphry Ward. Mr. Wells 
and his disciples are supposed to stand par- 
ticularly for this new kind of thing. They 
are not simply story-tellers; they have a 
larger function. When they sit down to write 
novels, it is a pretty serious business. Not 
that they pull a long face over it: motley 
is their wear. But it is not, so to speak, their 
underwear; that article we take to be stout 
buckram or chain-mail. For these are war- 
riors of the mind. Their real affair is not to 
entertain people, but to propagate the faith; 
and their weapon is the "idea." 

Unluckily, it is rather hard in practice to 
tell an idea from an abstract theory, or a 
personal prejudice, or a poetic fancy, or a 
fact recorded, or a platform, or a mere notion. 
But, as far as we can detach them, most of 
the serious ideas in current fiction seem to be 
based on reaction. This, of course, is the 
natural thing. Every age has its modernism, 
and modernism is always first of all a revolt 
against the smug and orderly past, a search 
for reality, a "return to nature." Therefore 
the current novel of ideas is anti- Victorian 
or anti-Georgian first, and (perhaps) some- 
thing else next. Often our champions of the 
present find it hard to turn away from the 
pleasantest and easiest part of their task 
gunning for the past. The ridicule of 
ancestors is now almost as obligatory among 
Western peoples as their worship is in China. 
The unpardonable sin is regard for conven- 
tion: we must be jolted out of that before 
anything can really be done for us. And the 
novel, with its fulcrum of the story, its 
(inherited) pretence of entertainment, is as 
handy a tool as may be, unless you are 
among the lucky ones, the Shaws (if twain 
there be), who have somehow got a thumb 
upon the theatre. Yet these new novelists of 



360 



THE DIAL 



[April 13 



ours, with the ideas, cannot be disposed of 
as mere pretenders. Most of them display 
undeniable quality as story-tellers. They 
have the technique of the art at their fingers' 
ends, are entirely at home upon those high 
levels of workmanship which are the peculiar 
vaunt of our time. They can do what they 
like with their material as far as the 
limits of their talent and the nature of their 
material let them. 

One of Henry James's last critical excur- 
sions led him into this bailiwick of the "new" 
novel. He found there great talent (always 
a little short of genius), expressing "an appe- 
tite for a closer notation, a sharper specifica- 
tion of the signs of life, of consciousness, of 
the human scene and the human subject in 
general, than the three or four generations 
before us had been at all moved to insist on. " 
He found there also an "inordinate posses- 
sion" of concrete materials, a knack of 
"saturation," and of subsequent expression 
as you express the water from a full sponge 
or the juice from a ripe orange. And along- 
side of such saturations with scene or type as 
that of Mr. Bennett with the Five Towns and 
the middle-class provincialism they embody, 
he observes certain other saturations of less 
material sort, as that of Mr. Hugh Walpole 
with the spirit of youth, or that of Mr. Wells 
with his own ideas. Mr. Wells, he says, is 
"a novelist very much as Lord Bacon was 
a philosopher," and is satisfied to "turn out 
his mind and its contents upon us by any 
free familiar gesture and as from a high 
window forever open." Mr. Wells did not 
relish this view of him, and retorted upon 
his critic with a lively caricature in the 
"Boon" volume. But there is more than a 
little truth in it, if not the whole truth, as 
applied, I think, not only to Mr. Wells, but 
to some of the younger men whose saturation 
Mr. James refers to the material plane. 
Unluckily, as with Mr. Wells, their inordinate 
possession of facts is almost inextricably 
involved with their inordinate possession by 
ideas. 

What then, their realistic method of story- 
telling apart, are the ideas these "new" nov- 
elists present ? Alas, what is an idea ? Usage 
gives us choice of a dozen meanings. Mr. 
Wells turns out for our examination, at one 
time or another, pretty much every kind of 
mental exhibit that the term can possibly 
include, prejudices, enthusiasms, grave the- 



ories, fantastic theories, dreams, forecasts. 
One mood or, if you choose, idea prevails. 
Mr. Wells is a prophet, and his glorious 
future, like most glorious futures, hangs upon 
a demolished past. Things are wrong, 
smash them! Then we'll see about building 
up again. The "mind of the race" exists, 
but half -enslaved : it is bound to express 
itself fully when once it has made sure of its 
freedom. How pitifully, after all the centu- 
ries, we are tied to empty forms ! Eeligion, 
how ineffectual; government, how clumsy; 
the attitude of age towards youth, how 
futile; marriage, how deadly in its possi- 
bilities! The whole question of sex, how 
crucial, how absorbing, how absorbent of all 
other questions that exist under the canopy! 
Eevolt, progress, "new" movements, when 
have they not centred in an attempted read- 
justment of the sex-affair? You may tinker 
with other established human relations, but 
not too rudely, if you really expect a serious 
hearing. Society, after all, depends on some 
sort of government for its safety. Men will 
always be cajoling themselves with some kind 
of religion. But the marriage-tie, the fetich 
of sex-morality regulated by code, here, at 
least, is a convention we can rid ourselves of 
comfortably. It is a nuisance to begin with, 
and the existence of the race by no means 
hangs upon it. Here, therefore, is the place 
to strike in, when we set about disposing of 
the old lumber piled around us by the mud- 
dling past. Mr. Wells (to return to our 
example) is concerned with many other 
themes, and yet he can never get away, in a 
sense he can never quite afford to get away, 
from this one. For it is the theme which 
brings him closest to his audience. His 
splendid childlike dreams of the future, of a 
world governed by the "mind of the race" as 
embodied in a natural and veritable aristoc- 
racy, remain dreams after all. They have 
power to stir the fancy, or even the white 
corpuscles; and yet they are pretty remote, 
we secretly feel, from the real business of 
life as life lives us. On the other hand, when 
he displays the frailty of the family tie, the 
discomforts of the marriage relation, when he 
assures us that we may fitly and even nobly 
cast off a lot of the burdens we have been 
taught to smile under, it is then that he is 
most warmly read and talked of. Where the 
prophet has captured his thousands of hear- 



1916] 



ers, the iconoclast has captured his tens of 
thousands. 

I suspect it might be more instructive than 
edifying if some inspired statistician were to 
tabulate for us the part played by sexual 
curiosity and incitement in the public patron- 
age of novels possessing genuine literary 
merit which have been produced during the 
past decade or two. Surely, more than one 
author of serious purpose must have been 
humiliated by a sense of the meretricious 
nature of a sudden popularity due to excep- 
tional frankness upon the perennial theme. 
The pursuit of "realism" has involved special 
risk of this sort. "The real facts of life" is 
a phrase which seems too often, as I was say- 
ing the other day, to be nothing better than 
an euphemism for the risky or dreary side of 
sex. There are, after all, so many other things 
in the world ! decency among them. Heaven 
defend us from a return to the prudery of 
the Victorian regime ! The nineteenth century 
was deplorably fond of playing ostrich. But 
there are less decent birds, the parakeet, 
say. I for one believe that reticence, in life 
and in art, is a less corrupting influence than 
loose babbling. By all means let us tell our 
children all we can, as simply as we can, about 
the essential facts of sex. But it, does not 
follow that we need introduce them into 
brothels, or even into our own bedchambers. 
Let us by all means, as adults, get rid of the 
smoking-room leer and the boudoir giggle, 
and speak as men and women, when occasion 
arises, of matters which concern us. We may 
still be chary of saddling our physiology and 
pathology upon the novel or any other form 
of art. 

We may, to take larger ground, be chary 
of imperiling the true ends of art for the sake 
of any other ends whatever. It is all very 
well to say that there is nothing sacred about 
art, that life is far more important, and that 
if you can "put across" a working idea under 
the color of art, so much the better for life. 
The argument is especially plausible in regard 
to the novel, partly because it is the loosest 
and most flexible of all forms of art, and 
partly because story-telling starts with fable 
and parable, with instilling ideas and pointing 
morals. Fable and parable are distinct and 
intelligible forms, still fit for noble uses, as 
William Morris, or more recently Mr. Henry 
Newbolt, has shown. In the more complex 
orders of story-telling also, moral and intel- 



lectual ideas are bound to be present. In a 
sense, there never was a story without such an 
idea, however feebly conceived, behind it. But 
in the higher orders it stays behind ; at least, 
however unmistakably it may inspire or 
inform the story, it does not prod and bully 
it, does not skip about upon the surface, and 
sacrifice true action and true characterization 
to its own vanity. What interests me when 
I take up a new book calling itself a serious 
novel, is whether I am going to find a gar- 
nished idea, or an interpretation of life 
through character and action, a document, 
or a true story. 

I find the first thing far oftener than the 
second: that is to be expected. But what 
ought not to be quite so much a matter of 
course is that half the time the writer has not 
really tried to tell a true story. He means 
to report a case or to expound a theory, or 
at the best to build a fable,^ and he must 
straightway botch his job by idling with the 
machinery of action and of character! The 
mongrel product we proceed to classify and 
dignify under the name of novel ! And indeed 
it is often hard enough to judge of such 
books. In a larger sense there is sure to be 
some idea or system of ideas some working 
philosophy, as the phrase goes behind the 
labor of every novelist who is anything more 
than the slave of his mechanism. It may be 
the idea of man's brutality, or of his angelic 
.possibilities ; of the conditions of his domestic 
happiness or his usefulness in the world. 
Such an idea is always likely to crop up to 
the surface and get in the way of the artist's 
effort, when it should be content to underlie 
and fructify it. On the other hand, not a few 
writers who have set out with the vile inten- 
tion of using fiction as a sugar-coating for 
their lectures or their sermons have builded 
better than they knew have been insensibly 
seduced into something at least approaching 
true invention and characterization. They 
are rather ashamed of that. 

Here is a pretty good example of the new 
novelist and his nonchalant ways. One of 
the most brilliant of the younger English 
group gives an account of his entrance into 
fiction. He had been for some years a student 
of serious matters, and had published the 
results of his study through formal channels. 
He had no wish to be a literary artist, but he 
saw that the novel offered a popular medium : 
"I saw that nobody takes a theory seriously

if you say it in a serious book. I saw that 
I had wasted years on housing and municipal 
milk ; I hurled my blue-books down the base- 
ment stairs, and in delicious fury wrote 'The 

.' This, in short, was a novel with an 

idea or purpose frankly displayed from the 
first page." It was, the author goes on to 
confess, "the hot controversial production of 
a young mind, anxious to strike a blow for 
woman, to make society swallow the fact that 
under present conditions woman is driven into 
abominable trade, to make society ashamed." 
This is all very well ; but the pamphleteer had 
the story-telling instinct, and duly produced 
the inevitable hybrid and succeeded in 
making a portion of society curious if not 
ashamed. He had dealt freely, that is, with 
certain "facts of life," aided by a glamour 
of art; and he did not care greatly whether 
that was a false glamour or not. In his later 
books the story-teller has gained upon the 
pamphleteer; but, an avowed feminist, he 
continues to make a rather shameful thing of 
sex, and it is little less than pitiful to find 
him still crowing over his ability to shock. It 
is so easy to be shocking, and so little to the 
purpose for any man who has it in him to be 
about the great affirmative business of art. 

I have been speaking of the newer English 
novelists: our own current fiction shows the 
same confusion of motive and effect. Muck- 
raking, social and economic problems, sex 
pathology, can we never get them out of the 
foreground? Is the novel so poor a thing as 
this a vehicle for theories, for reports, for 
arguments and rebuttals, for garbage of one 
sort or another? Or may we rightfully look 
to it, when it is really itself, as an embodi- 
ment, through the interpretation of human 
character in action, of the great ideas which 
underlie them, of truth?

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN PARIS. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
From the great mass of war books published 
during the past year and a half among the 
French-speaking nations, I have selected for 
brief notice those which follow mainly because 
they best illustrate in some way the more 
spiritual aspects of the present conflict, their 
authors standing for what is more high- 
minded or characteristic of the finer part of 
our poor human nature, whether displayed 
at the fireside at home or in the trenches at 



the front. So this letter should furnish not 
only some bibliographical data and perhaps a 
few critical reflections, but may reveal here 
and there the underlying moral features of the 
tremendous contest, especially on the admir- 
able French side, where the eyes of the world 
have been so often centred since the autumn 
of 1914. 

In the first place, it should be noted that 
many of these writers bear in silence a heavy- 
burden of personal sorrow in addition to their 
more public weight of grief as citizens of a 
suffering country. This spirit of solemn earn- 
estness has penetrated their whole work, as 
you readily perceive when you chance to learn 
of the existence of this burden, and gives to 
this work a deep and touching imprint. Let 
me offer one or two signal instances of this 
which have recently come under my own eye. 

Professor Paul Stapfer, dean emeritus of 
Bordeaux University, is now seventy-six years 
old, but is still vigorous intellectually and 
still adding new volumes to the more than 
thirty which he has published during a long 
and active life. When a young man fresh 
from college, he was the tutor of the grand- 
children of Guizot, and a little later, while 
teacher of French at the Royal Elizabeth 
College at Guernsey, he became very well 
acquainted with Victor Hugo. His doctor's 
thesis was on Laurence Sterne. He was sus- 
pended for six months from his duties as dean 
because of his open support of Dreyfus. Such, 
briefly told, is the past of the noble scholar 
who handed me quietly the other day a 
pamphlet, "Douze Sermons sur la Guerre" 
(Paris: Fischbacher, 1 fr. 50) containing a 
dozen sermons preached last autumn in a 
country parish in the Gironde. The incum- 
bent was at the front, and Professor Stapfer, 
though not himself of the cloth, was asked 
to fill the vacant pulpit. These circumstances 
in themselves would have sufficed to give a 
certain touch of solemnity to the pamphlet, 
but when I reached my hotel and glanced at 
the first page, I read this dedication : " To my 
grandnephews who have died for our coun- 
try, " six in all are mentioned, three bearing 
the great Protestant name of Monod ; a fourth, 
by the way, also a grandnephew of M. Stapfer, 
having fallen since the pamphlet was pub- 
lished, "to those who have disappeared and 
to those still living." 

The case of Baoul Allier is very similar. 
Professor at the Paris Theological Seminary, 
and a clergyman by profession, M. Allier was 
invited by the Protestant boys of the capital, 
to-day too young to go to the front but who 
may be called there to-morrow, to deliver 
before them a series of sermons or lectures 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



363 



(Paris: "Foi et Vie," 30 centimes each). In 
the letter asking for the sermons, I inquired 
after M. Allier's fine son, an Alpinist, whom 
I have seen grow up from boyhood, and whom 
the people in the streets would turn and ad- 
mire as he went by in his jaunty uniform 
well set off by a graceful carriage and superb 
physique. The father sent me the lectures, 
and then added simply, at the very end of 
his letter: "As for Roger, he disappeared on 
August 27, 1914, and we have had no news 
from him since." One may imagine the soul j 
put into these addresses delivered before ; 
youths but a little younger than his own boy, ' 
many of whom are destined to "disappear" 
in a similar manner if this dreadful holocaust 
continues another year. 

And the same note of suppressed anguish 
is breathed in the Belgian war books, only j 
two of which, however, I can find room to I 
mention here. "En Italic avant la Guerre" 
(Paris et Bruxelles note this second city on 
the title-page Van Oest, 2 frs. 50), and 
"Les Socialistes et la Guerre Europeenne" 
the same publisher and price, and the title j 
sufficiently describes the contents are both I 
by a distinguished Belgian orator and socialist ; 
deputy, M. Jules Destree. This is the dedica- j 
tion of the first of these volumes: "To M. 
Lorand, Liberal Deputy of Viton, and M. j 
Melot, Catholic Deputy of Namur, their j 
socialist colleague of Charleroi, in memory of | 
a time when party distinctions disappear 
before the common desire to defend the out- j 
raged Commonwealth. " Nor should this state- j 
ment in Maeterlinck's preface to the volume 
be overlooked, that the landlords of the 
hotel where the poet and the orator ("a ; 
formidable orator," the former styles the 
latter) put up during their tour stating the 
Belgian case and, indirectly, discreetly push- 
ing Italy towards hostilities, all refused pay, 
and even the servants declined the traditional 
pourboire, a good example of that indescrib- 
able and often unexpected sentimentality of 
the Latins. 

The Paris university world has also been 
doing some excellent work in influencing 
foreign public opinion, by editing and issuing 
a very able series of pamphlets under the 
general title of "Etudes et Documents sur 
la Guerre" (Paris: Colin, 50 centimes each). 
The aim and spirit of these nine or ten opus- 
cules is well set forth in this extract from a 
letter of the secretary of the committee of 
professors who have the work in charge, 
Professor Emile Durkheim, who fills the chair 
of philosophy at the Sorbonne : 

Our purpose has been to counteract the propaganda 
of the Germans among the neutral nations, but by 
employing a method quite different from that em- 



ployed by the Germans. In this propaganda work 
we remain to-day what we were in time of peace, 
savants, historians, sociologists, jurists, etc. Our pur- 
pose has been to fix certain aspects of the war by 
giving to our work all the objectivity of which we are 
capable. There were subjects which we decided not to 
touch upon, though the newspapers do not hesitate 
to treat them, because it seemed to us that we could 
not establish objectively the wrong-doings of the 
Germans in these particular cases. But we still had 
left a sufficient number of subjects for treatment! 

And now, after having scattered a hundred 
thousand of these pamphlets, translated into 
a half dozen modern tongues, in all parts of 
the world, this same committee is turning 
its attention "to home propaganda, our object 
at present being to give our French people a 
true picture of the military and economic 
situation of the belligerents, again leaving 
to one side the purely political events of the 
day." These "Lettres a Tous les Franais," 
furnished gratis by Colin, the publisher just 
mentioned, embrace "Patience, Effort, Con- 
fidence," by Professor Durkheim; "La Paix 
que les Allemands Voudraient Faire," by 
Professor Ernest Lavisse, the historian and 
head of the Superior Normal School ; and "Le 
Bloc des Alliances," by Professor Ernest 
Denis, of the Paris University. 

Other university professors who contribute 
conspicuous books, pamphlets, or essays to the 
question of the hour are M. Jacques Flach, 
the French jurist who has written much on 
Cujas and Jonathan Swift, and who is a mem- 
ber of the Institute and professor at the 
College of France, "Le Droit de la Force et 
la Force du Droit" (Paris: Recueil Sirey, 1 
fr. 50) ; a high-keyed lecture delivered in one 
of the Paris Protestant churches; M. Leon 
Pollier, professor at the Toulouse Law School, 
-"Les Forces de la France d'Hier et de 
Demain" (Paris: Recueil Sirey, 3 frs.), six 
lectures delivered last April at Madrid, the 
author's chief aim being to combat the idea 
prevailing abroad that this war has brought 
out a new France, whereas we simply see 
"the old France to which foreigners had shut 
their eyes"; M. Eugene d'Eichthal, member 
of the Institute and director of the well 
known school in the Rue Saint Guillaume, 
"Kant et la Guerre," "Des Evaluations du 
Cout de la Guerre," and "Apres Douze Mois 
de Guerre" (Paris: Alcan, 50 centimes each), 
three essays which are worthy of particular 
attention because of the subjects treated and 
because of the high position of the author in 
the economic and educational circles of Paris ; 
M. Paul Seippel, professor at the Zurich 
Polytechnic School, "La Defense de notre 
Independance Intellectuelle" (Zurich: Orell 
Fiissli, 25 centimes), an excellent presentation 
by an able neutral of the difficult position of 



,364

troubled Switzerland in the present conflict; 
and M. Joseph Barthelemy, professor at 
the Paris Law School, "Les Institutions 
Politiques de 1'Allemagne Contemporaine" 
(Paris: Alcan, 3 frs. 50). The author of 
this last-named book should not be con- 
founded, as often happens, with Professor 
Henri Berthelemy, also of the Paris Univer- 
sity and who also writes on questions of 
public law. As a young man Joseph 
Barthelemy studied at Bonn, Heidelberg, and 
Berlin. "I was especially attracted by 
Professor Jellinek," he once said to me, "and 
I think I know well enough German political 
science to enjoy the right of not having to 
admire it." The aim of the book is to show 
that real political liberty is unknown in Ger- 
many "the accentuation of the anti-parlia- 
mentary regime under Herr von Bethmann- 
Hollweg cannot be questioned" and hence 
the cause of danger to the rest of the world. 
I may add, by the way, that perhaps no other 
writer has been so often "crowned" by the 
Institute, M. Barthelemy having been six 
times a "laureate" of the Academy of Moral 
and Political Sciences. 

Mention of Professor Seippel and of Zurich 
reminds me of the splendid part which the 
Swiss people in general has been playing in 
this terrible catastrophe. A single example 
will suffice. "Le Passage des Rapatries 
Frahcais a Zurich" (Bale: Nouvelle Librairie 
Litterarie, 3 frs.) is a collection of photo- 
graphs of those forlorn French men, women, 
and children who, torn from the invaded 
regions of France by the Germans, are now, 
provisions becoming scarce, sent back to their 
desolate homes, where they should have been 
left in the first place. There are fifty pages 
of these photographs, generally four to the 
page, taken by different members of the 
"Comite des Rapatries," one of the many 
spontaneously constituted Swiss groups that 
have done so much to alleviate the sufferings 
of their unfortunate neighbors. At the end of 
the volume, the Rev. William Cuendet, presi- 
dent of the committee, explains in a few 
pathetic pages what he and his friends have 
accomplished. It is one of the tenderest epi- 
sodes of the present war, and it does marked 
credit to warm and generous Swiss philan- 
thropy. 

From Switzerland also comes this rather 
melancholy and outspoken note from Romain 
Rolland : 

Freedom of speech is too limited in France just 
now and passions are too excited to make it possible 
or useful to try and make heard an independent 
thought. I have said in my published articles a*ll 
that I can say, for the moment, as a good Frenchman 
who will not, however, surrender his own reason. I 
will now wait for a more favorable hour before 



speaking again. In the meantime I observe and work 
in silence. As regards books which judge from an 
elevated standpoint the present crisis, without yield- 
ing to the passions of the day, I practically know none, 
except they be in manuscript, for at present it is 
almost impossible to get printed in the belligerent 
states, except in England perhaps, anything which 
runs counter to the current of public opinion. Here 
and there some good article appears, and now and 
then a book of audacious verse slips thrpugh the 
poets seem to be regarded as rather inoffensive and 
among these last is Jouve's volume. 

The book referred to, by the poet P. J. Jouve, 
"Vous etes des Hommes" (Paris: Nouvelle 
Revue Frangaise, 2 frs. 50), is a little collec- 
tion of vigorous poems suggested by the war 
and presented in free verse. The author is 
interesting to Americans in more ways than 
one. He is about thirty years old, and belongs 
to a group of young French poets, consisting 
of Vildrac, Bazalgette, Jean Richard Bloch, 
and others, who have been strongly influenced 
by Walt Whitman. "This circle," writes 
Rolland, "has best preserved during the war 
a spirit of equity and large humanity. " Even 
Walt's inclination towards nursing the sol- 
diers of our own Civil War seems to have 
found imitation on the part of his French 
disciple. Jouve's health was so bad that the 
military authorities pronounced him unfit for 
active service, and he might have remained 
quietly at home with wife and boy. But he 
volunteered twice for duty in the hospitals, 
worked' there for a year, twice fell ill, and is 
now at "La Feniere," a villa at Montana, 
Switzerland, trying to restore his shattered 
nerves. 

A couple of volumes of reprints from the 
editorial pages of two important Paris reviews 
deserve attention for several reasons. These 
are "La Guerre de 1914 vue en son Gours 
chaque Semaine" (Paris: Delagrave, 3 frs. 
50), by M. Paul Leroy-Beaulieu, the learned 
French political economist, editor of the 
weekly paper, "L'Economiste Francais"; and 
"L'Allemagne contre 1'Europe" (Paris: 
Perrin, 3 frs. 50), by the late Francis 
Charmes. The publisher of this last-named 
volume informs me that it will be followed 
by a second which will continue the reprint 
of M. Charmes 's chroniques of the "Revue 
des Deux Mondes" down to the day of his 
death. M. Leroy-Beaulieu 's volume extends 
from August, 1914, to July, 1915. In the 
first article he said that he thought the war, 
then just begun, "could not end in less than 
three months; it may, like that of 1870, last 
half a year"! The author tells me that the 
second volume will appear some time toward 
the end of next summer, and thereupon he 
adds: 

It is not likely that the war will then be finished; 
so I will have a third volume devoted to the third 



1916]

year of the hostilities, as the armistice and the nego- 
tiations will also doubtless occur in this year, and 
lead up to the peace, which it will take much time to 
bring about, on account of the number of belligerents 
and the enormity of the interests concerned. 

Another publication which covers the whole 
period of the war down to a recent date is the 
"Histoire de la Guerre par le Bulletin des 
Armees" (Paris: Hachette, two volumes, 3 frs. 
each). This is a reprint of the ''Bulletin des 
Armees de la Republique" how this title 
savors of the heroic days of the First Repub- 
lic ! the little semi- weekly journal issued by 
the Minister of War and sent to the trenches, 
often the only reading matter received there 
for weeks at a time. The paper is not on sale, 
and this reprint is made to satisfy public 
curiosity to have a set of this official and yet 
popularly edited periodical, an interesting 
evidence of the fact that republican France 
considers the intellectual condition of her 
troops of the first importance. 

Very different is the series of volumes edited 
by the veteran Paris journalist, M. Gaston 
Jollivet (Paris: Hachette, 3 frs. 50 each) 
two have already appeared and three or four 
are to follow, a sort of brief running 
account of the operations from day to day, 
which are a very good supplement to M, 
Joseph Reinaeh's "Les Commentaires de 
Poly be" (Paris: Fasquelle, 4 volumes, 3 frs. 
50 each). It will be remembered that the 
Greek historian Polybius, who lived some two 
hundred years before our era, was a model 
of conciseness. "I have always had a great 
liking for this historian," says the versatile 
author of these modern commentaries in his 
preface, "who shows that in politics as in war, 
however much of the success may be attributed 
to good luck, coherency in plan and per- 
severance in resolution count for something, 
'often producing finer effects than rashness 
and hazard,' says the old Greek writer, thus 
predicting, it might seem, the Joffre of 
to-day." The appendix to the fourth volume 
contains some important statements concern- 
ing Ferdinand and the Bulgarians which are 
very timely at this hour. 

In this same category of books belongs 
''Pages d 'Histoire" (Nancy: Berger-Levrault, 
prices varying from 30 to 90 centimes accord- 
ing to the size of the pamphlet). This col- 
lection, which now numbers over a hundred 
separate pamphlets, is edited by M. Robert 
Steinheil, of the firm which publishes it, and 
is sent in large quantities to the front. Here 
will be found the remarkable article by M. 
Emile Boutroux, on the perversion of the 
grand soul of the old Germany which we all 
loved and admired, which article first ap- 
peared in the "Revue des Deux Mondes"; M. 



Salomon Reinaeh's "Voix Amerieaines" ; "Les 
Poetes de la Guerre," giving verses by Jean 
Aicard, Francois Fabie, Paul Fort, Rostand, 
etc.; "Les Volontaires Etrangers," where our 
American young men who have taken up 
arms for France receive due praise; and 
"Chants de Soldat" (1525-1915), including 
the national airs of the allies. 

But a more important volume devoted to 
soldiers' songs is "Chansons pour les Poilus" 
(Nancy: Berger-Levrault, 2 frs. 50), written 
by M. Andre Alexandre, poet, dramatist 
"Madame Chrysantheme" is his work and 
prolific song-writer. In a preface to the vol- 
ume, the well known Paris lawyer, M. Henri 
Robert, deservedly praises both these songs 
and their author. 

Nor does the attention of the French Gov- 
ernment and French writers and artists for 
the well-being of their soldiers stop with intel- 
lectual and more material comforts. " Conseils 
au Soldat pour sa Sante" (Paris: Wellhoff & 
Roche, 50 centimes) is a pamphlet issued by 
the Health Bureau of the War Office and 
intended as a sanitary guide for the common 
soldier. It is an admirable little publication, 
and must be doing a world of good in the 
ranks. 

Even the elite directories reflect the prevail- 
ing spirit. One of the oldest of these it 
has been appearing for over thirty years 
and one of the best, "Tout Paris" (Paris: 55 
Chaussee d'Antin, 12 frs.), prints in heavy- 
faced type the names of the young men and 
officers of Paris fashionable life who have 
fallen in battle. The roll is a long one, and 
the grandest families of historic, literary, and 
artistic France are represented in it. At the 
end of the volume is a list with the caption, 
"Honneur et Patrie," giving not only the 
names of those "mentioned in dispatches" or 
decorated, but printing the official statement 
of why they were so honored. Here again the 
catalogue is lengthy and brilliant. 

Perhaps the best collection in France of 
everything pertaining to the present war 
books, maps, reviews, pamphlets, newspaper- 
clippings, etc., is to be found in the 
"Bibliotheque de la Guerre" of the Lyons 
Public Library. The librarian writes me that 
they have correspondents in all parts of the 
world, exclusive of the diplomatic and con- 
sular representatives of France, who are also 
helping. A special catalogue is now being 
drawn up. Senator Herriot, the mayor of 
Lyons, a man of much intellectual and literary 
polish, is the soul of the whole enterprise.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE WHEREFORE OF FREE VERSE is set forth 
with some ingenuity, even if not with entire 
persuasiveness, by Mr. Edward Storer in "The 
New Republic." He holds that "a poet who 
wishes to give expression to realities in 
modern life will find in practice that he is 
confined for his literary expression to the two 
media of prose and free verse"; and the 
reason of this is that the regular, rhythmical 
form in which so much of poetic feeling in the 
past has found expression owes its being to 
the religious impulse. As these older metrical 
schemes "lost the primitive force that created 
them, they also lost their meaning, or a part 
of their meaning," and it is now "impossible 
in using them to produce more than a 
theatrical effect." They may still serve the 
purposes of amusement, of dilettante literary 
exercises; but for the adequate utterance of 
"modern truths, there are the great formless- 
nesses, the dissipating molten matter of 
speech, the possibilities of language." So far, 
Mr. Storer. In reply one might ask whether 
the religious impulse no longer stirs in human 
breasts, whether the emotion of awe and 
reverence in the face of the mystery of 
existence and the wonders of creation has 
become a thing of the past. And what has 
poetry, any more than any other art, to do 
with "formlessnesses" except to reduce them 
to form ? The poet, etymologically and in 
the common understanding of the word, is a 
maker, a fashioner, not a dealer in "great 
formlessnesses" or "molten matter." One need 
go no further than the nursery to learn, from 
the instinctive use of rhyme and metre there, 
that these regular rhythms, believed by Mr. 
Storer to belong to a past age, are as much of 
the present time as is the measured beat of 
our pulse, or the regular alternation of inhala- 
tion and exhalation. The ripple of the ocean 
waves, the breaking of the surf on the sea- 
shore, the swing of the planets in their orbits 
these and countless other examples of the 
rhythm that pervades all nature refute the 
doctrine that the day of regular rhythms has 
passed. 



PRESIDENT ANGELL'S BREADTH OF CULTURE 
was the natural result, the earned reward, of 
his labors in many fields, educational, literary, 
journalistic, editorial, administrative, and 
diplomatic. At his death on the first day of 
this month, in his eighty-eighth year, he had 
been for more than six years president 
emeritus of the University of Michigan, after 
holding the presidency thirty-eight years, 
before which he had been president of the 



University of Vermont, and had held a profes- 
sorship at Brown University, of which he was 
a graduate. He had also been United States 
Minister to China, had received the appoint- 
ment to a like post at Constantinople, but had 
soon resigned, had served on two important 
national commissions, had been a member of 
the board of regents of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, and had, earlier in life, edited the 
Providence "Journal" for six or seven years. 
Agricultural experience on the home 'farm, 
studies abroad, the exercise of his pen in 
authorship, and of his voice on the public plat- 
form, with a number of other activities, had 
contributed in their several ways to his devel- 
opment. In literature his most generally 
interesting work is his modest volume of 
"Reminiscences," published four years ago, 
while his more scholarly side is shown in his 
earlier works, "Progress in International 
Law" and "The Higher Education." Maga- 
zine articles, lectures, and other short pieces 
have come from his pen in some abundance. 
His story of his own life, above referred to, 
has many a genial touch. No good and per- 
tinent anecdote comes amiss with its author. 
He illustrates the German love of thorough- 
ness, the Deutsche Grundlichkeit, by a brief 
reference to the literary methods of an author 
and antiquary with whom he had become 
acquainted in Braunschweig. This man made 
a study of the coats-of-arms of the Brunswick 
chimneys, and wrote a book about them, a 
"History of the Chimneys of Brunswick," in 
which, for the sake of thoroughness, he first 
went back to the chimneys of ancient Greece 
and Rome, but became convinced, after pains- 
taking research, that the Greeks and Romans 
had no chimneys; accordingly the first part 
of his treatise turned out to be a laborious 
dissertation on the nonexistent chimneys of a 
chimneyless people. This autobiography of 
the late James Burrill Angell is, in its way, a 
notable little book, and a highly readable one. 



PROBLEMS IN BOOKSELLING have from the 
first exercised the wits of those engaged in 
this trade. As early as 1471 certain printers 
of the Latin classics in Rome found themselves 
so embarrassed by the difficulty of getting 
their wares into the hands of those for whom 
they were intended, and who unquestionably 
desired them, that these printers appealed to 
the Pope for assistance. It was the same 
problem that still perplexes, how to bring 
the book and its buyer most expeditiously and 
unfailingly together, at a minimum expense. 
Probably not even papal infallibility was 
equal to the exigencies of the case. This inci- 
dent is referred to by Mr. Joseph Shaylor, a

veteran of the English bookselling trade, in 
"Some Thoughts on Bookselling," published 
in a recent issue of "The Publishers' Circu- 
lar" (London), though originally prepared 
for oral presentation before a convention of 
the Associated Booksellers that failed to con- 
vene by reason of disorganization caused by 
the war. He writes at some length and with 
complete understanding of the questions dis- 
cussed. In a concluding summary he em- 
phasizes three of these questions: first, he 
believes that books by untried authors, works 
in the purchase of which the dealer incurs 
more than the ordinary risk, should be return- 
able to the publishers within six months; 
secondly, the publisher should make a plain 
distinction between books in which he is finan- 
cially concerned and those which he issues at 
the author's expense; and thirdly, he should 
always fix his terms and adhere to them with 
both wholesale and retail dealer, and the rates 
of discount to these dealers should be per- 
manently established and strictly observed by 
all publishers, acting in harmony. In general, 
it is organization and cooperation that are 
lacking among publishers the world over. 
How to effect these is a great problem, and 
its magnitude becomes apparent when one 
bears in mind that the world's annual output 
of books amounts to nearly 175,000 separate 
works, or did before the present relapse into 
barbarism. 

A COLLEGIAN'S DIARY that gives glimpses of 
Longfellow as lecturer, of Lowell as student, 
of Pierce and Felton and E. T. Charming in 
their several chairs of instruction, and of 
other notables of the time and place, is likely 
to be interesting reading; and when the 
diarist himself chances to be no less a per- 
sonage than the author of "The Man without 
a Country," this likelihood becomes a virtual 
certainty. Professor Edward E. Hale has 
edited for the April number of "Harper's 
Monthly" some selections from his father's 
journal of Harvard life in the thirties of last 
century. The first entry bears date of Janu- 
ary, 1837, when the writer was half-way 
through his sophomore year, though not yet 
quite fifteen years old. Here is a passage, 
unintentionally smile-provoking at the end: 
"We recited in German for the first time to 
Professor Longfellow. The recitation, or 
rather the exercise, for we had no lesson set 
before, was very easy. I think we shall like 
the study very much." Some months later: 
"At 11 A. M. went to Professor Longfellow's 
first lecture on Goethe's Faust, The lectures 
are to be extemporaneous translations of the 
German with explanations; as he called it 
recitations in which he recites and we hear. 



He made a long introduction to the matter in 
hand very flowery and bombastic indeed, 
which appeared to me very much out of taste. 
I believe, however, that it was entirely extem- 
poraneous and that he was carried away by 
the current of his thoughts. In fact, he 
appears to say just what comes uppermost. 
The regular translation and explanation part 
of the lecture was very good." A later entry 
records the writer's decision not to attend the 
lectures on the second part of Faust, a volun- 
tary course. "The lectures are tolerably 
interesting, but not enough so to compensate 
for the time taken up by them." Still later he 
"went to Professor Longfellow's introductory 
lecture on Dante. Much to my delight, he 
rather advised those who had not finished the 
Ital. course not to attend till next year, 
which advice I shall follow." There is record 
of an "exhibition," in which, says the diarist, 
"I liked Jim Lowell's part better than any of 
the others." Interesting, in a different man- 
ner from these jottings, is the facsimile of 
student Bale's college bill for one term. 
Tuition is $25.00; rent and care of room, 
$5.00; special repairs, $0.57; fuel, $2.75; 
board, $28.60. Total, $61.92. 



IRVINGTON'S INFANT LIBRARY has passed its 
first birthday (or should one say its second, 
counting the day on which it was born as its 
first?) and issued its "First Annual Eeport." 
It is Irvington, New Jersey, not Irvington-on- 
Hudson, that is here meant. The New Jersey 
Irvington is much the larger of the two, 
having nearly or quite twelve thousand 
inhabitants, and the wonder is that it has not 
sooner acquired a public library. Perhaps 
this may be partly explained by its proximity 
to the excellent institution that has made 
Newark famous in the library world. At any 
rate, it now has "a live, growing collection of 
books" of its own, numbering 3,569 at last 
accounts, presumably a building in which to 
keep them, and certainly a librarian, Miss 
May E. Baillet, to promote their usefulness 
and report upon their circulation, growth, and 
other kindred matters. Moreover, it has a 
board of seven trustees, including a mayor 
who answers to the fortunately ominous name 
of Glorieux. Under lucky auspices does the 
Irvington (N. J.) Public Library enter upon 
its second year of existence.

ele in the "Review Cuba Contemporanea," 
entitled "The Races in America." It is writ- 
ten by Dr. Jose Ingenieros, but sets forth the 
views of the distinguished Argentine sociol- 
ogist, Sefior Domingo F. Sarmiento. The 
paper's aim may be summed up in one sen- 
tence of the article : to construct, with all the 
poor and weak nations of South America, a 
grand and strong modern nation, after the 
type of that of the North, their constant 
model. Such a generous tribute from such 
a source shows that the two races and two 
continents are approaching each other. On 
neither side does "ignorance make a barren 
waste of all beyond itself. " Another article in 
the same review, on "The Spirit of Liberty in 
the Poetry of Dominicana," will be a revela- 
tion to those who might have been in doubt 
whether either liberty or poetry existed in 
that island. In Cuba itself there is certainly 
an intellectual revival. We hope that this 
may be in some measure due to the action of 
the United States in interfering to secure its 
freedom. From Santiago de Cuba comes a 
stout volume as a memorial of the foundation 
and first year of "El Ateneo," an association 
of writers and artists of various kinds, appar- 
ently somewhat after the order of the old 
Italian Academy. Its purpose is to promote 
the arts, judge works, award prizes, and so 
forth. It has an imposing list of committees 
for the various sections, Literature, Philos- 
ophy, Music, Plastic Arts, and many others. 
'That its work is well done may be attested by 
a volume of addresses on Schumann, Chopin, 
And Grieg, put forth by its Director, the poet

THE BEST WAY TO CELEBRATE THE SHAKE- 
SPEARE TERCENTENARY, or one of the best 
"ways, is pointed out by Mr. Charles D. 
;Stewart in the "Wisconsin Library Bulletin" 
for March, a Shakespeare number in certain 
of its features. Mr. Stewart's wise and prac- 
ticable suggestion is that we observe this 
three-hundredth recurrence of Shakespeare's 
death-day (our word, not Mr. Stewart's) by 
reading one or two of his plays and trying to 
become really acquainted with him. "Take a 
play that has not been staled by everyday 
quotation and which has not been made tire- 
some by being 'studied' in school. Then, 
declaring your independence of all scholars 
and commentators, and throwing aside all 
help except an occasional reference to the 
glossary, sit down to get out of his work the 
one great thing that is in it namely human 
nature. Aside from his wonderful power of 
expression, which will take care of itself, this 
is the thing which makes Shakespeare; and 



on that basis you can meet him directly and 
on your own ground. If you have been 
through the world's mill to any purpose you 
may get more out of him, and be able to tell 
more about him, than even the most learned 
and cloistered commentator. " A good play to 
select for this reading, and one that has not 
yet been read and "studied" to death, would 
be "Richard II.," by some critics pronounced 
superior to "Richard III.," which has tended 
to eclipse it ; at any rate, it has merits enough 
of its own to fear no comparison with its 
fellows. . . . 

THE READING WITH THE MOST RELISH is 

likely to be that which has been secured with 
effort and after long waiting. Lamb's ecsta- 
sies over an old and rare book, long coveted 
and at last obtained only after strict economy, 
are well known to readers of Elia. In the 
town of Swanton, Vermont, there has lately 
been finished a library building that owes 
its existence to no millionaire benefactor, nor 
even to any appropriation from the public 
funds. A writer in the "Bulletin of the Ver- 
mont Free Public Library Commission" 
announces with pride that "the peculiar 
distinction of the Swanton library resides 
in the fact that it is in the completest 
sense a community possession." King's 
Daughters, churches and schools, boys and 
girls, men and women, all have worked 
together to make the library, long a desirabil- 
ity, an actuality; and now they one and all 
feel a peculiar sense of proprietorship, which 
augurs well for the future usefulness of this 
work of their hands. The lot of land on which 
the building stands was originally granted by 
George III. "to his loving subjects of New 
Hampshire," and its subsequent changes of 
ownership, down to the benefactor who gave 
it to the town for its present use, have been 
traced. . . .

COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARY AND POLICE 
has for some time been attempted in a novel 
way and apparently with good results in one 
of the cities of the state whose public-library 
system is the most nearly complete of any 
in America. Only one town in Massachusetts 
is without its public library, and this town 
(Newbury) enjoys the use of a neighboring 
library for a proper consideration. But to 
return to our starting-point: in the city of 
Somerville, a suburb of Boston, boy offenders 
placed on probation by the police court are 
required to report at stated times to the pro- 
bation officer at the library, not, as heretofore, 
at the police court. Every such youthful 
offender is made to draw from the library a 
book with a story bearing on the offence of 
which he is guilty and pointing a moral, and, 
what is more, the boy is subsequently called 
upon for proof that he has read the prescribed 
matter. Close cooperation between the court, 
the police, and the library is producing what 
seem to be encouraging results. Here, then, 
.is one more to add to the increasing list of 
cooperative activities engaged in by the public 
library.

to gather it under the control of the high horn 
comb holding its main strands together. The 
lankness of her long figure showed in the 
calico wrapper which seemed her sole gar-

lank in their way, nose and chin and high 
cheek-bones; her eyes wabbled in their 
sockets with the sort of inquiring laughter 
that spread her wide, loose mouth. She was 
barefooted, like Reverdy, ..." The unfold-

SOME RECENTLY DISCOVERED POEMS 
BY WALT WHITMAN. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
May I be allowed space in your columns to 
announce, for the benefit of students of the poetry 
of Walt Whitman, the recent discovery of a num- 
ber of his early poems? Of all the verse which 
Whitman must have written before he produced, 
at the age of thirty-six, that prodigy of poetry, 
the First Edition of "Leaves of Grass," he has 
preserved but four poems, and the diligence of 
his biographers has unearthed only as many more.

THE DIAL 



[April 13 



In the "Brooklyn Daily Eagle" there appeared 
in 1846, when Whitman was editor of the paper, 
two poems: "The Play-Ground," a descriptive 
poem, and an " Ode to be sung on Fort Greene ; 
4th of July, 1846." Ten others have been found 
in an imperfect file of the "Long Island Demo- 
crat," recently rescued from an old garret. 

It appears that in the year 1840, Whitman was 
teaching school in, or near, Jamaica, Long Island, 
a village which has since been incorporated in the 
Borough of Queens, New York City. He boarded, 
for over a year, with a certain James J. Brenton, 
who afterwards (1850) included in his "Voices 
from the Press" one of Whitman's early sketches 
called "Tomb Blossoms." Mr. Brenton was the 
editor and publisher of the "Long Island Demo- 
crat," in the office of which, after school hours, 
Whitman worked as a compositor. To this paper 
Whitman contributed, with fair regularity, one 
piece of verse each month. 

The tone of most of these poems is meditative, 
if not morbid, a common theme being the vanity 
of life and the peacefulness of death. Even one 
which is ostensibly a continuation of the well 
known ballad, "Father Grimes," soon loses the jest 
in the sermon. But all show conscientious experi- 
mentation in various verse forms, and indicate an 
increasing mastery of form and phrasing. A list 
of the titles will give some idea of what the youth 
of twenty or so was meditating about in the days 
when his only readers were the subscribers to a 
village paper: "Young Grimes," "Fame's Van- 
ity" (the original form of the autobiographical 
"Ambition"), "My Departure" (the original of 
"Death of a Nature Lover"), "The Inca's 
Daughter," "The Love that is Hereafter," "We 
Shall Rest at Last" (the original of "Each Has 
His Grief"), "The Spanish Lady," "The End of 
All," "The Columbian's Song" (a patriotic ode), 
and "The Winding-Up" (a revision of "The End 
of All"). 

When a more scientific study of Whitman's early 
life and writings than has hitherto been possible 
is made, these accidentally preserved "efforts" will 
prove of considerable importance.

THE SOUECES OF WILLIAM VAUGHN 

MOODY'S "THAMMUZ." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
I daresay that most readers of William Vaughn 
Moody's poetry are puzzled by his "Thammuz." 
In four stanzas the poet embodies his conception 
of life as a fusion of religious mysticism and 
pagan joy. His sources are the Bible, Milton, the 
myth of Orpheus, and Euripides. 

In his ode "On the Morning of Christ's 
Nativity," Milton writes (line 204) : 

In vain the Tyrian maids their Thammuz mourn, 
while at line 460 of "Paradise Lost" he expands 
"Ezekiel" VIII, 14, as follows: 

Thammuz came next behind, 
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured 
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate 
In amorous ditties all a summer 's day, 
While smooth Adonis from his native rock 



Kan purple to the sea, supposed with blood 
Of Thammuz yearly wounded : the love-tale 
Infected Sion's daughters with like heat, 
Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch 
Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led, 
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries 
Of alienated Judah. 

In his edition of Milton's poems ("Cambridge 
Edition," 1899), page 395, Moody has the follow- 
ing note on Milton's "Thammuz": "An important 
figure in Phoenician mythology. He was slain by 
a boar in Lebanon, but comes to life each spring, 
his death and resuscitation symbolizing the destruc- 
tive forces of winter and the quickening forces 
of spring. When the river Adonis became red- 
dened by the mud brought down from Lebanon 
by the spring torrents, it was believed to be the 
flowing afresh of Thammuz's wounds which caused 
the change of color." 

In Moody's "Thammuz" the god is represented 
as killed by frenzied women. This conception is 
not innate in the Thammuz- Adonis myth, so Moody 
effected a combination of the Orpheus story, in 
which love-maddened nymphs slay the hapless 
singer, and of the "Bacchae" of Euripides, in 
which women crazed by Dionysus tear Pentheus 
to pieces. 

I now venture to quote "Thammuz" entire: 
Daughters, daughters, do ye grieve? 

Crimson dark the freshes flow! 
Were ye violent at eve? 

Crimson stains where the rushes grow! 
What is this that I must know? 

Mourners by the dark red waters, 
Met ye Thammuz at his play? 

Was your mood upon you, daughters? 
Had ye drunken? O how grey 
Looks your hair in the rising day ! 

Mourners, mourn not overmuch 
That ye slew your lovely one. 

Such ye are; and be ye such! 
Lift your heads; the waters run 
Euby bright in the climbing sun. 

Eaven hair and hair of gold, 
Look who bendeth over you! 

This is not the shepherd old; 
This is Thammuz, whom ye slew, 
Kadiant Thammuz, risen anew!

"FEEE VEESE" DEFINED. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Members of the Poetry Society of America have 
been much concerned of late because nobody could 
seem to hit upon a satisfactory definition of vers 
libre or free verse. 

Having observed this contest for some time, and 
noted the anguish of mind into which this question 
has thrown some of our temperamental singers, I 
can no longer bear to let them suffer, and hence 
come forward to suggest the following: "Free 
verse is verse which cannot be sold and which 
must, therefore, be given away."

THE POETRY OF IJIOXEL, JOHXSOK. 



We have all been reading lately the verse 
and travel letters of a young English poet 
whom death has set apart from his fellows 
and anticipated in his favor the verdict of 
posterity. It is startling to reflect how long 
he might have waited for the fame which is 
now his, and rightly his, had not death 
silenced him forever. Yet it seems clear, as 
clear as such things can ever be, that the 
verdict is a just one, and that Rupert Brooke's 
niche in the House of Fame is secure. Be- 
tween him and Lionel Johnson a comparison 
is all but inevitable. Both were public school 
and university men, representing, therefore, 
much the same social and literary tradition; 
both early gave proof of a notable poetic gift ; 
and the fame of both rests solely upon the 
first fruits of their genius ; for, though John- 
son lived to be thirty-five, the greater part of 
his verse was written, like Brooke 's, before he 
was twenty-six. Their very portraits invite 
comparison and, at the same time, suggest the 
essential difference in their poetic quality. 
Brooke is the spirit of adventure incarnate, 
with every sense alert for what life may offer ; 
while in Johnson's steady eyes and quiet 
mouth there is the look of one to whom the 
world is not a pageant but a problem, the 
solution of which he does not expect to find in 
what he hears and sees. The one face is vivid, 
winning, richly human; the other is grave, 
reflective, even a little chilling, notwithstand- 
ing its youthful charm. And this contrast is 
more than superficial. In Johnson we miss 
the richness, the vehemence, the triumphant 
accent of the young soldier-poet's utterance; 
the will to live is less clamorous in his verse. 
On the other hand, there is a meditative 
wisdom, a sober contemplation of the mys- 
teries of life, that the younger poet, in his 
haste to be about the business of living, did 
not pause to achieve. There are, of course, 
diversities of poetic as truly as of spiritual 
gifts, but "the one Spirit's plastic stress" is 
urgent in them all. 

Of the genuineness of Lionel Johnson 's gift 
there can be no doubt. His technique to 
speak first of its external aspect is well-nigh 
flawless. He sometimes reminds us of Arnold, 
whom he sincerely admired and perhaps imi- 
tated; but at his best and dealing with a 
sympathetic theme, he often reaches a degree 
and kind of beauty at which Arnold did not

even aim. While the piercing tenderness and 
pathos of the elder poet are almost never 
found in the younger Arnold's "sad lucid- 
ity of soul" is, of course, quite beyond him 
yet the melody of his verse, its subtle ordering 
of vowel and consonant, its delicate adjust- 
ment of pause, its lingering beauty of cadence 
are not to be found in Arnold except in his 
happiest moments. The following stanzas are 
of his twentieth year and show that in the 
technique of meditative verse, at all events, he 
had little to learn: 

Ah! fair lips hushed in death! 
Now their glad breath 

Breathes not upon our air 
Music, that saith 

Love only, and things fair. 

Ah! lost brother! Ah! sweet 

Still hands and feet! 
May those feet haste to reach, 

Those hands to greet 
Us where love needs no speech. 

The curiously effective pause upon the first 
syllables of certain lines is highly character- 
istic; the short line, too, is a favorite with 
I him, and some of his most admirable verse- 
forms are built upon it. He may well have 
got a hint of its possibilities from Arnold, 
though he uses it in so different a way and 
produces with it effects so different. At all 
events such stanzas as the following sound 
pleasantly upon the ear of the lover of 
Arnold's verse: 

I, living with delight 

This rich autumnal day, 

Mark the gulls' curving flight 

Across the black-girt bay. 

Winds rush and waters roll: 
Their strength, their beauty brings 
Into mine heart the whole 
Magnificence of things. 

It is not Arnold 's music, yet in imagery, mood, 
and melody the poem from which these lines 
are taken is subtly reminiscent of "Obermann." 
Probably it is the poet's spiritual kinship with 
Arnold more than the movement of his verse 
that reminds us of him. Certainly there are 
poems in this volume that both for substance 
and for sound might be Arnold's. Let these 
stanzas from "Lucretius" bear witness : 
Thou knowest now, that life and death 

Are wondrous intervals: 
The fortunes of a fitful breath, 

Within the flaming walls. 

Without them, an eternal plan, 

Which life and death obey: 
Divinity, that fashions man, 

Its high, immortal way. 

It is evident that such verse as this might 
not improperly be called "academic," if by 
academic we mean verse that is marked by fin-

ish rather than fire, that has no touch in it of 
the "feverish rhetoric" of a Swinburne the 
phrase is Johnson 's ; that aims not so much at 
expressiveness as at pure and tranquil beauty. 
And this remark is as true of its substance as 
of its form. It is academic even in the narrow 
sense ; that is to say, it is the verse of a man 
who is by training and temper a scholar, who 
has the scholar 's love of quiet, of old ways and 
old places, the scholar's scrupulous sense of 
the becoming, the scholar's reticence and ten- 
dency to hide his life. It is even, at times, 
bookish verse. The poet delights to express 
his gratitude to his favorites in the world of 
literature, Plato, Virgil, Lucretius, Arnold, 
Lamb, Newman, the Brontes, to whose hold 
upon him many a page of his prose bears 
witness. He loved Oxford and Winchester 
with a son's devotion, and nothing could be 
more admirable in its way than the poem 
called "Oxford Nights," a descant upon the 
great books that had made those nights immor- 
tal in his memory a modern, Oxford varia- 
tion on the theme of "II Penseroso." It is an 
exquisite though unconscious picture that he 
draws, there and elsewhere, of a boyhood and 
youth spent among books, rich in friendship 
and abounding in natural and normal plea- 
sure, but touched profoundly by its inter- 
course with the things of the mind and the 
soul. He is especially eloquent and convinc- 
ing, as an Oxford man should be, when he 
draws his subject from classical antiquity. 
"Julian at Eleusis," composed in his twentieth 
year, is an admirably sympathetic study of the 
great apostate, written in a blank verse that 
is more reminiscent, perhaps, of Tennyson 
than of Milton, but that has a suave and 
stately beauty of its own. The subject is 
highly characteristic, for Julian represents 
the imaginative appeal of the finer aspects of 
Greek religion its lofty symbolism, its eso- 
teric significance which has been felt by 
the scholar in every age. To a poet of the 
generation of Arnold, such a theme would be 
especially attractive. Unable, yet, to yield 
himself to the consolations of Christianity, 
but feeling, nevertheless, the need of a faith, 
an aspiration, to fill up the void of life, he 
looked back a little wistfully, like Arnold 
himself, to a religion that did not demand of 
man what man could not give, and that still 
did not ignore or evade, like the shallow phil- 
osophies of the day, the soul 's necessities. It is 
true that in five years he was to become a 
loyal and devout Catholic, yet much of his 
early verse is tinged with the reluctant skep- 
ticism that characterizes the school of Arnold. 
It is a quite different thing from the immiti- 
gable hostility of a Swinburne or a Carducci 



to the Supplanter of the elder gods. It is 
quite unlike Leopardi's bitter nihilism. It is, 
of course, minor poetry minor in a sense that 
Arnold's is not. It is negative, acquiescent. 
Indeed, on occasion, except for its exquisite 
form, it might not unjustly be called plaintive, 
and Arnold is never that. Nor is Leopardi. 
There is a passionate vitality in both that in 
the one case has overcome and in the other 
seems certain to overcome the withering effect 
of the years. Finished as it is and congenial 
to the spirit of its day, one can not be quite 
sure that Johnson's verse will do so. 

Academic his verse is in still another sense. 
Its dominant note is meditation, not passion. 
It is not poetry that stirs the pulses; its 
ardors are intellectual. It is a little remote; 
it is often severe ; it leaves one, at first reading, 
somewhat cold. . But as one reads, the quiet 
felicity of the imagery, the meditative charm 
of the thought, the grave beauty of the phras- 
ing gradually take possession of the reader's 
mind and rule it. Such verse is not an incan- 
tation; it weaves no spell, unless its power, 
continually exerted and continually renewed, 
upon the reader's reluctance, be a spell of the 
most magical sort. One feels its beauty, as 
Pater says of Wordsworth, only at the price 
of certain adjustments and renunciations ; but 
the beauty is there, and one 's admiration of it 
is the more durable for not being easily 
yielded. Little of it is devoted to the passion 
of love, in spite of the poet's youth, and that 
little, almost without exception, is dedicated 
to a love that is spiritualized by distance or 
by death. There is, indeed, almost no "human 
interest" in these poems, not even that which 
centres in the poet himself, for he effaces 
himself as completely as it is possible to do in 
verse so entirely subjective. It is upon the 
emotion, the imagery, that our attention is 
fixed, not upon the poet who feels and sees. 
He seems to have no passions but the passion 
for Ireland and the passion for nature, and 
those are subject to obvious limitations. He 
writes with something like passion of the love 
of friends, but again it is a love that is sancti- 
fied by death or merged in the larger love of 
God. He is at his best in threnody, as might 
be expected of one in whom the care for 
ancient things, the memory of past joys, the 
piety of loved places are the food upon which 
his meditation lives. 

The passionate remembrances, 
That wake at bidding of the air: 
Fancies, and dreams, and fragrances, 
That charmed us, when they were, 

these determine the atmosphere of all his 
poetry. Even his feeling for nature, keen as it 
it, is not the characteristic poet's rapture in 



1916]

form and color and odor. It is rather the 
sense, so natural to the cultivated mind, of 
nature's age-long intercourse with man. By 
his love of her he is linked with all the genera- 
tions, and at no time does he feel more inti- 
mately his kinship with humanity than when 
his pulses stir to beauty : 

Beside the tremulous, blue sea, 
Clear at sunset, they love to be: 
And they are rarely sad, but then. 
For sorrow touches them, as men, 
Looking upon the calm of things, 
That pass, and wake rememberings 
Of holy and of ancient awe; 
The charm of immemorial Law: 
What we see now, the great dead saw! 

Here his divergence from Arnold is com- 
plete ; for the elder poet sought in nature the 
calmness, the order, the acceptance of prevail- 
ing law, which the life of man denied him. 
It is a high, austere doctrine, the gospel of 
nature as Arnold teaches it, a bracing and 
salutary discipline. To Johnson, Nature offers 
more ordinary consolations: the brooding 
quiet of a summer day, the "golden music" 
of the corn as it ripples in the autumn wind, 
the driving mists of mountain gorges, the 
wild exhilaration of "the chivalries of air." 
Above all, in the peace and the ineffable 
expansion of night and the stars he finds him- 
self most at home ; they are best suited to his 
mood of sober questioning. It is not that his 
thought or his emotion lacks energy; but the 
day distracts him, and only in the night, "that 
strange and solemn thing," does he command 
them. 

Yet when the city sleeps; 

When all the cries are still: 

The stars and heavenly deeps 

Work out a perfect will. 

These lines, among the most perfect that he 
wrote, suggest the nature of Johnson's gift ; in 
spirit he walks alone, under the friendly 
stars. It is curiously revealing, the recur- 
rence of stellar imagery in his verse. "The 
sad stars wheel," "the calm still stars wane," 
the twilight is "starred," "the clear stars shake 
within the gleaming sea, shake and abide." 
The "starry music, starry fire, high above all 
our voice and glare," are symbols of Plato's 
thought. "When sad night draws down, when 
the austere stars burn," he is mindful of his 
lost friend. Charles, "the fair and fatal 
king," rides forever at Charing Cross at- 
tended by stars. 

Xight hath fierce loveliness: clouds race 
Past star and still unconquered star, 

to herald the dawn of revolution. The life of 
the Brontes, "children of fire," reminds him 
that 

From the tempest and the gloom, 
The stars, the fires of God, steal forth. 



i He reflects how fair must be the City of God 

j if "man shall not miss the stars, nor mourn 

the sea." It may almost be said of him that 

from the depths of his sombre musings he 

; comes forth, like Dante, "to behold the stars." 

i Though a man of books, his chief teacher 

has been Earth, the common mother, "her 

memories, her splendors, her desires"; but 

it is "Earth whom the vast stars crown" that 

has taught him most. 

The spell which night and starlight lay upon 
the spirit is almost the only one which his 
verse is quite certain to render adequately. 
His poetical gifts are many, but among them 
' is not that of commanding the reader's mood. 
He can not, with a phrase or a line, color all 
the world for us, pierce us with a strange pain 
or a strange joy, or make us feel the spirit of 
a place, as Wordsworth and Arnold frequently 
do. The reader is always expecting this 
change of mood, and there is no evident reason 
i why it does not happen. Certainly, it is not 
1 an affair of many words. There are stanzas 
of a few syllables in Verlaine's "Sagesse," for 
i instance, that produce it inevitably. Perhaps 
I the reason for the lack of this gift in Johnson 
I is to be found in what may be called, for the 
lack of a better word, his reticence. In all 
that he writes, not merely in his utterances 
concerning the deeper things of life, but in his 
portrayal of a mood, in his account of some 
momentary effect of sea or sky upon his spirit, 
one feels a certain detachment, a refusal or 
an inability to tell the whole story, that pre- 
vents the reader from seeing with the poet's 
eyes and feeling with the poet's heart, and 
produces in him also an objective attitude that 
is fatal to the thrill of poetry. Horace's 
admonition may be pressed further than he 
i himself cared to press it. If the poet wishes 
I us to weep, he must not only first have wept 
i himself, but he must also not conceal from us 
i too successfully the traces of his tears. John- 
son was not of those who "publish their wist- 
fulness abroad" ; and while his reticence, in a 
i day when reticence is not, gives to his verse a 
j touch of severity that is an added charm, it 
j does prevent that contagion of the poet's mood 
| which is, after all, one of the pleasures that 
we have a right to expect from literature. 

Even his religious verse is marked by this 

curious impression of something withheld. It 

is never perfunctory, except perhaps in the 

Latin poems, as to which one's judgment may 

i easily go astray. They certainly have not the 

I ardor and the poignancy of the best of the 

i great Breviary hymns ; they are too obviously 

"composed," too evidently and laboriously put 

together, like bits of clever joinery. But the 

English verse has an unmistakable fervor and

passion; it is vital with religious as well as 
poetic inspiration. This, of course, applies to 
the poems written after his reception into the 
Catholic Church. Before that, his verse has 
the note of uncertainty, of wistfulness, of 
desire for a faith beyond his reach, which is 
the voice of his generation; but the Catholic 
poems are resonant with faith and tender with 
devotion. Nevertheless, they are not reveal- 
ing ; there is not in them that ring of anguish, 
of personal need, of mystical rapture that 
arrests us in the poetry of Francis Thompson. 
Only three or four times in all the volume is 
there an expression that strikes us as a verita- 
ble cry from the depths; for the rest, the 
lovely imagery, the exquisite music, seem to 
draw a veil between the poet's innermost mind 
and ours. 

The same objection may be made to the 
verses on Irish subjects. They lack the note 
of intensity for which we listen in poetry 
dedicated to the hopes and sorrows of an 
unhappy people. The poem entitled "Ire- 
land" is especially disconcerting to one whose 
standard in such matters is determined by the 
fashion in which Swinburne, for example, 
sings the woes of Italy. It is an admirable 
poem, full of noble imagery, of touching asso- 
ciations, and of subtle music ; but the heart is 
not wrung by it, nor is the pulse quickened. 
Johnson himself may possibly have felt this 
lack in his verse, for in an essay on "Poetry 
and Patriotism in Ireland," he genially re- 
bukes those who maintain that the sincerity 
of patriotic verse must be measured by its 
emotion and especially by its neglect of form. 
"Melancholy, and sorrow, and the cry of pain, 
it has been said by some, are more poetical 
than serenity and ardor : for my part I do not 
believe it." Whatever may be said of the 
"ardor" of Johnson's patriotic verse, .its 
serenity and its perfection of form are not to 
be denied. And, in fact, the ardor also is 
unquestionable. Not only in the Irish poems, 
but elsewhere, there is many a phrase and 
half-line which shows that his heart is "still 
in the far, fair Gaelic places," that the voice 
of "desolate Cornwall, desolate Brittany" is 
ever in his ears. 

Lovely and loved, O passionate land! 

Dear Celtic land, unconquered still! 
Thy mountain strength prevails: 
Thy winds have all their will. 

They have no care for meaner things, 
They have no scorn for brooding dreams: 

A spirit in them sings, 

A light about them beams. 

Here is the immortal charm of Celtic lands to 
every man who is capable of ' imagination 
their unconquerable poetry, the light of 



another world that lies upon them, their native 
hospitality to dreams. But the Celtic spirit 
has another side, and in this, too, the poet 
shares. "They went forth to war, but they 
always fell," says an Irish bard of the heroes 
of his race. It is of the glory and sadness of 
lost causes that such poets as Johnson most 
care to sing; but the fighting came first, and 
in Johnson, too, beneath all his pensive brood- 
ing upon things that were, there was the stuff 
of a fighter. Certainly "The Coming of War" 
and "Dawn of Revolution" are martial and 
resonant enough to satisfy his countrymen, 
even at this hour. In words that curiously 
anticipate Brooke's well-known lines, he ac- 
knowledges his debt to the earth that bore 
him and welcomes the opportunity to pay it : 
Earth cried to us, that all her laboured store 
Was ours: that she had more to give, and more: 
For nothing, did we deem? 

We give her back the glory of this hour 
O sun and earth! O strength and beauty! 
We use you now, we thank you now: our duty 
We stand to do, mailed in your power. 

It is difficult to account, in verse so personal 
as Johnson's, for the reader's curious sense of 
something wanting, for the lack of that thrill 
of intensity which one often feels in the work 
of poets much less gifted. Why, when the 
fuel is heaped so skilfully upon the altar, 
does the fire from heaven not descend to kindle 
it? Is the verse a little cold and remote be- 
cause the poet did not really feel intensely; 
or is it because his fear of undue expansive- 
ness forbade him to speak out? Or, finally, 
is it the result of an instinct that told him that 
man prizes most highly, in literature as else- 
where, those satisfactions which have not been 
gained without much effort, in which he has 
been obliged to cooperate? Notwithstanding 
Wordsworth's doctrine of "emotion recol- 
lected in tranquility , " is it quite certain that 
emotion which can be hoarded and meditated 
and transmuted was ever very keen? Such 
emotion, no doubt, is more lasting than the 
intenser sort. It is often productive of a 
high order of beauty ; but we miss in it always 
the exaltation and the lyric rapture of more 
spontaneous poetry, and we miss them because 
they were never felt. After all, the enigma 
of Lionel Johnson's verse is the enigma of his 
personality. One of his friends wrote of him 
after his death: "In earlier days he had a 
wide circle of friends in spite of a certain 
reserve and aloofness of manner, which rarely 
left him. Under the mask of irony, coldness, 
and even perversity, which he bore in personal 
intercourse, lay a passionate spirit destined 
never to find complete utterance."

RETROSPECTS OF AX ENGLISH 
JOURNALIST. * 



It is chiefly his long and richly varied 
experience as a roving newspaper writer that 
the author of "No. 5 John Street" draws 
upon for the material of his reminiscent 
volume, "My Harvest." This experience, be- 
ginning in the sixties, when the writer was in 
his twenties, has involved the visiting of many 
lands, including our own, and the meeting 
with innumerable persons of note, whose 
recorded sayings and doings help to enliven 
the pages of this genially discursive retro- 
spect. Incidentally the author's philosophy 
of life, the motives that have actuated him, 
the ends he has striven for, the ideals he has 
cherished, are with some definiteness brought 
into view. 

A sort of haphazard and rather misfit edu- 
cation, with some years of manual training 
in the engraving of seals and other diminutive 
objects, seems to have been imposed upon the 
motherless and half -neglected boy who was 
destined to make his mark with freer stroke 
than that taught to him by Benjamin Wyon, 
Chief Engraver of Her Majesty's Seals. 
Evenings at the Working Men's College under 
the teaching of Maurice, Kuskin, Ludlow, 
Furnivall, and Hughes, relieved for a while 
the cramp of the irksome days, and a for- 
tunate mission to Paris in the interests of a 
proposed Working Class Exhibition, to be 
participated in by the sons of toil of the 
two countries, England and France, went 
far toward completing the emancipation. It 
is of interest to note how the radical prin- 
ciples inevitably imbibed by the young man 
amid those associates and surroundings be- 
came the conservative views of his maturer 
years. One has only to adhere long enough to 
almost any doctrine of radical reform to find 
it in the end accepted and established in all 
respectability. It was a spirit of eager in- 
quiry in many directions that made it impos- 
sible for the young engraver to settle down 
stolidly to his task, as was expected of him 
by his father, and to accept unquestioningly 
and contentedly the lot in life whereunto tha*t 
father believed him to have been born. In 
the following passage we see some of his striv- 
ings for larger things : 

I did not remain long at the College. I hardly 
know why I think because I suffered then, as at 
other times in my life, from a most plentiful lack of 
cash. It may have been because I thought I knew 
a better way: I did not, but I had to find that out. 
So I bobbed about from one thing to another and 
mastered none. I bought my books for myself at the 
old second-hand bookshops, then extant in Holywell

Street and in Vinegar Yard under the lee of the 
Drury Lane Theatre. . . Sometimes I merely dipped 
into the Pierian spring, well knowing I could never 
afford to pay for my drink. " 'Ow's business, Joe?" 
asked a neighboring dealer of a colleague, as I was 
once engaged in this way. "Quiet," was the answer; 
"all readers an' no buyers to-night." I dropped the 
volume and vanished into the fog to hide my shame. 
I was like the monkey with the nuts in the fable. 
I could withdraw nothing from the vase of scholar- 
ship because I wanted to grasp all. 

Far into the night he pushed his reading of 
such hard-won books as he possessed, some- 
times kneeling at his literary devotions to 
keep himself from falling asleep in his chair. 
Like John Muir at a rather earlier date, he 
invented and used a device for awakening him 
to his studies at the dawn of day. It worked 
to admiration, but aroused the whole house- 
hold as well as the inventor. "Given a 
certain temperament, and I had it," he re- 
marks at the conclusion of this episode, "all 
this portended book-writing or crime per- 
haps both in a way. I made up my mind to 
be a writer, and to slip the collar of the other 
art as soon as I could." 

Carried by a lucky chance to Paris, as 
above indicated, several years before the 
downfall of the Second Empire, Mr. Whiteing 
found himself, as he says, "in touch with the 
little band who were quietly engineering" 
that impending collapse. With the Reclus 
brothers, especially, one of whom nearly paid 
with his life for the part he took in this enter- 
prise, he was on terms of intimacy. A pass- 
ing pen-portrait of the less famous of the two, 
with a brief characterization of the pair in 
their dominant traits, is worth reproducing. 

The elder, Elie, was the perfect thing in fanaticism, 
cold and self-contained. He might have sat for the 
portrait of a Covenanter. Spiritually he reminded 
me of those animals whose jaws lock in what they 
bite. Heredity may have had something to do with 
it: the father was a Swiss pastor of the Calvinistie 
type. The pair, I imagine, had long since parted with 
their Christianity to put philosophic Anarchy in its 
place. With old Blanqui, another notable figure of 
the time, they were for ni Dieu, ni maitre, the abso- 
lute freedom of the individual to walk by his own 
light, with nothing but his conscience for guide and 
law. . . I came most in contact with Elie because 
his English was better. The only soft spot in him 
was his love of literature : he usually carried a volume 
of Hugo in his pocket, perhaps as the best expression 
of the current revolt for freedom, in that domain. 
Yet, inconsistently enough, he was disposed, as a 
Frenchman, to make a reservation here in favour of 
order and law. Our easy-going independence of these 
things in English letters was hateful to him. "The 
negroid dialects," he once remarked to me in his icy 
way, "have the same simplicity of structure." 

Mr. Whiteing 's winning of a place in jour- 
nalism came after only a brief agony of 
desperate effort and semi-destitution. It was 
luck, again, so far as there is any such thing, 
that brought to him the suggestion of his

first "hit," a humorous-satirical sketch en- 
titled "A Night in Belgrave Square by a 
Costermonger. " This was a sort of reply or 
offset to a like performance that had set the 
town talking, namely, "A Night in a Work- 
house by an Amateur Casual." "The Pall 
Mall Gazette" had published this latter, to its 
considerable profit; and "The Evening Star" 
was glad to score an equal success with the 
companion piece offered by an untried 
genius, who was afterward not unwilling to 
go on with his Costermonger "and make him a 
character the Coster here, there and every- 
where in a survey of the whole scheme of 
things." Finally a book was made of him, 
which has served its ends, had its day, and 
passed into obscurity. Its author says in 
regard to this fortunate stumbling upon the 
theme that then best suited him, after con- 
siderable wasted energy and ink: "The one 
thing I had never thought of writing about 
was the thing that was nearest to my heart. 
The shyness of the pen is sometimes the most 
invincible of all." 

Of journalistic openings to the author of 
these costermongerings there seems to have 
been an unfailing abundance; or that is the 
impression conveyed by the narrative, though 
what disappointed hopes and weary waitings 
there may have been interspersed, and wisely 
left to forgetfulness, who can say? Justin 
McCarthy, prominent in those days as a ver- 
satile and accomplished journalist, historian, 
novelist, and miscellaneous writer, was one of 
the many literary craftsmen with whom this 
auspiciously beginning journalist was brought 
into friendly contact; and the picture pre- 
sented of the optimistic and genial and 
wonderfully resourceful author of "A His- 
tory of Our Own Times" is well drawn and 
pleasing. His literary style is pointed out 
as the one exception to the rule that easy 
writing makes hard reading; but the author 
weakens the effect by recording later instances 
of the same exceptionality, as for instance 
Andrew Lang, a marvellously ready and 
rapid writer whom to read is far from being 
a task. Among the leading newspapers that 
at one time or another enlisted the services of 
Mr. Whiteing, may be named the New York 
"World" and "Tribune" and the Manchester 
"Guardian." To Geneva to report the 
Alabama arbitration he was sent by the first- 
named, and to Madrid to observe Spain in 
revolution, just after the abdication of 
Amadeus, he went in the service of the 
"Tribune." Later missions of a similar char- 
acter took him to Russia, to Germany, to 
France more than once, and to our! own 
country. Among American authors he names 



Emerson as "the most abiding influence on 
my life," and pays tribute to Irving, Cooper, 
Holmes, Lowell, Whitman, Mark Twain, and 
Henry James, finding in many of these and 
other writers of this new land an agreeable 
note of kinship with those of the mother 
country. 

Generous in his praise of great authors, 
Mr. Whiteing can also be liberal in sarcastic 
disapproval of some whom he regards as less 
great. An ardent lover of Shakespeare, he 
necessarily finds himself at odds with Mr. 
Shaw in the latter 's outspoken dispraise of 
the great poet. Ibsen, too, fails to kindle his 
enthusiasm. In a paragraph toward the end 
of his final chapter, a chapter which he 
entitles "Threshing Out," the author in a 
sane and conservative fashion gives his out- 
look for the future. He says : 

Blessedness, the sweet of adversity for the building 
up of character, self-control, self-denial, the old beati- 
tudes, no matter what their theological setting, the 
old new birth of the spirit into its real self -hood, in 
one word, all that differentiates the finished article 
from the mere mistakes of the potter, these, I think, 
in their struggle for the recovery of the old ethical 
pattern, are going to be the note of a new time. 

May the prophecy come true! There is 
much else that is sane and of wholesome in- 
fluence in the book thus brought to a close. 
It will repay careful reading.

A CENTTJKY AND A HALF or AMERICAN 
DIPLOMACY.* 

"Diplomacy is dynamite with a soft voice," 
Professor Fish tells us. "The American 
type," he might have added, "is often used 
with amazing carelessness." That our hap- 
hazard practice of the art, inspired as often 
by ignorance as by design, has not resulted 
more disastrously is another evidence of the 
special Providence that guards the destinies 
of the American people. At the same time it 
affords positive proof that public opinion in 
America needs to become "internationally 
minded." This is one purpose that inspires 
the present volume, and a careful perusal of 
its pages leads us to believe that the author 
will measurably achieve it. 

In one sense American diplomacy begins 
with the famous Papal Bulls of 1493, but there 
are comparatively few other manifestations 
until the eighteenth century. The Treaty of 
Utrecht, in 1713, followed a half century later 
by the Treaty of Paris and the Royal Procla- 
mation of 1763, affords the proper basis for

later American territorial diplomacy. The 
struggle for political independence involved 
the task of obtaining continental recognition 
and of re-arranging commercial relations with 
the former Mother Country. Both France and 
England were inclined to regard the new 
nation merely as a convenient protectorate, 
to be tolerated or bullied as best served their 
financial and commercial needs. 

This attitude persisted long after the forma- 
tion of a "more perfect Union," and was fed 
by foreign predilections that long continued 
to determine domestic partisanship. The 
situation was complicated by the wars arising 
from the French Revolution and the advent of 
Napoleon Bonaparte. In the ensuing general 
struggle, the United States appeared then, as 
now, the most conspicuous champion of the 
rights of neutral commerce, with diplomacy as 
its most potent weapon. At the same time, 
the desire to navigate the great interior water- 
ways and round out the national domain 
encountered an obstinate resistance from 
Spain, reluctant to jeopardize her colonies. 
This reluctance naturally evoked an equally 
strong determination, favored by the situa- 
tion abroad, to assist these colonies in gaining 
their independence. Thus commercial needs, 
territorial ambition, and political idealism 
combined to influence the four decades of 
American diplomacy preceding the formal 
announcement of the Monroe Doctrine. 

To the diplomatic problems of that day the 
Americans brought some experience derived 
from Indian councils, early colonial agency, 
and the halls of Continental Congress. With 
this slender training they surprised contem- 
poraries and gratified posterity by the measure 
of success that crowned their efforts. If, in 
many instances, good fortune rather than good 
management brought about this result, they 
suffered but little in comparison with their 
opponents. Occasionally more astute than the 
latter, they uniformly surpassed them in 
directness and persistence. Their diplomacy, 
often amateurish in method and at times dis- 
porting itself in "shirt sleeves," depended 
less on "bluff" than simplicity and patience 
to gain its ends. No American need be 
ashamed of our foreign service when Frank- 
lin, Jay, the Pinckneys, Gallatin, and the 
''brace of Adamses" graced its rolls. 

Following the Napoleonic wars, nearly a 
score of years were necessary to settle the 
questions arising from that series of conflicts, 
to establish relations with our southern neigh- 
bors, and to announce with them a common 
separateness from Europe. New Granada, 
subsequently Colombia, in South America, 
and Mexico on our borders, occupied then and 



thereafter a prominent place in our Latin- 
American negotiations, and were ultimately 
to bear the brunt of our "manifest destiny." 
This same catchword was used to strengthen 
our territorial claim to the Pacific Northwest ; 
where, however, we were finally led to 
acknowledge the co-existent claim of Great 
Britain. In the mid-century, Asiatic exclu- 
siveness was forced to yield to commercial 
expansion and in turn to feel the effects of 
our own racial antipathy. The Civil War 
renewed the problems of blockade and neutral 
commerce, but with our nation in the role of 
belligerent. This internecine strife likewise 
provoked in Mexico the most serious test of 
the Monroe Doctrine, and inspired the most 
virulent threats against continued British 
domination in Canada. 

For more than half a century the fisheries, 
commercial claims, and Isthmian transit 
served to put an edge on our diplomatic deal- 
ings with Great Britain. Tying our own 
hands with the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, we 
avoided a clash over the last-named issue, but 
we did not thereby improve our relations with 
the Caribbean powers. Finally a boundary 
dispute in Venezuela gave the opportunity to 
proclaim that the fiat of the United States was 
law upon the American continent. The at- 
tempt to force from Great Britain a recogni- 
tion of this principle almost precipitated 
hostilities between the two countries, but it 
also marked the beginning of a new era in 
American diplomacy. 

Seward, Evarts, Blaine, and Olney exhibited 
a vigorous American spirit that rivalled the 
earlier manifestation of Clay, Calhoun, Web- 
ster, and Cass, but fell far short of the 
standard set by our earliest diplomats. Web- 
ster and Seward, the latter aided by a third 
member of the Adams family, were alone 
worthy to rank with the generation that pro- 
duced John Jay and John Quincy Adams. 
But Seward 's acquisition of Alaska was a far 
less notable act than the Florida Treaty; and 
Webster's vigorous rejoinder to Hulseman 
was far more grandiloquent than the dignified 
expression of American policy that preceded 
the Monroe Doctrine. After Seward and 
Evarts, not even Blaine and Olney could lift 
American diplomacy from the slough of petty 
and personal interests into which it had fallen. 

But events were working for a speedy 
change in our foreign policy. The interven- 
tion in Cuba established the hegemony of the 
United States in the Caribbean and made pos- 
sible the construction of an Isthmian canal 
wholly under American auspices. The occu- 
pation of the Philippines planted the Ameri- 
can flag as a challenge on the coast of Asia,

and marked the way thither by scattered 
outposts in the Pacific. The expansion that 
occurred at the end of the nineteenth century 
fulfilled some of the prophecies uttered at the 
beginning, but it did not closely correspond 
to its earlier counterpart. Its purposes were 
more clearly protective and altruistic, but its 
methods were distinctly imperialistic. The 
"open door" policy of John Hay, the abroga- 
tion of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty that he 
secured, the dismemberment of Colombia that 
he sanctioned, and the protectorate that his 
successors have virtually established over 
Santo Domingo, Nicaragua, and Hayti, mark 
successive steps in this new American im- 
perialism. 

Benevolent guidance rather than assimila- 
tion constituted its chief motive, although it 
could not wholly erase the mark of "dollar 
diplomacy," and has conspicuously failed to 
exorcise racial antipathy. A new "Pan 
Americanism" has come into being, alongside 
the earlier exclusive Monroe Doctrine. 
"Watchful waiting" has blocked the intangi- 
ble alliance between foreign concessionaires 
and our State Department. The issues of 
neutrality are with us in greater measure than 
ever before ; while the promising development 
of international arbitration, in which our part 
was so conspicuous, must await the outcome 
of the present cataclysm. Our national influ- 
ence is greater than ever; our responsibilities 
have increased in proportionate degree; but 
the majority-, of our population, hyphenated 
or otherwise, is not fully aware of either fact. 

Professor Fish's soft-speaking but dynamic 
volume ought to arouse a fair measure of 
interest in his subject. It is timely. Its 
popular figures, well-turned phrases, apt 
characterizations, clever summaries, and vigor- 
ous descriptions, in which even the illuminat- 
ing utterances of Mr. Dooley have their part, 
should be welcome to the general reader. He 
presents a connected and well-proportioned 
summary of our diplomatic history at a time 
when diplomacy has an unexpected meaning 
for the average thoughtful citizen. But one 
does not have to belong to this class, even, to 
appreciate the vivid sketches of past worthies 
in that field or to contrast their elevated 
responsibilities with the strivings for social 
prestige that but yesterday marked the service. 

The author has not hesitated to express his 
opinion, whether he decries the War of 1812 
and our war with Spain, approves the course 
of John Adams in 1799, or characterizes 
Blaine as "charlatan and genius," whose 
superficial imitation of Clay made compari- 
son with the latter odious. The few surviving 
admirers of the "Plumed Knight" may not 



relish these references to their hero, but we 
might expect them from a student of Ameri- 
can civil service. Elsewhere he does full 
justice to Elaine's permanent contributions. 
His interpretations and inferences are specific, 
well placed, and give a clear idea of the con- 
nection between a particular event and the 
establishment of a precedent based upon it. 
The various steps in the development of the 
Monroe Doctrine are especially well treated. 

As a text book for college classes, the work 
should prove particularly valuable. It has a 
good complement of maps, although the one 
relating to the Floridas will bear considerable 
revision, and one or two others should be 
subjected to slight changes. The sequence of 
events leading to the Louisiana Purchase is 
not clearly observed. There are far too many 
minor slips in dates and other minutiae, and 
numerous instances of careless proof-reading. 
These will doubtless be corrected in the later 
edition which this work should call forth. 
The author's treatment of the series of diplo- 
matic problems affecting our whole southern 
frontier, is, in the present reviewer's judg- 
ment, hardly adequate; but it is far easier 
to say this than to point out specific improve- 
ments in the same space, especially in view of 
the wide field the author attempts to cover. 

The treatment of the Indian, and of western 
topics in general, is gratifying. The book is 
well proportioned, with a minimum of direct 
quotation, illustrative rather than definitive in 
character. Some readers may prefer a more 
strict adherence to the topical method than 
Professor Fish has followed. But a good 
teacher can remedy this defect, if such it be; 
while most will agree that the chronological 
treatment, with numerous chapters and para- 
graph indentations, adds to the usefulness of 
the book as a text. One misses a formal 
bibliography. The rather infrequent foot- 
notes, giving references to monographs, 
collections of personal and general corre- 
spondence, and the better known scholarly 
magazines, suggest material for further study 
rather than afford citations to support the 
text. The index is ample, and evidently 
reasonably accurate. 

Professor Fish has not produced a treatise 
like Trescott's. This is but another way of 
saying that his work is not based on personal 
experience, and that it does not embody the 
traditions of an earlier age. Nor does he 
exhibit the cautious judgment and predilec- 
tion for system that mark the books of 
ex-Secretary Foster. But his pages reveal a 
purpose, easily perceptible to student and 
casual reader. American diplomacy, with all 
its faults, has been characterized by simplicity,

liberality, and directness. Personality, too, 
has played its part, but not in a way to 
obscure the true features of democracy. Our 
author wishes us to see these facts, and suc- 
ceeds in making us see them. For this, his 
work deserves hearty commendation.

WAR 



RELIGION.* 



The Christian mind has never been so stag- 
gered as by the Great War. This shows the 
lack of logic in the Christian mind; for the 
hidden sins that eat placidly, poisonously, 
continuously, into the life of society give the 
lie to Christianity quite as much as war does. 
The death-rate among babies in a congested 
city is as devilish a fact as the slaughter of 
men by shrapnel and bayonets; indeed it is 
worse in a way, for fewer idealistic pretexts 
can be found for indirect murder than for 
modern war. The helplessness of the churches 
to stop that death-rate has long been cause of 
scoffing to radicals, and Christian men had as 
much reason to be ashamed of themselves in 
1913 as they have now. 

Yet the visible is the effective. For drama- 
tic horror, this breaking loose of Hell in a 
seemingly secure and refined civilization is 
without parallel. "We all know it, witness 
our restless days and haunted nights. Chris- 
tians know it perhaps best of all, and they are 
unhappy people these days. Their unhappi- 
ness, their perplexity, and, better, their 
attempts at constructive thinking, are re- 
flected in numerous books, a few of which are 
dealt with in this review. When first the war 
broke out, men could utter little beyond a cry 
of pain. As it goes on, the power of thought 
awakens. The race must keep on living, and 
it must find out how. Religious minds ought 
to have some solution to offer; and the chief 
thing that strikes one in glancing over this 
group of books is that people are beginning to

recognize a stimulating power in the world- 
catastrophe, and to see in it not only judgment 
but opportunity. 

France, England, America, and Russia are 
represented here. There are, as it happens, 
no books from Germany or Italy ; but no one 
doubts that in these countries also are minds 
that rise with Romain Rolland "above the 
battle." Perhaps a writer in the "Christliche 
Welt" expressed other Germans besides him- 
self awhile ago, when he demanded that a 
moratorium be proclaimed on Christianity till 
the war is over. The Pope is thinking, 
though nobody dare pretend to read his mind. 

Not all of these books are directly concerned 
with the issues of the present war. Indeed, 
the most striking of the group, Solovyof 's 
"War and Christianity," was published in 
1900, and the author died the following year. 
His thought is occupied with a general inquiry 
into the relations of Christianity to warfare 
and incidentally to all earthly life. The result 
is rather an extraordinary book. It shows the 
habitual Russian blend of realism with mys- 
ticism, of sardonic irony with naive and fervid 
faith. It is inconclusive, but it searches deep. 
The form is that of imaginary conversations. 
They are breezy, full of wit, as clever and 
modern as they are Russian. The speakers 
include a fine old General, erect-minded, 
religious, who is plunged in distress because 
modern peace-propaganda is undermining the 
devout faith in the nobility of war, necessary 
to the maintenance of military ideals ; a poli- 
tician, a good disputant, who entertains as he 
says the usual enlightened European point of 
view; a lady who plays the part of hostess; 
a young Prince, follower of Tolstoy, aglow 
with pacifist, socialist, humanitarian views; 
and a mysterious Mr. Z., who stays in the 
background, cracking an occasional joke or 
briefly exposing a fallacy, till he emerges in 
the last dialogue as the uncompromising 
Christian mystic, and bears off the honors. 

It would be difficult to defend war better 
than the General does. Able statesmanship, 
fatuous and worldly, is capitally expressed by 
the politician. Culture and civilization are his 
shibboleths, and he has an international mind. 
War was a necessity while Europe was evolv- 
ing order from barbarism, but it is becoming 
obsolete. In a society which possesses in com- 
mon Shakespeare and Goethe and the great 
geniuses of France and Russia, any war would 
henceforth be civil war and is unlikely to 
happen. The pacifists meet his approval, for 
they are helping to dispel any slight danger 
that remains. The politician is an old man, 
and he talks at the end of the last century, so 
one may hope that he died happy. 



380 



[April 13 



The portrait of the Prince is the most inter- 
esting. He is the aversion of Solovyof, who 
was the determined opponent of Tolstoyan 
ideas. The choicest modern phrases concern- 
ing fraternity, social welfare, neo-Christianity 
that eliminates Christ, the kingdom of God on 
earth, run glibly off his lips. But there is 
something queer about him. The talk in time 
strikes into religious lines. Of a sudden, Mr. 
Z. challenges the reality of progress, and the 
stark question emerges whether Christianity 
justifies faith in social redemption on earth, 
or whether it points to a catastrophic end of 
history. Anti- Christ is mentioned j the Prince 
slips abruptly away. But when he returns, the 
distasteful subject is still under discussion. 
In the pleasant Riviera villa where the friends 
are gathered it is noted that the atmosphere 
has slightly darkened. Mr. Z. now leads the 
conversation. It is he who raised that ques- 
tion about progress, he who stresses the 
antithesis between a religion centred in a 
Resurrection, and the travesty as he thinks 
concerned only with kindliness and social 
welfare. The hint why the Prince ran away 
is not pursued ; only Mr. Z. closes the talk by 
reading a manuscript written by a monk, his 
friend. It is the prophecy of a world in which 
war has ceased and the ideals -of the Prince 
prevail under the sway of Anti-Christ in 
person, till the End of History arrives. 

This last section may seem a mere fantasia, 
like Hugh Benson's "Lord of the World," 
which it curiously resembles. But somehow, 
again and again the book strikes to the quick. 
In the pacifist and humanitarian ideal, 
Solovyof sees only a subtle form of material- 
ism, to be viewed with contemptuous dread. 
Should this ideal be fully realized, men will 
continue to live not in a Kingdom of God but 
in a Kingdom of Death, unless they accept the 
revelation of immortality in the Risen Christ. 
The cessation of war, social justice, all tem- 
poral improvements, are either temptations or 
trivialities. Nothing matters except the 
power of humanity to maintain faith in the 
eternal soul. In the assumption that belief in 
earthly progress and in supernatural Chris- 
tianity are incompatible, may be recognized 
a pessimism peculiarly Russian and peculiarly 
profound. 

It is to be feared that Solovyof would often 
hear the voice of his Prince in certain of the 
other books in our group, which approach the 
subject of peace purely from an ethical direc- 
tion. This is true in the most vital of an 
interesting group of papers gathered from a 
Pacifist Conference in London, those in par- 
ticular by the Hon. Bertrand Russell and Mr. 
Edward Carpenter, which scintillate with 



keen and brave ideas. It is probably the 
Prince who speaks also through Dr. Adler's 
"The World Crisis and Its Meaning," but he 
has gained insight and it is hard to cavil at 
him. The book is cogent and constructive. 
Dr. Adler is not a peace-at-any-price man. 
He holds that war may be just, even in self- 
defence, that is, "in defence of the human- 
ity resident in your own person." Yet he is 
clear that its moral assets are either temporary 
or by-products, and that "the fierce stimulant 
of war" is not necessary to nerve us to escape 
the evils of commercial sin. Dr. Adler is like 
Solovyof in at least one respect : he sees that 
militarism is merely a symptom, which can not 
be attacked directly. "Militarism is the gun, 
but the power behind the gun is commercial- 
ism, industrialism, imperialism." "The ma- 
chine gun is the counterpart of the machine 
loom." Thus the human race has run into a 
sort of an impasse both in industry and in 
war. 

How to get out of it? Dr. Adler shows 
relentlessly the weakness of most of the safe- 
guards urged. The mainsprings of the peace 
movement, "the appeal to sentiment and 
the appeal to pecuniary self-interest, " have 
proved helpless. Religion and socialism are 
broken reeds. Little faith can be placed in 
Hague tribunals, international courts, or the 
abolition of secret diplomacy. Nationalism, 
based on the need for commercial expansion, 
culminating in rival imperialisms, and using 
militarism for its tool, is stronger than them 
all. But in the purification of nationalism 
can be found the slow way out. Mere cosmo- 
politan ideals are useless; but "a world-wide 
ethical movement inspired by an enlightened 
sense of varied national types is called for." 
A contribution to just such a sense is offered 
in an interesting and partially fresh chapter 
on American, German, and English ideals. 
German Pflicht und Schuldigkeit plus a mys- 
tic impulse are set against the aristocratic 
English watchword "noblesse oblige," with its 
conception of government from the top down, 
and the American reverence for the uncom- 
mon quality latent in the common man. 
When sympathetic understanding and mutual 
regard among nations are mature, and only 
then, something may be hoped for from 
mechanical devices for the enforcement of 
peace. Sacrifice and self-control are as essen- 
tial as sympathy to compass the great end, 
but sacrifice for the nation can be found else- 
where than in war, in the sphere of political 
and social activity. The book is therefore 
quite properly devoted in the last half to de- 
veloping an admirable programme of social 
reform. The suggested incentive to such 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



381 



reform is "so to live as to release the life that 
is in others." It is a noble formula, and if 
applied would certainly end war. Dr. Adler 
claims that not sympathy but spirituality is 
the animus of it. Christians will find it hard 
to acknowledge this, and are likely to deem 
the incentive, taken by itself, insufficient. 

The understanding of alien national types 
for which Dr. Adler pleads is remote from 
some of the belligerents. Here is an English 
book, "The Great Sacrifice,'' which moves on 
very high levels in a way, urging with power 
the necessity that England repent her of her 
sins, but at the same time serenely assured 
that her cause is the cause of the Lord. And 
here are two of the chief religious leaders of 
France, M. Paul Sabatier and M. Paul Loisy, 
equally convinced that sheer barbarism char- 
acterizes their opponents. Solovyof 's General 
would enjoy their assumption that fight to the 
death is the only way of righteousness. Each 
adds to this comfortable faith a personal 
stress, for war does not suppress one's 
private specialties in enthusiasm. M. Saba- 
tier is concerned with the genial effort to 
illustrate the promise of spiritual rebirth in 
France; M. Loisy quite as characteristically 
appears largely desirous of discrediting the 
Pope, and denying the increase of Catholic 
sympathies in his country. But the author 
of "L'Evangile et 1'Eglise" goes further. He 
presses home by all the resources of his elo- 
quence, and he has, as the translator says, a 
style "light, clear, and pregnant," "the 
impotence of the Gospel to realize its ideal." 
"We are compelled to acknowledge that 
Christendom has failed continuously and in- 
creasingly to carry out the principles laid 
down by Christ. And the reason is not to be 
sought in our human imperfection, but 
rather in the too simple imaginative and rigid 
form which the principle itself has assumed 
in the Gospel. It was a sublime and unrealiz- 
able dream." 

Perhaps the war marks the final stage in 
discarding the dream. One feels that the 
former priest contemplates with a certain 
bitter satisfaction the spectacle of Christian 
nations destroying each other. And since old 
habit is strong, and the need for some sort of 
religion indubitable, it is with profound joy 
that he hails in Dr. Adler 's "purified sense of 
nationality" the successor and substitute to 
the ascetic mythology which has long held 
Western thought under its dreamy yoke. His 
sharply cut contention is that patriotism and 
Christianity are opposed, and that patriotism 
is destined to supplant Christianity as a 
religious power. " Christianity is not founded 
upon the notion of humanity, but upon the 



transcendental and un verifiable notion of a 
plan of eternal salvation devised by the 
Master of the universe for those whom he has 
willed to choose." "The gospel of Jesus 
implies the non-existence of nationality; it 
effaces it." "The author of this little book 
makes no claim except to patriotism, such a 
national and truly humane ideal as may be 
a return towards the religions of antiquity. 
His final conclusion is that this ideal can and 
should go far beyond Christianity itself." 
This "super-religion," consisting in respect, 
first, for the individual, then for the nation, 
"has been derived from the Gospel; it has 
been prepared by the Gospel, and would not 
have been born without it, but it is going 
beyond it." Nothing conduces to clear think- 
ing more than saying exactly what one means ; 
M. Loisy is unmistakable. 

So the Frenchman, like the Russian, faces 
a complete discrepancy between social or 
national progress and the ideal of Jesus ; only 
where the Russian draws the inference that 
progress is worthless, the Frenchman decides 
that the Gospel is obsolete. The remaining 
books in our list deny the alternative. They 
are all the products of Christian optimism, 
maintaining, a little breathlessly, that if 
Christianity can only for once get itself tried 
it will outgrow war and usher in the King- 
dom. They are equally sure that unless it 
does get itself tried, the race is headed for 
suicide. 

None of these books have the literary charm 
of the French or the Russian. Most are ex- 
tended pamphlets, written by professed paci- 
fists, succinct, pertinent, and charged to 
the lay mind with Christian commonsense. 
Neither their diagnosis nor their remedies, to 
be sure, come within the present horizon of 
politics, but so much the worse for politics. 
The encouraging thing about them is that, see- 
ing the long perspective ahead, they do not 
lose heart, but seek stubbornly to raise the 
peace-movement "from the mazy region of 
propaganda up to the plane of international 
politics" and to enlist statesmanship rather 
than sentiment in its service. They are free 
from partisanship ; and they achieve -an auda- 
cious feat of imagination, for they contem- 
plate a Christian nation! In that nation, 
honor is identified with forbearance and not 
with self-assertion, and risks are taken for 
the sake of peace. Far from coveting military 
efficiency, it would avoid that, because, as Dr. 
Jefferson says, the first effect of it would be to 
make the nations afraid of us, and "it is the 
worst fate that can befall a nation that other 
nations become afraid of it. Fear passes in- 
evitably into hate, and the hate of its neigh- 



382

bors is the one thing that no nation can 
afford. . . Who knows what might happen if 
a great Republic like ours should take a mag- 
nificent risk for God?" 

This attitude does not mean belief that 
force can be wholly dismissed : against reason- 
able preparedness (soothing and meaningless 
watchword!) these authors have no protest. 
But generous fancy plays around far possi- 
bilities. Instead of spending thirty millions 
on two dreadnoughts, Dr. Jefferson sees 
America pouring out the same sum for the 
healing of the nations. And if indemnities 
are to be exacted, why should the nations 
responsible for the slaughter pay them ? Why 
not we, who have suffered less and can afford 
more than any other people? Indemnities, 
be it remembered, are not paid by guilty 
governments but by innocent working folk. 
In like spirit, Dr. Gulick outlines a truly 
heavenly policy toward Mexico, such as might 
surely end her antagonism to us and almost 
put an end to her troubles. Such interna- 
tional behaviour might incidentally prove 
highly conducive to safety and prosperity in 
the long run! 

These books are not written by dreamers, 
however, but by minds at close grapple with 
reality. On a nearer level, they are full of 
clear, keen thinking. Dr. Atkins analyzes 
with convincing power the real causes of war. 
Dr. Jefferson's study of the situation from a 
religious point of view leads straight to named 
corruptions at Washington. As for Dr. 
Gulick, his definite and brilliant proposals for 
the solution of our immigrant problem in the 
West have attracted attention in highest quar- 
ters. It may be said of all these works that 
they are rich in constructive suggestions, 
worthy the attention of all sober persons. 

It is mean thought that does not kindle at 
such ideas ; but it is foolish thought that ex- 
pects to realize them easily. Sensible and 
inevitable as they sound, humanity must be 
born again to achieve them. No Hague con- 
ference, no pacifist machinery will avail, on 
this all lay equal stress, unless behind them 
lies a virile Christianity, strong to inspire 
national policies with the courage of fraternal 
faith. Must not such Christianity draw from 
deeper sources than mere ethical ideals ? The 
supernatural in religion is not discussed by 
these books; it is assumed. They do not stop 
to ask whether the Gospel be simply an ad 
interim policy, for use while the human race 
awaits annihilation ; they feel too desperately 
that all other sources of redemption fail. In 
the words of the Master of Life, they read no 
"plan of eternal salvation" for the elect, but 
principles of divine wisdom one with love, 



which in measure as they are introduced into 
the hearts of men must pass into the structure 
of states. 

An English book entitled "Christ and 
Peace," a collection of papers by minds now 
active in the Fellowship of Reconciliation, 
presses close home the Christian ideal in its 
fulness. It looks for the winning of the world 
to peace only when it shall be won to Christ, 
and the Cross dominates the road which leads 
to the great goal. On lines of statesmanship, 
this book is less valuable than some others; 
but of all under review it offers most help 
to the troubled private conscience. Perhaps 
it places a shade too much emphasis on the 
crime of inflicting physical death, as if that 
could be segregated from other crimes and put 
in a separate and more evil class. But the 
book as a whole has a pathetic interest as the 
work of Englishmen who have actually learned 
to love their enemies (one remembers that 
early in the war a clergyman was publicly 
rebuked for preaching from this text), and 
who are suffering for their convictions. 

"Church and Nation," by another English- 
man, the Rev. William Temple, may give yet 
more aid than the last to troubled minds. Mr. 
Temple, one of the authors of that stirring 
book, "Foundations," is a leader among the 
younger High Churchmen. His temperate, 
illuminating, closely reasoned discussion of the 
relations of Church and State has no direct 
bearing on the peace problem ; and it can not 
be given in this review the attention which it 
deserves. But it meets point by point the 
argument of M. Loisy. Religion is broader 
than Christianity, and Christianity is broader 
than the Church. Yet even for the poor hesi- 
tant Church (to be revered, says one of the 
other writers, "not for what it has done but 
for what it is going to do") the present crisis 
may offer the opportunity of the ages. Only, 
however, thinks Mr. Temple, if that crisis 
stimulates it to embrace at once that principle 
of nationality which Catholicism has wrongly 
ignored, and that universal ideal which the 
Reformation abandoned. If it can rise to this 
height we may yet see, not a free Church in 
a free State but free States in a free Church, 
and such a Church may be the very power 
needed to purify patriotism from its narrow- 
ness, and the essential preliminary to a united 
and fraternal world. 

At all events, the religious mind, as met in 
these books, is neither moribund nor cloistered. 
It is bowed down by penitence, it gropes be- 
wildered among shadows, it contradicts itself 
often. But it lives and wakes and seeks.

RECENT FICTIOX.* 



Mr. Chamberlain's "John Bogardus" is the 
story of a young man with a pre-arranged 
education who came into the monotonous con- 
ventionality of American university life and 
felt that if he was ever to be anything worth 
while he must make his escape, get out into 
the world, and become something worth while 
to be. So only would he have anything to 
teach. He went out into the world and served 
several turns, first as a gentleman-vagabond 
and then as a sailor, and learned that what- 
ever one becomes, one always becomes all that 
one has been, or, in other words, that every- 
thing counts and that one must count every- 
thing, especially in marriage. This wisdom he 
gained by several experiences. The first 
taught him something about the personal life, 
the second something about the life in com- 
mon, both through the medium of girls. He 
then drifted into being a man of letters, and 
had another and deeper experience of which 
I cannot state the exact influence, save that 
(in connection with the war) it gave him en- 
larged and excellent views on society which he 
embodied in some very impressive essays on 
"The New Crucifixion." The result of 'these 
essays was that he was once more called to 
the university from which he had made his 
escape, and accepted the call with the feeling 
that he had at last got something that he could 
teach. It is not said whether there will be 
another volume telling what he taught, and 
(to my mind a much more difficult matter) 
how he taught it. 

From this account one will easily judge that 
one ought to read this book with more sympa- 
thetic interest than I have had. I must 
confess that this is so, although Mr. Chamber- 
lain 's main idea (so far as I grasp it) seems 
to me excellent. Many must feel how unsatis- 
factory is the teaching and living founded 
only on what one has been told, whether by a 
previous generation or by one's own, or what 
one has read in books or magazines or Sunday 
supplements. One often wants (whether a 
university teacher or not) to live a life and 
to see others live a life which is the simple and 
direct expression of what one really is. Mill- 
ions have had that feeling, and it is at the 
very bottom of that revolutionary teaching 
which will in time transform the world. 
Nothing external is enough, our Lord felt,

no laws, commandments, customs, usages, 
principles, or anything else. It is only from 
within that one can have real life. John 
Bogardus set off on no foolish quest; he set 
off on a journey in which he had been pre- 
ceded by some of the noblest who have lived. 
That he did not seek the end by the way they 
trod is not necessarily against him or against 
Mr. Chamberlain, for one must work with 
what one has, and in the end if you get to the 
right place you are there, however you may 
have got there. Nor is it remarkable that 
Mr. Chamberlain should have found that the 
way he had conceived led to a new (and to 
most of our minds a very discreditable) cruci- 
fixion, for some sort of crucifixion inevitably 
stands before the end of such a way. One 
need not object to such reasons as those. But 
in reading a story like this, one cannot avoid 
wanting to be carried along by a sense of 
reality, by a feeling of life, by the illusion 
(if illusion it be) that all this is so, that how- 
ever strange these ways, however unjustified 
in the minds of the wise and the prudent, 
however impossible to those who judge of 
what may be by the cold proof of what has 
always been, yet still that outcome is plain, 
undeniable, and absolutely right and to be 
desired. 

In fact, one may offer the book its own test. 
All this, we may say, must come out of actual- 
ity. Not because Mr. Chamberlain has read of 
such and such experiences of farm-hand and 
sailor, or thought of them, or wished for them, 
not even because he may have had them. 
It is of no consequence what he read, thought 
of, wished, or was, unless his reading, think- 
ing, wishing, being has somehow given him 
the power of understanding the tremendous 
cross-currents of the life he tells of, or of feel- 
ing their tumultuous courses so deeply that he 
can make it all seem to us in a measure at 
least what it has been to him, or may have 
been. The book should give us the illusion, 
at least, of life. 

There are two other books which come to 
mind here: Mr. Kussy 's "The Abyss," and 
Mr. Noble's "The Bottle-Fillers," for they 
deal more particularly with phases of life that 
"John Bogardus" passes over rather lightly, 
one the life of a vagabond, the other the life 
of a sailor. These books appear to be written 
by men whose heads and hearts are full of 
things that they must write down. They are 
full of actuality, full of detail, full of fact. 
They do not carry conviction to an equal 
degree ; "The Bottle-Fillers" is the more vivid, 
the more living, the more actual book. Both 
writers are possessed by an idea, and that 
idea much the same : the insistent feeling that 



384 



THE DIAL 



[April 13 



the sailor, the hobo, is an individual who 
struggles in a failing fight with the dead 
weight of a social indifference and a social 
stupidity. Yet in neither book is the idea 
so dominant as to override the things which 
give it form; in neither does it take away 
from the impression of life itself. The captain 
of the inferior and overloaded "tramp" first 
battles with the sea, then has to battle (in an 
inquiry) with the inadequate machinery of an 
out-worn system, then with the vaguely pon- 
derable weight of society in general, always 
pressing on a man already down. It is all 
good; in all, Mr. Noble knows what he is 
talking of and takes his time to tell us. Storm 
at sea, dense and heavy lawcourt, the dirty 
round of the wet docks, one after another, 
and a dozen more, scene after scene, give 
us the actual, vital, acrid taste of life, yet 
thrilling too, even tonic. The descriptions of 
the sea are the best, perhaps because even in 
life itself some things are felt more keenly than 
others; the touch of art is always the same 
whether the subject be remarkable or common- 
place, yet there is something in subject too. 
Mr. Noble is a fine hand at the sea. I have 
read nothing by him before ; if I had, I should 
be sure to remember it. Nor is the book 
merely a string of descriptions, nothing of 
the sort: there are people in it too, not such 
very marked characters but people with feel- 
ing, deep and passionate, so that we follow 
along the course of O'Hagan and Lucy with 
that sort of sympathy that makes one 
acquiesce in the end that our writer sees 
must be. Good fortune, or bad fortune, it all 
has the sign of actuality. 

"The Abyss" does not give any such sense 
of coming direct from life itself, nor could 
one properly expect that it would. Few who 
have ever known those depths as a matter of 
daily experience ever come up to what we 
think of as the surface. Hobos, broken men, 
down-and-outs rarely turn men of letters. If 
one would write of such life one must learn 
of it from such report as one may get, and 
it is hard work to give a clear, an undisturbed 
view. Mr. Kussy's book sounds a little too 
much like the newspapers in some places, too 
much like Dickens in others. It rarely has the 
peculiar smell of the underworld; his people 
have had a bath and their clothes have been 
fumigated. Still, there is much in the book. 
The childhood of the little Jewish boy, the 
life on the road, the days in prison, the effort 
to make a place in the world of New York, are 
all true to life, even if they have not the 
absolute illusion to make it seem life itself. 

Both books make us feel what the authors 
have in mind. They do not have to tell us 



often, it is true, they cannot help telling us 
how hard is the world, how cruel, how stupid, 
but that is because it seems as though they 
could not help it, as though the thing were 
somehow pressed out of them. Such books 
make more of an impression on me than the 
rather airy resume that gives us the striking 
points in the working out of an idea. 

"Those about Trench" is a very interesting 
book, though it seems to be written with a 
thorough disregard for the very things which 
might have been chiefly counted on to make 
it so. One cannot say it has a well-constructed 
plot; it begins with an interest about Dr. 
Trench, goes on with Saadi Sereef, and then 
gets well settled for the last half on Jaffer, 
whom no one has heard of before. Then it is 
not strong on character: the representatives 
of the different nationalities who have gath- 
ered about Trench seem admirably drawn, but 
the only one I can judge the American 
is sadly commonplace or else conventional, and 
so, possibly, the others may be. The book has 
a "fundamental idea" without much doubt, 
but for most of one 's reading one forgets that 
there is one, and the author certainly neglects 
to clinch the matter at the end. Indeed, Mr. 
Lewis neglects to do most of the things he 
ought to have done (in any ordinary well- 
behaved way), and yet he somehow gives the 
constant impression that he is all right and 
that his book is excellent. One reads it with 
unflagging interest in what is going to happen 
next; the people are always entertaining 
(except perhaps one or two), and the idea of 
the book keeps impressing itself here and 
there so that at the end one remembers it, 
even though Mr. Lewis does not bother to say 
much on the subject. 

Those about Trench from whom the book 
is named are a number of medical students 
gathered in Chicago from various parts of 
the earth China, India, Boston, Russia, 
Persia for the study of medicine, who have 
come under the wing of Dr. Trench and live 
in a sort of caravansary in his house. Just 
this combination is probably enough to carry 
any book, indeed, if Mr. Lewis had not 
allowed himself to be diverted from them to 
topics unprovided for in his title he would 
probably have developed the possibility more 
fully. Beside these five, there is Jaffer (who 
used to be of the number but has gone back to 
the hill-country of India) and Saadi Sereef, 
who really take away the interest from the 
caravansary and locate it in their own persons 
and proceedings. Not the least charm of these 
Orientals is their mastery of the English 
language. The Persian appears to be the best 
at it ; he is certainly much more elegant than 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



385 



the Bostonian, whose conversation is deplora- 
bly like that of other Americans of his age. 
But Saadi Sereef comes very near him, though 
his inability (apparently total) to imagine the 
function of the article in our speech gives his 
language a most whimsical turn. But it is not 
merely with these interesting Orientals that 
the story has to do. Dr. Trench has other 
interests, and Mr. Lewis has chosen as the 
time for his story the period of a year or so 
(I take it) before his marriage, so that we 
become interested in the lady who became his 
wife and her concerns. All these matters are 
intermingled and developed and make a plot 
which, as I have said, is not at all what it 
should be. 

Dr. Trench was a scientist and what we 
should vaguely call an atheist, at least he 
told Saadi he did not believe in Bog. Ameen 
was a very broad-minded person, Chatter jee 
belonged to the Brahmo Somaj, Becker was a 
Jew, Wu may have been a Confucian, Deland 
was an earnest member of the Y. M. C. A., 
Saadi said he hated and despised religion. 
There was in all this something oppressive to 
Miss Edith Bridgeman, a young woman with 
strong religious convictions and principles 
who was engaged in studying science. She 
and Dr. Trench both gained an enlargement 
of view during the time covered by the story. 
So did Saadi, although I am not at all clear 
just what it was. Mr. Lewis probably felt 
that he had better business in hand than 
theological or even psychological analysis. He 
possibly felt that viewing life as he did and 
seeing certain things in it, it was quite enough 
to present what he saw and let the rest take 
care of itself. 

I think he was quite right. No one can 
maintain that a novelist should have no con- 
victions about the serious things of life 
(religion among them), or that he should not 
allow them a place in his books. It is better 
that he should believe much and that what 
he believes should be found in his books. It 
has been so with almost all great novelists: 
they have had all sorts of beliefs and convic- 
tions, and one has generally been able to get 
at those they felt most important. Our preju- 
dice against such things comes first in the case 
of men who are not great novelists, but who 
take the form of the novel as a means of 
presenting their views. It is deepened by 
those who, though they have something of the 
novelist's art, are still unable to make their 
ideas implicit in the picture of life that they 
convey. Mr. H. G. "Wells, a while ago, took 
pains to say that religion nowadays was prac- 
tically barred from the newspaper and the 
novel. As to the newspaper, we need not 



concern ourselves ; but as to the novel, it may 
be said that (whatever be the fact) there is 
always an opportunity for religion in a novel 
when there happens to be a religious element 
in the life that has interested the novelist. 
Hence there is a good deal of religious thought 
in the novels of our own time, about one 
hundred times the amount there was when 
Sir Walter Besant said, "Thank heaven, the 
religious novel is a thing of the past. " " Those 
about Trench" is not a religious novel, but 
the people who are in it are not insensible to 
what is still one of the most universal of the 
higher impulses of life.

Several books by the late Sister 
Nivedita (Margaret E. Noble) 



columns, all of them being concerned primar- 
ily with presenting Hinduism to Occidental 
minds. In a new volume by this remarkable 
Irish woman, "Religion and Dharma" 
(Longmans), we have the other side of her 
work. Here again she is absolutely confident 
of the "power of the Indian consciousness to 
absorb the contribution of the West and to 
transmute it"; and she is equally confident 
that Hinduism in some form will soon be the 
leading religion and philosophy of the world. 
"Not the churches of the world alone, but the 
very universities of Europe, will yet do 
homage before the names of Indian thinkers, 
who, living in the shelter of forest-trees, and 
clad in birch-bark or in loin-cloths, have for- 
mulated truths more penetrating and more 
comprehensive than any of which Europe her- 
self childishly bent on material comfort 
ever dreamed." But she is not so intent on 
emphasizing this belief as on appealing to 
Young India to appropriate and develop the 
virtues we are prone to think of as belonging 
rather to the Occident than to the Orient. Of 
course it is impossible to say what effect these 
papers will have on their readers; but to the 
present reviewer they seem exactly the sort 
of thing that ought to be said to the youth of 
India. "Righteousness lies in duty done." 
"Heroism in great moments is the natural 
blossom of a life that in its little moments is 
fine and fearless." "Hinduism will undoubt- 
edly develop a larger democratic element." 
"The struggle with material conditions is 
eternally necessary for the upward growth of 
the spirit." "Does it matter that instead of 
ringing the temple bells at evening, we are 
to turn to revive a dying industry? Does it 
matter that instead of altars we are to build

factories and universities?" "Fighting is 
worship as good as praying. Labor is offer- 
ing as acceptable as Ganges water." But 
readers who are interested in India will prefer 
to make their own excerpts from this thought- 
ful volume. Probably we should note that 
the pieces in this posthumous collection 
appeared originally several years ago. In a 
brief Introduction, Mr. H. K. Ratcliffe says 
we should remember that they "were thrown 
off with great rapidity in the midst of a 
crowded and arduous life of service in India" ; 
but no apology is needed, when their purpose 
is kept in mind. 

When, in the late autumn of 
\ book , of 1914, the first bewildered fugi- 

the homeless. . 

tives from the war areas began 
to drift into Paris, and some systematic provi- 
sion for their relief became imperative, Mrs. 
Edith Wharton and others of a little group 
of American and French residents in the 
capital organized the American Hostels for 
Refugees. To provide needed funds for the 
ever-increasing activities of this organization, 
and for the allied labors of the Children of 
Flanders Rescue Committee, Mrs. Wharton 
conceived the plan of enlisting the collabora- 
tion of her literary and artistic confreres in 
the production of a volume that might be 
likely to find a wide popular sale in this coun- 
try and abroad. This plan is now realized in 
"The Book of the Homeless" (Scribner), a 
quarto of imposing beauty in every external 
detail, and providing in its contents a remark- 
ably varied and attractive feast. So many 
famous names English, American, French, 
Belgian appear in the list of contributors 
that to begin to specify without going through 
the entire roll would be difficult indeed. 
Besides editing the volume, Mrs. Wharton has 
enriched its pages with an original poem and 
with numerous English renderings, remark- 
able in quality, of the poems contributed by 
French writers. These, and the offerings of 
Henry James, Mr. Joseph Conrad, Mr. John 
Galsworthy, and Mrs. Humphry Ward, seem 
to us the most notable items on the literary 
side. In the artistic section, special mention 
should be made of the fine photogravure from 
Sargent's portrait of Henry James, and the 
reproductions in color of work by Leon Bakst, 
Claude Monet, and Rodin. There are one or 
two contributions that might well have been 
spared from the book, as for instance, Miss 
Agnes Repplier's attempt to maintain the 
novel thesis that the sins of one nation cancel 
or obliterate the sins of another, the writer 
misquoting Matthew Arnold into the bargain ; 
or Mr. Edmund Gosse's solemn arraignment 
of "The Arrogance and Servility of Germany" 



on the evidence of a nocturnal frolic of some 
German officers in a Konigswinter hotel. A 
delicious bit of fooling, in grateful contrast 
to the necessarily rather sombre atmosphere 
of the book as a whole, is Mr. Max Beerbohm 's 
colored cartoon, "A Gracious Act," depicting 
"Lord Curzon of Kedleston reading to M. 
Cammaerts a translation (signed with his own 
hand) of a poem by M. Cammaerts." Alto- 
gether, we cannot commend this notable book 
too unreservedly to our readers, both for its 
own quality and for the sake of the beneficent 
charities in whose interests it is published. 



Humorous If Mr - John Kendrick Bangs is 
aspects of the always as successful in enter- 
ot ' taining his lecture-audiences as 
he is in amusing his readers with anec- 
dotes of his lecturing experiences, he 
will never speak to other than full houses. 
"From Pillar to Post" (The Century Co.) 
rehearses the humors, agreeable and vexa- 
tious, of a lecturer's lot as recalled by 
Mr. Bangs after an extended acquaintance 
with its pleasures and pains. His open- 
ing chapter contains a reminiscence, not 
untimely at the present moment, of a 
finely characteristic exhibition of tact and 
kindness on the part of Mrs. Julia Ward 
Howe. At an authors' reading toward the 
end of the last century he was attacked, before 
the performance began, by stage fright, if we 
are to believe his words, and was only rescued 
from utter collapse by the touch of a woman 's 
soft hand on his own and the sound of a 
woman's voice, with a slight catch and tremor 
in it, saying: "Oh, Mr. Bangs, do you know 
I am so nervous about going out before all 
those people to-night that I really believe I 
shall have to borrow some of your manly 
courage and strength to carry me through!" 
The speaker was Mrs. Howe, "her lovely eyes 
full of sympathy, touched with a joyous reas- 
suring twinkle." Enjoyably human and real 
are the many varied characters, chance ac- 
quaintances for the most part, that give life 
and color to Mr. Bangs 's pages, though the 
oddity of the "vagrant poet" in chapter five 
tends to strain credulity. It is a book packed 
with amusing incident and accident (the latter 
not always so amusing to the victim) as well 
as with manifold types of human nature. Mr. 
John R. Neill catches the spirit of it all in 
his numerous drawings. 



Professor Charles Sanford 
Terry's "Short History of 
Europe" (Button) is the last of 
a series of three volumes in which the author 
attempts to cover the history of Europe since

the "fall of Rome" in 476. The present 
volume begins with the dissolution of the 
Holy Roman Empire and closes with the 
outbreak of the great European War or, 
as he calls it, the Zweikaiserkrieg of 1914. 
Professor Terry's treatment of his theme 
differs from that of conventional histories in 
that he deals almost exclusively with large 
movements of international importance and 
ignores everything that is isolated and unre- 
lated to the larger politics. The work conse- 
quently includes no discussion of domestic 
problems and legislation in the various states ; 
and even Socialism, which has at least been 
believed to be an international movement, is 
discussed only in connection with the republi- 
can experiment of France in 1848. On the 
other hand, the reconstruction of Switzerland 
is treated at considerable length, and a chap- 
ter is given to Latin America and its revolt 
from Spain. The author writes clearly and 
energetically, and has succeeded well in his 
effort to give a concise account of the great 
changes which Europe has undergone during 
the past hundred years. For the present, 
however, the interest of the work will lie 
chiefly in the last fifteen pages, in which 
Professor Terry traces the diplomatic moves 
that led up to the outbreak of the great war. 
As the author holds a professorship in the 
University of Aberdeen, the work is naturally 
written from the British viewpoint. But 
except for a few pages of the Introduction and 
the closing chapter, Professor Terry's history 
will be found profitable and enjoyable read- 
ing by all, even by those whose sympathies at 
present are with the central powers. 



The methods From the corners of the artistic 
and aims of universe, Professor Lane Cooper 
"* has collected in "Methods and 
Aims in the Study of Literature" (Ginn) an 
admirable series of extracts designed primar- 
ily for advanced college classes. The first 
section of the book, "On Method in General," 
draws light from Leonardo da Vinci, Milton. 
Kenyon Cox, Agassiz, and others as diverse, 
in an endeavor to discover the bond between 
science and art. All of this is highly stimulat- 
ing to careful thought, though the underlying 
unity of method in science and art is perhaps 
not so fruitful a conception as the funda- 
mental distinctions between the two. The 
subsequent divisions deal with the practice of 
great writers in composing (with emphasis on 
revision), the reading of great poets, and, as 
a concluding illustration of the principles 
previously stressed, "Method in the Poetry of 
Love." Although Professor Cooper's book is 
concerned with method rather than with 



matter, and would therefore need to be sup- 
plemented, for practical use, with a book or 
with lectures on literature as an interpretation 
of life, it does excellently what imperatively 
needs to be done, it makes perfectly clear 
the rigorous discipline without which the 
writer is foredoomed to oblivion. This is made 
impressive physiologically, so to speak, 
through the extracts from Dorothy Words- 
worth's "Journals," in which William is 
recorded as constantly tiring himself with 
labor on "The Pedlar," and sleeping very ill, 
and even keeping the dinner waiting till four 
o'clock. The editor has happily included his 
own "Glance at Wordsworth's Reading," re- 
printed from "Modern Language Notes."

^ r ' Edward Carpenter has said 
of Walt Whitman's influence, "I 
find it difficult to imagine what 
my life would have been without it," and he 
has also, on the same page of his own chief 
work, emphasized the fact of his own distinc- 
tive qualities of mind and heart and disposi- 
tion, thus: "Anyhow, our temperaments, 
standpoints, antecedents, etc., are so entirely 
diverse and opposite that, except for a few 
points, I can hardly imagine that there is 
much real resemblance to be traced." Exactly 
what is the nature of the younger man's in- 
debtedness to the older is expressed by Mr. 
Edward Lewis in his book, "Edward Carpen- 
ter: An Exposition and an Appreciation" 
(Macmillan), in "the figure of speech that 
Whitman played the part of a midwife in the 
deliverance of Carpenter's spiritual child." 
Mr. Lewis's chapters naturally concern them- 
selves to a great extent with "Toward Democ- 
racy," its writer's most elaborate expression 
of his creed, and in form and substance an 
inevitable reminder of "Leaves of Grass." 
But if its writer harked back to Whitman in 
this work, he anticipated another master, 
Professor Bergson, in some thoughts to which 
he gave utterance in a later important book, 
"The Art of Creation." These two works, 
with others of narrower scope, from the same 
pen, are made to illuminate the dozen chapters 
that set forth the doctrine of this remarkable 
teacher, while the opening and closing pages 
are given to more purely personal aspects of 
the man. The book is provided with portrait, 
index, and footnotes. It is a warmly sympa- 
thetic treatment of its theme. 



The recent widespread interest 
in the great writers of modern 
Russia may have operated indi- 
rectly in bringing about now, for the first 
time, the translation into English of the early

historical epic, ' ' The Tale of the Armament 
of Igor" (Oxford University Press). Cer- 
tainly it seems strange to those familiar with 
the degree of ignorance of and indifference 
toward English literature of the Middle Ages 
a degree of ignorance and indifference much 
greater than that shown to Old English to 
find this twelfth century epic of Russia trans- 
lated with the hope of gaining readers. A 
further surprise which will greet the student 
of European literature who has not been able 
to read the Slavonic, is the sophistication and 
genuine poetic merit of this poem, written 
between 1185 and 1187 eighteen years prior 
to our own "Brut" of Layamon. It is de- 
cidedly not inferior to the "Brut" in spirit 
or in style. The unknown author seems to 
have been a companion of Igor Svyatoslavish 
in an unsuccessful foray against the Polovtsy. 
The story, following the chronicle closely, has 
no wide national significance, except as show- 
ing in the character of Igor, in his impulsive 
generosity but his fatal weakness, the desper- 
ate state of central Russia under the wide- 
spread anarchy obtaining at the time. The 
manuscript, dating from the sixteenth cen- 
tury, was discovered in 1795, and published 
in 1800 by Count Musin-Pushkin. The pur- 
pose of the editor and translator, Mr. Leonard 
A. Magnus (who, by the way, is about to pub- 
lish a "Concise Grammar of the Russian Lan- 
guage"), is of course linguistic rather than 
literary. The notes and critical material are 
satisfying and illuminating. The value of the 
book is further enhanced by a map of 
mediseval Russian, complete genealogical 
tables of the period, and especially by a 
scheme of transliteration from the Greek or 
Cyrillic alphabet to the Romanized forms.

pose of Mr. William Ellery Leonard's, in his 
little volume entitled "Socrates, Master of 
Life" (Open Court Publishing Co.), to "re- 
interpret, imaginatively yet critically, an 
ancient personality that has too often become 
for the scholar merely one or another technical 
problem, and for the general reader too often 
but a name or an anecdote. " Provided with a 
select bibliography, and giving a balanced 
account of the life and philosophy of Socrates, 
the book is frankly introductory; but, as the 
title indicates, the greatness of Socrates is 
made to consist in his wisdom in the conduct 
of life. "Kant founded the moral life in the 
good will ; Socrates in right thinking. " And 
the author admirably points out the timeli- 
ness of his subject, in that "the romantic 



ethical tendencies of to-day need the propae- 
deutic of Socrates more than of Kant. The 
good will we have always with us, giving often 
enough, with ghastly best wishes, unwittingly 
a serpent for a fish and a stone for bread ; but 
the intelligence to see the practical bearings 
of conduct and to discriminate between higher 
and lower ideals is too often lacking to the 
dwarfing of the individual and to the confu- 
sion of society. The fool in Sill's poem (which 
goes deep) prayed not for the good will, but 
for wisdom ; and therefore the less fool he. "

brother, namely, "The Soliloquy of a Her- 
mit," by Mr. Theodore Francis Powys. All 
three have the courage of unreserved candor 
'SO far as candor can be unreserved. All 
three, but especially John and Theodore, take 
a sort of sardonic delight in heaping scorn 
upon their own weaknesses and deriding their 
own follies. Of course there must be some- 
thing of literary affectation in all this, even 
while the writers profess to give nothing but 
the naked truth. When, for instance, the first- 
named of the three declares himself utterly 
devoid of "sympathetic interest in himself," 
and then devotes chapter after chapter to 
self-dissection and self-portrayal, he fails to 
convince the reader in that one respect. To 
the mind not interested in its own processes 
it never once occurs to proclaim the fact, so 
engrossing is the outer world. But the 
younger of the "two brothers," Mr. Llewellyn 
Powys, is clearly more concerned with the 
objective than with the subjective. His con- 
tribution to the volume is something more 
than spiritual autobiography, admirable 
though that is in the preceding portion, and 
his extracts from "the diary of a private 
tutor" and from "a consumptive's diary," 
with a too brief mention of a visit to America 
(from his native England), are agreeably 
free from the introspection that, in its turn, 
had made the other's pages equally interest- 
ing, in a different way. Whatever the faults 
of the book, it is not commonplace or insig- 
nificant. ( The Manas Press, Rochester, N. Y. ) 



Records of 
travel in 



A series entitled " Early Egyp- 
tian Records of Travel" (Prince- 
Egypt - ton University Press) has been 
planned by Mr. David Paton, to furnish 
" materials for a historical geography of 
Western Asia." The earliest documents, ex-

tending down to the close of the XVII 
Dynasty, have just appeared as Volume I. 
Such well known inscriptions as the auto- 
biography of Uni and the literary tale of 
Sinuhe are included. Though the established 
character of these and the other records is 
evident from the comprehensive bibliography 
cited, the author has gone over them again 
with the latest researches in mind, noting in 
detail even the exact signs used in the Egyp- 
tian texts. In fact, the greater share of his 
space is occupied by introductory description 
and columns of collation and transliteration, 
much of which workshop material could well 
have been left to its sources. The translations 
modestly disclaim " anything in the nature of 
originality or authority." Mr. Paton's depen- 
dence results in minor slips which would 
scarcely be possible to an Egyptologist. The 
Asiatic names which form the goal of the 
present work are extended into a final col- 
umn. But the context has loomed so large in 
the author's thought and treatment that even 
this column of results shows more African 
terms than Asiatic. The book is printed from 
unduly reduced zinc etchings of typewritten 
tables, very neat in appearance but a burden 
to the eyes. Form and material, then, com- 
bine to discourage the reader. The compila- 
tion is chiefly of bibliographical value. 



A hMorv of the In " The Jews of Russia and 
jews in Russia Poland" (Putnam), Professor 
Israel Friedlander, of the Jewish 
Theological Seminary of America, presents a 
concise, eloquent, and depressing statement of 
the history of the Jewish people in the 
Slavonic countries. The style of the book is 
fluent, and is marked with an undercurrent of 
repressed emotion which cannot but color the 
data presented. No attempt is made either to 
analyze documents or to expound situations. 
The book moves as a compendious narrative, 
from which all that might interfere with the 
progress of the story has been eliminated. 
The adventure of the Jews into Poland, the 
history of their relation to the Polish kings, 
to the Shlakhta or nobility, their economic 
rivalry with the burghers, their rise and de- 
cline in power, their gradual isolation from 
contact with the non-Jewish world, their reac- 
tion to the policy of heartless annihilation 
initiated by the Russian government after the 
partition of Poland, are all touched on with 
a firm hand and profound sympathy. The 
Russian government, indeed, is credited in the 
preface with "a consistent attempt to destroy 
Jews and Judaism in that country." The 
case makes itself. On the other hand, the 
chapter on the inner development of Russo- 



Polish Jewry is inadequate. The existence of 
a chartered autonomy, and the consequent 
federal form of inter-communal organization 
are declared, but not sufficiently exhibited, 
nor their effects described. Similarly, the 
record of spiritual changes marking the rise 
of new religious modes, of the Hebrew and 
Yiddish Renaissance, of the neo-nationalist 
movement and other secularist developments, 
serves only to whet the appetite for more. 
It is to be hoped that Professor Friedlander 
will some day give us an adequate book on 
these topics. 

A volume by Mr. Geoffrey 
Rhodes on "Mind Cures" 
(Luce) tempts the reviewer to 
resort to the sort of damning by faint praise 
which is his dangerous privilege. The book 
deserves a better fate, though it is doubtful 
whether it adds very considerably to a knowl- 
edge of the subject or to the convenient aids 
to acquiring such a knowledge. It presents 
a variety of moderate virtues. It reflects a 
modern and a reasonable point of view ; it is 
safe and sane. Its citations of psychology are 
sound, and its applications timely. Indeed, 
the accounts of cases, many of them growing 
out of the practice of the author, constitute 
the most valuable portion of the manual. It 
is not very systematically or convincingly put 
together; it leaves the reader with the im- 
pression that mind cures are real, but scarcely 
develops that impression to an orderly under- 
standing of the basis of mental action in the 
alleviation of physical ills. As a discursive 
introduction to the subject it may be safely 
commended. 

The Bible Well fitted to arouse interest in 

as a work the Bible as a work of literature 

is the little book by Mr. George 
P. Eckman entitled, "The Literary Primacy 
of the Bible. " Its six chapters were originally 
delivered as the second series of Mendenhall 
Lectures at De Pauw University, and are 
introduced with a foreword by President 
Grose. That the lecturer has not in this in- 
stance concerned himself exclusively with 
doctrinal theology in his message to his De 
Pauw audience, may be inferred from the 
headings of his lectures, such as "The Poetry 
and Oratory of the Bible," "The Fiction and 
Humor of the Bible," and "The Bible the 
Most Persistent Force in Literature." In 
asserting of the Bible, as he does at the outset, 
that "the larger number of our colleges and 
universities insist on placing it among the 
indispensable text-books of their curricula," 
the author rather seems to make the wish the 



390

father to the assertion. In how many college 
catalogues is the Bible included in the list of 
prescribed text-books? Both literary and 
Biblical learning and illustrative anecdote, 
with a wealth of apt quotation, are found in 
this readable volume from one whose own 
literary style bears evidence of profitable 
hours spent with the book which Charles 
Dudley Warner once went so far as to call 
"in itself almost a liberal education." (The 
Methodist Book Concern.) 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A revised edition of "The History of American 
Music" (Macmillan) by Mr. Louis C. Elson forms 
the second volume in the series, "The History of 
American Art," prepared under the editorial super- 
vision of Mr. John C. Van Dyke. The merits of 
Mr. Elson's work were pointed out in these columns 
some twelve years ago upon its first appearance, 
when it was warmly commended as a valuable 
guide in its field. 

Dr. Charles Brodie Patterson, in "The Rhythm 
of Life" (Crowell), rightly emphasizes the im- 
portance of music in the educational scheme; the 
Greeks long ago taught the world the indispensa- 
bility of music to culture. But rhythmic effects 
are produced not by sound alone; color also has 
its harmonies. "Color is sound made visible, and 
sound is color made audible." The regenerating, 
re-invigorating, therapeutic action of visible and 
audible harmonies on the human system is en- 
larged upon with enthusiasm by Dr. Patterson. 
The score of chapters treat of music as a com- 
pelling power, the dance, music and color tones, 
color tonics, music and character, cosmic conscious- 
ness, musical therapeutics, and other related 
themes, all presented with the persuasive charm 
that comes from earnestness and conviction on the 
writer's part. 

In his Conway Memorial Lecture on the "The 
Stoic Philosophy" (Putnam), Professor Gilbert 
Murray gives a fresh and enlivening account of 
"a way of looking at the world and the practical 
problems of life which possesses still a permanent 
interest for the human race and a permanent power 
of inspiration." The review, in the course of an 
hour, of a system so multifoldly inspired, with a 
content so various, and with an appeal to men of 
temperament and station so opposed as Marcus 
Aurelius and Epictetus, can hardly do more than 
sketch in its outline. Professor Murray does this 
with a characteristically firm hand. He shows how 
Stoicism is a theory of life, a religion, rather than 
a system of dialectic, and how consequently logic- 
ally contradictory but practically and emotionally 
satisfactory conclusions are drawn from its prem- 
ises at the same time. 

The Virginia State Library has recently pub- 
lished part one of "A Bibliography of Virginia," 
compiled by Mr. Earl G. Swem, who has already 



to his credit several excellent publications of 
smaller character. This bibliography contains 7,000 
titles of books now in the Virginia State Library 
which relate to Virginia or were written by Vir- 
ginians or were printed in Virginia. Official pub- 
lications are not included, but it is planned to 
bring out a list of these as part two of the bibliog- 
raphy. Mr. Swem estimated that the collections 
in the State Library lack 10,000 to 15,000 titles of 
being complete; and he announces that as the 
missing titles are acquired supplementary lists 
will be issued. This publication is a first-class 
contribution to American bibliography. It is fit- 
ting that the "Mother of Presidents" should be 
among the foremost of the states in preserving 
the history of her people. One hopes that the 
Virginia State Library, on account of the excellent 
character of its work, will receive the financial and 
other support which it deserves. 

Under the somewhat pretentious title, "The Uni- 
versal Plot Catalog," a little manual by Mr. Henry 
Albert Phillips brings together in classified form a 
good number of items suitable for use as plot 
material, and introduces this material with instruc- 
tive remarks on the best way to handle it in plot- 
construction. Not to seven or eleven or any other 
definite number does he reduce all the variations of 
the major plots that have in countless shapes enter- 
tained the lovers of romance from the earliest 
times; on the contrary, he asserts that "it would 
take many large tomes" to hold merely a list of all 
the plots that have ever been used, while the number 
of "good, complete plots that are possible through 
combinations of plot material" he believes to be 
incalculable. A careful index with cross references 
is appended to the table of plot material, and an 
illustrative example of the skilful use of such 
material is given. If the story-teller, unlike the 
poet, is made and not born, here is the book that 
will help to the making of him. ( Stanhope-Dodge 
Publishing Co., Larchmont, N. Y.) 

Since the publication, three hundred and fifty 
years ago, of Aurifaber's compilation of Luther's 
table-talk, many additional records have come to 
light, and much of this new material has been 
put into printed form in comparatively recent 
years. Luther had many reporters, and their notes 
are all of interest. Thus, besides Aurifaber, there 
were Lauterbaeh, Cordatus, Schlaginhaufen, 
Mathesius, Rabe, Heydenreich, Weller, Besold, and 
Plato (name of good omen in this connection), 
who all, as students at the Black Cloister, sat at 
the master's board at one time or another, and 
zealously recorded his utterances. A selection 
from this more lately published material has been 
made and translated, with notes and index, by that 
well-equipped Luther scholar, Preserved Smith, 
Ph.D., with the collaboration of Herbert Percival 
Gallinger, Ph.D. "Conversations with Luther" is 
the book's title, and within modest compass will 
be found the cream of the great reformer's famil- 
iar talk not already long familiar to the world in 
the standard work mentioned above. Portraits 
and other illustrations are judiciously supplied.

XOTES. 

"The Golden Apple" is the title of a new play 
by Lady Gregory, which is soon to be published. 

A book of verse by Miss Mary Aldis, entitled 
"Flashlights," is announced by Messrs. Duffield. 

"The Buff on," a novel of contemporary life by 
Mr. Louis W. Wilkinson, is announced for early 
publication by Mr. Alfred A. Knopf. 

"Scenes from the Life of Benjamin Franklin" 
by Messrs. Charles E. Mills and Louis A. Holman 
will be issued this month by Messrs. Small, May- 
nard & Co. 

Mr. Hilaire Belloc will soon follow up his "High 
Lights of the French Revolution" (published last 
autumn) with a volume entitled "The Last Days 
of the French Monarchy." 

Mrs. Havelock Ellis, who dealt at some length 
with James Hinton in her book entitled "Three 
Modern Seers," has recently completed a more 
elaborate study of Hinton, which will appear dur- 
ing the spring. 

The first number of a new periodical devoted to 
literature and art, to be called "The Quarterly 
Notebook," will be published in the near future 
by Mr. H. A. Fowler of Kansas City, Mo., formerly 
publisher of "The Miscellany." 

Early additions to the "Writers of the Day" 
series will include volumes on Henry James, Mrs. 
Humphry Ward, and Mrs. Edith Wharton, the 
writers of these studies being Miss Rebecca West, 
Mr. Stephen Gwynn, and Mr. Robert Lynd, 
respectively. 

In his forthcoming volume on "Society and 
Prisons," Mr. Thomas Mott Osborne will present 
a constructive programme for dealing with the 
prison problem based on his own experience and 
observations. The Yale University Press will pub- 
lish the book. 

"Victory in Defeat" is the title of a war book 
by Mr. Stanley Washburn to be published imme- 
diately by Messrs. Doubleday. It deals entirely 
with the Russian phase of the war, giving an 
analytical account of the great Russian retreat 
from Galicia and Poland. 

A new volume from the pen of Mr. Fielding 
Hall, to be entitled "For England," will appear 
shortly. Like Mr. Fielding Hall's last book, "The 
Field of Honour," this new volume will consist 
of stories and poems not of actual warfare itself, 
but rather of the indirect effects of war upon the 
homes of England. 

A volume of "Selected Poems" by Gustaf 
Froding, translated from the Swedish and pro- 
vided with an Introduction by Mr. Charles Whar- 
ton Stork, will be issued by the Macmillan Co. 
This is the first English translation of Froding, 
who, in the opinion of Professor Stork, is "the 
most striking and probably the greatest figure in 
the long array of distinguished Swedish poets." 

Among other forthcoming publications of 
Messrs. Longmans are the following: "The Ivory 
Child," by Sir Rider Haggard; "My Lady of the 
Moor," by Mr. John Oxenham; "Driftwood 
Spars," by Mr. Percival Christopher Wren; "Ver- 
dun to the Vosges," by Mr. Gerald Campbell; 



and the third volume of "Ireland under the Stuarts 
and during the Interregnum," by Dr. Richard 
BagwelL 

Mr. A. E. Gallatin has written a new volume of 
essays in art criticism which the John Lane Co. will 
publish in May under the title "Certain Contem- 
poraries." The volume will contain illustrated 
essays on the work of William Glackens, Ernest 
Lawson, John Sloan, Walter Gay, and Boardman 
Robinson, besides notes on some masters of water- 
color, Sargent, Homer, Hassam, Whistler, and 
others. 

This year's summer meetings of the National 
Education Association and the American Library 
Association will occur in successive weeks and in 
the same neighborhood. The thirty-eighth annual 
conference of the library association will be held 
from June 26 to July 1, at Asbury Park, N. J., 
followed in the next week by the fifty-fourth meet- 
ing of the teachers, in New York, Library and 
educational workers will thus have another oppor- 
tunity for discussion of common problems. Miss 
Mary W. Plummer, of the Library School of New 
York Public Library, is president of the A. L. A., 
and Mr. George B. Utley, A. L. A. Executive 
Office, 78 East Washington Street, Chicago, is 
secretary. 

Chronologically arranged, a 76-page catalogue of 
"Books and Pamphlets Published in Canada" from 
1767 to 1837, copies of which are in the Toronto 
Public Library, is issued by that institution under 
the editorial supervision of Miss Frances Staton, 
head of the Reference Department. It is a valu- 
able contribution to Canadian bibliography, and 
will be followed by others from the same source, 
as a prefatory note announces. If one were to 
pass any general criticism on this carefully- 
prepared list, it would relate to its obviously inex- 
haustive nature, from the fact that it confines itself 
to works owned by the Toronto library. A nearer 
approach to completeness may be attained in sub- 
sequent editions. 

Valuable work in its field is being accomplished 
by "The Photo-Miniature," a journal devoted to 
general photographic information, edited by Mr. 
John A. Tennant and published by Messrs. 
Tennant & Ward of New York City. Unlike most 
periodicals, each issue is a complete monograph 
in itself, written by a specialist who covers his 
subject in from ten to fifteen thousand words. 
For the current year the January and February 
issues are at hand, dealing respectively with 
"Failures and Why: In Negative Making" and 
"Success with the Pocket Camera." Conciseness 
of treatment, convenience in size, numerous illus- 
trations, and a price that is only nominal, are 
attractive features of these little monographs, 
which should be widely popular among photog- 
raphers, amateur or professional. 

"The Poetry Review of America," a monthly 
periodical devoted to the interests of American 
poetry in all its phases, will begin publication early 
in May, under the editorship of Mr. William 
Stanley Braithwaite and Mr. Joseph Lebowich. 
The spirit of the publication, according to its 
prospectus, "will be one of advancement and

cooperation; the desire to serve the art of poetry 
and to consolidate public interest in its growth 
and popularity to quicken and enlarge the poetic 
pulse of the country. In this spirit, we propose to 
our contemporaries in the field a union of effort 
and mutual encouragement; to the poets of 
America an open forum and a clearing-house for 
ways and means to serve the art we all love; to 
the poetry-reading public of our country we pledge 
a never-ceasing striving for the best in American 
poetry, and a constant effort to bring out the 
strength and joy to be derived therefrom." 

The biennial Justin Winsor prize offered by the 
American Historical Association for the best 
unpublished monograph in American history will 
be awarded this year. The monograph must be 
based upon independent and original investigation 
in American history, by which is meant the history 
of any of the British colonies in America to 1783, 
of other territories, continental or insular, which 
have since been acquired by the United States, of 
the United States, and of independent Latin 
America. It may deal with any aspect of that 
history social, political, constitutional, religious, 
economic, ethnological, military, or biographical, 
though in the last three instances a treatment 
exclusively ethnological, military, or biographical 
would be unfavorably received. The monograph 
must be submitted on or before July 1. Full 
details as to the competition may be obtained from 
the chairman of the Justin Winsor Prize Com- 
mittee, Professor Carl Russell Fish of the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin.

THE 

FOOD-TONIC 

APPROVED BY SCIENCE , 



The Value of Sanatogen to 
the Man who Works His Brain 

"Without albumen, no life; without phosphorus, no 
thought" so runs a famous saying. 

True, the healthy body gets enough albumen and phos- 
phorus from the daily food, but an overtaxed brain and 
nervous system will run short of these vital substances 
because the demand outruns the normal supply. Then we 
have fatigue, depression and worse, if nothing be done. 

It is then that Sanatogen is of splendid aid. Combining purest al- 
bumen and organic phosphorus in chemical union, Sanatogen takes to 
the fundamental sources of nervous and mental efficiency just the ele- 
ments needed. It supplies these elements quickly and without strain, 
upon digestion, giving the depleted cells real nutriment, real susten- 
ance and no false stimulation. 

The result of this is well epitomized by Sir Gilbert Parker when he 
writes, "Sanatogen to my mind is a true food-tonic, giving fresh vigor 
to the overworked body and mind." And by Arnold Bennett, who 
tersely reports, "The effect of Sanatogen upon the nervous system is 
simply wonderful." 

It is good to remember that the medical profession has set the seal of 
approval upon the value of Sanatogen no less than 21, 000 doctors have 
written letters endorsing its value. 

Should not the knowledge of these facts create the conviction that 
Sanatogen tuill also help you f

The Problems of Your City 

Principles and Methods 
of Municipal 
Administration 

By WILLIAM BENNETT MUNRO 

Professor of Municipal Government in Harvard 
University 



Professor Munro's new book deals with 
matters in which every one is or should be 
vitally interested. In clear and non-technical 
language it discusses such important phases of 
municipal work as city-planning, street admin- 
istration, water supply, sanitation, police, fire 
protection, public lighting, school management 
and municipal finance. These subjects are 
treated in such a way that the book cannot fail 
to arouse and stimulate a desire for better 
government and a knowledge of how to 
obtain it.

American Municipal 
Progress 

New edition, thoroughly revised and 
enlarged, with many illustration* 

By CHARLES ZUEBLIN 

"pROBABLY no one book has done more 
* to turn the thought of Americans to the 
problems of their 20th century cities than 
American Municipal Progress, which first 
appeared about a decade ago. And it is 
doubtful if there has been during this 
decade a more stimulating single influence 
in the direction of civic awakening than the 
author of this work, Prof. Charles Zueblin, 
who in a new, enlarged and thoroughly 
revised edition of American Municipal Prog- 
ress, has given every citizen a first rate 
manual of genuinely good citizenship."

Rome; Venice: in the Aesthetic Eighties 
Paris, London; in the Fighting Nineties 

By ELIZABETH ROBINS PENXELL 

Sixteen illustrations from photographs and 

etchings. $3.00 net. Octavo. Postage extra. 

The pleasure of association with 
equally famous literary and artistic 
friends has been the good fortune 
of the Pennells. In this absorbing 
book there is the inside history of 
an enthralling period ; and an ac- 
quaintanceship with those who made 
it what it was: Beardsley, Henley, 
Harland, editor of "The Yellow 
Book," Whistler, etc. The illustra- 
tions, photographs, and etchings by 
Joseph Pennell are unusual. 

PETROGRAD PAST AND 
PRESENT 

By WILLIAM BARNES STEVENI 

Thirty photographic illustrations. 319 pages. 

Octavo. $3.00 net. Postage extra. 

In a lively style, the author pre- 
sents the life of the great city since 
the day of Peter the Great, its 
founder. The Moujiks, bureaucrats, 
and aristocrats are observed and 
made to live in the Occidental mind 
by the author watching and study- 
ing in theatres, restaurants, gardens, 
army quarters, etc. 

A THOUSAND YEARS OF 
RUSSIAN HISTORY 

By SONIA E. HOWE 

Thirteen plates. Twenty-eight illustrations. 

432 pages. 8 maps. Octavo. $2.50 net. 

Postage extra. 

This is just what is desired : A 
readable history of Russia since the 
foundation of the Empire in 1862. 
The author is a Russian by birth and 
an Englishwoman by marriage. By 
revealing the past this book gives 
the reader the meaning of the litera- 
ture, music, dancing, and politics of 
the present. 

CLOTHING FOR WOMEN 

By LAURA I. BALDT, B. S., 

Teachers College, N. Y. C. 

Being the First Volume in 

LIPPINCOTT'S HOME MANUALS. 

Edited by BENJAMIN R. ANDREWS, Ph.D., 

Teachers College, N. Y. C. 

7 colored plates, 262 illustrations in the text. 

$1.75 net. 

This work deals exhaustively with 
the selection, design, and construc- 
tion of women's clothing. The diffi- 
cult problems of harmony of color 
and design have been fully treated. 
It is a book for the College short 
course, the high school, and the home 
library. The numerous illustrations 
are particularly good and of great 
practical value. 



MRS. MINNIE MADDERN FISKE, America's Great- 
est Actress, says : 

"From beginning to end I found BEHOLD THE 
WOMAN gripping and thrillingly interesting it is pic- 
turesque, vivid and dramatic throughout." 

GEN. THEODORE A. BINGHAM, of the United 
States Army and Former Police Commissioner of the 
City of New York, writes : 

"A powerful and and stirring tale, which I read with 
great interest, and which I hope will have the success it 
deserves." 

BEHOLD THE WOMAN! 

By T. EVERETT HARRE 
$1.35 net. Postage extra. 

* 'May justly be said to surpass in vividness, realty and human 
appeal any novel of recent years. Its true predecessors are 'Quo 
Vadis,' 'Bin Hur,' 'Salammbo,' 'Hypatia.' It is a novel of 
powerful religious significance, and bears a message for every man 
and woman. " 

In the character of Mary, the powerful Alexandrian 
courtesan whose beauty was "the glory of Egypt," the 
author presents the struggle of womanhood in its integrity 
and nobility with man's age-long exploitation, and inter- 
prets that eternal struggle which is today finding one of 
its expressions in the feminist movement. 

A novel teeming with the turbulent excitement, intrigue 
and romance of the most splendid and licentious age of 
the world. The Time is the final conflict between Pagan- 
ism and Christianity. 



THEODORE ROOSEVELT SAYS: 

"... A really capital handbook . . . 
which should be read by every citizen 
who wishes to know how the men of 
this country should make themselves 
soldiers in time of need and how the 
soldiers of this country should act in 
time of need."

in detail the military service in all branches of the army.

THE BROOD OF LAUGHTER. 



The Tragic Muse hides behind her Gorgon 
head, but Miss Comedy has a hundred masks. 
"Laughter holding both its sides," the mor- 
dant sneer, travesty, wit that is like a web of 
lightnings, earth-upsetting humor, certainly 
there is "God's plenty" in the varieties of the 
risible. 

Slang (cant, jargon, argot) is the attempt 
which the multitude makes to achieve style, 
its effort to say things differently. Three- 
fourths, probably, of slang has a humorous 
tinge, for in its nature it is a mockery of the 
dignified in thought or speech. Unquestion- 
ably it is often excellent fooling. The bright 
wits of the otherwise inarticulate masses 
strike out unexpected analogies of thought, 
remarkable felicities of image and phrase. 
And literature has profitted by them accord- 
ingly. There is much slang in Shakespeare; 
a great part of Rabelais is written in argot. 
Without slang what would we do for humor 
in America! The trouble with the literary 
use of slang is twofold. In the first place, it 
is a language within the language. It has to 
be translated when new, and it quickly fades. 
The writer who uses much of it soon requires 
an apparatus of footnotes. In the second 
place, while the unknown originator of an apt 
slang word or phrase is a genius, the tenth 
or ten-thousandth transmitter of it is merely 
a plagiarist He works with about the cheap- 
est material that a writer can employ. The 
first time one sees in print such synonyms for 
man as "piker," "gink," "long drink of 
water," or verbal re-incarnations of girl into 
"chicken," "broiler," "flapper," "squab," 
"doll," "skirt," or "queen," they may seem 
excruciatingly funny; but after one has read 
ten thousand tales or sketches whose humor 
depends mainly on these expressions, the 
business becomes a trifle tiresome. Yet slang 
is a vitalizing influence. It is an earth ele- 
ment which both language and literature need 
for growth. 

The reformed school of spelling seems to 
have put the professional purveyors of that 
commodity out of the market. Its literate 
ventures in illiteracy tickle us more than the

old masters in the art can do. Our Ameri- 
can adepts who had such a great audience in 
their day are no longer read. Petroleum V. 
Nasby, Philander K. Doesticks, even the great 
Artemus Ward, are unknown to the rising 
generation. Mr. Howells edited Artemus 
Ward 's work some years ago ; yet even he, in 
spite of his love for the native and the new, 
was forced to confess a certain lack of interest 
in it. Dialect, which has always had a hold 
on literature (there are three varieties of 
dialect in "The Merry Wives of Windsor") 
still lives. A few years ago it swept over 
literature like fire over a prairie. Nothing 
could succeed which did not have the local 
color of dialect or patois. In a great measure, 
writers seem to be coming back to plain 
English. Of course dialect sometimes has as 
much tradition and authority as academic 
language. Again, it seems to spring up like 
a gourd in the night. The transformation 
of vowels by which the lower-class English 
turn "lady" into "lidy" and "game" into 
"gime" seems very recent in origin. It would 
be a curious subject for inquiry as to whether 
the cockney use or non-use of the letter h 
goes a long way back. I cannot recall that 
the older English comic writers made any 
fun of this oddity of pronunciation. Charles 
Lamb's farce, "Mr. H.," which is founded on 
the fact of a man being named "Hogsflesh," 
would have lost its point if the aspirate had 
not been generally sounded. 

In proverbs we have the multitude in a 
sentence-mongering mood. These are often 
grim and grave and wise enough; but the 
stoical humor of endurance, the disillusion- 
ment of experience, come out most in them. 
Unless an author makes his own proverbs, 
the use of them lays him open to a charge of 
unoriginality, though when Sancho Panza 
comes along with the wisdom of all the Span- 
ish ages dropping from his tongue, the effect 
is funny enough. 

Parables and fables are proverbs put into 
narrative. They, too, are the experience of 
the race eked out by the artist's skill, and 
they are overwhelmingly humorous or satir- 
ical. Eenan claimed that one of Christ's most 
shining qualities was his wit; and certainly 
the parables of the New Testament are full 
of satire and irony. 

Puns seem to have had their day. They do 
not flourish in contemporary literature, or 
even in our common parlance. Compared 



with the larger forms of humor, they are 
about what the fire-fly 's flash is to daylight or 
lightning. But in the hands of masters like 
Charles Lamb and Thomas Hood, they are 
irresistible. The present writer, alas, has been 
almost as incapable of making a pun as solving 
a riddle. But I remember one. A scientific 
friend was explaining the mysteries of animal 
magnetism. "What," he asked, "happens 
when you touch a man?" "Why," I said, 
"sometimes you get turned down." Perhaps 
that was too obvious. I recall one of my 
father's, which strikes me as pathetically 
good. He was in his last illness, and was 
wasted to a skeleton. A friend, a big, bounc- 
ing chap, had called on us, and was striding 
up and down the room boasting that he 
weighed 185 pounds. "Well," piped my 
father, "you may have the advantage of me 
in avoirdupois, but I can beat you all hollow 
in apothecary's weight." 

In the larger, organized forms of humorous 
literature, fun comes first. It is animal spirits 
put into words or action. It is the clash of 
oddities, the farcical situations which life 
really affords or which by a good deal of 
license can be read into life. We are so con- 
stituted that we find something ridiculous in 
a man slipping on the ice, or a shabby coat, or 
a pair of soleless shoes. The slap-stick of 
the pantomimist or the brick of the cartoonist 
answers our primal need for laughter. As 
the Roman slaves had their Saturnalia, so we 
slaves of work or custom must have our car- 
nival moments, when we dance or riot for 
relief. There is plenty of this exuberance 
in literature. Perhaps it shows more abun- 
dantly in the novels of Lever than anywhere 
else. There is hardly anything in these novels 
but high spirits, practical jokes, orgies of 
misrule, except duels, which are thrown in 
by way of balance. 

Travesty, or burlesque, is a higher form of 
humor. It works by pulling down. It tum- 
bles dignity into the dirt. It brings Jove 
upon the stage with an old umbrella and 
goloshes, and makes Venus scold Mars over 
the wash-tub. Mingled with divine poetry 
and illimitable imagination, as in Aristo- 
phanes, it yields one of the highest types of 
comedy. Parody is a variant of this form. 
Some works, "Don Quixote" and "Joseph 
Andrews" for example, began as parodies but 
developed into great original creations.

What for lack of a better term we must call 
extravaganza or fantasia is a great element in 
American humor. It asserts absurdities as 
truths. It puts forth impossibilities with the 
sober certitude of common sense. The tales of 
Frank Stockton are signal examples of this 
kind of work. But its classic is certainly 
"Alice in "Wonderland." That tale is the con- 
centrated essence of everything that could not 
happen related with historic gravity. 

Wit is a difficult thing to define. In the 
eighteenth century the word was used to cover 
all forms of mental activity. Poets, novelists, 
essayists, men about town, were all denomi- 
nated wits. Richard Bentley was a wit, and I 
am not sure that Sir Isaac Newton was not 
classified with the great wits of the age. We 
use the word in a more restricted sense now; 
yet we hardly know what that sense is. We 
seem to mean by it a brilliant, concentrated, 
revelational flash of the mind expressed in 
language. Some pieces of literature, like 
Congreve's "Way of the World" and Sheri- 
dan's "School for Scandal," are all compact 
of wit. Some miscellaneous writers, like 
Hazlitt, Sydney Smith, Dr. Holmes, and 
Lowell, are more wits than anything else. But 
wit is the kindling, originating, inventing, 
surprise element of the mind, and it permeates 
pretty nearly everything that the mind does, 
so that the eighteenth century people were 
not altogether wrong in their estimate of it. 

It is hard, also, to pick out from the litera- 
ture of laughter the special quality which we 
call humor. As compared with wit, it is 
broader and more continuous. It is less ex- 
clusively mental, more the product of the 
whole man. It has relations with the tragic 
and pathetic which wit has not. If its pro- 
fundities sometimes wound or appal, its 
pities heal and refresh. It probably comes 
nearer giving the actual truth about human 
character in its relations to the world and 
Fate than any other form of literature what- 
ever. It relentlessly exposes the vices, follies, 
hypocrisies, and littlenesses of mankind, until 
we ought to be disgusted with life itself. But 
we are not ; for humor puts such vitality into 
the very rags and leavings of mankind that 
they are really more to us than angels. We 
take Burns 's drink-sodden beggars to our 
bosoms; we applaud Mr. Pecksniff leaning 
over the banisters at Todger's and adjuring 
his hearers "to be moral" ; we go into ecstacies 
when Sairey Gamp and Betsey Prig quarrel 



over the mythical Mrs. Harris. Although 
humor has a preference for publicans and 
sinners, it can deal equally well with the 
good and noble, as witness Don Quixote, 
My Uncle Toby, and Scott's "Antiquary." 
Dickens is the most prolific of humorists, and 
one hesitates in placing him with the greatest 
merely because he lacks somewhat of the 

! profundity of thought which we find in Aris- 
tophanes, Cervantes, Shakespeare, and Mo- 
liere. His earthquakes only make the edifices 

I of man totter and slide about ludicrously; 
theirs shake the mightiest structures down, 
and open abysses in the earth which seem to 
pierce to the dark foundations of our state. 

Satire is the scourge, the cat-o '-nine-tails, 
of literature. It proceeds by way of indigna- 
tion. It holds the office of public executioner. 
Yet the best satire gives us enough of con- 
trast to make its pictures of humanity credi- 
ble. Dryden, in his characters of Buckingham 
and Shaftesbury, allows his victims a dozen 
lofty or amiable qualities. Pope's Addison 

is the picture of a good man spoiled by 
jealousy. The satires of Horace are tolerably 

\ good natured. When a satirist pursues either 
a living person or a literary creation with 
unrelenting fury we feel sure he is not telling 
the whole truth. Buskin's harsh comment on 
Thackeray was that "the blow-fly had got at 
the meat and spoiled our dinner." Formal 
satire seems to have gone out of fashion, but 
the satirical vein is apparent in most of the 
comedies and half of the novels of the world. 
Irony might be defined as the appearance 
of things propitious, the reality of things 
malign. This is at least a description of the 
irony which has been attributed to the Greek 
tragedians, and which is certainly apparent 
in Shakespeare. The sky is blue, and a thun- 
derbolt falls from it. The grass is green and 
pleasant, and the earth yawns at our feet. 
Verbal irony is best exemplified in the dia- 
logue of Socrates, or those simple statements 
which indict of Thucydides or Tacitus. 
Socrates probably had to drink hemlock, not 
because of irreverence to the gods, but because 
he tangled up the wits of the sophists and 
tripped up the intellectual heels of the Athe- 
nian elders by his seemingly innocent 
questions. The greatest, perhaps the only 
great, English master of verbal irony, Junius, 
had to hide under the mask of that name, 
and is yet undiscovered, though I believe 
he was no less a personage than Chatham.

Playfulness is the last form of humor on 
our list, and it is the most delightful. It may 
not assay high in wit or humor or wisdom. 
It .does not excite laughter, perhaps not even 
smiles. But it kindles a glow within us. It 
is simply charm incarnate, and charm can 
beat even beauty or grandeur from the field. 
It bears the stamp of high breeding; and, 
whether "gallant and gay in Clivedon's proud 
alcove" or rustic in Arden's forest, it attracts, 
wins, conquers. Orlando comes into the 
banished Duke's presence, sword in hand. 
"I thought that all things had been savage 
here," he says. He is received with courtesy 
and consideration; the playful talk goes on, 
and he is soothed and comforted. With all 
their splendor of poetry and dazzle of wit 
and depth of humor, playfulness is really the 
predominant note in Shakespeare's comedies. 
Goldsmith is another author in whom this 
quality is perpetually present. He was play- 
ful at The Club, though sadly misunderstood 
by Ursus Major and his satellites. He was 
playful in his poems, his plays, his novel, and 
his essays. "The Haunch of Venison" and 
"Retaliation" are the most perfect playful 
poems in English literature. Dr. Johnson 
was somewhat elephantine in his gambols, but 
his letters are playful and so is much of his 
talk. Playfulness puts on no airs; it simply 
wants to utter the throbbings of its heart. 
The great letter writers, therefore, Madame 
de Sevigne at the head, with Gray, Cowper, 
Keats, FitzGerald, and Lowell following,: are 
adepts in this natural art. Most of them did 
greater things than to write letters, but in 
their correspondence they forgot their great- 
ness and only wanted to be happy. There is 
a good deal of playfulness in Jane Austen, 
but more acidity. She lets us see that she 
knows her characters are fools". Shakespeare 
and Scott and Dickens probably knew", too, 
but they did not care. They liked them better 
that way. Irving is the most playful writer 
we have had in America. 

Taken as a whole, humorous literature is the 
wrong side of the tapestry. It shows the 
foundation work, the ends and shreds and 
seams and blurs of what on the other side is 
a picture of life, painted in smooth and vivid 
colors by poetry, tragedy, and romance. 
Which is the truest, the grotesque sketch, 
or the beautiful, harmonious, awe-inspiring 
vision?

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN LONDON. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
When this reaches you we shall be in the 
thick of the Shakespeare Tercentenary Cele- 
brations. I don't know whether the word 
"thick" is justified. It might perhaps be 
more applicable in Germany, where "Unser 
Shaxpur" (whose shade is invoked against 
his degenerate countrymen) is to be honored 
with numerous orations and special perform- 
ances. Here the plans are very modest. Mr. 
Benson's Company will perform as usual, and 
special Shakespearean exhibitions are to be 
held at Stratford and Oxford, where the 
Bodleian 's unique collection of Shakespeare 
folios and quartos is to be on show. The 
London Guildhall is also exhibiting its folios 
and its specimen of that anguished arabesque 
which goes by the name of Shakespeare's sig- 
nature. As the Bard's death-day and reputed 
birth-day is also St. George's Day we may 
expect a large crop of newspaper articles on 
Shakespeare as a patriot. And it is too much 
to hope that the concocters of these articles 
will avoid the usual error of asserting that 
Henry V was Shakespeare's ideal English- 
man, his pattern king and his chevalier sans 
reproche. Most aspects of Shakespeare may 
be argued about ad nauseam, the most 
interminable discussion always leaving the 
disputants "of the same opinion still." 
Shakespeare has been compared to a dark por- 
trait hung under glass : everybody who exam- 
ines it sees not the portrait but his own face 
reflected. But if there is one thing that ought 
to be clear to any unprejudiced reader it 
surely is that in writing "Henry V" Shakes- 
peare was inter alia exposing the stupidity 
of aggressive Imperialism and the detrimen- 
tal effects which the militarist creed may have 
even upon a character in many respects noble 
and generous. Read Henry's speech when he 
threatens to deliver up Harfleur to his fero- 
cious army if it does not surrender, and ask 
whether this is the conduct Shakespeare rec- 
ommends to his country's sovereigns. 

Tercentenary books are few. A large com- 
pilation by various hands entitled "Shakes- 
peare's England" is announced; and Mrs. 
Stopes, one of the most painstaking of living 
Shakespearean students, has published a num- 
ber of chips from her workshop under the 
name of "Shakespeare's Industry," which a 
critic has unkindly remarked should rather 
have been called "Mrs. Stopes 's Industry." 
Had we not been engaged in war there would 
presumably have been an appeal for some 
hundreds of thousands of pounds to complete 
the Shakespeare National Memorial Theatre.

That is too large an order for times like these ; 
though a week's receipts from the nation's 
cinemas would suffice to run up the most 
sumptuous theatrical structure in the world. 
A modester scheme has been launched by a 
number of eminent persons who suggest that 
ten thousand pounds should be raised to pro- 
vide a permanent endowment fund for Mr. 
A. H. Bullen's Shakespeare Head Press at 
Stratford. Mr. Bullen's is not the only Press 
at Stratford; it was at Stratford that Mr. 
William Jaggard issued his great "Shakes- 
peare Bibliography." But he is a man who 
has spent his life in the service of literary 
scholarship; and since he established his 
Stratford Press he has published not only a 
magnificent edition of the Works but also sev- 
eral volumes of research which will be of 
immense value to students, but which can 
scarcely have been commercial speculations 
of the first water. All Mr. Bullen's produc- 
tions are beautifully printed and bound ; and 
it would be a great thing if his undertaking 
were established on a permanent basis. What 
form of commemoration Shakespeare himself 
would have preferred one cannot dare to 
guess. We cannot even be certain that the 
matter would much interest him. It is true 
that he said that his powerful rhyme would 
not be outlasted by marble or the gilded mon- 
uments of princes ; but it is also true that, as 
far as we can discover, he took not the slight- 
est pains to perpetuate his plays in an accu- 
rate, or indeed in any, form. But it may be 
presumed, as a general rule, that the most 
civil thing we can do to any author is to read 
him. To how great an extent we actually do 
read Shakespeare it is not easy to estimate. 
Was it not in THE DIAL that I saw the other 
day a complaint that, though works dealing 
with Crabbe can be found in every library, 
Crabbe's own compositions are in most places 
unknown? Shakespeare is not in that situa- 
tion : there is scarcely a middle-class home in 
Great Britain where his Works, bound in limp 
red morocco, do not lie about on a little table 
in the drawing room. But all the same, the 
amount of "mention" of him in print and 
speech is, one suspects, out of all proportion 
to the amount of reading of him that is done. 
He is undoubtedly read much more frequently 
than any other English author of date earlier 
than 1800 with the exception of Dr. John 
Overall, Mr. Edward Lively, Dr. Hadrian a 
Saravia, Dr. Jeremiah Badcliffe, Mr. Michael 
Babbett and others whose names may or may 
not be recognized as those of the compilers 
of the authorized version of the Bible. But 
what does the position of "National Poet" 
really come to? Does one Englishman out of 



a hundred read a single play by Shakespeare 
once a year? It is safe to say that ninety- 
five out of a hundred never open his works 
after they have left school. Millions of school- 
children have two or three plays drilled into 
them, and remember fragments of "To be, or 
not to be," "The quality of mercy," "So work 
the honey bees," "0 that we now had here," 
and "Friends, Bomans, countrymen." These 
quotations on a man's lips are almost invari- 
ably relics of juvenile experience. Droves of 
school-girls are taken every year to see the 
touring companies in "The Merchant of 
Venice" and "As You Like It" ; and now and 
then London turns out to see Miss Somebody's 
Juliet, Mr. Somebody's Hamlet or Sir Some- 
body Something's Shylock. But we most of 
us think we are far more familiar with 
Shakespeare's plays than we actually are. 

I mentioned Mr. Bullen's excellent print- 
ing. Quite apart from Shakespeare a press 
like his is worth encouraging for the sake of 
its typography. English book production is 
not yet anything like as good as it should be. 
It is not for instance anywhere near the Ger- 
man level. No one who visited the Leipzig 
Book-Trades exhibition in the (earlier part of 
the!) summer of 1914 could fail to be struck 
by the immense superiority of the German 
exhibits in point of appearance. But there 
has been a great improvement here in the 
last five and twenty years ; and that is unde- 
niably due to the example set by the various 
private presses, such as the Kelmscott, the 
Vale, and the Doves. These private presses 
are not usually long-lived. They usually pro- 
duce a few beautiful books and then cease 
work; their products then rising to great 
values in the market. Happily there always 
seems to be somebody to carry on the torch. 
At present Mr. Arthur Sabin is doing very 
pretty work at his Temple Sheen Press; an- 
other new one is the Bomney Street Press con- 
ducted by Francis Meynell, a son of Alice 
Meynell the poet. Mr. Meynell has just issued 
his first volume, a selection of his mother's 
recent poems. It is a very sound and charm- 
ing piece of printing. The type is the old 
Fell type which was used in the seventeenth 
century (I believe by the Oxford University 
Press) and the old typographical ornaments 
are employed. The book is hand rubricated 
by Mr. Edward Johnson, one of the finest of 
modern calligraphers. The proprietors of 
"Form" the new art quarterly which I 
mentioned recently are also bringing out 
books; they propose to devote themselves 
mainly to verse, written out by hand, repro- 
duced, and illustrated. Several other private 
presses are in the air. In some instances

people seem to be taking to this form of recre- 
ation as a means of escape from the nervous 
strain of war. They are taking to chess in the 
same way ; the shops which sell chessmen find 
it difficult to cope with the demand for them. 

Notable new books are few. The best thing 
recently has been Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch's 
book "On the Art of Writing" which con- 
tains lectures delivered at Cambridge just 
before the war. It is not easy to say anything 
new about the qualities at which a writer 
should aim and the defects which he should 
endeavor to avoid. Accuracy and clarity 
have been eulogized before, and the super- 
fluous adjective has often been denounced. 
But if Sir Arthur, not being Adam or Eve, 
cannot lay down new rules, he has certainly 
formulated the essentials of good writing as 
clearly and accurately as any man before him ; 
and his humor and variety of illustration 
make his book very delightful to read. It is 
a book that every professional writer should 
study; though it makes one painfully self- 
conscious of the stains and blotches on every 
sentence that one writes. It is above all a 
book for the person of university age who has 
not yet developed bad habits which are incur- 
able. It will assist him to think for himself, 
encourage him to write, and materially help 
him to avoid writing badly. 

Miss Louise Sill's translation of M. Paul 
Claudel's "L'Annonce faite a Marie" comes, 
I think, from your side. If Claudel were 
easier reading one could prophesy a boom 
here. Five years ago he was little known ; since 
then he has stolen silently into an acknowl- 
edged place amongst the first living French 
writers. People here are beginning to read 
him ; and though there may be some difference 
of opinion as to his size I have not yet met 
anyone who disputes his genius. One perform- 
ance of one play is all we have hitherto seen 
in London of his dramatic work. It will be 
strange if "L'Annonce" is allowed to remain 
much longer unstaged. It is a play of great 
beauty and dramatic force, and it peculiarly 
lends itself also to the modern "producer." 
M. Claudel's war-poems which have reached 
us are more impressive than anything of the 
kind that has been done here. None worth 
reading have appeared lately. Among other 
new poetry one may notice Mr. John Free- 
man's "Stone Trees" published by the new 
firm of Selwyn and Blount ; while a volume is 
announced which will contain the verse of 
A. W. St. Clair Tisdall, a young Cambridge 
man who, after a brilliant university career, 
died in the Dardanelles last year in a heroic 
enterprise which won him a posthumous V. C. 
What his verse is like I do not know. 



Meanwhile, in strong and steady current, 
however the output of everything else may 
fluctuate, the war-books stream forth from 
the press. Spy-books and narratives by 
escaped governesses are fewer than they were. 
The product now falls into three main classes : 
(1) narratives of actual fighting, (2) "indict- 
ments" of the Germans, and (3) books dis- 
cussing the settlement at the end of the war. 
These last, the publishers say, are selling in 
thousands; akin to them in appeal is M. 
Eomain Holland's "Above the Battle" which 
is being widely read here and of which nearly 
fifty editions have appeared in France. 
Among the "indictments" the most serious is 
"The Germans" by Mr. J. M. Eobertson, the 
politician and anti-Baconian controversialist. 
Mr. Robertson's conclusions will, I suppose, 
be less appetizing to the Germans than to our- 
selves ; but his most hostile reader must admit 
the force of the chapters in which he demol- 
ishes practically every "race-theory" that has 
ever been invented, and bangs the skulls of 
the dolichocephals and the brachycephals 
against each other until there is no visible 
difference between them. A work of less 
learning, but equally remarkable in another 
way, is Mr. Henry de Halsalle's "Degenerate 
Germany," which for sustained invective has 
been equalled by no other war-book. This 
gentleman says "airily" that the Germans 
"became cannibals" in the seventeenth cen- 
tury ; that no German deserves the appellation 
"lady" or "gentleman"; that Germans pick 
their teeth with forks in public ; that Germans 
relish bad smells and wash in the smallest pro- 
curable basins ; and that German literature is 
unprecedented in its immorality. As a pro- 
test against their impiety he makes the rev- 
erent suggestion that we should inscribe above 
the altars in our churches the text "Father, 
forgive them not, for they know what they 
do." This book should have a conspicuous 
place in any museum of war-literature which 
may be established when Europe has got 
straight again.

the Belgian Scholarship Committee. It is nearly 
a year since this movement started, its object in the

destitute Belgian scholars; but this aim has gradu- 
ally broadened, so that now the purpose is "to give

to resume their work of art or science," and "to

The first part of this twofold purpose is of a tem- 
porary character; the second relates to the long 
future (it is hoped) of a restored Belgium, and is 
more important. Appeal is made to libraries and 
publishing houses and individuals for books, espe- 
cially duplicates that can be easily spared, and to 
learned societies and educational institutions for 
sets of their publications. But provisionally, and 
until the return of peace, promises only are desired, 
there being no present facilities for the receipt and 
storage of these gifts. Money, however, at the 
earliest moment, will be welcome for the immediate 
aid of Belgian scholars, writers, and artists, and 
for the creation of a substantial reconstruction 
fund; and it is, in the committee's words, ''the elite 
of the American people," those interested in the 
diffusion of knowledge and the growth of art, 
rather than the general public, that must be looked 
to for this aid. Associate membership in this band 
of workers is offered at ten dollars a year during 
the war and for two years thereafter, sustaining 
membership at one hundred dollars annually, and 
fellowship at one thousand dollars annually. 
Remittance should be made to Mr. John Joy Edson, 
Treasurer, 309 Wilkins Bldg., Washington, D. C. 
Mr. Nevil Monroe Hopkins is chairman of the 
committee, and Professor George Sarton, of the 
University of Ghent, but at present in Washington, 
is secretary. 



A CORRESPONDENT OP THE OLD SCHOOL, eminent 
in the art of writing something more than mere 
news bulletins such as the modern press agency 
sends forth from all parts of the world to all parts 
of the world, George Washburn Smalley, who died 
in London on the fourth of this month, leaves a 
long and enviable record of journalistic achieve- 
ment. He was born in 1833 at Franklin, Mass. 
"My Memoirs," he writes in opening bis "Anglo- 
American Memories," a substantial two-volume 
retrospect, "begin with that New England of fifty 
years ago and more which has pretty well passed out 
of existence. I knew all or nearly all the men who 
made that generation famous: Everett; Charles 
Sumner, ' the whitest soul I ever knew,' said Emer- 
son; Wendell Phillips; Garrison; Andrew, the 
greatest of the great ' War Governors'; Emerson; 
Wendell Holmes; Theodore Parker; Lowell, and 
many more ; and of all I shall presently have some- 
thing to say." What he says is well worth reading, 
as is also his earlier book, "Studies of Men." So 
long and actively had he mingled with men who 
were making history that his reminiscences of those 
men had more than a personal or biographical 
interest. In education he was a product of both 
Yale and Harvard, the former having given him 
his academic training, the latter his professional 
outfit; for before he entered upon journalism he 
both studied and for five years practised law. But 
the Civil War claimed his energies as correspond- 
ent from the front for the New York "Tribune." 
Later he became a member of that journal's edi- 
torial staff, then organized its European bureau in 



London, and had charge of its European corre- 
spondence until 1895, when he accepted the post of 
American correspondent of the London "Times." 

| Ten years ago he retired from active journalism, 
though continuing to write occasionally for the 

j New York "Tribune," which published serially his 
"Anglo-American Memories," and for magazines. 

! In 1878 he spared enough time from journalism to 
serve as Special Commissioner of the United States 
at the Paris Exposition. He compiled a volume 
of Blight's speeches in 1868, and wrote a "Life of 
Sir Sidney Waterlow" forty years later. 



BOOKSHELVES IN EVOLUTION have in no single 
treatise received the exhaustive study that might be 
given to the subject. From the solidly built wall- 
bookcase to the skeleton construction of steel that 
graces the modern bookstack and adjusts itself to 
volumes of varying sizes, is a considerable advance 
in utility and in beauty. The development of the 
book-rest, or reading-desk, that sprang from the 
wall at right-angles in such manner as to receive 
necessary light from an adjacent window, into the 
tier of shelves abutting against the wall, was an 
early step in bookshelf -evolution ; but the rigidly- 
built, non-adjustable wooden shelving was a long 
time in giving way to the present-day adaptable 
construction. No rational system of book-classifica- 
tion and book-arrangement was easily possible 
under such primitive conditions. Our oldest circu- 
lating library, that founded by Franklin and his 
associates in Philadelphia in 1731, continued for 
more than a century and a half to classify its 
books, with rough-and-ready simplicity, as folios, 
quartos, octavos, and duodecimos, shelving them 
merely according to size. This rude classification 
effected much saving of space, but served no other 
purpose, unless it were to promote in the librarian, 
as it certainly did in the instance of Lloyd P. 
Smith, an extraordinary development of the "bump 
of locality" in respect to the many separate works 
on a single subject in the large and constantly 
growing collection. Wooden shelves supported by 
wooden pegs inserted in holes in the uprights, and 
thus capable of being raised or lowered at will, 
were a step in the right direction; and the modern 
steel shelf, of open-bar construction and easily 
adjustable, is the logical continuation of the move^ 
ment toward a strong and flexible and dustless 
system of shelving. The styles of bookstack offered 
by different manufacturers, with remarks on library 
equipment by librarians of experience, will be 
found in the current issue of the "Library Jour- 
nal" by any seeker after knowledge and useful 
information in this technical branch of library lore. 



THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL, as the afflicted author 
of "Invictus" might not inappropriately be called, 
is conspicuous among the choice spirits admirably 
portrayed by Mrs. Pennell in her "Nights," a book 
for the elect, of the elect, and by one of the elect 
as will be found more fully set forth on a later 
page. Henley must have been a terror to those 
whom he opposed, or who opposed him, but at this 
distance of time and place one can admire the 



412 



THE DIAL 



[April 27 



uprightness and downrightness of the man and the 
invincibility of his courage and spirit under 
grievous physical infirmity. "Rarely has a man so 
hampered by his body kept his spirit so gay," says 
Mrs. Pennell. "He was meant to be a splendid 
creature physically, and fate made him a helpless 
cripple who was it once described him as ' the 
wounded Titan'? Everybody knows the story: he 
made sure that everybody should by telling it in his 
' Hospital Verses.' But everybody cannot know 
who did not know him how bravely he accepted his 
disaster. It seemed to me characteristic once when 
a young cousin of mine, a girl at the most suscep- 
tible age of hero-worship, meeting him for the first 
time in our chambers and volunteering, in the 
absence of anybody else available, to fetch the cab 
he needed, thought his allowing her to go on such 
an errand for him the eccentricity of genius and 
never suspected his lameness until he stood up and 
took his crutch from the corner. There was noth- 
ing about him to suggest the cripple." Possibly if 
he had kept out of his verses all reference to his 
sturdy endurance of "the bludgeonings of chance" 
we should like him even better than we do. But 
on the other hand, if he had done so, how would 
his readers, or most of them, have known anything 
about that which now stirs their admiration? 



THE CHILD AND HIS "LiBEBRY" might form the 
subject of an interesting and amusing and instruc- 
tive book such as has not yet been written. To the 
child the "liberry" is quite as often the borrowed 
book from the public collection of reading matter 
as it is the building and its contents, just as with 
his elders the word "laundry" means both the 
package of napery and underwear submitted for 
washing and also the establishment in which the 
washing is done. A passage from the current 
Report of the Maiden (Mass.) Public Library is 
here in place. Rapid increase in the number of 
juvenile borrowers has made necessary the build- 
ing of an addition, an exclusively children's annex. 
Just before its occupancy Mr. Fison, the librarian, 
reported : " This department, which was considered 
crowded a year ago, shows an increase of 11 per 
cent in the circulation of books, and at times the 
help of three or four additional assistants has been 
required to look after the children. The largest 
day's circulation was 621. Forty-one per cent of 
the entire circulation of the main library was juve- 
nile. When we report that 11 per cent more chil- 
dren's books were circulated, we ought to add that 
about 44 per cent more children have visited the 
rooms this year, for it is a universal custom that 
when a child comes to change his ' liberries,' as he 
generally calls his books, he is sure to bring, at 
least, three others with him to see that it is properly 
done, and any boy or girl who cannot muster three 
followers has no social standing: whatever." 



THE CREATOR OF GALLAGHER AND VAN BIBBER, 
whose sayings and doings were interesting some 
appreciable fraction of the reading public a quar- 
ter of a century ago, has died suddenly in the 
very prime of life, but with a record of literary 



work to his credit that, in quantity and in good 
average quality, many a far older writer has failed 
to equal. Richard Harding Davis was born in 
Philadelphia in 1864, the son of L. Clarke and 
Rebecca Elaine (Harding) Davis, both well known 
in the world of letters. After graduation from 
Lehigh University and a special course of one year 
at Johns Hopkins, he entered upon journalism, his 
father's calling, and from that soon passed to the 
writing of fiction, his mother's literary occupation. 
"Gallagher," a story of newspaper life, is said to 
have achieved thirteen rejections before its lucky 
acceptance by "Scribner's Magazine," after which 
its author had little experience of editorial rebuffs. 
War-correspondence, novel-writing, short stories, 
plays, descriptions of travel, tales for children 
all these have claimed his energies, and in all his 
work he has been successful in pleasing the popu- 
lar taste. The London "Times" and the New York 
"Herald" secured his services as war correspond- 
ent, and he saw actual fighting and described it in 
his reports on the Turko-Greek, the Spanish- 
American, the South African, and the Russo- 
Japanese wars. He was, at the time of his death, 
on April 11, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical 
Society, a member of the Aero Club of America, 
and also a member of the Explorers" Club of 
America. The list of his books is too long to give 
here, and too easily accessible, in books of refer- 
ence and in library catalogues, to require any such 
detailed mention. 

A GIFT OF LINCOLN MANUSCRIPTS of no Small 

value has been made to the Library of Congress by 
Mr. Clarence L. Hay, and another of almost equal 
interest by Miss Helen Nicolay. Mr. Hay, acting 
for himself and sisters, presented two drafts of 
the Gettysburg address, one of which the speaker 
is said to have held in his hand when he delivered 
that memorable oration. Perhaps the familiar 
legend of Lincoln's reading that speech from the 
backs of old envelopes pressed into service at the 
last moment will now be either confirmed or 
refuted. The draft of the second inaugural address 
was also handed to Librarian Putnam by Mr. Hay. 
These three autograph manuscripts had belonged to 
the late Secretary John Hay. Miss Nicolay gave 
Lincoln's autograph memorandum, prepared Au- 
gust 23, 1864, when he thought his re-election in 
grave doubt and desired to forecast a plan of 
cooperation with the president-elect for the saving 
of the Union. This document, endorsed by the 
members of his cabinet and sealed, was opened and 
read to the cabinet after the election, and was 
preserved by his private secretary, John G. Nicolay, 
whose daughter now places it in the government's 
keeping. 



COLLEGE VERSE may seldom attain the sublimities 
or the profundities, but within its proper domain 
of the youthfully buoyant, the brisk, the piquant, 
the humorous, and occasionally the gracefully sen- 
timental, it is not seldom excellent reading. For 
pure fun in rollicking rhyme what could be better 
than some of the verse in the Harvard "Lampoon" 
or any one of perhaps a dozen other similar mouth-

pieces of student wit and humor? In what environ- 
ment but that of an American college could there 
have started such a periodical as "The Purple 
Cow," which had its birth (not as a calf) at 
Williams College nearly nine years ago? A fit 
name, surely, for a humorous publication in a 
college of such bucolic surroundings as Williams. 
Mr. Alfred Noyes has been editing a volume of 
Princeton undergraduate verse, and his name on 
the title-page will serve as no slight attestation to 
the worth of the book's contents. He goes so far 
as to say of these Princeton poems that they attain 
"a higher standard than is found in similar works 
edited in England by Gilbert Murray and Quiller- 
Couch." This, if correctly reported, is no small 
praise. At Oxford and Cambridge the cultivation 
of poetry has for ages been stimulated by the offer 
of prizes and honors to successful contestants, 
whereas in this country athletics rather than 
poetics has long been the one engrossing interest 
outside the prescribed academic pursuits, or rather 
to their exclusion in many instances. 



THE RETIREMENT OF A VETERAN PROFESSOR OF 

ENGLISH is announced as soon to take place at 
Yale. Professor Henry Augustin Beers, one of the 
oldest members of the Yale faculty, though still 
lacking more than a year of the scriptural three- 
score and ten, will bring his present labors to a 
close at the end of this college year. In 1880 he 
was appointed to the chair of English in the Shef- 
field Scientific School, and by virtue of seniority in 
this department he has for some time been its head 
in the University. Four courses will have to be 
provided with other teachers at his retirement. 
That on "New England Writers" will next year 
be incorporated in Professor William Lyon 
Phelps's course in "American Literature." The 
lectures on Milton will be given by Professor 
Lawrence Mason, those on "Aspects of the Drama" 
by Mr. A. I. Taft, and Dr. S. T. Williams will 
handle the " Selected Topics from the Literature of 
the Victorian Age." Professor Beers is best 
known to the reading public for his compilation, 
"A Century of American Literature," issued in 
1878, his "Sketch of English Literature," and his 
life of N. P. Willis in the "American Men of 
Letters" series. As a magazine writer also his 
name is familiar, and what he has to say is more 
than likely to be well worth reading. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



BACONIAN METHODS OF CONTROVERSY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I know neither Dr. Tannenbaum nor Mr. Basil 
Lupton, and have only a languid interest in the 
Shakespeare-Bacon question, believing that as long 
as we have the works to read and study it makes 
little difference whether they were written by "the 
paltry actor" or "the wisest, brightest, meanest 
of mankind." But I have been much interested in 
the controversy between the two gentlemen referred 
to that has been going on in your columns, because 



Mr. Lupton's letters furnish such admirable illus- 
trations of the methods of the controversialist 
intent only on winning an apparent victory, that 
from one point of view they may be regarded as 
masterpieces. Possibly you can find space for con- 
sideration, somewhat lengthy but made as brief as 

possible, of those methods. 

First: Misrepresenting an opponent's state- 
ments and their purpose; usually quite effective, 

1 for few will look back to see what actually was 
said and why. 

Illustrations: Dr. Tannenbaum asserts in his 
review of Mr. Baxter's "The Greatest of Literary 
Problems" (THE DIAL, Dec. 9) that that writer 
"selects for quotation only such allusions and 
references to the poet-dramatist about which there 
can be some doubt" and "suppresses or distorts" 
evidence that "Shakespeare was very frequently 
spoken of by his contemporaries." To support this 
serious charge, he shows that Mr. Baxter rejects 

; the testimony of Chettle, Greene, Heywood, Jonson, 
and Heminge and Condell on irrelevant or unin- 
telligible grounds; makes no mention of the 
inscription on Shakespeare's monument; and has 
not "even so much as hinted at" nine "unequivocal 
references to Shakespeare as a poet." Mr. Lupton 
makes no endeavor to refute the charge, but writes 
(issue of Jan. 20), as though the references had 
been given as proof that the actor and the author 
were one and the same person, "Mr. Tannen- 
baum's reasoning would be paralleled by stringing 
together a number of passages in praise of George 
Eliot's novels, and proceeding to argue that the 
author of the novels must have been a man of that 
name." Dr. Tannenbaum having failed in his 
letter published February 17 to point out this 
misrepresentation, Mr. Lupton in his communica- 
tion of March 16 writes: "Dr. Tannenbaum 
appears blind to my point that no amount of 
contemporary praise of the Shakespeare plays and 
poems can be regarded as evidence of the author- 
ship." This is shrewd, for of course it looks as 
though he had the Doctor "stumped." 

Several other illustrations of the use of this 
method could be cited; but one, the most pro- 
nounced of all, must suffice. In the issue of 
January 20, Mr. Lupton asserts that by unearth- 
ing Shakespeare's deposition in the Bellott-Mount- 
joy lawsuit, Professor Wallace "unwittingly proved 
conclusively that the actor was unable to write, 
because lus name is written by a law clerk in law 
script, and the deponent made his mark beneath 
the signature." Dr. Tannenbaum then comments 
(Feb. 17) : "No human being outside of a lunatic 
asylum, or a fit candidate for one, who has ever 
seen a facsimile of the deposition and the wit- 
ness's signature can for a single moment entertain 
the belief that the abbreviated signature was 
written by the clerk who wrote the deposition. 
No sane person who knows anything of graphiol- 
ogy can for a moment doubt that the signature 
in question is an unquestioned Shakespeare auto- 
graph; and that the deposition as well as the 
signature are in the hand-writing that was in 
general use at the time. Has Mr. Lupton mistaken 
the lex script a for law script? Furthermore, what 
Mr. Lupton calls a 'mark' beneath the signature 



414 



THE DIAL 



[April 27 



is only a small blot. Had the witness not been 
able to sign his name, the clerk would have written 
the name, and would have written the words 'his 
mark' between the Christian name and the sur- 
name, in accordance with general usage." Mr. 
Lupton thus answers (March 16) : "Dr. Tannen- 
baum gives his case away when he admits that the 
body of the deposition . . and the signature are 
in the same hand-writing. . . The signature is 
written by the law clerk, and the mark (dot or 
cross is immaterial) is added by the illiterate 
deponent Shakspere." This is excellent! See 
how by the simple transmogrification of "in the 
hand-writing that was in general use at the time" 
into "in the same hand-writing" the Doctor has 
been made to "admit" what he so roundly asserted 
no sane person could believe: how the "blot" has 
become a "dot"; how the statement that had he 
written the signature the law clerk would have 
written "the words 'his mark' between the Christian 
name and the surname, in accordance with general 
usage" is ignored; and how the light and airy 
"dot or cross is immaterial" suggests that Dr. 
Tannenbaum's main point is that the "mark" is 
not a cross, though in fact he made no reference 
whatever to a cross. If the reader is not com- 
pletely deceived, it is because even a controversialist 
has his limitations. 

Second: Stating so simply and positively as 
apparently to preclude all possibility of denial 
that an opponent has not done what in fact he 
has. This is a very common method, and is fre- 
quently very briefly characterized. 

Illustration: Mr. Lupton having said (Jan. 20) 
that none of the contemporary writers cited in the 
review, "with possibly one exception, identifies the 
author with the Stratford actor," Dr. Tannenbaum 
asserts (Feb. 17) that "Mr. Lupton is not telling 
the truth," and reminds him of "Ben Jonson's 
wholly unequivocal identification of Shakespeare 
with Stratford," "the testimony of Shakespeare's 
monument in Stratford," and Leonard Digges's 
reference to that monument in the First Folio. 
Mr. Lupton replies (March 16) that "he does not 
hesitate to say I am not telling the truth, yet he 
does not indicate where I am at fault." 

Third : Ignoring a principal point found incon- 
trovertible and treating a subsidiary matter as if it 
were the main point. 

Illustration: Among the references given in 
the review, Dr. Tannenbaum calls especial atten- 
tion to one in which "the dramatist is unequivocally 
spoken of as an actor," a poem by John Davies, 
"To our English Terence, Mr. Will: Shakespeare" 
who "plaid some kingly parts in sport." Mr. 
Lupton writes (Jan. 20) that none of the authors 
cited by Dr. Tannenbaum, "with possibly one 
exception, identifies the author with the Stratford 
actor, and this possible exception is by no means 
a clear exception. The phrase 'our English 
Terence' suggests a pseudonym, if the Terence 
plays were the work of Caius Laelius." Note the 
eloquent silence as to the quotation "plaid some 
kingly parts in sport" ! 

Fourth: Raising an issue other than the one 
under consideration and endeavoring to divert the 
discussion to that the method recommended by 



Schopenhauer to a controversialist who feels that 
he is being worsted. 

Illustration: Dr. Tannenbaum comments thus 
(Feb. 17) on the quotation from Mr. Lupton just 
given: "He refers to John Davies's poem in which 
Shakespeare is spoken of as 'our English Terence,' 
and says that if the Terence plays were the work 
of Caius Laelius then Davies's allusion 'suggests 
a pseudonym.' This, then, proves nothing, and 
may be equivocal. It is amazing what wizardry 
an 'if exerts upon a Baconian." Mr. Lupton then 
asserts (March 16) : "The theory that the Terence 
plays were the work of Caius Laelius, is dismissed 
by Dr. Tannenbaum with a sneer," and then adds: 
"A genuine literary student would be interested to 
know what Cicero and other contemporary writers 
tell us of the subject." Of course, any "sneer" 
that may exist in Dr. Tannenbaum's remarks is 
not at "the theory that the Terence plays were the 
work of Caius Laelius," in which for aught that 
appears to the contrary he may be a firm believer; 
and "what Cicero and other contemporary writers 
tell us of the subject," like "the flowers that bloom 
in the Spring," has "nothing to do with the case," 
the real question being, if this theory is to be 
brought into the discussion, what John Davies 
thought about it and what reason he had for 
believing that his contemporaries would understand 
such a cryptic suggestion. But suggesting that 
Dr. Tannenbaum has sneered at the theory and 
lugging in Cicero may involve him in a discussion 
concerning it, and that troublesome quotation from 
Davies may be lost in the shuffle. 

Fifth: Stating matters of mere opinion as if 
they were indisputable facts. 

Illustrations : The assertions (March 16) that Ben 
Jonson's play proves that the application for the 
Shakespeare coat-of-arms was "a subject of mirth 
at the time"; that "many persons were in the 
secret" that Shakespeare was not the author of 
the plays attributed to him; that Greene's allusion 
to "an upstart crow beautified with our feathers" 
"indicates the paltry actor strutting about decked 
out as a dramatic author" ; that the quotation from 
Nash is "a hit at Bacon, a lawyer . . turning 
playwright"; that Bacon and Jonson composed the 
Leonard Digges verses in the First Folio and the 
inscription on the Shakespeare monument, and 
that they worked "to put the public on a wrong 
scent," not one of which assertions is believed 
by the vast majority of Shakespearean scholars. 
Mr. Lupton's animating principle seems to be 
"I believe it, therefore it is an indisputable fact," 
rather than "It is an indisputable fact, therefore 
I believe it." 

Sixth : In default of evidence or argument, put- 
ting forth an obiter dictum confidently as though 
it were a generally recognised truth, and, if occa- 
sion offers, repeating it more elaborately. The 
confident tone will impose on some readers and the 
particularity on others. 

Illustrations: Dr. Tannenbaum says (Dec. 9) 
that the Baconians "exasperate the orthodox 
Shakespearean by spelling the Stratfordian's name 
' Shakspere.' " Mr. Lupton replies (Jan. 20) : 
"Mr. Tannenbaum's displeasure does not alter the 
fact that the difference does exist" "between the 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



415 



actors name, Shakspere, and the author's pseudo- 
nym, Shakespeare or Shake-speare," "and it exists 
quite as clearly as the difference between Tannen- 
baum and Rosenbaum." Dr. Tannenbaum replies 
(Feb. 17) : "I have yet to see any evidence that 
'Shakespeare' was a pseudonym. As to Mr. 
Lupton's confident assertion that 'Shakspere' and 
'Shakespeare' are essentially different names, I 
venture to say that his confidence is probably in 
inverse proportion to his knowledge of the sub- 
ject." Mr. Lupton makes no attempt to supply 
the evidence that Dr. Tannenbaum has "yet to 
see," but instead gives (March 16) the pronun- 
ciation, an alternative spelling that "proves" it, 
and a possible derivation of "the Stratford actor's 
name 'Shakspere' " and the pronunciation, an 
alternative spelling that "proves" it, and a 
derivation of "the author's pseudonym," Shake- 
speare. Of course, the differentiation is a modern 
invention, to uphold which there must be explained 
away the facts that the first of "The Names of the 
Principall Actors in all these Playes" that precedes 
the list of plays in the First Folio is William 
" Shakespeare," and that "Shakespeare" is the 
name that is signed to one of the folios of Shake- 
speare's will, tliat appears on the Stratford monu- 
ment, in the reference to that monument in Digges's 
poem in the First Folio, and "in the grant of arms 
in 1596, in the license to the players of 1603, and 
in the text of all the legal documents relating to 
the poet's propertv." (Lee's Life of Shakespeare, 
page 285). 

These, then, are Mr. Lupton's methods, as any 
one can easily verify by reference to the issues 
of THE DIAL of December 9, January 20, Febru- 
ary 17, and March 16. What is it that actuates the 
"Baconians and anti-Willians" anyhow? Is it 
fondness for fair play, desire to do justice, and a 
sincere and disinterested love of truth for its own 
sake? 

Mr. Lupton says (March 16) that "dear old 
Dr. Furnivall . . used to get quite angry when 
he saw nail after nail of modern reasoning and 
research driven into the coffin of the man of Strat- 
ford"; if his own letters are specimens of the 
"modern reasoning and research," it must have 
been something other than the feeling that "nail 
after nail" was being "driven into the coffin of 
the man of Stratford" that made the good Doctor 
"quite angry." Nails! Why, they are not even 

brass tacks! T^ -r.

IN PEAISE OF "SPOON BIVEB." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
I have noted a communication in your issue of 
March 30 recording the reactions of one of your 
readers to the "Spoon River Anthology" by Mr. 
Edgar Lee Masters. "Spoon River" needs no 
apologia. Yet there seem to be some who, like 
your correspondent, crave an apologia, some who, 
not finding one in the accepted oracles of criticism, 
vacillate and are half inclined to think that the 
book can be dismissed after all with a curt refer- 
ence to "reptile," "slime," "vulgarity," and "sexual 
psychology." It is a satisfaction to answer the 



challenge of doubt by a statement of personal con- 
viction; and without speaking for anyone but 
myself, I venture an explanation of why I believe 
"Spoon River" is not Death, but Life. 

Briefly, it is because I believe it a sign of weak- 
ness, of morbidity, when the reader demands of 
his literature a presentation of life more whole- 
some and more idealistic than life itself. To crave 
a coloring or varnishing of the truth instead of the 
truth itself is to confess an intellectual disease; 
and to yield utterly to that craving, to shut out 

! of one's vision the spectacle of folly and ironic fate 
and wrong, is to become a spiritual invalid, a dead 
soul. 

Because our literature is full of a decadent sen- 
timentality, glossing over the black horrors of a 
chaotic universe, minimizing them, palliating them, 
denying them, finding pretext after pretext for 
extracting a far-fetched right out of an unadul- 
terated wrong, one turns from it as from the 
tempered and medicated atmosphere of a hospital 
to the cold air of a world where men can face 
facts. And such a world one finds in "Spoon 
River." Can anyone deny that things do happen 
as they happen in "Spoon River"? Or must one 

j deny it because no comforting assurance that the 
evil deserved their fate or that the good are to be 
rewarded in another world is appended to each 
confession? Of course, if one gazes at the fiends 
and their victims in Malebolge, it is a relief to 

' have the liquid Italian lines to reassure him that 

! it is all the operation of a mysterious justice. It 

' is but natural, too, that a man seeing about him 
a real world as hellish in some of its corners as 
Malebolge should summon, in the veriest panic, 

, the sophistical philosopher, the smooth-spoken 
parson, or the dreaming poet to furnish the pre- 
texts or the illusions he requires. So coddled and 
drugged, he finds living endurable. From the 
writer who bids him look on the stark reality of 
one tragedy, unredeemed by pageantry or an 
appearance of justice or promises of compensa- 
tion, he withholds the title of literature. Perhaps, 
evading the issue, he withholds it on the flimsy 
pretext that the form is not that of what he has 
been accustomed to call poetry. Let the quibbler 
have his way: let him call it puckery or piggery 
or pork-packery ; but will he deny its likeness to 
a part of the living world? 

After all, why are Crabbe and Scott and Words- 
worth cried up for a Return to Nature as vocifer- 
ously as Zola, Hardy, and Mr. Masters are cried 
down for a Return to Reality? It is not because 
Crabbe and Scott and Wordsworth excluded the 
trivial, the tawdry, the cloacaline, but because they 
were willing to furnish the spiritual anaesthetics 
that left one in a cheerful frame of mind. The 
vulgarity of Shakespeare is pardoned because it is 

i laughable. The appalling catastrophes of "Lear," 
"Othello," and "Hamlet" are found to be not 
only endurable but also edifying because Eternal 
Justice is exemplified, first, in the fact that the 

i evil are involved with the good in their fall; and, 
secondly, in the fact that the vices of the good, 
Lear's lack of insight, Othello's rash trustfulness, 
and Hamlet's speculative itch, found in agony 
and death a chastisement richlv deserved. In

Mr. Masters's book, the trivial and disgusting are 
not pardoned because they are treated with "high 
seriousness." The catastrophes and mockeries of 
circumstance which he depicts are not considered 
edifying because he does not allow the reader to 
discover the consoling circumstance, the vindicating 
theory, which reconciles him to the world as it is. 
Let us cease our clamor for a literature which 
reads into the world some cosmic idealism, which 
finds a sublime destiny in the drunkard's last 
delirium, in the embrace of the jaded street-walker, 
in the demoniac task of the stoker, in the con- 
vulsive breathing of the gas-poisoned soldier, in 
the blighting of child life in the sweat shop and 
factory. Let us say to ourselves: "No casuistry 
will obliterate, no dreams obscure, no religion 
glorify, these horrors. What are we going to do 
about it?" Arrived at that stage, perhaps we 
shall turn the enormous force of our wasted ener- 
gies, wasted in soul salves and trifling reforms, 
into the task of tasks, the transformation of the 
world as it is into a world which will need no 
apologies, no discreet concealments, a world not 
unworthy of a God. We shall be skeptical of the 
power of passing Pippas or Third Floor Backs 
to work miracles on whole communities, or of 
social settlements to combat by magic the organic 
operation of the forces of greed, ignorance, and 
vice. I do not belittle such influences, and am far 
from opposing them. But to see in them the hope 
of the future is grossly to under-estimate the task. 
What concrete steps the awakened power and 
vision of humanity will take to abolish poverty, 
to answer the needs of sex, to afford expression to 
the higher capacities of all, it is not for me here 
to speak, and the suggestions of to-day will seem 
the puerilities of the next century. But we may 
be sure of one thing that will characterize that 
constructive age: it will not demand of its litera- 
ture the blinking of any reality whatsoever; if it, 
demands the "noble and profound application of 
ideas to life," it will not accept as such the vapor- 
ings of any well-meaning man with an imagination 
and a gift for language, who discovers felicities 
where they do not exist and extenuates unnecessary 
and appalling ills; who rhapsodizes about airy 
abstractions like Duty, Liberty, and the Will, with- 
out any scientific analysis or any full realization of 
their application to any concrete problem; who, 
in short, offers the ideas he has read into life 
instead of the ideas he has read out of life. In 
that day, we may believe, "Spoon River" will be 
read as a book that faithfully mirrored a micro- 
cosm palpitant with vitality, that did not blink the 
worms that grope through ordure, or dim the 
splendor of those energies that now seem groping 
too, but which, we may reasonably hope, if they 
are redirected, will evolve a new world.

IS BACON NOT "SHAKE-SPEAEE"? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issues of Dec. 9 and March 2, Mr. 

Samuel A. Tannenbaum replies to the following 

anti-Shaksperians, Mr. James P. Baxter and Mr. 

George G. Greenwood respectively. Mr. Baxter's 



book, "The Greatest of Literary Problems," con- 
tains in its last pages which Mr. Tannenbaum 
purposely avoids answering (because it "deals with 
ciphers," etc.) an explanation of. a point that 
has clearly baffled both Mr. Greenwood and Mr. 
Tannenbaum. 

In replying to Mr. Greenwood's recently pub- 
Isihed book, "Is There a Shakespeare Problem?" 
Mr. Tannenbaum takes issue with Mr. Greenwood's 
contention that a verse in the 1604 Quarto Edition 
of "Hamlet" shows the author to have been a 
classical scholar conversant with the view of 
Aristotle and other philospohers that there can be 
no motion without sense, or sense without a soul. 

The "Hamlet" quarto verse is as follows: 
"Sence sure you have 
Els could you not have motion." 

Taking with Mr. Tannenbaum the word "sence" 
to include mental faculties, the error of the 
philosophy just expressed is manifest to any who 
have seen a snake's tail move after its severance 
from the body. So that Mr. Tannenbaum is right 
in saying that the passage is inane (more espe- 
cially in connection with the "Hamlet" context), 
and Mr. Greenwood is right in implying that the 
author was misled by a "classical" error. Neither 
calls attention to the fact that the Folio Edition 
of "Hamlet" omitted these lines, and that is where 
Mr. Baxter's wider view clears up the matter, as 
your readers will find on pages 497-8 of his book, 
where he shows that the omission of this verse 
from the 1623 "Hamlet" was coincident with 
Bacon's correction in the 1623 edition of his 
"Advancement of Learning" (or "Augmeutis") of 
the "classical" view expressed in the 1605 edition 
thereof that "in the absence of sense there can 
be no motion." In the 1623 edition, Bacon states 
that "ignorance drove some of the ancient philos- 
ophers to suppose that a soul was infused into all 
bodies without distinction; since they could not 
conceive how there could be motion at discretion 
without _sense, or sense without a soul." 

It seems to me that Mr. Baxter has raised the 
real question as to this point when he says: "In 
the First Folio of the ' Shakespeare ' Works pub- 
lished the same year, the lines from the earlier 
Hamlet were left out. By whom and why were 
they cancelled if not by Bacon, who was then see- 
ing his 'Augmentis' through Jaggard's press"? 
That is the question for your readers to decide 
before concluding that Bacon is not "Shakespeare."

I wish to appeal to the omniscient constituency

concerning what famous man it was true that he 

had inscribed on his monument that he had repaid

LEISURE HOTTRS OF A [LITERARY LIFE.* 



More than seventeen centuries ago Aulus 
Gellius gave to the world his "Noctes Atticae," 
somewhat less than a century ago John Wilson 
(or Christopher North, as he called himself 
in literature) was busy with his "Noctes 
Ambrosianse," and now we have another book 
of a similar title though of a different char- 
acter from either of these, a volume of 
"Nights" by Mrs. Joseph Pennell, which, to 
establish a sort of kinship with the other two, 
we might call "Noctes Pennellianse." It gives 
us the nocturnal diversions of the gifted artist 
and his equally, though differently, gifted 
wife in the four European cities, Rome, 
Venice, London, and Paris, where Mr. and 
Mrs. Pennell were at one time and another 
busily engaged by day in filling commissions, 
to the subsequent satisfaction of magazine- 
readers and others, and less strenuously 
occupied after nightfall in cultivating a con- 
siderable number of desirable friendships. 
Conventional Philadelphia breeding and re- 
spectable Philadelphia traditions seem to have 
been subjected to some little violence in the 
bohemianizing process wrought by these inno- 
cently mirthful, harmlessly convivial Roman 
and Venetian, London and Parisian nights. 
The late hours, extending into early morning 
hours, kept by the choice spirits with whom 
these expatriated Philadelphians consorted as 
by a kind of natural affinity, were not the best 
preparation for a following day of diligent 
toil at desk or easel; but one cannot doubt 
that they were worth all they cost. Their later 
fruit, at least, in the agreeable literary and 
artistic and personal reminiscences now put 
into book form, is something to be unre- 
servedly thankful for. Taking the nights in 
the order of their rehearsal, let us make our 
first dip into the book in the Roman section 
and join the Pennells and sundry others at 
the home of the artist Elihu Vedder and his 
wife: 

There was little of Ms work to see, for his studio 
was some distance from his apartment. But it was 
enough to see Vedder himself or, for that matter, 
enough to hear him. In his own house he led the talk, 
even Forepaugh [a fictitious name] having small 
chance against him. He was a prolific, a splendidly 
determined and animated talker. It was stimulating 
just to watch him talk. He was never still, he rarely 
sat down, he was always moving about, walking up 
and down, at times breaking into song and even 
into dance. He was then in his prime, large, with

a fine expressive face, and as American in his voice, 
in his manner, in his humour as if he had never 
crossed the Atlantic. The true American never gets 
Europeanized, nor does he want to, however long he 
may stay on the wrong side of the Atlantic. When I 
was with Vedder, Broadway always seemed nearer 
than the Corso. 

He had recently finished the illustrations for the 
Eubaiyat and the book was published while we were 
in Rome. It was never long out of his talk. He 
would tell us the history of every design and of every 
model or pot in it. He exulted in the stroke of genius 
by which he had invented a composition or a pose. 
I have heard him describe again and again how he 
drew the flight of a spirit from a model, outstretched 
and flopping up and down on a feather bed laid upon 
the studio floor, until she almost fainted from fatigue, 
while he worked from a hammock slung just above. 

Instances follow of the artist's high esteem for 
FitzGerald (who is incorrectly referred to as 
"Fitzgerald"), especially his rejoicing "in the 
story of Dr. Chamberlain filling a difficult 
tooth for the Queen and all the while singing 
the praises of the Eubaiyat until she ordered 
a copy of the edition de luxe." 

From the Venetian section a reviewer can- 
not do better than to quote a passage concern- 
ing the brilliant and eccentric genius whom 
the writer was destined to see much of in the 
near future and, with her husband's collabora- 
tion, to make the subject of a notable 
biography. 

It was extraordinary how the Whistler tradition 
had developed and strengthened in the little more than 
four years since he had left Venice. I had never met 
him then, though J. had a few months before in 
London. I hardly hoped ever to meet him; I cer- 
tainly could not expect that the day would come when 
he would be our friend, with us constantly, letting us 
learn far more about him and far more intimately 
than from all the talk at a cafe table of those who 
already know him, accepted him as a master, and loved 
him as a man. But had my knowledge of him come 
solely from those months in Venice I should still have 
realized the power of his personality and the force 
of his influence. He seemed to pervade the place, to 
colour the atmosphere. He had stayed in Venice only 
about a year. In the early eighties little had been 
written of him except in contempt or ridicule. But 
to the artist he had become as essentially a part of 
Venice, his work as inseparable from its associations, 
as the Venetian painters like Carpaecio and Tintoretto 
who had lived and worked there all their lives and 
about whom a voluminous literature had grown up, 
culminating in the big and little volumes by Buskin, 
upon which the public crowding to Venice based their 
artistic creed. 

Any exaggeration in this estimate of Whis- 
tler's Venetian fame will be readily pardoned. 
Anything is better than to damn one's friends 
with faint praise. 

In the considerable section devoted to 
London there occurs, among other pleasing 
pen-portraits, this of the amiable and talented 
though strangely taciturn Phil May : 

Neither his books nor his silence, however original 
and personal, could have been the cause of the charm 
he undoubtedly possessed. I think he was one of the 
people whom one feels are nice instinctively, without 



418 



THE DIAL 



[April 27 



any reason. He was sympathetic and responsive, 
serious when the occasion called for it, foolish when 
folly was in order. It wasn't only in his drawings 
that he was ready to wear the cap and bells. I know 
an artist, one of whose cherished memories of Phil 
May is of the Christmas Eve when they both rang 
Lord Leigh ton's door-bell and ran away and back to 
Phil May's studio on the other side of the road, and 
Phil May was as pleased as if it had been a master- 
piece for Punch. 

In the spirit of gay and frivolous Paris is j 
the following extract from the Parisian por- 
tion of the book. The writer and her com- 
panion were young at the time of this joyous 
first sojourn in the French capital : 

Occasionally we dined joyously beyond our means, 
and one memorable year we devoted our nights to 
giving each other dinners where the best dinners were 
to be had. Those alone who are blest with little 
money and the obligation of making that little can 
appreciate the splendour of our recklessness, just as 
those alone who work all day and eat sparingly can 
have the proper regard for a good dinner. I do not 
regret the recklessness, I am not much the poorer for 
it to-day whatever I was at the time, and I should 
have missed something out of life had I not once 
dined recklessly in Paris. 

Thus in bright and cheery vein does Mrs. 
Pennell write of those memorable European 
nights, wisely forgetting, for the time being, 
whatever hardships and anxieties entered into 
the days. Her playfellow and co-worker in 
those nights and days contributes of his art to 
the embellishment of the volume, which is 
further illustrated from photographs and 
otherwise. It is a thoroughly wholesome and 
enjoyable piece of work, personally reminis- 
cent (or one might say gossipy) without 
malice, and anecdotal without triviality.

SOCIAL, JUSTICE AXD RELIGIOUS 
EVOLUTION.* 



To the innumerable company of simple folk 
who, in these troublous times, are daily groan- 
ing under the burden of an unintelligible 
world, the recently published little book, "The 
Struggle for Justice," by Mr. Louis Wallis, 
following upon the same author's larger work, 
"A Sociological Study of the Bible," to which 
it forms an addendum, will serve to illuminate 
some of the dark places in our historical 
retrospect, and to throw a ray of light upon 
the path to be followed in the immediate 
future. In the older parts of the world, the 
struggle for justice is not, as in America, a 
thing of modern growth. The effort of labor 
to free itself from the tyranny of privilege is 
as old as history, and is first brought to light

in human records in the account of the revolt 
of Israel against his taskmasters the Egyp- 
tians, under the leadership of that greatest 
and gentlest of labor-agitators the world has 
ever seen, Moses the Jewish Law-giver. There 
can be little doubt in the mind of the thought- 
ful and impartial student of history that this 
perpetual internecine warfare has been the 
real cause, underlying those that appear on 
the surface, of the rhythmic rise and fall of 
empires in the far-distant past. The enslave- 
ment of the common people, and the engender- 
ing of a political dry-rot among the ruling 
classes through the spread of idleness and 
luxury; the growth of a swollen and top- 
heavy condition with an outward appearance 
of health and an inward condition of corrup- 
tion; a revolt from below and an unsteady 
resistance from above; a violent shaking of 
the substratum and the collapse of the super- 
structure, such has been for the most part 
the record of the decline and fall of civiliza- 
tions since the beginning of written history. 
Such, in brief, is the tale of "the glory that 
was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome. " 
To those who have sufficient vision to dis- 
cern the signs of the times, and into whose 
consciousness recent European events are 
being burned as by a branding-iron, it is 
becoming increasingly clear that the old world 
is at this moment paying the penalty of its 
age-long indifference to the demands of the 
workers for justice. It seems as though for 
Europe the day of reckoning has come. The 
god Nemesis has presented her bill and de- 
mands instant settlement. It should not be 
difficult for those who can look beyond prox- 
imate to original causes, to perceive that in 
the threatened or impending revolts from 
beneath, which seemed two years ago to en- 
danger the internal stability of each one of 
the belligerent nations, are to be found the 
real reasons why Europe is now weltering in 
blood. Had Justice ruled in each of the war- 
ring countries; had the resources of each 
country been open to the effort of all the citi- 
zens in each country; had general content- 
ment reigned alongside of each monarch on 
his throne ; had every honest man sat securely 
under his own vine and fig tree, none daring 
to make him afraid, such an inhuman spec- 
tacle as we are now witnessing would have 
been impossible, indeed, unthinkable. The 
question, therefore, which is probably press- 
ing itself upon those European minds that are 
sufficiently freed from the asphyxiating influ- 
ence of national passions to be capable of 
thinking, is not as to when and how the war 
may terminate, or as to what form a treaty 
of peace may assume, but as to whether the

nations that have been involved in the strug- 
gle may have sufficient vision to interpret 
the teaching of destiny aright. Will the 
suffering peoples learn that to go on perpe- 
trating social injustice is to defy the inexor- 
able laws of the universe; that it is to pile 
up a debit-balance that must assuredly one 
day be wiped out; that it is to accumulate 
explosive material that must ultimately, by 
spontaneous combustion if not by accident, 
result in disastrous conflagration ? And what 
lesson does this world-tragedy contain for the 
neutral nations, and especially for this 
greatest among neutrals, the United States? 
This is just the question that Mr. Wallis 's 
two books should bring vividly to the mind of 
every thoughtful and patriotic American. 
Must we complete our apprenticeship in the 
art of right living by going through the same 
experiences of blundering and suffering, or 
may we learn in time that the laws of the 
universe are pledged to social justice, and that 
we violate these laws at our peril? America 
is in a peculiar sense at the parting of the 
ways, and those who most deeply love her 
institutions and ideals will most earnestly 
hope for such a national heart-searching as 
will reveal to her whether or not she is follow- 
ing in the footsteps of those countries whose 
accumulated sins are now being expiated on 
fields of blood. 

In the "foreword" to "The Struggle for 
Justice," Mr. Wallis points out the interesting 
and extremely significant fact that two great 
movements, which to the casual thinker may 
seem to have no obvious relationship to each 
other, are converging to the same objective, 
like two rivers flowing together to form a 
larger stream. These are the awakening of 
the social conscience to the need for economic 
justice, and the modern re-interpretation of 
the religion of the Bible. It is upon these 
two movements that our Western civilization 
must rely for its preservation or escape from 
the catastrophe that has invariably overtaken 
its predecessors, even those that have attained 
to the highest point of distinction in com- 
merce, science, art, and literature. And the 
value of such a sociological study as Mr. 
Wallis has given us lies just in this, that it 
reveals the close association which necessarily 
exists between the religion of dogmas and 
creeds and that form of society in which 
land-monopoly and privilege dominate the 
lives of the common people; and it reveals 
the equally vital or organic connection be- 
tween the religion of social morality and the 
freer political institutions towards which 
mankind have always been struggling. In 
every age there has been a "New Theology" 



alongside of a "New Sociology," the one being 
a revolt against the tyranny of dogmatic re- 
ligion, and the other a bursting of the political 
and economic trammels that had circum- 
scribed the life of the people. What distin- 
guishes this double movement in the twentieth 
century from all similar movements that have 
preceded it is that it is now supported as it 
never has been before by knowledge and 
understanding of the art of Biblical and his- 
torical interpretation, on the one hand, and 
of the science of economics on the other. 

It is strange indeed that we should so per- 
sistently have taken for granted that our 
primitive forefathers were possessed of an 
inherent tendency to metaphysical specula- 
tion, and that the religion of early races grew 
out of a desire to solve the riddle of the 
universe. If the method of ^plaining the 
past by observation of the processes we see 
in operation around us in the present is the 
method suggested by pure reason, then the 
assumption that our remote and unlettered 
ancestors evolved their religion out of their 
unsuccessful efforts to transcend the finite 
and to comprehend the infinite must be ruled 
out of court. For we now see plainly that 
I the habit of metaphysical speculation is not 
natural to the genus homo except in his later 
and more complex developments. The natural, 
healthy, well-fed man has no immediate im- 
pulse toward theology, philosophy, or mys- 
ticism. The speculative instinct, like the 
aesthetic or mathematical faculties, only 
asserts itself after a substantial beginning has 
been made in the life that is based upon 
animal sensation, and in the construction of 
the intellectual machinery by which it is 
regulated. Why, then, should we have 
assumed that, while in our own days only 
the few leisured and educated among us have 
a tendency to look beyond the life of the 
passing day, the common people of remote 
ages soared among the immensities and eterni- 
ties out of mere love of theological specula- 
tion? The assumption is obviously not a 
reasonable one, and can only have arisen 
through causes which we have not hitherto 
clearly diagnosed. 

Mr. Benjamin Kidd, in his "Social Evolu- 
tion," has propounded a theory which seems 
to provide an answer to this question. In the 
early days of social development, he points 
out, the interests of the race were sharply 
opposed to the personal interests of the indi- 
viduals composing the race-group. From the 
point of view of that cosmic energy to which 
by a mental necessity we are compelled to 
attribute a personal volition, and which urges 
humanity to the conquest of the earth and 



420

[April 27 



to the highest development of his powers in 
the arts and sciences, it was absolutely essen- 
tial that men should be compelled to toil by 
some power external to themselves, some 
power stronger than the mere force of hunger 
that impels the animal to seek for food. In 
other words, it was necessary that the few 
strong men of exceptional intelligence should 
enslave the many and compel them to obedi- 
ence, it was necessary that injustice should 
provide the first stepping-stone to the higher 
life of society. It is evident that this hypo- 
thesis places the interests of the race and 
those of the vast majority of individuals at 
any given time in direct opposition to each 
other. The interests of the hive involve the 
complete subordination of the great army of 
individual bees who from generation to gener- 
ation have occupied the hive. But why, it 
may be asked, should men have submitted to 
this subordination of their own interests to 
the future interests of the race, a future in 
which, as individuals, they could have no 
part or share ? Eeason gave no sanction to it. 
By the appeal to force, the bands of slavery 
in all its forms could have been burst asunder 
in their earliest stages. But the power that 
rules human destiny seems rigorously to have 
determined that the interests of the race must 
be supreme, and so a supra-rational sanction 
had to be discovered for the subordination of 
the individual, a sanction that would be 
above and independent of reason; and that 
sanction was found in the religion of dogma 
or authority, the religion which rests upon 
an assumed command of supernatural beings. 
The early structure of society, in short, neces- 
sitated a system of theology which postulated 
an external authority which was supposed to 
have ordered this subordination of the mass 
of men to the few powerful spirits among 
them; and so there arose that complex hier- 
archy of gods and demons, with their com- 
mandments and creeds and dogmas, to whom 
was attributed supreme power over the des- 
tinies of the race. The hypothesis may be 
expressed thus: given a certain economic or 
industrial form of society, there must evolve 
a certain system of theology to correspond, 
a system which will profess through its creeds 
and dogmas to authorize the existing struct- 
ure of society, and which will serve to stifle 
the spirit of rebellion on the part of the 
sufferers under that structure. There is, in 
short, an organic connection between a 
religion of authority and dogmatism, and a 
structure of society which involves the abso- 
lute subordination of the many to the few. 

With this hypothesis before us, it is of 
exceeding interest to follow Mr. Wallis in his 



elucidation of the circumstances that led up 
to the struggle of the Hebrew people for the 
worship of the one god, as opposed to the 
cults of the many gods who reigned in the 
temples of the great powers of the time. 
"That struggle," says Mr. "Wallis, "was not a 
mere theological contest between certain wise 
people who served a real God and certain 
foolish people who served unreal gods? It 
was a warfare between the principles of jus- 
tice and injustice. The rise of monotheism 
and the downfall of polytheism spelled the 
triumph of the plain people over the aris- 
tocracy." This is indeed the burden of Mr. 
Wallis 's message to our time, as it is con- 
tained in the two books before us. What we 
have hitherto wrongly interpreted as a per- 
petual intellectual warfare between older and 
newer metaphysical systems was at bottom a 
continuous struggle between those in posses- 
sion of unjust privileges and those who 
suffered from that injustice. "Such as were 
oppressed had no comforter, but on the side 
of the oppressor there was power." The fact 
that this struggle against economic oppression 
assumed the thought-forms it did assume, 
should not have blinded us to the truth that 
its purpose was to burst the manacles of slav- 
ery. The refusal to bow to a king and to kneel 
to a priest are at bottom identical, as being 
expressions of the question that man was 
bound sooner or later with advancing intelli- 
gence to ask himself, "Why am I not free?" 
If we would see clearly on this matter we 
cannot get too firmly into our minds the 
thought expressed in the words of Mr. Wallis, 
"Religion is always the reflection, or mirror, 
of the conventional usages and views of 
Society," and the realization of the fact that 
a revolt against the fetters of law and custom 
invariably manifests itself as a revolt against 
the religion associated with, and giving its 
authority to, these customs. 

How persistently this struggle between 
those on whose side was power and those who 
suffered and had no comforters, has gone on 
under all the changing forms of society and 
religious belief is impressively shown in the 
course of Mr. Wallis 's study of Hebrew his- 
tory. After the motley crowd of gods and 
goddesses who reigned in the temples had 
been dismissed, and the one true God was 
established on his eternal throne, the conflict 
between power and freedom expressed itself 
in a new form. "As soon as Monotheism was 
established, a new struggle arose over the 
question, How is the One God to be served?" 
Then began that conflict that has been waged 
all through the succeeding ages between priest 
and prophet, between dogmatist and moralist,

between orthodoxy and heterodoxy, between 
the upholders of ancient beliefs and the 
seekers after new truths. And the outstand- 
ing fact, the significance of which we are only 
now beginning dimly to perceive, is that the 
priest, the dogmatist, and the orthodox up- 
holder of things as they have been have 
invariably been ranged on the side of power 
and privilege ; while the moralist, the prophet, 
and the heterodox religionist have at all times 
been the supporters of the oppressed and dis- 
inherited. The agitation for justice in social 
relationships has never proceeded from the 
religion of dogma and authority, but always 
from the religious heretics, from those who 
believed that the One God was to be wor- 
shipped, not by giving credence to alleged 
happenings in the past or future or assent to 
certain creeds or dogmas, but by setting up 
principles of justice in human relationships. 
It seems as though it is by a true instinct that 
men have always felt the denial of ancient 
creeds to be the only possible method of 
approach to the double-sided problem of 
religion and politics, theology and sociology, 
the fatherhood of God. and the brotherhood 
of man. 

Apart from the appeal which Mr. Wallis's 
two books make to every earnest social re- 
former, their intellectual value as contribu- 
tions to a right understanding of Hebrew 
history can hardly be over-estimated. The 
plain man seldom realizes that, despite the 
excellence of the translations we have been 
provided with, the idioms, images, and 
phrases in which the history of the Jews is 
conveyed to us are so foreign to our ordinary 
modern language as to constitute practically 
a different tongue. This is specially true of 
the writings of the later Hebrew prophets, but 
applies to some extent even to those of profane 
historians of the time of Josephus. We conse- 
quently fail to recognize that the unfamiliar 
form and phrasing in which the message is 
conveyed have obscured and blurred its mean- 
ing, and have left only the most hazy impres- 
sion on our minds as to the real order and 
significance of the historical happenings. Our 
indebtedness, therefore, is great to a student 
who has taken the trouble to focus the records 
through the lens of his own understanding, 
and to re-present them to us in a form which 
we can fully comprehend. 

Few among average book-readers in these 
days realize the deep human interest that 
attaches to the early history of the Jewish 
people. Not only have we inherited from 
that persecuted race our richest legacy in 
literature, poetry, and (when rightly inter- 
preted) early history, but it is to the Jewish 



race that we are indebted for the inception 

and conservation of the moral sentiment. To 

the Hebrew people we owe it that the torch of 

| ' loyalty to the idealized community" was first 

' lighted and has been kept burning through 

j the long darkness of heathenism. To the 

j Greeks we are indebted for that sentiment of 

I beauty which has played so large a part in 

the intellectual evolution of the human mind ; 

to the Romans we acknowledge our education 

in the uses of the sense of power in all the 

spiral forms through which m^n mounts to 

higher planes of being. But it is to that 

''chosen people" to whom the sense of justice 

was first revealed that we must place the 

credit of having through its seers and 

prophets preserved for future generations the 

highest conceptions of social righteousness 

the world has yet known. 

"We commend these two books to the atten- 
tion of every sincere and humane student of 
sociology. Despite the sadness which always 
attends a candid survey of the blunderings of 
our poor humanity in the past, and despite 
the clamor and confusion of the present age 
in which that survey is made, Mr. Wallis's 
pages are illumined by a persistent hopeful- 
ness, a rational optimism, a stubborn faith in 
the ultimate supremacy of righteousness. We 
cannot do better than to close this imperfect 
review by quoting the author's final sentence: 
"There can be no doubt how the present strug- 
gle will end: the social gospel will triumph; 
and the Bible, as explained by scientific 
scholarship, will stand at the centre of the 
greatest movement for justice and freedom 
that the world has ever seen."

PAIXTIXG AXD THE PTTKLIC.* 



There are in the main two causes of the 
present unfortunate lack of sympathy between 
the painter and the public. Mr. Frederick 
Colin Tilney, an English painter, teacher, and 
critic, discusses them in the opening chapters 
of "The Appeal of the Picture." 

One cause lies in the conditions of modern 
life. Leisure no longer exists. Contempla- 
tion is a lost faculty. Only novelty and the 
sensational attract attention, and that but for 
the moment. Legitimate art, unable by its 
very nature to traffic in novelty and sensation, 
thrives only in an age of greater calm. 

The other cause is to be sought in the 
painter's art itself, as practised to-day. Two 
tendencies in contemporary painting have

Principles in Picture Making. By Frederick Colin Tilney.

422 



THE DIAL 



[April 27 



gone far toward producing total estrangement 
of public from artist. There is, on the one 
hand, the scientific tendency. Since the 
inauguration of the luminarist movement 
upward of a hundred years ago, and particu- 
larly since its triumph in the eighties, such 
painters of the new school as have been really 
sincere have been so absorbed in the technique 
of light and color as almost to have forgotten 
the public in the overwhelming desire to please 
themselves and their fellow artists. The 
public mind, educated for generations in the 
language of the great masters, and looking to 
painting for a transcript of life, is filled with 
mystification and distrust before the ever 
shifting and contradictory mass of experi- 
mental effort, for the most part neglectful of 
subject matter and attentive to technique, that 
adorns the walls of the exhibition. 

On the other hand, there is the tendency 
toward the illegitimate and the insincere. 
These are the parasites of the scientific. The 
successful experimentation of the honest and 
conscientious artist has been followed by the 
haphazard experimentation of the insincere, 
the ignorant, and the self-interested. Walls 
are hung with easy imitations of successful 
innovators, or with startling originalities mak- 
ing desperate bids for notoriety. The 
indistinct drawing and the omission of detail 
inherent in the great impressionists have been 
made the excuse for and erected into the 
principle of bad drawing. The necessary or 
accidental strangeness of genius has been 
seized upon and made into virtue. Archaism, 
exoticism, naivete, unreality, unrecognizabil- 
ity, and actual ugliness, all have their cults. 
Mere newness and freshness of concept or 
execution have been exalted. Lack of genius, 
talent, or industry, unwillingness to submit to 
rules, the itch for notoriety, the desire for a 
market, have all joined voices in noisily 
avowed contempt for the traditional and 
undying qualities of art. The public, mysti- 
fied and distrustful before the more or less 
incomprehensible product of even the modern 
artist who is endowed with genius and sin- 
cerity, has ended by having added to its 
other emotions disgust at the self-conceit, self- 
assertion, and self -exploitation of quack artist 
and quack critic. 

In thus explaining the breach between pub- 
lic and painting, however, the author of "The 
Appeal of the Picture" does not rail. Mr. 
Tilney 's primary purpose is not to establish 
a theory; his book is neither a satire nor a 
polemic, but a series of twenty-three very 
sober and very sensible and instructive chap- 
ters on such topics as the ordinary reader, 
whether artist or mere picture lover, delights 



in hearing discussed by the expert. These 
are some of his themes: the point of view of 
the public, subject-matter, size as a factor, 
tone, tonal effect, color, composition, realism 
and idealism, naturalism (by which he means 
not the photographic naturalism of literary 
criticism, for which he employs the term 
literalism, but the quality of existing or pos- 
sible reality), mood, feeling, the romantic and 
the picturesque, landscape, impressionism, 
development, quality, mural painting, genre, 
portraiture, background, photography, archa- 
isms, fears and hopes. 

Mr. Tilney is conservative, but temperate. 
He gives due credit to those who have repre- 
sented real progress in painting, opposing 
only the exaggerated claims of the extremists. 
He insists on the essential correctness and 
value of traditional principles. It behooves 
painters to be human like the old masters, he 
says, and to be artists like them also. 

The history of the world teaches us that it is usual 
for apostles of new creeds and starters of new move- 
ments to be over-zealous, as well as for their immedi- 
ate disciples to carry enthusiasm beyond reasonable 
bounds. They will not pause to ask whether the 
principles they are treading down and the styles they 
are throwing over are worth anything for the goodness 
and truth that is in them. Naturally all this causes 
consternation amongst the adherents to old principles ; 
and so it usually happens that a new regime begins 
with a reign of terror. 

And under the cloaking turmoil of a reign of terror 
there are to be found many who commit crimes in the 
name of liberty. They assume the cockade, and under 
the aegis of a veritable tri-colour, pass as being in the 
movement. Without assimilating its matter they make 
a brave show with its manner. Their voice is raised 
in strident tones in order that those who cannot judge 
shall esteem them heroes and yield to them the spoils 
of war. 

To change the metaphor: Impressionism, Pleinair- 
isme and Pointillisme have opened the gates to inca- 
pacity and chicanery. 

Again, speaking of the most recent apostles 
of modernism, against whose "shameless rub- 
bish" "it is an astounding thing that, with 
one or two exceptions, no critics can be found 
who will frankly and fearlessly set their 
faces," Mr. Tilney says: 

Our present revolutionaries have won no support at 
all amongst painters. Their popularity has been a 
thing of newspaper "booming." It has had no real 
life because people have been able to see nothing in it. 
Works which, upon patient examination, yield more 
and more conviction, are those which possess true and 
good principles. 

It is ridiculous to suppose that men who have made 
a life-long study of painting, who have lived always 
in the atmosphere or art and are alive and keen to 
every sign of new life, can be so much surpassed in 
perspicuity by a few untrained men as to miss in 
their works any sign of true life and progress if such 
is there to be seen. It is likewise ridiculous to sup- 
pose that childish and hideous performances can 
possess truths and beauties which the foremost artists 
cannot see, but which two or three dealers and news- 
paper critics can recognize by intuition or revelation. 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



423 



Mr. Tilney insists also on the partnership of 
the people in art. The public, whose ideal of 
beauty has always had a generous share, along 
with the genius of the artist, in the production 
of art expression, is not to be despised and 
scorned. There is health in the demand of 
the public for a transcript of life, in its dis- 
trust and disgust at the substitution of 
strangeness and unreality for the traditional 
language of art. With due regard for the fact 
that the artist must necessarily be in advance 
of the public, it is a safe principle that the art 
which troubles the public is by that very fact 
rendered suspect. "Nothing but man's un- 
troubled joy in art can keep art alive."

THE GROWTH OF 

REPUTATION.* 

The late Professor Lounsbury, whose death 
at the age of seventy-seven occurred a little 
more than a year ago, had won a wide 
reputation as a careful and sound productive 
scholar. His monographs on Cooper, Chaucer, 
and Shakespeare and his writings on the 
English language, although some of them 
expressed views to which his critics could by 
no means assent, were respected as valuable 
contributions to knowledge; and taken alto- 
gether, his career as a public teacher and man 
of letters was honorable and distinguished. 

In his later years, Professor Lounsbury 
became interested in the history of critical 
opinion with respect to Browning and Tenny- 
son. His lectures on Browning's early works, 
published in 1911, were reviewed in THE DIAL 
for Feb. 1, 1912. His far more elaborate 
work on Tennyson, which bade fair to rival 
in bulk his three-volume "Studies in 
Chaucer," was cut short by his lamented 
death. Although he never expected to cover 
the poet's entire career, he hoped to come 
down to the publication of "The Idylls of the 
King." When death overtook him, though he 
had collected much material for the decade of 
the fifties, he had not fully completed his 
remarks on "In Memoriam," and none of the 
chapters had received his final revision. This 
fact must be borne in mind in judging the 
volume before us, which has been very ably 
edited and seen through the press by Professor 
Cross. It is a well printed book of nearly 
seven hundred pages. So well have the editor 
and his associates done their work that only 
rarely is one reminded that the book is to be 
taken not as a finished product but as a torso. 

* THE LIFE AND TIMES op TENNYSON (from 1809 to 1860). 
By Thomas R. Lounsbary. New Haven: Yale University 
Press. 



On nearly every page one finds specimens 
of that pungent and thoroughly characteristic 
humor for which the author was celebrated. 
Professor Lounsbury has expressed himself 
frankly and colloquially, and has not aimed 
at preserving an atmosphere of academic 
frigidity. As a result, he has certainly pro- 
duced a most readable book, on what might 
have been deemed a rather dry subject. 

The task which he set himself was to write 
a literary biography of Lord Tennyson which 
should not supplant but rather supplement 
existing biographical works, chief among 
which, of course, is the memoir by Tennyson's 
son. Specifically, he sought to trace the 
growth of Tennyson's popularity and the 
change of attitude toward him on the part of 
his critics. From the narrative several facts 
become clear. 

The first to be noted is that although Tenny- 
son 's friends worked hard at the outset of his 
career to bring him to the favorable notice of 
the public, their efforts had no appreciable 
effect upon his permanent reputation, which 
his works have earned on their own merits. 

Another is that Tennyson's own morbid 
hypersensitiveness to hostile criticism was one 
of his worst enemies, but for the existence of 
which he might have jumped ten years earlier 
to the position of England's chief poet. Not 
only did unfavorable comment so depress him 
that at times he thought of writing no more, 
but it induced him to commit at least two 
indiscretions, the lines to Christopher North 
and "The New Timon and the Poets." The 
former, if Lounsbury's reasoning is correct, 
recoiled on his head in the malicious review 
in "The Quarterly" for April, 1833, which 
was probably written by Lockhart at the insti- 
gation of Wilson. 

On the other hand, while eager for praise 
and somewhat too easily upset by blame, 
Tennyson, in revising his poetry, was singu- 
larly independent of criticism, especially of 
censure. Indeed, he did not sufficiently, per- 
haps, respect what might be called the vested 
rights of the public; for he sometimes intro- 
duced sweeping changes into a poem after his 
readers had become thoroughly familiar with 
and fond of its first form. Some of these 
changes may have been desirable; others, it 
would seem, were not. 

Again, the steady stream of unfavorable 
criticism which greeted the volumes of 1830 
and 1833, and which continued through almost 
two decades, seems to have had no permanent 
effect upon Tennyson's reputation. This was 
regulated not by the critics but by the public, 
which paid little attention to the critical jour- 
nals. By 1850, Tennyson had become one of 



424 



THE DIAL 



[April 27 



the leading poets, if not the first poet, of 
England; and this triumph both Wilson and 
Lockhart lived to see. 

It has been generally supposed that 
Hallam's death in 1833 paralyzed Tennyson's 
poetical activity for some years. Professor 
Lounsbury finds the case to be otherwise. The 
event did, to be sure, have a disastrous effect 
upon the poet's health; but when that im- 
proved, he wrote as much as ever. Indeed, 
we may suppose from various remarks in the 
earlier parts of "In Memoriam" that in writ- 
ing he found an anodyne. 

A general conclusion to be drawn from 
Tennyson 's life is that contemporary criticism 
of works of the imagination is generally futile. 

There is of course the personal equation which 
leads one man to look with indifference upon what the 
vast majority of men passionately admire. But far 
greater than this is the difficulty that attends hi 
who is compelled to give speedily a fair and just 
judgment of a work which necessarily requires for 
honest appreciation that thorough familiarity which 
is begot of frequent examination and of examination 
in different states of mind. This is true of every 
single poem of any length. But when it comes to 
a collection of short poems, the task of judging be- 
comes infinitely harder. 

Of the scores of reviews of Tennyson's early 
works, very few are worth reading to-day, 
because few critics were able to detach them- 
selves from preconceived notions sufficiently 
to set a proper value upon this new worker in 
poetry. Much, too, of the early criticism was 
mere parrot talk learned from bolder writers. 
The fourth chapter gives us a useful history 
of the critical journalism of the period. The 
two great reviews," The Edinburgh" and "The 
Quarterly," were "mighty powers both in the 
world of literature and of politics." In 1832, 
an article in "The Quarterly" is said to have 
sent stocks down two per cent. In literature 
they made or ruined reputations. Gradually, 
however, their influence was diminished in 
consequence of the appearance of the month- 
lies and the weeklies, of which by 1830 several 
had sprung up. In all of these, moreover, the 
style of criticism was far more vociferous and 
brutal than would be tolerated to-day. It 
was a time when Lockhart in "Blackwood's" 
could speak of "the calm, settled, impertur- 
bable, drivelling idiocy of 'Endymion/ " and 
when the anonymous reviewer (probably 
Christopher North) of Hunt's "Byron" could 
speak of it (March, 1828) as "hypocritical 
twaddle," and of its author as a Freizeland 
Bantam, "the vainest bird that attempts to 
crow" "who to the prating pertness of the 
parrot, the chattering impudence of the mag- 
pie, to say nothing of the mowing malice 
of the monkey adds the hissiness of the bill- 
pointing gander and the gobble-bluster of the 



bubbly-jock," etc. Just why this sort of thing 
was supposed to be more effective than sober 
argument is not clear. Nowadays if critics 
believe all this of an author, they do not write 
forty-five-page reviews on him, but pass him 
over in silence. 

Interesting, too, is the chapter on "Surviv- 
ing Reputations of the Georgian Era." In 
1830, Wordsworth was still highly regarded, 
although his best work had long since been 
done. Circumstances had combined to give 
Byron an immense reputation, and he "was 
still the one whom nearly every youthful 
aspirant for poetic honors took consciously 
or unconsciously as his model." Curiously 
enough, Shelley's reputation was just begin- 
ning. Still later did Keats come to his own. 
It will thus be observed that the growth of 
Tennyson's reputation was synchronous with 
the growth of Keats 's fame a fact that is 
interesting in view of the affinity between the 
two poets. 

Professor Lounsbury has thrown much light 
on the obscurer years of Tennyson's career, 
and his book therefore deserves the careful 
perusal of all students of the Poet Laureate.

RECENT FICTION.* 



It may have been feared from early signs 
that we were to have a very searching time 
with the novels this year. It made the older 
ones among us look back with sombre recol- 
lection to the days when the name "problem 
novel" was invented. The novelists appeared 
to be delving in great depths of thought. 
Life, whether real or not, was very earnest. 
Especially did it seem necessary to consider 
why it should be that two people who had 
promised to love each other till death did 
part, should find themselves unable to do so, 
or else what it was best to do when this was 
the case. Such matters were much in mind; 
and as they had often been in mind before, 
a gloom of conventionality and even tedious- 
ness seemed to be settling down. Such efforts 
are so often made at the expense of the very 
things that make fiction worth while that 
there was real ground for uneasiness. But 
the spring announcements did much to dis- 
sipate this cloud, and it soon appeared that 
life had still a shining face. "Romance, ad- 
venture, mystery" were still possible.

"The Blind Man's Eyes" has all these ele- 
ments, at least it has mystery; and when 
life is mysterious, it is likely also to have 
adventure and romance. I have read no bet- 
ter detective story for a good while. It is 
difficult to write about such a book, because 
it is a shame to give an idea of the story 
beforehand. Of course there are those who 
think it best to read the end of such a story 
first, so as to appreciate better the art by 
which one's interest and curiosity are height- 
ened and carried along. I have no doubt that 
this is a good practice, but it surely ought to 
be a matter of choice. It is not fair to insist 
on telling such things beforehand. One thing, 
however, may be told. This story is of a blind 
man who knew much more than many who 
could see. This seems to me a novel and ingen- 
ious idea, even if it does not reach the 
dignity of a "new note." 

This would be a good place to say some- 
thing of the history of the detective story, if 
only I knew enough. It is very easy to say, 
"'The Blind Man's Eyes' sounds a new note," 
or something of the sort, but one needs con- 
siderable knowledge of literary history to 
determine whether a "note" really is new or 
not. I am sadly ignorant of the history of 
the detective story, and how far it used to be 
considered literary, and whether it used to be 
such as could be read with a preservation of 
intellectual self-respect. I remember that in 
the old pre-Sherlock-Holmes days, most of the 
detective stories (not counting the dime novel 
predecessors of "Old Sleuth," if there were 
any) were French: Gaboriau was the chief 
man at it who is now remembered, though 
there were others. But they were not very 
respectable from the literary standpoint. 
Andrew Lang wrote (in a Ballade of the day) : 
These two have shortened many a mile 
Miss Braddon and Gaboriau. 

There were of course exceptions. Wilkie 
Collins and Charles Beade, as well as the 
delightful Miss Braddon, provided mystery, 
though not always the mysteries of detection. 
It was Mr. Conan Doyle (as he was then) 
who was the Joshua, if not absolutely the 
Moses, of a new and promising land. The idea 
that detection of crime was no esoteric cult, 
but that it was open to all who could detect, 
was wholly in keeping with the democratic 
tendencies of our time. The idea that such 
personal detection was likely to be better 
than the rigid rule-of-thumb officialism was 
also natural to an age which prefers the spirit 
to the letter as does our easy-going, luxurious 
time. The idea that crime was to be detected 
by thinking about it in a logical manner, in- 
stead of listening conveniently at doors or 



sliding panels or wearing false whiskers and 
other disguises, was in keeping with the sin- 
cerity of modern realism. These important 
points had been clearly seen by Poe, but they 
were popularized by the creator of Sherlock 
Holmes with such real literary art that since 
that time the detective story has been a rec- 
ognized form of higher literature. And 
people have been delighted to find that it was 
just as literary to follow absorbedly the way 
a clever burglar uses a red-haired man to get 
into a bank, only to be headed off by a cocaine- 
user sitting at a concert, as it was to be dis- 
turbed about whether one had a right or a 
duty to commit suicide, or to leave one's hus- 
band and children. 

All this is perhaps a little too academic. 
The intellectualist as a detector of crime is, 
of course, not a new figure, but it was certainly 
ingenious to think of a blind intellectualist 
who knew so much more than any one else. 
Then as to the murder. I have always a preju- 
dice against a murder, it seems as though 
there could not possibly be so many mysteri- 
ous murders ; it was certainly not the least of 
the gifts of Conan Doyle to think of so many 
things worth detection beside murders. But 
granted a murder, it was certainly a good 
thing, in this case, for the murdered man to 
come to himself and find out about the crime 
better than anybody else. So Messrs. Mac- 
Harg and Balmer are well started, and once 
started they are quite equal to their oppor- 
tunity. They do not have, as some detective- 
story writers have had, a keen sense of 
character; but there are not many detective 
stories that really do give us much sense of 
reality in persons, now and then one gets 
it, but not often when there are the other 
necessary things, "The Blind Man's Eyes" 
carries its story along with unfailing ingenu- 
ity and resource. 

Mr. Maurice Drake is already known by 
other books which I have not read. "The 
Ocean Sleuth" is a good detective story with 
an additional dash of the sea. Indeed, I sup- 
pose that the sea-story part is more interest- 
ing to Mr. Drake than the rest ; there is more 
gusto in the opening chapters about the 
wrecking-tug, more vigor in the scene at the 
wreck of the liner, than I find afterward. 
Fortunately, Mr. Drake takes his time; and 
though he is bent on detection, he likes quite 
as well to tell of one thing or another as to 
get on with his story. I am sure he has 
plenty of excellent touches that I have missed 
in my haste to find out about the bank notes, 
like Austin's opinion of Anjou Mousseaux 
before and after having seen the young lady 
he had come to Brest to see. This disposition 



426 



THE DIAL 



[April 27 



to dally with his subject is a good thing; a 
whole novel at the intensity of a good detective 
story is a hard thing to read. Conan Doyle's 
long stories do not come up to the shorter ones. 
Mr. Drake was probably cut out for something 
other than a writer of stories of mystery. Not 
that his mystery is not good (it is not a 
murder, which at least shows a step toward 
originality), but better are his glimpses of the 
sea and of the men who sail upon it or knock 
about its shores. When Mr. Voogdt takes a 
pint of beer with uncle or tries to make a 
point out of Peters of Millbay Docks, or cor- 
responds with Aaron Fletcher of S. S. 
"Godwit," I felt rather more at home than 
when he is going around Brest looking for 
hundred franc notes. Everybody will not like 
that sort of thing better, but it has more of 
the touch of life to it. One cannot say even 
now that everyone can write a good detective 
story; it is unfortunately true not only that 
many cannot but that of their number some 
try. But it is also true that fewer still can 
write a story with a touch of real life to it, 
and that is a thing which somehow seems 
better worth doing than the other. So one 
may rather hope that Mr. Maurice Drake will 
keep his mind fixed more on the ocean and 
less on the sleuth. He will be likely to write 
other interesting books on what he happens 
to be thinking about; but a story will prob- 
ably grow out of his experiences with the men 
of the sea quite as easily as it can be thought 
out from a good situation, whether of bank 
notes or something else. 

One is always pretty safe with Mr. E. 
Phillips Oppenheim. It is true that people 
generally say of each new book that of course 
it is not as good as "A Maker of History" or 
whichever of his former novels they read first 
in that golden long ago when they first made 
his acquaintance. But they are generally 
indulgent, too, and before they come to an 
end they are likely to be consoled for their 
disappointment. In "An Amiable Charla- 
tan," Mr. Oppenheim lets his readers down 
easily. He plays with them, it must be ad- 
mitted; I think he is more of an amiable 
charlatan himself than Mr. Bundercombe was. 
Mr. Bundercombe was amiable enough, but he 
was not the kind of person whom I think of 
as a charlatan. Even in his preliminary form, 
he is not that. But charlatan or not, he moves 
in the real Oppenheim world, that strange 
if delightful world in which one spends most 
of one's time at restaurants, sometimes with 
a glass of hock by one's side and a portion of 
the plat du jour before one, and sometimes 
with a more elaborate menu, but always in a 
mood for something to happen. Those won- 



derful restaurants, not of the Hotel Milan 
this time, but Stephano 's ! What a change 
from stiff English country-houses, or stiff 
American houses in town, from our highly 
moral amusements and our dull day-by-day 
life! Such (at least) was the view of that 
charming adventuress so devoted to her 
amiable if criminal father; and while we are 
with Mr. Oppenheim we can understand how 
Mr. Walmsley felt about her, even after he 
had once or twice gone to Scotland Yard with 
her. But Mr. Oppenheim is really too respec- 
table ; he feels too responsible for our morals. 
It is suggested that Shakespeare allowed Mer- 
cutio to perish in the middle of the play 
because he felt unequal to carrying him 
through to the end. I have no such lack of 
confidence in Mr. Oppenheim, but I unhesi- 
tatingly pronounce the first part of the book 
the best. But this sort of talking of course 
gives little idea to those who have not read 
the book, and is not of interest to those who 
have. Mr. Oppenheim really needs no com- 
ment, but only to be passed along. 

After so much that is exciting everybody 
will want a change. Even the intellectual and 
artistic Greeks after a trilogy of tragedies 
liked a change, and used to have satyric plays, 
of which all have been lost. These consisted, 
doubtless, of a crude, probably a coarse, 
humor, which would only have been enjoyable 
after a long day devoted to Prometheus, 
Medea, or (Edipus. After a trilogy of detec- 
tive stories (even ending with Mr. Oppen- 
heim) one should have a change. The best 
thing would be something rather realistic, 
something that would give one the feeling of 
real, if unexciting, life; but failing such for 
the moment, one will do well to read Mr. Tark- 
ington's "Seventeen." To be perfectly frank 
about this book, I should say that it was the 
most dreadful combination I had met with in 
years, but very funny. Probably not even 
Mr. Tarkington would expect that I should 
appreciate it : I am too like Mr. Parcher for 
that, though older even than he was. I rec- 
ognize truth in Mr. Parcher, except that I do 
not believe that he (or any other gentleman 
of or from Indiana) ever retired on a hot 
summer's evening to read "Plutarch's Lives" 
in the library, even to escape a young man of 
seventeen on the piazza talking with a lovely 
girl who used baby talk. But Mr. Parcher 
had arrived at an age when he did not appre- 
ciate youth. "Fathers forget," says Mr. 
Tarkington, and this is certainly true of some 
things, though not always of others, as for 
instance jokes. "Seventeen" is a remarkable 
piece of work. That a man should be able to 
take the elements of boy and girl, little sister,

the collar-button, the youthful poem, the slight 
moustache, make a book from them and offer 
it for sale and yet not only be allowed to live 
but be encouraged seems beyond belief. It 
cannot be doubted that "Seventeen" has 
stirred thousands to inordinate and healthful 
laughter. Some will not laugh so much as 
others, but even these will read the book 
through if only to find out whether there is 
to be a goat eating tomato-cans, and whether 
Mr. Parcher is to put up a stove. Every age 
has its own standards, especially in humor: 
a generation ago "Helen's Babies" was de- 
lightful; before that, "Tom Sawyer." The 
youth of the present do not care for "Tom 
Sawyer," and never heard of "Helen's Ba- 
bies." No one who would understand the 
twentieth century should omit Mr. Tarking- 
ton 's study of current adolescence. It will do 
much to explain the history of our country 
thirty years hence, if we can stick it out

BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS. 

"Many things I have wrote to 
^t money," said Robert Greene 
on his death-bed. His works fill 
thirteen volumes in Grosart's admirable edi- 
tion. He was the most prolific of the Eliza- 
bethan writers, his output including romances, 
framework tales, social pamphlets, prodigal 
son stories, poems, plays, " repentances " ; and 
he was versatile as well as prolific. His lit- 
erary work was done in twelve years, and he 
died at thirty-four. Greene's allusion to the 
" upstart crow . . in his owne conceit the onely 
Shake scene in a countrie " has done more to 
keep his name alive than all the other relics 
of his pen; yet Robert Greene's "many 
things" have more than passing interest for 
the student of his age. An interesting study 
of Robert Greene is to be found in the mono- 
graph by Dr. John Clark Jordan, lately issued 
by the Columbia University Press. It is con- 
scientious and readable. The romances (in- 
cluding the tales), the social pamphlets, and 
the "repentances" are analyzed and studied 
in detail. In the first of these groups, Dr. 
Jordan finds Greene following, with not a few 
borrowings, the taste and the models of the 
hour. In the second group, also with occa- 
sional appropriation of other men's wares, he 
was working in a field somewhat less occupied 
and one obviously attractive to him. As to 
Greene's humanitarian purpose in the conny- 
catching pamphlets, Dr. Jordan does not 
think that we should claim much ; Greene was 
quite as interested in the production of what 



would sell as of what would edify. The two 
aims may have happened sometimes to coin- 
cide. In his discussion of the " repentances," 
also, the author of the thesis is skeptical. The 
earlier pamphlets he considers not autobio- 
graphical but commercial fiction. However, 
while autobiographical inferences must be de- 
rived with caution, there is no need of going 
to the other extreme and denying any reflec- 
tion of actual experience. Of Greene's poetry 
his critic says pithily, that it is best appre- 
ciated when it is " recollected in tranquility." 
Chronologies are included in the text, along 
with a tabulation of the framework tales, 
a discussion of misconceptions concerning 
Greene, and a collection of early allusions to 
the romancer and dramatist. 



Historical 
record* of 
early Illinois. 



Until recent years investigators 
interested in the early history 
of the western United States, 
and especially that of Illinois, have concerned 
themselves with either the period of the 
French influence or that following Clark's 
Kaskaskia expedition. The intervening period 
-1763 to 1778 has been touched only 

i lightly, the attention paid it being by no 
means equal to that which its importance 
merits. During these years the English bus- 
ied themselves with such problems of colonial 
organization as confronted them in the west- 
ern country. Most of these were entirely 
new: the control of the Indians who were as 
hostile to the English as they were favorable 

I to the French, the organization of the fur 
trade, the schemes for colonizing the new 
country, and finally the organization of a 
civil government to take the place of the 
military government. The documents which 
tell this story are scattered in a score of 
places. Some are in print ; others are still in- 
manuscript form. For several years the work 

I of collecting and editing this material has 
been going on under the direction of Mr. 
Clarence W. Alvord, assisted by Mr. Clarence 
E. Carter. The results of their labors are to 
be gathered into five or six volumes known as 
the "British Series" of the "Illinois His- 
torical Collections," published by the Trus- 
tees of the Illinois State Historical Library. 
The first volume Volume X of the " Collec- 
tions " has appeared under the title, " The 
Critical Period," and deals with the years 
1763 to 1765 inclusive. An introduction by 
the editor gives a summary of the history of 
these years. Five hundred pages of documents 
form the body of the substantial volume. 
Such chapter headings as "Organization of 
the Western Territory," " The Proposed Col-

ony of Charlotina," "Accounts from the Illi- 
nois," " The Regulation of Indian Affairs," 
etc., show the scope of the work. If the re- 
maining volumes approach the standard set 
by the first there will be no doubt as to the 
value of the contribution made. Since the 
Illinois country was one of the chief centres 
of activity in the West, the problems which 
confronted the British imperialists here were 
those of the whole region. For this reason 
these documents, although they deal primarily 
with the British in Illinois, will be of the 
greatest assistance to the student who seeks 
information concerning the plans of the En- 
glish statesmen for the organization of the 
empire which they had won from the French. 
In Volume XII of the "Collections," Mr. 
Theodore C. Pease gives a compilation of the 
county records still in existence in the several 
counties of Illinois. As to the value of these 
records as historical material, he says that the 
writer of Illinois history who wishes to do 
work worth while "must explain how on the 
foundation of a French empire in the Missis- 
sippi valley has been built an Anglo-Saxon 
commonwealth how men entered the wilder- 
ness, bought and sold land, dabbled with the 
slavery they had put from them in their con- 
stitution as a forbidden thing, acquired 
wealth and achieved comfort and luxury, 
built roads and established schools, and 
administered a rude justice and a simple gov- 
ernment. In the land records, county com- 
missioners' records, and circuit court records, 
in assessors' books, the probate wills and in- 
ventories, the election returns, and the slavery 
papers that survive in county courthouses is 
the extant material for such a history of Illi- 
nois." Over eight hundred printed pages tell 
in detail the nature of the records and their 
location, and at the same time testify to the 
industry of the compiler of the volume. 



Exercises in 

nimble- 

wittedness. 



Fertile fancy, nimbleness of wit, 
freaks and whims, with an en- 
gaging manner delightfully free 
from conventions and defiant of the charge of 
egoism in its free use of the first person 
singular of the pronoun, abound in the collec- 
tion of short pieces more or less concerned 
with "The Romance of the Commonplace" 
(Bobbs-Merrill), and owing their existence 
to Mr. Gelett Burgess. Not new to print, or 
not all of them new, they are none the less 
good reading, particularly where they verge, 
as they often do, on the autobiographical ; for 
on no subject is anyone so well qualified to 
write as on his own experiences, material and 
spiritual. "I keep no pets," says Mr. Burgess, 



"since these would enforce my keeping regu- 
lar hours; the only familiars I have, there- 
fore, are my clock, my fire and my candles, 
and how companionable these may become one 
does not know who does not live alone. " Even 
living alone, then, has its romance, whatever 
the mountain shepherd may say to the con- 
trary. Fifty short papers, collectively dedi- 
cated to the author's sisters, "with whom this 
philosophy was proven, " make up the book. 



A birfseye Babylon through centuries of 
view of time was little more than an 

abstraction. But the persistent 
and systematic labors of excavators during 
the last twenty-five years have made it an 
astounding reality. Mr. Leonard W. King 
of the British Museum, whose "History of 
Sumer and Akkad" appeared a few years ago, 
now takes up the story in his "History of 
Babylon" (Stokes) where the previous work 
dropped it, namely, where the city of Babylon 
was on the point of securing permanent 
leadership under the West-Semitic Kings. 
The author carries us through the entire 
stretch of history from 2225 B.C. down to the 
Persian conquest in the sixth century B.C. 
The ten chapters of the volume are rather 
uneven in value and method of treatment, 
and, in fact, scarcely accord with the usual 
canons of history-writing. Chapter I states 
the place of Babylon in the history of 
antiquity; chapter II recites in great detail 
the results of German excavations on the site 
of old Babylon for the last two decades. 
Chapter III is a rather intricate chronological 
discussion that should have been relegated to 
an appendix, and its conclusions incorporated 
in the body of the volume. The remaining 
chapters present without much variation the 
regular course of events. Chapter V is espe- 
cially fresh in its discussion of the character- 
istics and influence of the Hammurabi 
period, while chapter VII embodies results 
of the wonderful "finds" at Boghaz-Keui in 
Asia Minor. The appendices are especially 
valuable in that they give us the latest lists 
of kings of the dynasties of Nisin, Larsa, and 
Babylon. The volume is profusely illustrated. 



The history of Vassar College

tion and now put upon the market by the 
Vassar College Bureau of Publication. "The 
Golden Age of Vassar," by Mary Harriott

Norris, is the more interesting if the less 
lively of the two books, for its connected 
account of the starting of Mr. Vassar's "dan- 
gerous experiment toward unsexing women" 
fills in many of the gaps which the "Letters 
from Old-Time Vassar" letters of a student 
in 1869-70 necessarily leave open. Both 
authors emphasize the enthusiasms of the 
early days and minimize their hardships and 
disappointments, or perhaps it would be fairer 
to say that both turn hardships into glories. 
The opposition of "Antis" only strengthened 
the minds of the feminists of those days, an 
eternal truth which might be equally well 
illustrated from to-day's suffrage campaigns. 
The criticisms brought against the curricu- 
lum and life of the pioneer institution only 
made more alert the attitude of its members 
toward it and toward their own purposes in 
supporting it. The amount of endowment, 
which, while considered wildly extravagant 
for its time, was in reality extremely inade- 
quate to meet all needs, stimulated greater 
proportional efforts to increase its total sum 
than those which at this moment are being 
put forth to raise the immediately needed 
million dollar fund. Finally, the simple life 
of the students, with its "mush and milk" 
and its "hash and vinegar" meals, left the 
young women merry and unconventional, 
youthful Stoics who learned willingly to sub- 
ordinate luxury and even comfort to spiritual 
necessity. More books such as these are 
needed in our libraries to vivify with personal 
recollection the annals that, read abstractly, 
tend to give a dreary and bare outline to a ! 
movement actually full of life and color. 



The story of " Fr th ^ Bubble" (Long- 

* restless mans) , by Mr. Maurice A. Har- 

bord. certainly makes no pre- 
tension in its title to any great seriousness of 
style, and in fact its entertaining contents are 
largely anecdotal; but the anecdotes are of 
personal experience, and their abundance and 
variety are astonishing. In quest of change 
and adventure the author has apparently been 
roaming the two hemispheres from the age 
of sixteen to his present maturity, whatever 
that may be, and only pauses long enough 
to write what he calls the first volume of his 
life because of temporary disablement in an 
encounter with an African leopard. From 
clerking in a bank to ranch life in Montana, 
thence to campaigning in South Africa in the 
Boer "War, after that to service in the Trans- 
vaal Town Police, then to farming in Nyanza 
Province these are some of the many bewil- 
dering moves that the reader of the book 



follows as best he may. The author was at 
Ladysmith during the siege, and took part in 
the relief of Maf eking; and everywhere he 
saw, heard about, or was a participant in 
occurrences worth relating. Little of his more 
intimate family history is recorded, but he 
describes himself as "the thirteenth child of 
a family of fifteen" and "raised in the ortho- 
dox English way." His father, a clergyman, 
shipped him off at a rather early age to Sibley, 
Iowa, and there the eventful narrative really 
begins. It is brisk reading, and furthermore 
is well illustrated. 



method, f the making of books on 
in teaching English composition there is no 
end. Still an occasional volume 
stands out from the mass and justifies itself. 
"How the French Boy Learns to Write" 
(Harvard University Press) gives "good 
measure, pressed down, shaken together and 
running over." Professor R. W. Brown of 
Wabash College, starting from the fairly well 
established fact that the average Frenchman 
writes the mother tongue with greater 
accuracy and even distinction than does the 
average American, went to France in 1912 
and devoted the academic year to a study of 
the methods used in the French schools, par- 
ticularly in the primary and secondary 
courses. He found abundant evidence that 
the French boy of high school age writes 
better than the American boy, that he has a 
more highly developed skill in the use of 
words, and a better sense for literature. The 
reasons assigned have the merit of appearing 
more than adequate to the result. The im- 
portant ones are these: The unifying effort 
of the National Department of Education; 
the universal methods of dictation and con- 
scious study of vocabulary ; the superiority of 
the teachers, due to their training, their hon- 
orable social position, their secure future, and 
their leisure for personal growth; and 
greatest of all, the national tradition that 
language, i. e., the mother tongue, is the 
most important thing for a French boy to 
know. The author scores the vagaries in 
American school methods, and remarks 
trenchantly that we "have a national habit 
of taking up a subject or idea, proving its 
absolute importance, and then immediately 
forgetting all about it." This may be a 
prophetic foreboding of the reception of his 
own book of suggestions. Individual teachers 
here and there will profit by it ; but there is 
small chance in our individualistic riot of its 
accomplishing any fundamental reform.

whether anyone but an atheist 
could believe in the infinitely small. Now, in 
the early days of another startling develop- 
ment in mathematics, at least one mathemati- 
cian assures us that the " new infinite " has a 
vital message for the "old theology," and is 
apparently questioning whether anyone can 
believe in the infinitely large without being a 
theist. And just as in the beginnings of 
Hypergeometry spiritualists fancied that they 
discovered in the new science a gateway to the 
supra-rational, so to-day a leading idealistic 
philosopher is convinced that the mathemat- 
ical infinites are quintessentially related to 
the life of the Absolute. But the history of 
mathematics is neutral. The Calculus and 
Hypergeometry progressed irrespective of 
theist, atheist, or mystic; and the theory of 
Transfinites is advancing regardless of theol- 
ogy or metaphysics. This new branch of 
mathematics the arithmetic of infinities of 
distinct and infinite numbers was invented 
and developed by Georg Cantor, of the Uni- 
versity of Halle. Two of his most important 
memoirs, entitled " Contributions to the 
Founding of the Theory of Transfinite Num- 
bers," have been translated into English, 
and supplemented by an excellent historical 
resume, by Mr. P. E. B. Jourdain. The trans- 
lation constitutes the initial volume of " The 
Open Court Series of Classics of Science and 
Philosophy," and sets for the series an unusu- 
ally high standard. 



Little essays 
for the 
millions. 



Seven years ago Dr. Frank 
Crane relinquished the pulpit 
for the pen. Though discharg- 
ing to general satisfaction the duties of pastor 
of a prosperous church, he decided to resign 
his pastorate and risk a hazard of new for- 
tunes. "My position was too secure," he tells 
us. "It was not precarious enough." Ap- 
proaching the half -century mark, he desired 
"to keep young" through the stimulus of a 
little risk and uncertainty as to where the 
daily bread was to come from. Therefore he 
became a writer of sermonettes or brief essays 
for the newspapers, hoping thus to reach a 
larger public than from the pulpit. His ven- 
ture has proved a success, and hundreds of 
thousands of newspaper readers have wel- 
comed his syndicated talks on familiar topics. 
A volume of short essays of this nature now 
comes from his pen, under the title, "Adven- 
tures in Common Se'nse" (Lane), each essay 
being only two or three pages in length, and 
the style admirably adapted to the theme and 
the intended class of readers. The paragraphs 



are of the briefest, and the whole appearance 
of the book appeals to the casual and hurried 
reader. A cheerful philosophy of life, a belief 
in ideals, and a command of terse and forceful 
language, agreeably tinctured with humor and 
enlivened with wit these are conspicuous 
among the book's qualities. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"Readings on the Relation of Government to 
Property and Industry" (Ginn), edited by Pro- 
fessor Samuel P. Orth, is a volume excellently 
adapted to the needs of business men, classes in 
business colleges, and college classes in general. 
The material is definitely and compactly organized 
under the following subjects: the changing con- 
ceptions of property obligations and of govern- 
mental functions; the expanding police power, as 
sanctioned by state and federal courts; the control 
of corporations; and the development of labor 
laws. 

The Country Life movement has gained no little 
headway in the last few years. We now have 
books and magazines about it, lectures to popu- 
larize it, and a national commission to encourage 
it. To its growing literature Dr. Ernest Irving 
Antrim contributes a well-informed little book, 
"Fifty Million Strong, or Our Rural Reserve," 
written with the persuasiveness of one actively 
engaged in furthering the cause and confidently 
hopeful of its signal success. Rural interests and 
all the instrumentalities for their promotion are 
intelligently and clearly discussed. The church, 
the school, the library, the part to be played by 
rural cooperative activities of all sorts, the call to 
leadership in rural upbuilding, the place of recrea- 
tions and amusements in the rural community 
these and other related topics are handled with 
vigor and understanding. (The Pioneer Press, 
Van Wert, Ohio.) 

Expertness in the use of reference-books is an 
accomplishment that has increased in value with 
the decreasing possibility of holding in one's head 
the sum total of human knowledge ; and this expert- 
ness will continue to gain in esteem with the rapid 
future extension of research in all directions. 
Hence the usefulness of such a manual as Miss 
Florence M. Hopkins's "Reference Guides That 
Should be Known, and How to Use Them," pub- 
lished by the Willard Company, of Detroit. 
Designed especially for use in high and normal 
schools, and arranged in eight groups of graded 
lessons, the book is equally serviceable for self- 
instruction or for teaching purposes in library 
training classes or library schools. Filling nearly 
two hundred octavo pages, it is comprehensive and 
detailed within its limits, works in foreign lan- 
guages being beyond its scope. Occasional minor 
errors call for correction in a later edition. Miss 
Hopkins has already shown her aptitude for tasks 
like her present one in her little manual on 
"Allusions," which we have had the pleasure of 
commending.

Mr. Robert Bridges, and many others. 

The next quarterly number of "The Book 
Monthly" will not appear until the beginning of 
October. The paper famine, coming on the top of 
other war difficulties, has made the way of an 
English literary magazine especially hard. Mr. 
James Milne, the editor and proprietor of "The 
Book Monthly," thinks it best frankly to recognize 
this and omit his April-May-June and July- August- 
September numbers. 

Mr. Edward Carpenter's forthcoming volume of 
reminiscences will be entitled "My Days and 
Dreams: Being Autobiographical Notes." The 
notes extend back a quarter of a century, and 
have been gathered under such headings as "Per- 
sonalities," "Trade and Philosophy," "The Story 
of My Books," "University Extension and North- 
ern Towns," and "Sheffield and Socialism." Chap- 
ters are also included on Cambridge and Brighton 
experiences. 

Professor Chester Martin's volume on "Lord 
Selkirk's Work in Canada," which the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press is about to publish in the "Oxford 
Historical and Literary Studies," is offered as a 
measure of tardy appreciation of Selkirk's services, 
even though, in the author's words, "it may not 
restore his name to the place which one may hope 
it would have occupied had his work and life not 
been cut short by a violent and a not very scrupu- 
lous opposition." The story of the Scottish colony 
which he founded in Canada is based on Selkirk's 
own papers. 

One of the features of the forthcoming memoir 
of Alfred Russel Wallace, in two volumes, by Mr. 
James Marchant, is a collection of hitherto unpub- 
lished letters which, in conjunction with the use of 
correspondence from Wallace's autobiography and 
the lives of Darwin and Lyell, tells the story of 
the evolution of the idea of natural selection in the 
scientists' own words. The letters also include 
correspondence with Herbert Spencer, Kingsley, 
Sir Francis Galton, Sir Joseph Hooker, Gladstone, 
and many other celebrities, covering every aspect 
of Wallace's manv-sided interests.

THE DIAL 



[April 27 



An "Introduction to the Study of International 
Relations," announced by Messrs. Macmillan, is a 
volume of papers by various authors, edited by 
Mr. Arthur Greenwood, who has himself con- 
tributed articles on "International Relations and 
the Growth of Freedom," and "International 
Economic Relations." The remaining papers com- 
prise "War and Peace since 1815," by Professor 
A. J. Grant; "The Causes of Modern Wars," by 
Mr. F. F. Urquhart; "Political Relations between 
Advanced and Backward People," by Mr. P. H. 
Kerr; and "International Law," by Mr. J. D. I. 
Hughes. 

A cumulation, in one alphabet, of the contents 
of the annual numbers of the "Readers' Guide to 
Periodical Literature," for 1910-14 inclusive, is 
announced for immediate publication by the H. W. 
Wilson Co. About ninety periodicals are indexed 
by author and subject, and subject references to 
one hundred and sixty-seven composite books are 
included in the same alphabet with the magazine 
references. Magazines added to the "Readers' 
Guide" since 1910 have been carried back to the 
beginning of the five-year period. The subject- 
headings have been thoroughly revised and many 
sub-headings have been added to f acilitate use of so 
great an amount of material. 

At such a time as this, it is a wise and noble 
action of Mr. T. J. Cobden-Sanderson in editing 
and producing an elaborate Doves Press edition of 
Goethe's poems in the original text. In this anthol- 
ogy, which bears the title "Auserlesene Lieder, 
Gedichte, und Balladen: Ein Strauss," the poems 
selected "have been arranged in three principal 
groups, with four interwoven Poems indicative of 
Goethe's attitude to Life, in such a way as to form 
ein Strauss : a nosegay of ' visionary flowers ' hav- 
ing relation in colour and perfume only to one 
another and to the nosegay which collectively they 
compose." The volume will be printed in red and 
black, from the Weimar edition, and will appear 
in July.

Our Chief Magistrate and 
His Powers 

By WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT 

Twenty-seventh President of the United States 

izmo, cloth, pp. vii + 165. Price, $1.50 net 

A notably comprehensive statement of the duties and 
responsibilities of the Chief Executive of the nation 
from the intimate point of view of a President of the 
United States. 

The whole is not only a distinct contribution to 
our actual knowledge of the workings of the govern- 
mental machinery of the Republic and a scholarly an- 
alysis of the functional powers of the President clearly 
and plainly stated, but it is from first to last written 
with the geniality characteristic of its author which 
makes it to a notable extent a personal document 
replete with human interest.

The Martyr's Return 

ByPercivalW. Well* 
One of the greatest literary successes of the age 

"A year or so ago PercivaJ Wells wrote 'The Major of the 
Kettledrum,' a brilliant satire on picayune politics; a work 
which interested discriminating readers all over the coun- 
try. Sow he has appeared in a role other than satirist or 
poet (both of which he has graced heretofore) and in a 
small volume entitled 'The Martyr's Return' he bag dis- 
cussed with keen insight and criticism some of the para- 
mount issues of today." OAKLASD (Cal.) TRIBUNE 
"The work has come out at an opportune time to help 
gu ide national thought Into serious channels. It is worthy 
an hour or two of any loyal American's time.' 1 

PASSAIC HERALD 

Mr. Wells has resorted to a novel method in the conveyance 
of his ideas and one that is unusually impressive."

\yRITERS prof essional or amateur like THE 
T EDITOR, the fortnightly Journal of Infor- 
mation for Literary Workers. THE EDITOR is 
now in its 22nd consecutive year of publication. 
pROM the days when Jack London, Mary Rob- 
erts Rinehart, Peter Clark Macfarlane, Albert 
Bigelow Paine, etc., were unknown aspirants, writ- 
ers have made THE EDITOR a great exchange 
through which they have transferred to one an- 
other the results of their valuable experiences. 
A/TARY Roberts Rinehart has said: "THE 
x EDITOR helped to start me, cheered me 
when I was down, and led me in the straight path 
until I was able to walk alone." 
TACK London has said: "The first number of 
T THE EDITOR I read aroused in me a great 
regret for all my blind waste of energy. I may 
not tell a hundredth part of what I learned from 
THE EDITOR, but I may say that it taught me 
how to solve the stamp and landlady problems." 

IN addition to practical, inspiriting articles on artistic and 
business phases of the art-trade of writing, THE 
E DITOR prints each fortnight news of markets for all kinds 
of literary material.

As a Social and Educational 
Institution 

By WILLYSTINE GOODSELL 

Teachers' College, Columbia University 

To those interested in the status of 
woman, this new book is especially 
rich in data. Not only does it treat 
the economic and social significance of 
the family in primitive and in Greek 
and Roman societies, but it traces its 
development to our own times, touch- 
ing on such modern problems as fam- 
ily limitation, divorce and suffrage and 
the meaning and trend of feminism. 

"The whole book is richly sugges- 
tive. It is. well balanced in tone, being 
neither reactionary nor radical."

Latest HENRY HOLT & COMPANY Books 



CHICAGO POEMS B y CARL SANDBURG 

Just Ready. $1.25 net. 

In his ability to concentrate a whole story, or picture, or character, within the 
compass of a few lines, Mr. Sandburg's work compares favorably with the best 
achievements of the recent successful American poets. It is, however, distinguished 
by its trenchant note of social criticism and by its vision of a better social order. 

These poems show, with a wide variety of theme, the modern metropolis, with its 
brutality and misery, its splendid achievements and unpardonable failures, its garish- 
ness and its beauty. 

Though Chicago furnishes the main motif, the book has many moods. The 
wistful note of beauty is touched no less frequently than the note of well-justified 
bitterness and resentment. It is a composite, expressing the many-sided city with 
genuine feeling and undeniable sincerity. 

"His book is sound, daring, inclusive of many types, and makes a contribution to American 
literature of emancipating influence, and of permanent importance." Edgar Lee Masters.

WITH AMERICANS 

OF PAST AND PRESENT DAYS 

By J. J. JUSSERAND 

The French Ambassador, M. Jusserand, has represented his country at Washington for more than 
thirteen years, so that he is now the dean of the Diplomatic Corps. No one is more sympathetic 
than he with America and American affairs. He rightly wants to signalize his long association and 
friendship with the American people by the publication of a volume dealing with intimate American 
subjects and the relation of Frenchmen to them. He calls it "With Americans of Past and Present 
Days, ' ' and it includes chapters on ' ' Rochambeau and the Revolution, " " L 'Enfant and the Federal 
Capital, " ' ' Washington and the French, " ' ' Abraham Lincoln, ' ' and a literary chapter about Horace 
Howard Furness, the great Shakespearian. It is most fitting that M. Jusserand should at this time 
write of the close affiliation of the American and the French republics. $UO net

With a Preface 
By JOSEPH H. CHOATE 
A study of England's home part 
in the War, of how the different 
classes and different sections are 
cooperating with the men in the 
field, of the attitude of the rich 
and the poor particularly of the 
women, and of the part the women 
are playing ; of the war's effect on 
London, of the prison camps, of the 
use of country houses as hospitals, 
etc. The articles are the result of 
a most searching and intimate study 
of conditions and of the subtler 
effects of the war on every sort of 
activity in the homeland.

On the Overland and 
Other Poems 

By FREDERICK MORTIMER CLAPP 

In this volume Mr. Clapp has shown a remark- 
able feeling for words. His poems create a mood 
in his readers, giving an impression of color tike 
the lustre of pottery. One critic compares him to 
"a futurist in art who really can paint and really 
knows what he is after, if you can imagine 
such a person."

THE HERITAGE 
OF TYRE 

By WILLIAM BROWN MELONEY 

' ' The United States is a vassal on the 
seas when only six and fifty years ago she 
was an enthroned and peerless monarch. 
. . . An opportunity to recover our sea 
heritage stands forth, ... an oppor- 
tunity of half a world at war such an 
opportunity as, in all likelihood will never 
present itself again under similar circum- 
stances. . . . Either we shall seize this 
opportunity forthwith, or else our sea folly 
of the past will continue a hostage to the 
future, to be delivered only, if at all, by the 
edge of a crimson sword." From The Her- 
itage of Tyre. Fifty cents. 

THE PENTECOST 
OF CALAMITY 

By OWEN WISTEE 

Author of "The Virginian," etc. 

"All humanity is in the same boat. The 
passengers multiply, but the boat remains 
the same size. And people who rock the 
boat must be stopped by force. America 
can no more separate itself from the destiny 
of Europe than it can escape the natural 
laws of the universe. . . . Perhaps 
nothing save calamity will teach us what 
Europe is thankful to have learned again 
that some things are worse than war, and 
that you can pay too high a price for peace; 
but that you cannot pay too high for the 
finding and keeping of your own soul." 
From The Pentecost of Calamity. Eighteenth 
printing. Fifty cents. 



THE FORKS OF

By WASHINGTON GLADDEN 

"Our interests are deeply involved in the

deepest feelings stirred by it, but our ideals 
are in the crucible; our institutions are 
under fire; all the great things that this 
nation stands for are to be vindicated or 
discredited by the issues of this conflict. 
. . . We look forward, therefore, to the 
coming Congress of the Nations with the 
deepest solicitude. . . . The question 
for this nation is, what things shall we

THEIR TRUE FAITH 
AND ALLEGIANCE 

By GUSTAVUS OHLINGER 

"True culture demands neither a press 
agent nor a conscious propaganda. . . . 
Viewed in the light of history, the propa- 
ganda of those Germans who are only geo- 
graphically and politically Americans is as 
unnatural as it is pernicious. . . . Un- 
der these influences an American nation 
would be impossible, and without an Ameri- 
can nation the American state would suc- 
cumb to disintegration. ... It is for 
those Germans who fought under Schurz and 
Sigel in the Civil War, to rebuke these false 
prophets and to turn the aspirations of their 
countrymen in the direction of true Ameri- 
can nationalism." From Their True Faith 
and Allegiance.

THE NEGRO IN AMERICAN FICTION. 

Ever since Sydney Smith sneered at Ameri- 
can books a hundred years ago, honest critics 
have asked themselves if the literature of the 
United States was not really open to the 
charge of provincialism. Within the last year 
or two the argument has been very much 
revived; and an English critic, Mr. Edward 
Garnett, writing in "The Atlantic Monthly," 
has pointed out that with our predigested 
ideas and made-to-order fiction we not only 
discourage individual genius but make it pos- 
sible for the multitude to think only such 
thoughts as have passed through a sieve. Our 
most popular novelists, and sometimes our 
most respectable writers, see only the sensa- 
tion that is uppermost for the moment in the 
mind of the crowd, divorce, graft, tainted 
meat or money, and they proceed to cut the 
cloth of their fiction accordingly. Mr. Owen 
Wister, a "regular practitioner" of the novel- 
ist's art, in substance admitting the weight of 
these charges, lays the blame on our crass 
democracy which utterly refuses to do its own 
thinking and which is satisfied only with the 
tinsel and gewgaws and hobbyhorses of litera- 
ture. And no theme has suffered so much 
from the coarseness of the mob-spirit in litera- 
ture as that of the Negro. 

As a matter of fact, the Negro in his prob- 
lems and strivings offers to American writers 
the greatest opportunity that could possibly 
be given them to-day. It is commonly agreed 
that only one other large question, that of the 
relations of capital and labor, is of as much 
interest to the American public ; and even this 
great issue fails to possess quite the appeal 
offered by the Negro from the social stand- 
point. One can only imagine what a Victor 
Hugo, detached and philosophical, would have 
done with such a theme in a novel. When 
we see what actually has been done, how 
often in the guise of fiction a writer has 
preached a sermon or shouted a political creed 
or vented his spleen, we are not exactly 
proud of the art of novel-writing as it has 
been developed in the United States of 
America. Here was opportunity for tragedy, 



446 



THE DIAL 



[May 11 



for comedy, for the subtle portrayal of all the 
relations of man with his fellow man, for faith 
and hope and love and sorrow. And yet, with 
the Civil War fifty years in the distance, not 
one novel or one short story of the first rank 
has found its inspiration in this great theme. 
Instead of such work we have consistently had 
traditional tales, political tracts, and lurid 
melodramas. 

Let us see who have approached the theme, 
and just what they have done with it, for the 
present leaving out of account all efforts put 
forth by Negro writers themselves. 

The names of four exponents of Southern 
life come at once to mind, George W. Cable, 
Joel Chandler Harris, Thomas Nelson Page, 
and Thomas Dixon ; and at once, in their out- 
look and method of work, the first two become 
separate from the last two. Cable and 
Harris have looked toward the past, and have 
embalmed vanished or vanishing types. Mr. 
Page and Mr. Dixon, with their thought on 
the present (though for the most part they 
portray the recent past) , have used the novel 
as a vehicle for political propaganda. 

It was in 1879 that "Old Creole Days" 
evidenced the advent of a new force in Ameri- 
can literature ; and on the basis of this work, 
and of "The Grandissimes" which followed, 
Mr. Cable at once took his place as the fore- 
most portrayer of life in old New Orleans. 
By birth, by temperament, and by training he 
was thoroughly fitted for the task to which 
he set himself. His mother was from New 
England, his father of the stock of colonial 
Virginia; and the stern Puritanism of the 
North was mellowed by the gentler influences 
of the South. Moreover, from his long appren- 
ticeship in newspaper work in New Orleans 
he had received abundantly the knowledge 
and training necessary for his work. Setting 
himself to a study of the Negro of the old 
regime, he made a specialty of the famous 
and infamous quadroon society of Louisi- 
ana of the third and fourth decades of the 
last century. And excellent as was his work, 
turning his face to the past in manner as 
well as in matter, from the very first he raised 
the question propounded by this paper. In 
his earliest volume there was a story entitled 
"'Tite Poulette," the heroine of which was a 
girl amazingly fair, the supposed daughter of 
one Madame John. A young Dutchman fell 
in love with 'Tite Poulette, championed her 
cause at all times, suffered a beating and stab- 



bing for her, and was by her nursed back to 
life and love. In the midst of his perplexity 
about joining himself to a member of another 
race, came the word from Madame John that 
the girl was not her daughter, but the child 
of yellow fever patients whom she had nursed 
until they died, leaving their infant in her 
care. Immediately upon the publication of 
this story, the author received a letter from a 
young woman who had actually lived in very 
much the same situation as that portrayed in 
"'Tite Poulette," telling him that his story 
was not true to life and that he knew it was 
not, for Madame John really was the mother 
of the heroine. Accepting the criticism, 
Mr. Cable set about the composition of 
"Madame Delphine," in which the situation 
is somewhat similar, but in which at the end 
the mother tamely makes a confession to a 
priest. What is the trouble? The artist is 
so bound by circumstance and hemmed in by 
tradition that he simply has not the courage 
to launch out into the deep and work out his 
human problems for himself. Take a repre- 
sentative portrait from "The Grandissimes": 

Clemence had come through ages of African 
savagery, through fires that do not refine, but that 
blunt and blast and blacken and char; starvation, 
gluttony, drunkenness, thirst, drowning, nakedness, 
dirt, fetichism, debauchery, slaughter, pestilence, 
and the rest she was their heiress ; they left her 
the cinders of human feelings. . . She had had 
children of assorted colors had one with her now, 
the black boy that brought the basil to Joseph; 
the others were here and there, some in the 
Grandissime households or field-gangs, some else- 
where within occasional sight, some dead, some not 
accounted for. Husbands like the Samaritan 
woman's. We know she was a constant singer and 
laugher. 

Very brilliant of course; and yet Clemence 
is a relic, not a prophetess. 

Still more of a relic is Uncle Remus. For 
decades now, this charming old Negro has 
been held up to the children of the South as 
the perfect expression of the beauty of life in 
the glorious times "befo' de wah," when 
every Southern gentleman was suckled at the 
bosom of a "black mammy." Why should we 
not occasionally attempt to paint the Negro 
of the new day intelligent, ambitious, 
thrifty, manly ? Perhaps he is not so poetic ; 
but certainly the human element is greater. 

To the school of Cable and Harris belong 
also of course Miss Grace King and Mrs. Ruth 
McEnery Stuart, a thoroughly representative 
piece of work being Mrs. Stuart's "Uncle 



1916]

'Riah's Christmas Eve." Other more popu- 
lar writers of the day, Miss Mary Johnston 
and Miss Ellen Glasgow for instance, attempt 
no special analysis of the Negro. They simply 
take him for granted as an institution that 
always has existed and always will exist, as 
a hewer of wood and drawer of water, from 
the first flush of creation to the sounding of 
the trump of doom. 

But more serious is the tone when we come 
to Thomas Nelson Page and Thomas Dixon. 
We might tarry for a few minutes with Mr. 
Page to listen to more such tales as those of 
Uncle Remus; but we must turn to living 
issues. Times have changed. The grandson 
of Uncle Remus does not feel that he must 
stand with his hat in his hand when he is 
in our presence, and he even presumes to help 
us in the running of our government. This 
will never do; so in "Red Rock" and "The 
Leopard's Spots" it must be shown that he 
should never have been allowed to vote any- 
way, and those honorable gentlemen in the 
Congress of the United States in the year 
1865 did not know at all what they were 
about. Though we are given the characters 
and setting of a novel, the real business is to 
show that the Negro has been the "sentimental 
pet" of the nation all too long. By all means 
let us have an innocent white girl, a burly 
Negro, and a burning at the stake, or the 
story would be incomplete. 

"We have the same thing in "The Clans- 
man," a "drama of fierce revenge." But here 
we are concerned very largely with the black- 
ening of a man's character. Stoneman (Thad- 
deus Stevens very thinly disguised) is himself 
the whole Congress of the United States. He 
is a gambler, and "spends a part of almost 
every night at Hall & Pemberton's Faro 
Place on Pennsylvania Avenue." He is hys- 
terical, "drunk with the joy of a triumphant 
vengeance." "The South is conquered soil," 
he says to the President (a mere figure-head, 
by the way), "I mean to blot it from the 
map." Further: "It is but the justice and 
wisdom of heaven that the Negro shall rule 
the land of his bondage. It is the only solu- 
tion of the race problem. Wait until I put a 
ballot in the hand of every Negro, and a 
bayonet at the breast of every white man from 
the James to the Rio Grande." Stoneman, 
moreover, has a mistress, a mulatto woman, a 
"yellow vampire" who dominates him com- 
pletely. "Senators, representatives, politi- 



cians of low and high degree, artists, 
correspondents, foreign ministers, and cab- 
inet officers hurried to acknowledge their 
fealty to the uncrowned king, and hail the 
strange brown woman who held the keys of 
his house as the first lady of the land." This, 
let us remember, was for some months the 
best-selling book in the United States. A 
slightly altered version of it has very recently 
commanded such prices as were never before 
paid for seats at a moving picture entertain- 
ment; and with "The Traitor" and "The 
Southerner" it represents our most popular 
treatment of the gravest social question in 
American life! "The Clansman" is to Amer- 
ican literature exactly what a Louisiana mob 
is to American democracy. Only too fre- 
quently, of course, the mob represents us all 
too well. 

Turning from the longer works of fiction to 
the short story, I have been interested to see 
how the matter has been dealt with here. For 
purposes of comparison I have selected from 
ten representative periodicals as many dis- 
tinct stories, no one of which was published 
more than ten years ago ; and as these are in 
almost every case those stories that first strike 
the eye in a periodical index, we may assume 
that they are thoroughly typical. The ten 
are: "Shadow," by Harry Stillwell Edwards, 
in the "Century" (December, 1906) ; "Call- 
um's Co 'tin': A Plantation Idyl," by Frank 
H. Sweet, in "The Craftsman" (March, 
1907) ; "His Excellency the Governor," by 
L. M. Cooke, in "Putnam's" (February, 
1908) ; "The Black Drop," by Margaret 
Deland, in "Collier's Weekly" (May 2 and 9, 
1908) ; "Jungle Blood," by Elmore Elliott 
Peake, in "McClure's" (September, 1908) ; 
"The Race-Rioter," by Harris Merton Lyon, 
in the "American" (February, 1910) ; "Sha- 
dow," by Grace MacGowan Cooke and Alice 
MacGowan, in "Everybody's" (March, 1910) ; 
"Abram's Freedom," by Edna Turpin, in the 
"Atlantic" (September, 1912) ; "A Hypo- 
thetical Case," by Norman Duncan, in "Har- 
per's" (June, 1915); and "The Chalk 
Game," by L. B. Yates, in "The Saturday 
Evening Post" (June 5, 1915). For high 
standards of fiction I think we may safely say 
that, all in all, the periodicals here mentioned 
are representative of the best that America 
has to offer. In some cases the story cited 
is the only one on the Negro question that a 
magazine has published within the decade.

THE DIAL 



[May 11 



"Shadow" (in the "Century") is the story 
of a Negro convict who for a robbery com- 
mitted at the age of fourteen was sentenced 
to twenty years of hard labor in the mines of 
Alabama. An accident disabled him, how- 
ever, and prevented his doing the regular 
work for the full period of his imprisonment. 
At twenty he was a hostler, looking forward 
in despair to the fourteen years of confine- 
ment still waiting for him. But the three 
little girls of the prison commissioner visit 
the prison. Shadow performs many little acts 
of kindness for them, and their hearts go 
out to him. They storm the governor and 
the judge for his pardon, and present the 
Negro with his freedom as a Christmas gift. 
The story is not long, but it strikes a note of 
genuine pathos. 

"Callum's Co 'tin'" is concerned with a 
hard-working Negro, a blacksmith, nearly 
forty, who goes courting the girl who called 
at his shop to get a trinket mended for her 
mistress. At first he makes himself ridiculous 
by his finery; later he makes the mistake of 
coming to a crowd of merrymakers in his 
working clothes. More and more, however, 
he storms the heart of the girl, who eventually 
capitulates. From the standpoint simply of 
craftsmanship, the story is an excellent piece 
of work. 

"His Excellency the Governor" deals with 
the custom on Southern plantations of hav- 
ing, in imitation of the white people, a Negro 
"governor" whose duty it was to settle minor 
disputes. At the death of old Uncle Caleb, 
who for years had held this position of 
responsibility, his son Jubal should have been 
the next in order. He was likely to be super- 
seded, however, by loud-mouthed Sambo, 
though urged to assert himself by Maria, his 
wife, an old house-servant who had no desire 
whatever to be defeated for the place of honor 
among the women by Sue, a former field-hand. 
At the meeting where all was to be decided, 
however, Jubal with the aid of his fiddle 
completely confounded his rival and won. 
There are some excellent touches in the story ; 
but, on the whole, the composition is hardly 
more than fair in literary quality. 

"The Black Drop," throughout which we 
see the hand of an experienced writer, ana- 
lyzes the heart of a white boy who is in love 
with a girl who is almost white, and who when 
the test confronts him suffers the tradition 
that binds him to get the better of his heart. 



"But you will still believe that I love you?" 
he asks, ill at ease as they separate. "No, of 
course I can not believe that," replies the 
girl. 

"Jungle Blood" is the story of a simple- 
minded, simple-hearted Negro of gigantic size 
who in a moment of fury kills his pretty wife 
and the white man who has seduced her. The 
tone of the whole may be gleaned from the 
description of Moss Harper's father: "An 
old darky sat drowsing on the stoop. There 
was something ape-like about his long arms, 
his flat, wide-nostriled nose, and the mat of 
gray wool which crept down his forehead to 
within two inches of his eyebrows." 

"The Race-Rioter" sets forth the stand of 
a brave young sheriff to protect his prisoner, 
a Negro boy, accused of the assault and mur- 
der of a little white girl. Hank Egge tries 
by every possible subterfuge to defeat the 
plans of a lynching party, and finally dies 
riddled with bullets as he is defending his 
prisoner. The story is especially remarkable 
for the strong and sympathetic characteriza- 
tion of such contrasting figures as young Egge 
and old Dikeson, the father of the dead girl. 

"Shadow" (in "Everybody's") is a story 
that depends for its force very largely upon 
incident. It studies the friendship of a white 
boy, Ranny, and a black boy, Shadow, a rela- 
tionship that is opposed by both the Northern 
white mother and the ambitious and inde- 
pendent Negro mother. In a fight, Shad 
breaks a collar-bone for Ranny ; later he saves 
him from drowning. In the face of Ranny 's 
white friends, all the harsher side of the prob- 
lem is seen; and yet the human element is 
strong beneath it all. The story, not without 
considerable merit as it is, would have been 
infinitely stronger if the friendship of the two 
boys had been pitched on a higher plane. As 
it is, Shad is very much like a dog following 
his master. 

"Abram's Freedom" is at the same time one 
of the most clever and one of the most pro- 
voking stories with which we have to deal. 
It is a perfect example of how one may walk 
directly up to the light and then deliberately 
turn his back upon it. The story is set just 
before the Civil War. It deals with the love 
of the slave Abram for a free young woman, 
Emmeline. "All his life he had heard and 
used the phrase 'free nigger' as a term of 
contempt. What, then, was this vague feel- 
ing, not definite enough yet to be a wish or 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



449 



even a longing ? " So far, so good. Emmeline 
inspires within her lover the highest ideals 
of manhood, and he becomes a hostler in a 
livery-stable, paying to his master so much 
a year for his freedom. Then comes the 
astounding and forced conclusion. At the 
very moment when, after years of effort, 
Emmeline has helped her husband to gain his 
freedom (and when all the slaves are free as 
a matter of fact by virtue of the Emancipa- 
tion Proclamation), Emmeline, whose husband 
has special reason to be grateful to his former 
master, says to the lady of the house: "Me 
an' Abram ain't got nothin' to do in dis 
worl ' but to wait on you an' master." 

In "A Hypothetical Case" we again see the 
hand of a master-craftsman. Is a white boy 
justified in shooting a Negro who has offended 
him? The white father is not quite at ease, 
quibbles a good deal, but finally says Yes. 
The story, however, makes it clear that the 
Negro did not strike the boy. He was a her- 
mit living on the Florida coast and perfectly 
abased when he met Mercer and his two com- 
panions. When the three boys pursued him 
and finally overtook him, the Negro simply 
held the hands of Mercer until the boy had 
recovered his temper. Mercer in his rage 
really struck himself. 

"The Chalk Game" is the story of a little 
Negro jockey who wins a race in Louisville 
only to be drugged and robbed by some 
"flashlight" Negroes who send him to Chi- 
cago. There he recovers his fortunes by giv- 
ing to a group of gamblers the correct "tip" 
on another race, and he makes his way back to 
Louisville much richer by his visit. Through- 
out the story emphasis is placed upon the 
superstitious element in the Negro race, an 
element readily considered by men who 
believe in luck. 

Of these ten stories, only five strike out 
with even the slightest degree of independ- 
ence. "Shadow" (in the "Century") is not 
a powerful piece of work, but it is written in I 
tender and beautiful spirit. "The Black | 
Drop" is a bold handling of a strong situa- j 
tion. "The Race-Rioter" also rings true, and 
in spite of the tragedy there is optimism in 
this story of a man who is not afraid to do 
his duty. "Shadow" (in "Everybody's") | 
awakens all sorts of discussion, but at least ' 
attempts to deal honestly with a situation that i 
might arise in any neighborhood at any time. | 



"A Hypothetical Case" is the most tense and 
independent story in the list. 

On the other hand, "Callum's Co 'tin'" and 
"His Excellency the Governor," bright com- 
edy though they are, belong after all to the 
school of Uncle Remus. "Jungle Blood" and 
"The Chalk Game" belong to the class that 
always regards the Negro as an animal, a 
minor, a plaything, but never as a man. 
" Abram 's Freedom," exceedingly well writ- 
ten for two-thirds of the way, falls down 
hopelessly at the end. Many old Negroes 
after the Civil War preferred to remain with 
their former masters ; but certainly no young 
woman of the type of Emmeline would sell 
her birthright for a mess of pottage. 

Just there is the point. That the Negro 
is ever to be taken seriously is incomprehen- 
sible to some people. It is the story of "The 
Man that Laughs" over again. The more 
Gwynplaine protests, the more outlandish he 
becomes to the House of Lords. 

We are simply asking that those writers of 
fiction who deal with the Negro shall be thor- 
oughly honest with themselves, and not remain 
forever content to embalm old types and work 
over outworn ideas. Rather should they sift 
the present and forecast the future. But of 
course the editors must be considered. The 
editors must give their readers what the read- 
ers want ; and when we consider the populace, 
of course we have to reckon with the mob. 
And the mob does not find anything very 
attractive about a Negro who is intelligent, 
cultured, manly, and who does not smile. It 
will be observed that in no one of the ten 
stories above mentioned, not even in one of 
the five remarked most favorably, is there a 
Negro of this type. Yet he is obliged to come. 
America has yet to reckon with him. The 
day of Uncle Remus as well as of Uncle Tom 
is over. 

Even now, however, there are signs of bet- 
ter things. Such an artist as Mr. Howells, 
for instance, has once or twice dealt with the 
problem in excellent spirit. Then there is the 
work of the Negro writers themselves. The 
numerous attempts in fiction made by them 
have most frequently been open to the charge 
of crassness already considered; but Paul 
Laurence Dunbar, Charles W. Chesnutt, and 
W. E. Burghardt DuBois have risen above the 
crowd. Mr. Dunbar, of course, was better in 
poetry than in prose. Such a short story as 
"Jimsella," however, exhibited considerable

technique. "The Uncalled" used a living 
topic, treated with only partial success. But 
for the most part, Mr. Dunbar's work looked 
toward the past. Somewhat stronger in prose 
is Mr. Chesnutt. "The Marrow of Tradi- 
tion" is not much more than a political tract, 
and "The Colonel's Dream" contains a good 
deal of preaching; but "The House behind 
the Cedars" is a real novel. Among his short 
stories, "The Bouquet" may be remarked for 
technical excellence, and "The Wife of His 
Youth" for a situation of unusual power. 
Professor DuBois's "The Quest of the Silver 
Fleece" contains at least one strong dramatic 
situation; but the author is a sociologist and 
essayist rather than a novelist. The grand 
epic of the race is yet to be produced. 

Some day we shall work out the problems of 
our great country. Some day we shall not 
have a state government set at defiance, and 
the massacre of Ludlow. Some day our little 
children will not slave in mines and mills, but 
will have some chance at the glory of God's 
creation; and some day the Negro will cease 
to be a problem and become a human being. 
Then, in truth, we shall have the Promised 
Land. But until that day comes let those 
who mould our ideals and set the standards 
of our art in fiction at least be honest with 
themselves and independent. Ignorance we 
may for a time forgive; but a man has only 
himself to blame if he insists on not seeing 
the sunrise in the new day.

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN FRANCE. 



A NOTEWORTHY EDITION OF MONTAIGNE. PERSONAL 
MEMOIRS OF EMILE OLLIVIER. GIFTS TO THE 
COMDIE FRANQAISE. THE LATE MARCEL HEBERT 
AND JOSEPH FABRE. POSTHUMOUS PAPERS op 
STUART MERRILL. "O. HENRY" IN FRANCE. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
The war has interrupted the publication of 
a series of volumes which will be the delight 
of all lovers of Montaigne's essays. During 
the four closing years of his life, the famous 
moralist was engaged in preparing a new 
edition of his great work. His Paris pub- 
lisher, L'Angelier, had sent him a set, in 
sheets, of the latest edition at that time, that 
of 1588 ; and on the margins and between the 
lines of these sheets, the philosopher penned 
numerous additions, modifications, and cor- 
rections, so that when he died in the autumn 
of 1592, the task was about completed, though 



he was unable to issue the new edition which 
he had contemplated. The publishing house 
of Hachette is now engaged in reproducing by 
photo-typography these precious sheets; the 
municipality of Bordeaux, of which town 
Montaigne was a citizen, is paying the 
expense ; and the learned Professor Fortunat 
Strowski, of Paris University, is the respon- 
sible editor. Two volumes had appeared 
before the war broke out, and one more 
remains to be issued, when there will be three 
superb quartos of more than a thousand 
pages, each volume costing 250 francs. 

During a recent sojourn in Bordeaux, I was 
able not only to admire this interesting publi- 
cation, but, through the kindness of the polite 
archivist of the Public Library, M. Jean de 
Maupassant, I was permitted to examine at 
my ease the unique original copy, the very 
pages on which this master-mind labored and 
where all his ways as a thinker and even his 
strong penmanship may be studied in undress. 
When Montaigne died, M. de Maupassant 
tells me, these sheets were deposited by his 
widow with the monks of the convent of the 
Feuillants of Bordeaux, in whose church the 
author was buried. In order the better to 
preserve these loose sheets, the monks handed 
them over to a binder, who did what these 
vandals so often do, trimmed the edges, "in 
order to make a good job," as is always their 
excuse, with the usual result (which was 
almost a crime in this instance) that they 
destroyed many a word or parts of a word, 
and in some places even whole phrases, left by 
the rare pen of Montaigne. 

The appearance of another work, though 
of a quite different nature from that just men- 
tioned, has also been stopped by the war. I 
refer to the proposal to extract from the seven- 
teen volumes of "L 'Empire Liberal" (Paris: 
Gamier, 3 frs. 50 each), by the late Emile 
Ollivier, two volumes of "Personal Memoirs," 
in which would be given all the lighter and 
more anecdotic parts of the more extensive 
publication. Apropos of this undertaking, I 
have received from the widow of the last 
Premier of the Second Empire this history 
of the heavy task in which she participated 
with devotion and intelligence as amanuensis, 
counsellor, and collaborator : 

Immediately after the fall of his ministry, Emile 
Ollivier conceived the design of writing the history of 
the war of 1870, in order to justify his country from 
the calumnies of Germany. With this end in view, he 
made many notes and drew up a memento, which 
recorded hour by hour all the events of the crisis which 
precipitated the conflict. But after the Peace of 
Frankfort, the virulence of his enemies made it im- 
possible for him to get a hearing for the truth and 
convinced him that the moment had not yet come to 
proclaim it. So it was not until 1894, at the age of 



1916]

sixty-nine, that he decided to publish his first volume. 
The plan of the whole enterprise embraced the history 
of the Second Empire from 1848 and the question of 
the Nationalities from 1815. Interrupted several 
times in his labors by fatigue and sickness, he did not 
reach the year 1870 until 1909, when he was eighty, 
and until his subject already filled thirteen volumes. 
It was his intention to end the account with the 
events of September 4, 1870, that is, the advent of 
the present Eepublic. Unfortunately the description 
of the battle of Sedan, which he supposed he had 
written at the very beginning of the undertaking, 
could not be found among his papers after his death, 
and, though he had only sketched the occurrences of 
September 4, the final volume was published by me 
last year as he had directed. 

But there are several instances where the 
war has been the indirect cause of gifts to the 
public art treasures of France. Let me cite 
one example of this which has come under my 
personal notice. M. Jean Jacques Olivier, 
who has written so many beautifully illus- 
trated and learned studies on the French 
stage and who, I may say in passing, may 
lecture in the United States when the peace 
comes, has been prevented by ill health from 
taking any part in the struggle and has been 
forced to seek in Italy a milder climate than 
he could find in Paris. So, to show his love 
for his native land in the hour of her stress, 
he has parted with some of the best objects of 
his collections, and has just presented to the 
Comedie Francaise an oil portrait of the 
famous actor Le Kain (1728-78), by Rosslin, 
and seven gouaches, representing leading 
French actors of the last century in their 
favorite roles, by Fesch and Whirsker, of 
whom M. Olivier writes me as follows: 

Very little is known of these two artists, who were 
born in Bale. They painted on parchment the actors 
of their time, observing in their work the greatest 
accuracy of detail. In their miniatures, costume, 
movement, physiognomy, all are faithfully noted, so 
that their portraits are of great documentary import- 
ance. After depicting the stars of the French and 
Italian operas of Paris, and those of the Comedie 
Franchise, they crossed the Channel and made a whole 
series of portraits of Garrick. These portraits, for 
which the great actor sat, were engraved and pub- 
lished in a volume entitled "Les Grimaces de David 
Garrick. *' 

By the way, in his home on the S. Maurizio, 
Venice, M. Olivier is now engaged in writing 
a monograph on Joseph Caillot and another 
on Mme. Dugagne, "two artists," he tells me, 
"who sum up the history of the Opera 
Comique from 1762 to 1800, that is, the epoch 
of Philidor, Monsigny, Gretry, Dalayrac, etc." 
Among recent deaths in France, I wish to 
speak of at least two, that of the ex- Abbe 
Marcel Hebert and that of Senator Joseph 
Fabre. The first of these was one of those few 
broad-minded priests who have been brave 
enough to break with Rome. William James 
called his book, "Le Pragmatisme" (third 
edition, 1909 'i, "a fairly instructive account"; 



and "Le Divin" he characterized "one of 
the ablest reviews of the general subject of 
religious philosophy which recent years have 
produced." Perhaps the fullest and most 
sympathetic sketch of Hebert 's noble career 
is that given by his old friend, Abbe Albert 
Houtin, "another heretic," one of his critics 
has designated him in his notable book, 
"Histoire du Modernisme Catholique" (Paris; 
1913) . The latter possesses a long series of his 
unpublished letters, which will form the basis 
of a biographical notice of him, "which I shall 
publish when the peace comes," he writes me. 
In the meantime, perhaps the best short 
printed narration of his life, especially the 
literary side, is M. Felix Sartiaux 's little arti- 
cle in the "Mercure de France" for April 1; 
while the following extract from a private 
letter to me from the former Abbe Alfred 
Loisy, professor at the College of France, 
seems to me the most satisfactory unpublished 
eulogy which I have seen : 

With an open mind thirsting for knowledge, de- 
voted by nature, good as the best passages of the 
Evangel, Hebert was a very remarkable educator, who 
inspired a body of young men with large and gener- 
ous ideas. There, probably, is his greatest work, 
though his philosophic, artistic, and archseologie writ- 
ings are of a high value. He was a man of the 
widest culture. Drawn towards the Church by a 
sentiment of lofty idealism, he left the ecclesiastic 
profession without renouncing this ideal to which he 
ever remained faithful. In fact, it may be truly said 
that he took this step in order that he might avail 
himself of this ideal with greater sincerity of purpose. 
A democrat and a socialist without being a party man, 
he loved the people and strove to enlighten them by 
lectures and newspaper articles, in order to lead them 
up towards those heights of the moral ideal without 
which life seemed to him devoid of sense and price. 

In a word, Hebert was one of those supremely 
fine characters who adequately redeem the 
defects of our poor human nature. For 
example, so modest was he that after his 
death, when a Paris periodical wished to give 
his portrait, not a single photograph of him 
could be found even among the members of 
his family. Though not exactly a materialist, 
he felt bound by no sect. He asked that in 
spe ("I die in hope") be engraved on the urn 
which contained his ashes, for (his final 
heresy) he was cremated; and "these words," 
one of his friends remarked, "expressed his 
whole faith." Some of the most liberal and 
most distinguished thinkers of Paris attended 
his funeral, and it was a Monod who spoke at 
his tomb. The charm of his personality was 
extreme. One day in our American Ambu- 
lance at Neuilly, I was attending a wounded 
youth who had sat under Hebert 's teachings, 
for during many years he was at the head of 
a famous priests' school at Paris, and who 
said to me with a full heart when he learned 



452

[May 11 



of "the dear master's death," that "thoughts 
of him and of his precepts were the consola- 
tion of my cravings for the spiritual when I 
was in the nightmare of the trenches. " Finally, 
he was the author of a half dozen or more able 
philosophical and religious volumes, and his 
great hero was Joan of Arc, "whom the 
Church slew and then resurrected." 

But it was Joseph Fabre who was the 
modern French warden of the Maid of 
Orleans. Like Hebert, Fabre was one of those 
emancipated philosophical minds who have 
always been the charm of France and who 
know no sects or conventionalities. His ardent 
republicanism, his thirst to understand our 
American system, and his admiration for 
Washington (he devoted a volume to him, 
perhaps two) and others of our really great 
public men, drew him closely to those few 
Americans perhaps, indeed, I was the only 
one who crossed his modest threshold in 
the shadows of the stately trees of the 
Versailles park. The dominant passion of the 
intellectual life of this humble son of the 
French peasantry his plain big-hearted old 
mother understood French but spoke only the 
patois of the Aveyron was the glorification 
of his sister peasant of Domremy. Early in 
his career he began to write about her; he 
lectured about her; he introduced bills into 
Parliament, where he had been both deputy 
and senator, about her; and if the Catholic 
Church now fetes her memory each year in 
Paris, though in a spirit quite contrary to that 
which he inculcated, it is indirectly due to his 
propaganda. This veritable cult for "the 
saint of Rouen" culminated in a sort of mod- 
ern miracle-play, a musical-dramatic tragedy, 
which was given on two different occasions on 
the Paris stage in two different forms, and in 
fact was almost reproduced also at New York, 
the late Augustin Daly having once entered 
into negotiations with the author with this end 
in view, "for Ada Rehan is obsessed with the 
idea of portraying Joan of Arc." The affair 
finally fell through, but just for what reason 
I have forgotten, and the American public 
missed seeing and applauding a beautifully 
idealistic, a highly artistic, and a deeply patri- 
otic piece. I may add that M. Joseph Hild, 
a distinguished member of the Paris bar and a 
warm friend of the late Senator, is now 
engaged in assorting his papers, and informs 
me that here too we may expect an interesting 
biographical memoir in due season. 

A similar pious act is being performed with 
the papers of the late Stuart Merrill by his 
friends, M. Ferdinand Herold and M. Albert 
Mockel, the well-known Paris litterateurs. 
The latter writes me : 



I have nearly finished drawing up the bibliography 
of the poet's posthumous works, which I mean to 
publish, along with my study of him which appeared 
in the Mercure de France immediately after his death, 
in a small volume, where you will find, I think, the 
most interesting things to be a series of translation 
of poems in French prose not included in his " Pastels 
in Prose," some of which, though unsigned, are by 
Merrill himself, as I have just discovered. Then 
there is a translation in verse of a series of French 
poems and a translation in French of one of James 
Thomson's poems. 

But the fame of another American man of 
letters who was far nearer being a genius than 
was Merrill has never, oddly enough, come 
within the ken of literary France. I refer to 
Sydney Porter. By way of explanation of 
this remark, I should state that Professor 
Alphonso Smith, of the University of Virginia, 
is preparing a biography of "0. Henry" which 
will be ready for the press in the early 
autumn. I understand that it will be a rather 
complete exposition of the formative influences 
that entered into the life and work of this 
brilliant story-teller during his early years in 
North Carolina, together with a detailed study 
of the form and content of his writings. "He 
and I were intimate boyhood chums," 
Professor Smith once said to me, "and I find 
myself interested more than I can say in this 
development of a youthful genius whom 
everybody loved in his early years and whose 
memory we cherish with the utmost regard 
and affection." This forthcoming book, and 
Professor Smith's enthusiasm for his friend, 
led me to reflect on the fact indeed, I asked 
myself if it was a fact that "0. Henry" 
was utterly unknown in France, though the 
Paris National Library has on its shelves ten 
volumes of his fiction, one of which curiously 
enough appears to have reached its final rest- 
ing place through the French dead-letter 
office. The other nine, I am assured, though 
I am tempted to question the correctness of 
this assertion, were bought by the library. 
When I expressed surprise that the very 
limited resources of this institution should be 
spent on an author so little appreciated, one 
of the librarians made this reply: "If 0. 
Henry is not very well known in France, he 
deserves to be. We saw in the ' Encyclopaedia 
Britannica,' which contains annual supple- 
ments of literary criticisms, that this author 
stood very high in America. So we thought it 
would be interesting to enrich our collections 
by adding thereto his works; hence these 
purchases." But lest my own observations 
should be at fault, I have turned to several of 
my French literary friends, and I find that 
their opinion on this matter agrees exactly 
with my own. Thus, M. Schalck de la Faverie, 
of the National Library, says: "As far as I 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



453 



am aware, this author is unknown in France" ; 1 
while M. Henry D. Davray, the critic for 
English books of the ^Mercure de France," 
is even more pronounced in his statement: "I 
do not know anything about O. Henry, have 
never seen any study of his work, or heard j 
of any of his stories being translated into our j 
language. " The National Library also records j 
the fact that none of "0. Henry's" stories has ' 
been translated and published in book form 
in France. I say translated and published, \ 
for I chance to know that one has been trans- ; 
lated ; and hereby hangs a rather curious tale. [ 

The French translation rights of "'Mr. \ 
Valentine's New Profession," first printed in 
September 1903, in "The London Magazine," j 
were sold in June, 1909, to Mr. A. Foulcher, ; 
a French civil engineer, with literary tastes 
and a perfect knowledge of our language, who 
is now in the army. He writes me as follows j 
from Lyons, where he is at present stationed: 

"Mr. Valentine's New Profession," the only thing 
of O. Henry's I ever translated, has a rather queer 
history in so far as I am concerned. I sent the 
manuscript to several periodicals, all of which declined ! 
it. But it suited the taste of a clever but not over- j 
scrupulous well-known writer who made a scenic j 
adaptation of it, of course without my consent or even I 
knowledge; so that some five or six years ago, enter- 
ing by chance the Vaudeville one fine evening, I had 
the pleasure of assisting at the performance of Mr. ' 
Valentine's feats in which of course I found neither '. 
glory nor profits. Mr. Valentine had once more 
changed his name, but he was the same man and 
played the same trick on the safe.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE HOUSE OF HARPER'S REMOVAL FROM FRANK- 
LIN SQUARE in the near future, as announced by 
that century-old publishing house, will be an event 
of importance in the publishing world. It will 
be a centennial event, if it falls within the next 
calendar year, for it was in 1817 that the firm of 
J. & J. Harper first started in business in a little 
Dover-Street room not far from the present estab- j 
lishment bearing the Harper name. Fulton Street, j 
Pearl Street, and Cliff Street were successively the 
scenes of these publishing activities of the Har- j 
pers, and the building now occupied by the firm j 
dates from 1854, when, in consequence of a disas- j 
trous fire in December, 1853, work was started i 
upon a fire-proof and up-to-date building, large I 
enough for years of future growth, and as per- j 
fectly equipped as it was then possible to make it. 
For a brief moment, but no longer, the burnt-out 
partners had considered the advisability of not | 
trying to imitate the phoenix, of abandoning the 
plan of rising from their ashes, of retiring on their 
already considerable fortune; then they were 
reminded of their sons and their sons' sons, and 
of the still remoter posterity to whom they owed 



it to hand on the business, and rebuilding began. 
A notable fact is it, in this connection, that not 
one member of the Harper family is to-day prom- 
inent in the management of the business. At least, 
no Harper is on the present Board of Directors. 
Up-town this old publishing house will move, like 
so many other similar firms within the last quarter- 
century, and the historic building in the square 
named, not from Benjamin Franklin, but from 
the merchant Walter Franklin, will echo no more 
to the tread of Mr. Henry Mills Alden, of Mr. 
William Dean Howells, of Colonel George Harvey, 
and of all the others who have for many or fewer 
years contributed to the success of the House of 
Harper. For further details of the firm's his- 
tory the reader is referred to the rich volume of 
memories and anecdotes put forth four years ago 
by Mr. J. Henry Harper under the title, "The 

House of Harper." 



A FAMOUS OLD DRAMATIC COMPANY, the Comedie 
Franchise, which had its beginning in the Theatre 
de 1'Hotel Bourgogne (founded in 1552) and has 
even since, with a brief interruption in 1793, con- 
tributed to the amusement of Parisian play-goers, 
is said to be contemplating a visit to this country 
next season. Never before has the company gone 
on tour outside its native France, it is affirmed in 
emphasis of the importance and the high honor to 
us of the projected departure from custom. The 
Comedie Franchise is in effect a national institu- 
tion, receiving an annual subsidy from the govern- 
ment and controlled by a governing board which in 
turn is supervised by government officials. Con- 
sequently its coming to our shores will be regarded 
as something akin to a national expression of 
friendship toward a sister republic. From indi- 
vidual members of this aggregation of talented 
actors we have had not a few visits, notably from 
Mounet-Sully, Coquelin, and Madame Sarah Bern- 
hardt (but only after the tetter's early severance 
of relations with the company). Though 1552 is 
given above as the date of the company's birth, it 
was not until 1680 that it assumed something of 
its present character, with royal recognition and 
a sounding name, "L'Hotel des Comediens du Roi 
entretenus par Sa Majeste." Nine years later it 
became the "Comedie Franchise," which it has 
since remained, though often referred to as the 
"Theatre Fran?ais," since this historic playhouse 
(almost destroyed by fire eight years ago) is its 
home. 



A PHILOLOGIST AND MORE THAN A PHILOLOGIST, 

a scholar keenly appreciative of the niceties of 
speech, especially in their literary application, and 
a noted teacher of the subjects that so deeply inter- 
ested him, died suddenly at Washington, D. C., 
April 18. Professor James Morgan Hart, to 
whom reference is here made, has left to the world 
one book that deserves to rank among the more 
notable examples of personal reminiscence: it is 
his account of his German-student days at Gb't- 
tingen, an inspiring narrative that has turned the 
steps of many a candidate for a degree made in 
Germany toward the old Hanoverian town famous

for its university and its sausages. After reading 
this book ("German Universities") any one inter- 
ested in the writer, his character and his achieve- 
ments, would do well to open next Mr. George 
Haven Putnam's "Memories of My Youth" at the 
ninth chapter, where is given an entertaining 
account of the young Princeton graduate as 
viewed in the intimacy existing between room- 
mates in a strange land. Though a student of 
jurisprudence at that time, Hart soon transferred 
his affections to more liberal studies, and four 
years after winning his doctorate (J.U.D.) at 
Gottingen was teaching modern languages at Cor- 
nell. A little later he taught these and also 
English literature at the University of Cincinnati. 
In 1890 he was appointed to the chair of English 
language and literature at Cornell, in 1907 was 
made professor emeritus, and was still a resident 
of Ithaca when death overtook him in the southern 
city where he had been spending the past winter. 
Among his published works are "Essentials of 
Prose Composition," "Standard English Speech in 
Outline," and various German texts and other 
books edited or translated by him. He was born 
Nov. 2, 1839, at Princeton, N. J., where he received 
his A.B. in 1860, his A.M. three years later, also 
his L.H.D. in 1900. 



THE BLUE PENCIL Is a small implement, but its 
office is not a despicable one. Perhaps it even 
deserves to rank with the "very small helm" that 
turns the big ship, and with the "little member" 
that nevertheless "boasteth great things." As a 
ready and effective means of emphasis, a useful 
instrument for arresting a reader's attention, it is 
beyond praise. When your friend in a distant 
city sends you a newspaper containing some para- 
graph or short article he wishes you to read, how 
difficult it is to find this paragraph or article if 
it be only slightly marked with a hard lead pencil, 
as it commonly is. But if with one bold stroke 
of blue your friend has indicated what you are 
to read, how quickly that passage leaps to the 
eye! Reports of learned and other institutions, 
with many like pamphlets and documents, come 
to our desk with no helpful, time-saving blue- 
pencillings to show at a glance the significant 
features on which our comment is invited. Other 
reports and pamphlets and similar documents there 
are, far fewer in number, that come with careful 
markings of indigo hue to lighten the examiner's 
task. Latest among these judiciously marked pub- 
lications is the Twelfth Annual Report of the 
Waterloo (Iowa) Public Library. Waterloo is 
not a large city, and its library might not be con- 
sidered especially important among the hundreds, 
if not thousands, of libraries to which we should 
be glad to call attention if our space were unlim- 
ited; but with a few notable items made conspicu- 
ous in blue how can one refuse to recognize their 
significance? For example, Waterloo readers are 
awaking to the fact that there are interesting books 
outside the fiction class. They have borrowed, in 
the last year, nearly seven thousand more serious 
works and nearly three thousand five hundred 
fewer novels than the year before. There was a 



considerable gain in total circulation far greater 
than the increase of books on the shelves, which 
is much more creditable than would have been the 
reverse. Reference-room work seems to have 
increased by about one-half. Our thanks to Miss 
Brace and her blue pencil! 

POST- VICTORIAN LITERARY ANTICS are amusingly 
exhibited to view in "The End of a Chapter" 
(elsewhere noticed more fully) by Mr. Shane 
Leslie, who gravely declares that he has "witnessed 
the suicide of the civilization called Christian" 
and dedicates his book "to the memory of those 
who have died before the next chapter has begun." 
After Victoria the literature of her realm "passed 
from an Augustan age straight to that of brass. 
There was no intermediary age of silver." It was 
typical of this decadence, Mr. Leslie says, that 
after 1900 everybody pretended to have read Mr. 
George Moore, whom before that date everybody 
pretended not to have read. Under King Edward 
"Browning and Tennyson were dismissed as grand- 
motherly. The latter was sent to Coventry and 
the former to Boston. Swinburne was hailed as 
the only poet of his era, about twenty years after 
he had ceased to write good poetry." Mr. Ches- 
terton came and in a scintillant but irritating style 
"smilingly stood Truth upon her head to explain 
the Universal Antipodes in which we all have our 
being." Mr. Bernard Shaw "may have had an 
artistic and a dramatic message to deliver, but he 
could not forego the cheapest advertisement of the 
prophet." But his vogue "endured until the futur- 
ists swept into undisputed mastery of the powers 
of topsyturvydom." In one pungent paragraph 
the author describes how, with the opening of the 
new century, "there was a cry for something 
wilder than Scott, for something more gloomy than 
the Brontes, for something more sexual than 
George Eliot. Dickens and Miss Austen were as 
forgotten as the Pentateuch. Even novelists who 
had begun writing in the Victorian age developed 
new and unexpected methods. Wells poured the 
laboratory, and George Moore the lavatory, into 
their books." Perhaps a sufficient note on all this 
is that it was written or at least conceived in the 
atmosphere of a military hospital, the writer being 
one of the victims of the Great War. 



LANGUAGE-MAKING IN THE TRENCHES is one of 
the few purely intellectual and unsanguinary activ- 
ities now going on at the battle-front. As was to 
have been expected, the Trench have shown them- 
selves most expert and nimble-witted at this exer- 
cise, though the English Tommies are not far 
behind. The busy Berthas and Jack Johnsons, the 
whizz-bangs, crumps, and Archibalds have been 
made famous by the latter. A London "Evening 
Standard" writer calls attention to a number of 
ingenious and amusing French terms facetiously 
expressive of grim realities in trench warfare. To 
the "poilu," or unshaven warrior of necessarily 
rare recourse to the barber, his bayonet is, in 
expressive slang which we here translate, a turn- 
spit, also a knitting-needle; and in his sentimental

moods he calls it Rosalie. The bullets with which 
he feeds his rifle are styled sometimes chestnuts, 
sometimes plums. Flower-pot is the term for his 
cap, and the head it covers is a lemon ( citron ). 
When he runs (never away from the fight, of 
course) he "knits his legs"; and when coffee is 
served out to him he calls it juice. The regimental 
tailor is a prick-thumb, and the colonel is, fami- 
liarly, the colo. The now well-known term, Boche, 
which the Germans themselves have gravely 
decided, after a trial by court-martial, to be 
expressive of derision and contempt, the writer 
here quoted regards as apparently a "back-slang" 
corruption of Schwob, the Alsatian's colloquial 
designation for his German master. There was an 
old variation, "Alboche," which may have been a 
similar reversed corruption of "Schwalbe." In 
much of this language-making is to be seen the 
same euphemistic tendency that caused the ancient 
Greeks to call the Furies the Eumenides (the gra- 
cious ones), and to propitiate the powers of dark- 
ness with flattering names. Autres temps, autres 
masurs, but ever the same human nature at bottom. 



HOW ONE LIBRARY DISPOSES OF ITS OUTWORN 

BOOKS is explained by the Cedar Rapids librarian 
in her current Report, and her account may be use- 
fully suggestive to others. Discarded literature of 
all sorts, both books and duplicate magazines, she 
sends to the local jail, where the police matron 
takes it in charge and distributes it among the occu- 
pants of the institution, "that they may read 
during their confinement. This is a harmless occu- 
pation, and it is much better than for these 
unfortunates to brood over their condition and 
become embittered." "Well said; and one cannot but 
hope that now and then some well-chosen book 
may help the reader to persuade himself, with 
Lovelace, that stone walls do not a prison make, 
nor iron bars a cage, though he may lack the inno- 
cent and quiet mind of the poet. It is significant 
that volunteer workers among the millions of war 
prisoners now eating the bread of enforced idleness 
report that one of the most pressing demands on 
the part of these millions is for food for the mind 
rather than for the body. Magazines, newspapers, 
almost anything cheerfully distracting in the way 
of reading matter, they eagerly welcome. Un- 
doubtedly the Y. M. C. A. organization that is now 
active in this prison work could make good use of 
much more literature of a suitable kind than it has 
at its disposal. 



MORTALITY AMONG MAGAZINES is so great that it 
might be supposed to discourage any and all 
attempts to start new ventures in this field in the 
future. But it will not. "Live and learn" is the 
rule in magazine-making as elsewhere. Mr. Mac- 
regor Jenkins, publisher of "The Atlantic 
Monthly," recently told the members of the 
Woman's Club of Englewood, N. J.. some rather 
startling facts concerning magazine-publishing. 
Less than a year ago there were in this country 
3,410 magazines enjoying a more or less assured 
existence, though very few of them having any- 
thing like a nation-wide circulation : and to-day 



there are but 2,700. Encouraging is his assertion 
that the oldest survivors are those that make a 
determined effort to give their readers the best 
that is to be had in current literature. That the 
magazine's fate depends pre-eminently on the occu- 
pant of its editorial chair is not surprising, though 
how few readers ever give a thought to that usually 
anonymous and very seldom conspicuously prom- 
inent person! What mountains of unreadable 
trash he and his assistants must have to plough 
through, in some fashion, and keep from working 
the ruin of the magazine for whose pages it is 
fatuously intended! Among rejected contribu- 
tions exhibited by Mr. Jenkins as specimens of 
this sort of trash were "An Ode to a Cold Pan- 
cake," "Little Willie Went Fishing," and other 
productions, illiterate and nonsensical to a degree 
that passes belief. Their admission to any maga- 
zine would speedily raise the already high rate of 
magazine mortality. 



"JOY-READING" has a far higher standing in our 
vocabulary than "joy-riding." In the latest Report 
of the New York State Library, Mr. Sherman 
Williams, of the School Libraries Division, uses 
the term to good purpose in commenting on the 
defects in literature-teaching as noted by many 
observers. Too much pedantry, too much dissec- 
tion of literary masterpieces, too much of formal 
examination at stated times, and too little of "joy- 
reading" that, in -brief , is the ailment afflicting 
literature-teaching in high schools, and elsewhere. 
Pupils from homes where the reading of good 
books is as much a matter of course as the eating 
of good food have more of literary culture at the 
very outset of their high-school training than 
others can show at the end. "A formal examina- 
tion in literature," remarks Mr. Williams, "is the 
best possible way to make a child dislike literature. 
It has been very effective for a long series of years. 
Is it not time to try something else? Let them 
read and read read extensively and about what 
they will guiding them by suggestion rather than 
direction." And he points out that high-school 
libraries are too largely composed of books for 
mature readers; they should have more books that 
are a joy and delight to the normal growing lad 
and ripening young woman. The "joy-reader" 
will go farther and profit more in an hour than 
the heavy-hearted reader under compulsion in a 

year, or a century. 



THE REAL DAVID GRAYSON has at last been found 
to be Mr. Ray Stannard Baker, not a peaceful 
agriculturist at all, but a very energetic, even 
aggressive, journalist, magazinist, investigator of 
social conditions, and prolific author of various 
kinds of books. The only touch of similarity with 
David Grayson that one discovers in Mr. Baker's 
biography is noted in the fact that agricultural 
studies were at one period of early life his chief 
interest. He was graduated from the Michigan 
Agricultural College in 1889 at the age of nine- 
teen. After that he took a partial law course and 
pursued literary studies at the University of Mich- 
igan. Newspaper work in Chicago soon followed,

then magazine editorship under Mr. McClure in 
New York, and since 1906 he has been one of the 
owners and editors of "The American Magazine." 
A wide range of talents is exhibited by his half- 
score or more books, from "The Boys' Book of 
Inventions" and "Our New Prosperity" to "Adven- 
tures in Contentment" and "The Friendly Road." 
The Grayson sketches, it appears, started as recre- 
ational note-book jottings in the intervals between 
strenuous days of study in the evils of our social 
and industrial life. Pressed for matter to fill the 
pages of the magazine which he, with others, had 
taken control of, he brought out his note-book 
and threw some of its contents into shape for pub- 
lication, under the pseudonym of "David Gray- 
son." Their success was a surprise to him, but 
not to his readers. 



A NOTE ON NEW FICTION, on the demand for it 
in comparison with the steady call for the old story- 
tellers, and on the amount of money spent in its 
purchase, catches the eye in Librarian Hill's record 
of a year's activity at the Brooklyn Public Library. 
After speaking of the proper place filled by novels 
in the people's free library, notwithstanding certain 
recent objections, he reports that in the library 
under his superintendence "the sum of $95,003 was 
spent for books in 1915, and of this amount only 
seven per cent, was for new fiction issued within a 
year. The circulation of all fiction was 3,977,998, 
of which about nine per cent, represented novels 
published within a year." Exceptional and inter- 
esting is this presentation of a comparative record 
of old and new fiction circulation. If all library 
statistics were equally detailed in this particular, it 
might be possible to draw some instructive general 
conclusions, either encouraging or discouraging. 
But at the same time it would be necessary to know 
how liberal the institution in question had been in 
offering current fiction to its patrons, how great the 
temptation it had held out to forsake the approved 
romancers of the past for the untried or little-tried 
novelists of the present. 

LITERARY RARITIES TURNED TO CHARITABLE USES, 
the pen employed to heal the wounds of the sword 
such is the spectacle now beheld, if recent 
reports from London are to be credited, in the sale 
of certain valuable manuscripts and books in aid 
of the British Red Cross Society and the Order 
of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem in Egypt. 
"A Christmas Garland," by Mr. Max Beerbohm, 
with caricatures of the subject of each chapter 
from the same hand, was among the more notable 
items sold under the hammer at Christie's. With 
caricature portraits of such celebrities as Mr. 
Chesterton, Mr. Kipling, Mr. Shaw, and George 
Meredith there was left a blank page for similar 
treatment of Mr. Henry James "pending ful- 
filment of our hope that health and activity will 
yet be given back to the consummate [artist] and 
well-beloved man whose work is here parodied." 
This clever work was presented by its artificer. 
The Marquis of Crew gave Lord Byron's copy of 
"Plini Panegyricus" with his signature, "Byron, 
Trin. Col. 1808." There were also a first edition 



of Dickens's "Christmas Carol," with illustrations 
by Leech and a letter by the author; a first edition 
of Blake's "Vision of the Daughters of Albion," 
with eleven plates; a copy on vellum of the "Horae 
Veatffi Maria? Virginis," and other works precious 
in the collector's eyes. Good prices were obtained. 

DRY STATISTICS, in a peculiar sense of the adjec- 
tive, come to us from far-away Puget Sound. The 
city of Seattle, while the State of Washington was 
still a "wet" state in the colloquial signification of 
the term, was able each year to devote about 
$45,000 from license fees to the circulation of good 
literature among its citizens. In other words, its 
public library profited to that extent from the 
indulgence in liquid refreshment of an intoxicating 
nature on the part of those within its gates (or a 
fraction of them). Last year, with Washington 
enrolled among the "dry" states, the entire receipts 
for library uses from "licenses, fines, and fees" 
amounted to less than half as much, or $21,531.55. 
That is, with the closing of the saloons and, in 
consequence, a presumably greater resort to the 
library and its branches on the part of those for- 
merly lured in other directions, the means for 
ministering to their needs as information-seeking, 
book-reading, or only magazine-reading and news- 
paper-browsing members of the body politic, 
become materially diminished. This anomaly, the 
partial dependence of the public library in many 
cities on liquor-license fees and police-court fines, 
has been commented on before in these columns, 
and it is likely to be commented on again before it 
ceases to exist. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



WAS "SHAKSPERE" " SHAKE-SPEARE " ? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Recently Baconians a term of convenience 
(like Mr. Greenwood's "Dryasdusts" for everybody 
who insists on facts and logic) that I shall apply 
to all the different varieties of anti-Stratfordeans, 
e.g., Baconians proper, Raleighans, Stanleyites, 
Rutlanders, Marlowites, etc., have made it a 
strong argument against the Stratfordean's claim to 
the paternity of the plays and poems attributed to 
him by the saner portion of mankind that his 
surname is not the same as that of the London 
poet. They assert, vehemently and without any 
facts to support their assertions, that the unknown 
Londoner, whoever he was, wrote under the pseudo- 
nym Shake-speare or Shakespeare and was almost 
always thus referred to, whereas the Stratfordean 
actor's and money-lender's name was always 
written Shakspere, Shaxberd, Shackespur, or in 
some similarly shortened form, without a hyphen 
between the two syllables, without an e after the k, 
and, above all, without an a in the second syllable, 
and that these two names were not even pronounced 
alike. As Mr. Fraser puts it, "these names were 
vocally and etymologically different." Do the 
known facts concerning the Shakespeare surname 
justify these bold assertions? If they do, we have

all these years worshipped at the wrong shrine and 
our tercentenary celebration is a mockery. 

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, 
English spelling was even more unauthorized, for- 
tuitous, and chaotic than it is now. Englishmen did 
not spell their names and their language uniformly 
because they were not educated to do so and 
because they did not attach any importance to the 
subject. The schools had no courses in English; 
there were no spelling-bees then (any more than 
we have in alien tongues), and people did not ask 
each other how they spelt their names. These 
facts, taken in connection with the non-existence 
of an English dictionary prior to 1604, together 
with the then scarcity of books among the common 
people, sufficiently account for the multitudinous 
forms which ordinary words and names assumed 
in the Elizabethan era. Elizabethans spelled 
phonetically, or tried to do so. Inasmuch as in the 
English language almost each sound is represent- . 
able by one or more letters or combinations of 1 
letters, and inasmuch as many letters do service 
for more than one sound, the particular form that 
any word or name assumed on the written page 
depended as much upon the whim, fancy, or : 
caprice of the moment as upon the education and 
habits of the writer. Our modern spelling, espe- 
cially of surnames, is almost as whimsical and 
capricious as theirs was. It is therefore not at all 
surprising to find Elizabethan Englishmen spelling 
ordinary words, and even their own names or those 
of their immediate relatives, differently on different ; 
occasions or even on the same occasion. The larger ; 
the number of sounds in a word or name the larger ; 
the number of variations in its spelling. 

Shakespeare's name contains seven sounds, and 
it was therefore capable of a great many different 
spellings. A certain Mr. Wise made a list of four \ 
thousand ways of spelling "Shakespeare." Mr. : 
Wise's estimate is a very modest one. Considering j 
that six of the seven sounds of which the poet's 
name is composed can be represented by several 
different letters or groups of letters (e. g., the first 
sound by s, sh, sch, ss, ssh, ch; the second by a, ea, \ 
ai, ay, e, o : the third and fourth by cs, ccs, chs, qus, ; 
ques, ks, kes, kss, cks, ekes, kys, ckys, kis, x, xs, I 
.rks, xkes, gs, etc. ; the fifth by p, b, ph; the sixth 
by a. e, ee, ei, ey, ea, i, and u, all with or without a 
final e; the seventh by r, rr, rd), there is almost 
no limit to the number of variations of which this . 
name is capable. If each one of the seven sounds 
in Shakespeare's name were capable of being 
written by only four different letters or letter- 
groups, there would be 16,384 ways of spelling this 
name according to English orthography. And yet j 
it was actually spelled only in some fifty or sixty j 
ways ! 

In the records of the Corporation of Stratford 
the name Shakespeare occurs 161 times (Sir Sidney 
Lee incorrectly says 66), and is spelled in fifteen 
(Lee says sixteen) different ways in the following ! 
order of frequency: Shaxpeare (69), Shaxpere ' 
(18), Shakspeyr (17), Shakespere (13), Shaks- \ 
peare (9), Shakyspere (9), etc. And yet Mr. ' 
Greenwood says there was no "Shake" in the j 
Stratfordean's name! 



An examination of all the extant records per- 
taining to William Shakespeare and his family, 
except the purely literary records, from 1550 to 
1625 (viz., the records of Stratford, Snitterfield, 
Wihnecote, Bearley, Shottery, Warwick, Rowing- 
ton, Clifford, Hampton-Lucy, Coventry, Ingon, 
and London, including notices of births, marriages, 
and funerals, court records, Corporation archives, 
wills and inventories, letters and diaries, views of 
frank-pledge, a list of freeholders, surveys, a list 
of recusants, a marriage license and a bond against 
impediments, marriage settlements, reports of 
special commissions, the records of the College of 
Heraldry, depositions, assessment rolls, bail bonds, 
deeds, leases, fines, tombstones and monuments, 
etc.) results in the tabulation of a little over seven 
hundred occurrences of this surname in forty-four 
different spellings, in the following order of 
frequency: Shakespere (114), Shaxpeare (73), 
Shakespeare (69), Shakspere (55), Shaxpere 
(51), Shackspere (38), Shakspeyr (38), Shacke- 
spere (32), Shaxspere (31), etc. It is to be noted 
that there is an e at the end of the first syllable in 
thirty-eight per cent, and an t or a t/ (the occa- 
sional equivalent of an e) in three and a half per 
cent more. And yet Mr. Greenwood says there 
was no "Shake" in the Stratfordean's name! 
Perfectly characteristic of the methods of the 
Baconians in presenting their case is Mr. Green- 
wood's frequent references to Shaxberd, Shagspere, 
Shagspur, and Shaxpur, instilling into his readers' 
minds the belief that the actor's name was most 
frequently so written by his acquaintances and 
associates. What are the facts? Shagspere occurs 
only seventeen times, a little over two per cent; 
Shagspur is nowhere to be found ; Mr. Greenwood's 
assertion that "Shaxpur is another well-known 
variant" is quite untrue, for it exists nowhere but 
in the fantasies of Baconians; and the form 
Shaxberd occurs only a few times and only in 
literary London, in documents of purely literary 
interest ! 

Reading Messrs. Greenwood, Baxter, Fraser, 
et id genus omne, one would infer that literary 
circles in London were unanimous in writing the 
poet's name Shakespeare or Shake-speare. But the 
truth is that Londoners were just as variable and 
unresolved as to the orthography of the popular 
dramatist's name as were the "boors" of the 
provinces. It is true that the majority of the 
printed mentions of the name show the forms just 
mentioned. But there are many exceptions. On 
the title-page of "Love's Labor's Lost" (1598) and 
of u The Passionate Pilgrim" (1612) we find 
Shakespere, of "Kong Lear" (1608) Shak-speare, 
and of "The Two Noble Kinsmen" (1634) Shak- 
speare. Other printed forms are Shake-spear, 
Shak-spear, and Shakespear. London manuscript 
references to the poet and his family are generally 
anything but Shakespeare. In these we find 
Shaxberd (1604-5), Shakespere, Shakspeer, Shack- 
spheere (1627), Shackspare (1619), Shakspere, 
Shaks per (by Edward Alleyn!), Shakspeare, etc. 
The officials of the College of Heraldry wrote 
either Shakespeare or Shakespere. In London, 
Shakespeare's name was written and printed in not 
less than twenty different ways, at least nine of 



458 



THE DIAL 



[May 11 



which (Shakesbere, Shackspeere, Shakspeer, Shak- 
speare, Shake-spectre, Shake-spear, Sheakspeare, 
Shakespheare, Shaxberd) are peculiar to the 
metropolis, and in all of these there is no doubt 
that the poet was meant. Sir Sidney Lee's state- 
ment that the form Shakespeare "has the pre- 
dominant sanction of legal and literary usage" is 
grossly erroneous. In truth and in fact, legal 
documents pertaining to the poet's property are 
overwhelmingly in favor of a shortened form of 
the name, especially as regards the omission of the 
a in the second syllable. Literary usage was as 
variable as legal usage. To speak of a "literary 
form" of the name is an absurdity. 

A number of orthodox Shakespeareans and, of 
course, all Baconians, have asserted that in the 
provinces the first syllable of the actor-poet's sur- 
name must have been pronounced short because 
six-tenths of the time it was written without an 
e (i or y the occasional equivalents of e) after 
the k. If this is true of the provinces, it is also 
true of London, for only in the printing offices was 
the name generally spelled with an e at the end of 
the first syllable. But all these writers have dis- 
regarded, or been ignorant of, the fact that in the 
reigns of Elizabeth and James there was no rule 
requiring a final e to indicate the length of a pre- 
ceding vowel, and that Elizabethan writers and 
printers employed or omitted the final e as suited 
their fancy. (Even to-day the sound of a in "far," 
etc., the sound this vowel had in the Elizabethan 
"shake," does not require a final e.) Salesbury, 
writing about the middle of the sixteenth century, 
tells us that the use of silent e was kept up for 
the convenience of printers "in consideration of 
iustifying of the lynes." When, at the close of the 
middle English period, all final e's were dropped 
in pronunciation they were naturally also omitted 
in spelling, especially in the first syllable of 
compound words, e.g., "wherof," "elswhere," "her- 
after," "therof," "somwhat," etc., and in sur- 
names composed of two words. That is why the 
e is so often omitted from the first syllable of the 
poet's name not only in provincial records but also 
in the vast majority of unprinted London records. 
These facts also explain why in approximately 
twenty per cent of the non-literary occurrences of 
the name there is no e at the end of the second 
syllable. 

The presence or absence of a final e had no 
influence whatever on the pronunciation of a sylla- 
ble or of the vowel sound in the syllable. In 
Elizabeth's day, even more than now, an individual 
writer's spelling was no guide to his pronunciation, 
inasmuch as each vowel had several phonetic values. 
Nothing is more certain than that Elizabethan 
writers did not associate a different pronunciation 
with a somewhat different spelling. Elizabethan 
and Jacobean manuscripts and printed books 
abundantly prove this. (Even to-day such differ- 
ent spellings as "pear," "pair," and "pare" have 
the same sound.) That "spere" or "sper" was 
the phonetic equivalent of "spear" or "speare" is 
proved, apart from etymological and other con- 
siderations (e.g., variant texts), by the Shakespeare 
coat-of-arms, which exhibits a falcon shaking a 
spear. Mr. Greenwood's references to the "spur- 



jingling form" of the Stratfordean's name is a 
piece of jugglery and misrepresentation perfectly 
characteristic of the whole ilk of Baconians. His 
statement that the College assigned "the spear- 
shaking name" to "Shakspere" because "Shaksper" 
would not have commended itself to them for 
pictorial purposes embodies a falsehood. The 
Heralds wrote indifferently Shakespere or Shake- 
speare, never Shakspere. Besides, why did 
Shakespeare have to have a canting pattern sug- 
gesting his name? And why does a spur not 
commend itself for pictorial purposes as well as 
a spear? To most of us a jingling spur sounds as 
heroical as a shaking spear, perhaps more so, and 
is as suggestive of a military origin. 

Baconians pretend to find a great deal of sig- 
nificance in the fact that in a large number of 
printed references to the great poet the name is 
printed with a hyphen between the two syllables. 
There were several reasons for the use of the 
hyphen in Elizabethan printing shops. In the first 
place, it was often used for no better reason than 
what Salesbury tells us about the use of final e. 
In the first folio we often find words connected 
with a hyphen (e.g., "fowle-play," "sea-storme," 
"Ayrie-charme," "worlds-stage," "holiday-foole," 
etc.) for no apparent reason. In the second place, 
Elizabethan and Jacobean compositors seem to 
have been instructed to indicate the composition of 
compound words and phrases by the introduction 
of a hyphen between the word components. That is 
why we find in the folio the following: "a-boord," 
"Bote-swaine," "out-live," "un-heard," "mid- 
night," "eye-lid," "non-pareill," "Pre-thee," "Com- 
mon-wealth," etc. Gratuitous and ridiculous 
etymologizing was one of the fashions of the 
printers of that day. Another and very important 
reason for the excessive use of the hyphen was to 
indicate that the hyphenated word-group was to 
be accented on the first element, e. g., "horse-man," 
"good-man," "young-man," "true-man," "half- 
Sword," "tyring-house," "spend-thrift," "Fly-me," 
"Shake-spear," etc. It goes without saying that 
printers would be more likely to aim at some 
kind of uniformity in orthography than writers. 
An examination of a large number of Elizabethan 
manuscripts shows that the hyphen was very rarely 
employed in writing and not at all in the writing 
of surnames. 

There is absolutely not a particle of reason for 
doubting that "Shakspere of Stratford was 
"Shakespeare" of London.

As an addendum to Professor Killis Campbell's 
important article in your issue of Feb. 17 entitled 
"New Notes on Poe's Early Years," I should like

Campbell rightly calls "the most interesting of the

The "new bit" is a bill for Poe's schooling in 
London. This document makes it clear that Poe

was not a pupil, as he himself averred, at the 
school of the Rev. John Bransby (whom he 
erroneously called "Doctor" Bransby) in Stoke- 
Newington throughout his five years' sojourn in 
Britain (1815-1820) ; but that part of the time, 
and previous to his Stoke-Newington days, he 
attended a school kept by the Misses Dubourg in 
Sloane Street, Chelsea. 

With the above data in hand, I set out on the 
quest of identifying the site of the school. The 
most obvious depository of such information 
proved fruitless, since the name of Dubourg does 
not appear in any of the London directories of 
the period. 

The second attempt was more successful. The 
Town Clerk of Chelsea courteously permitted me 
to examine the Poor Rate Books, in which I found 
the name of Francis Dubourg appearing for the 
first time in Midsummer of 1816. The date coin- 
cides with the date of the Misses Dubourg's bill to 
Allan for Poe's schooling, from which it may be 
inferred that Poe's first quarter in the school was 
likewise the first quarter of the school itself. After 
the same number, 146, under Dubourg's name, is 
that of Mary A. Brooke, from which it appears 
that two distinct tenants occupied the premises. 
It may be assumed that Francis Dubourg was the 
father of the Misses Dubourg, and his presence 
simply adds another member, to those already 
mentioned by Professor Campbell, of a family to 
be henceforth associated with Poe. 

The street numbering has not been changed (the 
numbers run consecutively up one side and down 
the other). No. 146 then is No. 146 still. It is 
the last house on the East side of Sloane Street, 
on the corner of Sloane Square. The present 
building, the ground floor of which is occupied by 
a branch of Parrs Bank, is comparatively recent. 
The discovery that Poe, when he was seven years 
old, attended a boarding school in Sloane Street 
greatly expands the boundaries of his London be- 
yond their previously accepted definition. It 
means not only that he lived in Chelsea, and that 
that Parish is to be added to Bloomsbury and 
Stoke-Newington as constituting the scene of his 
English childhood, but it also means that, hardly 
less than the district between Bloomsbury and 
Stoke-Newington, he must have frequently travelled 
over the part of town which lies between Blooms- 
bury and Chelsea. In other words, he must have 
known the aspect of Piccadilly and Hyde Park as 
well as of Russell Square and Newington Green.

SLIPSHOD BIBLIOGRAPHY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Not long ago, my attention was called to a 
recently-published volume by Mr. Peter H. Gold- 
smith, entitled "A Brief Bibliography of Books in 
English, Spanish, and Portuguese Relating to the 
Republics Commonly Called Latin American, with 
Comments." Being interested in those countries, I 
ordered the book for the assistance which I hoped 
it would give me. I must confess, however, that I 
am disappointed, and furthermore I cannot see any 



reasonable excuse for the publication. Issued by 
one of our great American publishers, I felt con- 
fident that it would at least be a compilation of 
some value. No doubt publishers occasionally err, 
but why this book has been put forth is beyond my 
comprehension. 

Mr. Goldsmith's name is unfamiliar to me; 
though according to the title-page, he is Director 
of the Pan-American Division of the American 
Association for International Conciliation. Hold- 
ing such a position, I am confident that he has 
made a grievous error in thus appearing in print. 

My own interest is in Nicaragua, and I therefore 
turned to that head in an index by countries and 
subjects. On page xvi I found one reference only, 
and that to a pamphlet published seven years since 
by the Government Printing Office, 14 pages, 
octavo; and the comment thereon is a cross refer- 
ence to a similar pamphlet on the Argentine Re- 
public. My hopes were dashed, therefore, as far 
as Nicaragua was concerned. I have a private 
collection of possibly one hundred titles on the 
Republic of Nicaragua, from the time of its first 
coming under the notice of Great Britain until last 
year. Most of these books are in English, although 
two or three are in French and a like number in 
Spanish. 

Mr. Goldsmith's "bibliography" consists of 107 
pages, and the whole number of titles included 
(299) is less than three times as many as I pos- 
sess on the single country of Nicaragua. 

I am curious to know the basis of the compiler's 
selection. Surely there are sufficient books of first 
importance which might have been included, as 
for instance, the great work on Mexico by Riva 
Palacio, 5 volumes. Is there any reasonable excuse 
for leaving out Waterton's "Wanderings," a classic 
of its kind, and Belt's "The Naturalist in Nic- 
aragua"? Fortunately, Bate's "The Naturalist on 
the River Amazons" does appear, but with a note 
insignificant as compared with the character of the 
volume. Only one title by Dr. Nicholas Leon is 
included. 

Mr. Goldsmith does not consider Mr. George 
Palmer Putnam's "The Southland of North 
America" as worthy of notice; and his diatribe on 
what Mr. Frederick Palmer saw and did in Central 
America is evidently written without any actual 
knowledge of the subject. Mr. Palmer's book is 
not "documented"; but there are so many titles 
throughout the volume, annotated by Mr. Gold- 
smith, where this somewhat awkward word is used 
that it becomes tiresome. The compiler also seems 
fond of italicizing such words as ''General," "Cap- 
tain," "Don," etc., for which he undoubtedly has a 
reason, though this reason does not readily appear 
to the uninformed. 

The compiler speaks of the scarcity of books in 
English on the Latin- American countries. Before 
making such a statement he should have consulted 
some of the collections in this country; and he 
might have done well to have inquired for informa- 
tion of Mr. P. Lee Phillips of the Congressional 
Library, to whom he refers as "A. Phillips" on 
page x of his index. 

It seems to me that Kingsborough's great work 
on Mexico receives too much attention. To be

sure, it was a labor of "self-sacrifice" and great 
"human perseverance," and the plates and general 
make-up of the volumes are superb. But does not 
Mr. Goldsmith know that this treatise has been to 
a great extent superseded by facsimiles of most of 
the important codices and other documents, made 
more accurate by modern photographic process? 

I should also like to have seen included Ward's 
book on Mexico. But the number of volumes not 
appearing is so considerable that I dare not even 
begin to enumerate them. The proof reading is 

bad throughout the volume.

A LETTER TO A DEAD AUTHOR. 
Dear Miss AUSTEN: 

Have you heard but prepare for something 
very dreadful. Amazing things are being said in 
this country about celebrated people. I cannot 
think what causes it. It may be the desire for 
something "new and novel," to use the expression 
of those venders of small articles we call "agents." 
It began in the East. Somebody confessed in the 
public prints that he had never read Dante. Some- 
one else announced that he had read Carlyle, but 
thought him a great bore. The facile descent was 
begun. "The Pilgrim's Progress" was next seen 
plunging down the vortex of unpopularity, along 
with the rest of the religious classics. I know 
your dislike of "the vortex," but no other figure 
fits the case. Vortexes are quite common with us. 

Even school children are asking why they should 
be subjected to the strain of reading defunct 
authors. "Our mothers," they say, "read 'Gulli- 
ver's Travels ' when they were children. It is out 
of date. Why, it was written before Abraham 
Lincoln. We prefer something recent." 

This could be borne; for to some a book is 
merely a commodity, like the season's clothes, to be 
changed when later fashions appear. But such 
leanings are more serious in those to whom a good 
book is supposedly "the precious life-blood of a 
master spirit." A few weeks ago a reviewer of the 
Brontes' poems averred that their novels are old 
fashioned; that they are more edited and discussed 
than read ; that, if read, it is merely because of the 
interest inspired by the tragic lives of the Bronte 
family. These were "the words, if not the very 
langwidges," of the review. A good deal was added 
about the melodrama of their plots, as if that were 
all their substance though if there is anything in 
literature more poignantly real than the school 
scenes in "Jane Eyre," I know not where it is. Is 
not Scott's "Rob Roy" melodramatic; and are not 
Dickens's "Oliver Twist," "Bleak House," "Martin 
Chuzzlewit" still more "precipitous"? 

But I disgress. The worst is yet to come. 
THE DIAL, intelligencer and guide of those to whom 
literature is supreme, queried recently, apropos of 
a proposed celebration of your centennial year: 
"Who reads one of her books once a year?" I am 
sorry to pain you, but so it was. 

"Strange words they seem of slight and scorn," 
but perhaps, like Wordsworth's Yarrovian jocular- 
ities, they veil an inward fealty. It may be con- 



soling to recall Lord Tennyson's compliment. It 
is related that when he visited Lyme he was impa- 
tient when historic spots were pointed out to him, 
saying with adorable warmth: "Don't talk to me 
of the Duke of Monmouth. I want to know the 
exact spot where Louisa Musgrove fell." 

Unhappily, Lord Tennyson himself may have 
disappeared from the literary firmament by this 
time. The next gale from the North may bring 
word that somebody in New York or Chicago no 
longer peruses him. Out here in Missouri, we 
should be all unaware of his disappearance. We 
are so far from intellectual luminaries that, like 
some of the fixed stars, they could be snuffed out 
and we would yet continue to bask in their rays for 
some years to come. 

It would be. a great pity, however, for Tennyson 
to suffer such a fate after all his labor. Your little 
Catherine of "Northanger Abbey" may turn out a 
prophet after all. "To be at so much trouble in 
filling volumes" which, as she artlessly remarked, 
"nobody would willingly look into, to be laboring 
only for the torment of little boys and girls, 
always struck me as a hard fate, and I have often 
wondered at the person's courage that could sit 
down on purpose to do it." 

On the present fashion in literature, as well as 
in dress, I would fain discourse, but these are 
themes for abler pens that that of 

Your obliged and faithful ser*,

COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARY AND 

POLICE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

An editorial paragraph with the above heading, 
contained in your issue of April 13, has just come 
to my attention. It is an interesting statement, but 
unfortunately is not true. Evidently it is based on 
the misconception of some local newspaper a year 
and a half ago, which was given currency by Mr. 
Pearson in his Boston "Transcript" column. The 
Somerville library's exact statement of the matter, 
printed in the "Library Journal," of course never 
caught up with the newspaper misconception. 

The fact simply is that the meeting between the 
boys on probation and the probation officer were 
arranged to be held in a small lecture room in the 
central library, so that the boys might be removed 
from the police court atmosphere. None of them 
are asked to take books, and most of them never 
enter any of the library book rooms; so that the 
offender cannot, of course, be "made to draw from 
the library a book with a story bearing on the 
offence" and "subsequently called upon for proof 
that he has read the prescribed matter."

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHARLES 
FRAXCIS ADAMS.* 



Charles Francis Adams was born in Bos- 
ton, May 27, 1835. He died in Washington, 
March 20, 1915. The brief autobiography 
now published was written, in the main, in 
1912, though here and there are fragments 
of an earlier date. In so short a work it was 
impossible to render full account of the many 
activities of a very active life, and only the 
leading episodes are related. Even these 
receive no extended treatment; they are, 
rather, but the pegs upon which are hung for 
inspection those characteristics and qualities 
that the writer felt were his, or felt he 
lacked. Thus the autobiography is an attempt 
at self -revelation ; only rarely is if a "mirror 
of his times." This was indeed Adams's con- 
ception of the proper function of autobiogra- 
phy, the self-expression, with truth and 
candor, of a man's personality; and to this 
conception he has held with admirable rigor 
throughout his book. 

Nevertheless, the bare bones of life must 
be presented, for understanding, and as such 
Adams has given them. At thirteen he was 
sent to the Boston Latin School, and his three 
years there he "loathed" then and in mem- 
ory. Placed under a private tutor, he entered 
Harvard College, with advanced standing, as 
a sophomore in 1853, another "error," for 
had he entered as freshman, he would have 
been a member of the remarkable class of '57. 
whereas the class of '56 "was as a class dis- 
tinctly unnoticeable a low average ; and, in 
subsequent years, the chief distinction it 
achieved was contributing two inmates to the 
State's prison." Yet the years at Harvard 
were profitable, for here Adams began to 
exercise his "aptitude" for writing. In Sep- 
tember, 1856, he began the study of law in the 
office of R. H. Dana, and was admitted to 
practice in 1858, thereafter "keeping his 
office," but finding few clients, and never con- 
tent with the profession. Visits to Washing- 
ton, where his father, Charles Francis Adams, 
was now a member of the House of Repre- 
sentatives, and a tour of the Middle West in 
company with Seward, in the campaign of 
1860, offered attractive opportunity to mix in 
the political whirlpool of that critical year. 
The beginning of the Civil War found Adams 
a member of the Massachusetts militia on

garrison duty at Fort Independence, and, 
after some heart searching as to duty, there 
followed enlistment in the volunteers, with 
appointment on December 19, 1861, as First 
Lieutenant in the First Massachusetts Cav- 
alry. Service in the army brought no especial 
distinction, though conscientious perform- 
ance of duties, here, as always, marked 
Adams's career. He was first stationed in 
South Carolina, then in Virginia, took part in 
the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg, and 
was in many minor engagements. In 1864 
appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the Fifth 
Massachusetts Cavalry, a sense of duty to 
the regiment made him decline a staff 
appointment, though he eagerly desired it. 
At the head of his regiment he rode into the 
burning Richmond the day after Jefferson 
Davis and his government had abandoned 
their capitpl. Made Brigadier-General, and 
the war concluded, he was mustered out of 
service in 1865. 

Married in 1865, to Mary Ogden, a wedding 
trip in Europe was followed by a return, in 
1866, to his law office in Boston, but "with a 
sinking heart. " From the dreariness, to him, 
of the law, an escape was found in a return 
to writing. "Instinctively recognizing my 
unfitness for the law, I fixed on the railroad 
system as the most developing force and 
largest field of the day, and determined to 
attach myself to it. I now stand amazed at 
my own inexperience and audacity." Yet 
within a fortnight after reaching this deter- 
mination, Adams had written for "The North 
American Review" an article on Railroads, 
thus entering a field of activity which was 
to engage a large portion of his energies for 
the next twenty-five years. "Paraphrasing 
Pistol, the world was my oyster then, which 
I with pen did open; and I did it, unaided." 
The fruition of these efforts came, in 1869, 
with the publication of "A Chapter of Erie." 
that classic in railway literature, and an 
appointment to the newly established Massa- 
chusetts Railroad Commission, the first of its 
kind, where Adams served for the next ten 
years. In 1878 he became chairman of the 
Government Directors of the Union Pacific; 
in 1882, an Overseer of Harvard College, 
serving twenty-four years; in 1882, also, a 
director of the Union Pacific itself, and in 
1884 the President of the company, for 
which he performed great services in estab- 
lishing its financial credit, only to see his 
plans thwarted by the manipulations of Jay 
Gould, who succeeded in 1890 in driving 
Adams from office. In 1892 he was made 
head of the Boston Park Commission, and 
was largely instrumental in saving the pres-

[May 11 



ent larger park systems from the maw of 
real estate speculators. In 1897 he became 
Chairman of the Massachusetts Commission 
on the relation of street railways and munici- 
palities. In the meantime, private business 
ventures, with varying success and failure, 
had required much time and attention, and 
in general, says Adams, "the fallibility of 
my judgment has been noticeable." But one 
great accomplishment was his, the organi- 
zation, and direction for over forty years, of 
the Kansas City Stock Yards Company, an 
enterprise which appealed to him as much for 
its benefit to the public as for its financial 
success. 

Thus enumerated in the pages of the auto- 
biography, though with but scant comment, 
the activities of Adams seem sufficiently 
varied and pressing to have occupied to the 
full one man's life. In reality, in addition to 
his historical study and writing, always 
engaging attention even in the midst of rail- 
way controversies, Adams has wholly omitted 
from description, or even reference, many 
other activities with which his name is insol- 
ubly connected, as "anti-imperialism," or 
"reform of the pensions." The autobiography 
is, then, no history of the man, or of his 
works. More than two-thirds of its pages 
are devoted, indeed, to but ten years of life. 
those from 1856 to 1866. The book is rather 
a running exposition of the man, a bit of 
introspection, if you please, with all the charm 
of Adams's style as a writer, his amusing 
divagations, his vigorous denunciation of 
human fault or frailty, his wonderful ability 
in dramatic presentation of historical fact. 

The chapters, "Law and Politics" (1856- 
1861), and "Washington, 1861," contain 
numerous interesting characterizations, or 
estimates, of men prominent in politics. 
Seward talked with his young friend of the 
great figures of the preceding generation, 
Webster, Clay, and Calhoun. Of the latter, 
he said: 

Calhoun was the most eminent of the three, but 
they are all over-rated men; for they converted the 
Senate-Chamber into a mere intellectual arena for 
their own struggles. Calhoun had undirected, original 
eloquence; Clay had a fiery, brilliant imagination; 
Webster, brute intellectual force. Calhoun 's logic was 
not sound; he led and did not follow it, using it to 
support a pre-conceived theory. 

Of Seward himself, although admitting the 
egotistical manner so offensive to many of his 
confreres, Adams presents a picture of the 
statesman in repose, less well known, and far 
more pleasing: 

Seward, in fact, never appeared so well as at home, 
in Auburn. He was there really and unaffectedly 
simple. He walked the streets exchanging greetings 
with every one; and, as he sat at home in his office, 



every one came in without form or ceremony, and to 
everyone the same welcome was extended. It was, 
too, all genuine the relations were kindly, unaf- 
fected, neighborly. 

In the years immediately following upon the 
Civil War, Adams had a profound belief in 
the wisdom and skill of Seward as Secretary 
of State. Later historical investigation some- 
what modified that judgment, both as to the 
man and his statecraft. He writes : 

As I now see him, Seward was an able, a specious 
and adroit, and a very versatile man; but he escaped 
being really great. . . Perhaps my own impression 
could best be conveyed looking back on him now 
through the perspective of forty years by saying 
that he was an adroit politician and pseudo -statesman, 
having in him a dash of the philosopher. 

During his visit to Washington in the win- 
ter of 1860-61, Adams met many men of 
prominence, and made a diary record (later 
destroyed in large part) of conversations. As 
a young man he had conceived a great ven- 
eration and affection for Sumner. Disillu- 
sionment came in this Washington visit. A 
diary record, previously printed, but here 
reprinted, tells of Sumner 's vague and dis- 
ordered language just previous to the 
inauguration of Lincoln. Adams was in con- 
versation with Sumner and Wilkinson of 
Minnesota : 

I had heard that he [Sumner] was excited, but his 
manner and language amazed me. He talked like a 
crazy man, orating, gesticulating, rolling out deep 
periods in theatrical, whispered tones, repeating 
himself, and doing everything but reason. . . I 
soon saw that reason was out of the question, and 
the only course was for me to hold my tongue, letting 
him run down. . . His attack was on Seward and 
"the compromisers"; he had thought of this matter 
in the day time, and lay awake over it whole nights; 
it was all clear to him; to him, his path was as 
clear as day ... he would reiterate : " I am sure 
I am certain I see my way so clearly ; such a 
glorious victory was before us; right was with us, 
God was with us our success was sure did we only 
hold firmly to our principles." . . It was very 
painful. The man talked so without reason, and 
almost without connection; and yet he gave me dis- 
tinctly to understand that he alone could now guide 
affairs; ... I was disgusted, shocked and mortified. 

Many historians have sought later to unravel 
Sumner 's "clear path," but without certi- 
tude, for neither then nor after did Sumner 
formulate definitely his plan of action. 

Adams 's ability to hit hard in characteriza- 
tion, as well as his ineradicable determination 
to tell the truth as he saw it, is illustrated by 
his youthful diary citation on Sumner. Other 
illustrations are frequent in the autobiogra- 
phy. Of Roger A. Pryor, a leading secession- 
ist, he writes : 

I remember him at one of Buchanan's receptions, 
a rather tall and lank Virginian, stalking about with 
a lady on each arm. In shabby black, of course, and 
ugly as a stone fence, with tallowy, close-shaven fea- 
tures, and prominent high cheek-bones, his eyes had

a hard, venomous look, while his flowing locks, brushed 
carefully behind his ears, fell well down over his coat 
collar, innocent of the shears. He was representative 
of a large class men who were just spoiling for a 
fight. They had it, too ! , and, before they got through, 
had a belly-full! 

Yet here follows a later impression of Pryor, 
received in a chance meeting at a reception 
to John Bigelow in New York, 1911: 

He was then manifestly a very old man, softened 
by experience and domestic afflictions. . . I recog- 
nized him, sitting on one of the front benches, the 
moment I came into the room; and at once went and 
introduced myself to him. He was plainly gratified ; 
and so was I at seeing him there. On both sides, 
all the old feeling was gone. In the quieter rays of 
a setting sun, I like to think it was so. 

Adams's anecdotal reminiscences, his gen- 
eralizations, a few of which have now been 
quoted, themselves indicate some of those per- 
sonal characteristics and qualities with which 
the autobiography intentionally concerns 
itself; for, as before stated, Adams's theory 
of the purpose of autobiography was that it 
should be, primarily, an honest attempt at 
self-revelation, and honest in intent he 
always was, even, at times, painfully so, both 
to others and to himself. Not all qualities 
or all characteristics can be treated in a brief 
review, and one must be content with a few 
of those evidently most vital to the author 
himself. No comprehensive diary remains to 
show the man as he understood himself from 
day to day. Until volunteering in the army 
he had kept such a diary. Thirty years later 
he read it and destroyed it. 

The revelation of myself to myself was positively 
shocking. Then and there I was disillusioned. Up to 
that time and I was then about fifty -five I had 
indulged in the pleasing delusion that it was in me, 
under proper conditions of time, place, and occasion, 
to do, or be, something rather noticeable. I have 
never thought so since. . . It wasn't that the 
thing was bad or that my record was discreditable; 
it was worse! It was silly. That it was crude, goes 
without saying. That I didn't mind! But I did 
blush and groan and swear, over its unmistakable 
immaturity and ineptitude, its conceit, its weakness 
and cant ... as I finished each volume, it went 
into the fire; and I stood over it until the last leaf 
was ashes. . . I have never felt the same about 
myself since. I now humbly thank fortune that I 
have almost got through life without making a con- 
spicuous ass of myself. 

Adams himself may thus scoff and condemn. 
No one who knew him, or his writings, would 
be likely to agree. The point of view is, how- 
ever, very characteristic of an honest self- 
depreciation, resulting, in spite of a bold 
front, in a genuine hesitation never wholly 
absent from a mind critically acute, and seek- 
ing that which was just and right. Boldness 
in word and deed is rightly connected with 
Adams's reputation. But it was the ante- 
cedent perplexed hesitation and self-inquiry 



which left their mark in his memory. Such 
habit of hesitancy he attributed somewhat to 
the fact that in youth he was unfortunately 
always held a little apart from other boys. "I 
should have been compelled to rough it with 
other boys." He was individualistic and 
needed "attrition." This incertitude of mind 
and purpose was most marked in the months 
before Adams volunteered in the army, and 
in those immediately following the end of 
army service. Even in age, the elation of a 
great decision made was as vivid to him as on 
that October day, in 1861, when he cast aside 
"scolding tenants, auditing bills, discussing 
repairs, rendering accounts, and so doing 
my duty ! Psh ! . . Even now, though more 
than fifty years have since passed on, I look 
back as at the moment of an inspiration 
the time when I resolved to burst the bonds, 
and to strike out into the light from the 
depth of the darkness. No wiser determina- 
tion did I ever reach." On return to civil 
life, the earlier dislike for the practice of 
law returned also, and it was not until he 
found a field of endeavor in railway matters 
that uncertainty was ended. How oppressive 
that uncertainty was, is shown in a letter 
written in 1869 to E. R. Hoar on the occasion 
of the latter 's nomination for the Attorney- 
Generalship (Memoir of Ebenezer Rockwood 
Hoar, 1911, p. 194) : "Of all comforting 
things the most comforting must be to feel 
that one has a mission to perform, that all 
responsibility and doubt are gone, and that to 
retreat is impossible." 

Another obstacle to success and happiness 
alike, so Adams believed, was his sense of a 
barrier in contact with men. He desired no 
such barrier, but, try as he would to break it 
down, there it stood, indestructible and insur- 
mountable. 

I was not popular in my college days; nor, indeed, 
have I ever been so since. . . I wanted to be; but 
it wasn't quite in me . . . moreover, gauche, I 
was singularly lacking in what is known as tact. I 
had almost a faculty for doing or saying the wrong 
thing at any given time; and I was painfully self- 
conscious. This made me shy; and the world, as 
usual, set my shyness to the account of pride. 

This is keen self -analysis, but surely over- 
stated. Tact may have been lacking in youth ; 
only his contemporaries can testify as to that. 
But in later years, tact and consideration for 
others were his, distinctly. Shyness, "set to 
the account of pride," was more lasting, and 
all the more a cause of discomfort to one 
whose real warmth of human sympathy 
needed an equal warmth of affection in 
return. Possibly it was this inability to find 
touch, that Adams would have regarded as 
the principal characteristic debarring him

from the public service, had he given the mat- 
ter any consideration. The autobiography 
has nothing to say of this, nor did Adams 
ever make any effort for political power. 
Nevertheless, the question inevitably arises, 
why a man of such distinguished political her- 
itage, with unquestioned intellectual gifts, 
with every quality, save possibly that of sup- 
pleness, fitting him to be a great public serv- 
ant, should have had no place in public life. 
The simpler, and presumably the correct, 
explanation is that he did not seek it. John 
Adams did so, with intent and persistence. 
So, also, did John Quincy Adams. Still again, 
Charles Francis Adams, the elder, from 
earliest youth looked forward to political 
usefulness, made his way through difficulties, 
led a "forlorn hope," saw that hope become 
a reality, and was on the very threshold of 
distinguished success in leadership, when 
diverted to the diplomatic field (and a great 
public service thereby) by the offer of the 
English mission in 1861. With equal mental 
abilities, abundantly evidenced in other fields, 
this man of the fourth generation did not gain 
the distinction in public service of his fore- 
bears. He did not seek. Had he followed 
the example of English political families, 
steadily pursuing, through years of appren- 
ticeship, opportunity in politics, there can be 
little doubt that distinction in that field 
would have been his also, and no doubt that 
the field would have been the better for his 
presence. 

In the autobiography there is little refer- 
ence to the political eminence of the family, 
and no direct evidence that Adams ever 
desired public service for himself. In the 
concluding pages he writes : 

I have, perhaps, accomplished nothing considerable, 
compared with what my three immediate ancestors 
accomplished; but, on the other hand, I have done 
some things better than they ever did; and, what is 
more and most of all, I have had a much better time 
in life got more enjoyment out of it. In this 
respect I would not change with any of them. 

Yet the natural talent for public service was 
his. "Statesmanship, politics in the largest 
sense, diplomacy," says Mr. Lodge, "were 
with him bred in the bone, were an instinct 
rather than an inborn tendency or inclina- 
tion." Whatever the greater personal happi- 
ness of life, the "better time in life," it 
must at least be a matter of much public loss 
and regret that Adams did not seek, and seek 
with persistence, opportunity in public 
service. 

The "enjoyment of life," both physical and 
intellectual, was one of Adams's leading 
characteristics. This found expression in the 



living fire breathed into his writing, whether 
on current topics or in historical investiga- 
tion. The power of vigorous writing and 
dramatic presentation he calls his "apti- 
tude, " a sufficiently modest word to 
describe what others would name as genius. 
Prom the writing of his first magazine article 
("Atlantic Monthly," April, 1861, "The 
Reign of King Cotton") to his last year of 
life, the gift of the pen was a joy and solace. 
Literary work was carried on in the midst of 
business worries sufficient to prohibit most 
men from all other thought. On the day 
after he resigned the presidency of the Union 
Pacific, his name was advertised as the author 
of the two-volume memoir of R. H. Dana. 
Historical investigation and writing espe- 
cially attracted him. " For thirty years it has 
led me through pastures green and pleasant 
places." There is no need to recount, in 
detail, his product. In 1912, he noted an 
array of ten bound volumes, and two volumes 
of occasional newspaper contributions. Since 
that date other volumes and many short 
articles have appeared. Not of equal merit, 
all are superior, and some are of unquestioned 
distinction. 

It has been noted that the autobiography 
does not offer a complete record of Adams's 
activities. Neither does it do justice to the 
man. It may indeed, for those who did not 
know him, leave a false impression, for, over- 
harsh in self-analysis, it dwells over-much on 
qualities in which Adams thought himself 
lacking, with a severity of judgment in 
which his friends would not agree. This, 
however, was in itself characteristic. As Mr. 
Lodge, in the Memorial Address, puts it, he 
"was essentially humble-minded as to him- 
self, and disposed to underestimate his own 
success and achievements." This may be an 
unusual, even a refreshing, note in autobi- 
ography. Yet here, it is not the real truth. 
Further, certain qualities, and those the most 
homely, do not appear at all, as his essen- 
tial gentleness and sympathy. Again quoting 
Mr. Lodge, "under a manner somewhat 
brusque, sometimes abrupt, was concealed one 
of the kindest, most affectionate hearts that 
ever beat, and how tender his sympathy could 
be those to whom it went out know well." 
Yet this self-restraint, even, in the desire to 
be just, this failure to be fair to self, serves 
to make clear that which was Adams's great- 
est attribute both as man and writer, his 
absolute intellectual and moral integrity, so 
taken for granted by friend and foe alike 
that none was ever known to question it.

CROWDS A>-D CROWD-PSYCHOLOGY.* 



A book decidedly superior to the ordinary 
run of volumes following the striking but 
hasty generalizations of Tarde and Le Bon 
upon crowd psychology is Sir Martin Con- 
way's "The Crowd in Peace and War." In 
the first place, its author does not write about 
the crowd from the restricted point of view 
which defines it as of two kinds, the Mob 
and the Public. In the second place, the 
theme of his book is that crowd organization 
is the mainspring of social progress, and his 
belief in the possibility of perfecting this 
organization saves him from the undue pessi- 
mism with which many regard crowd char- 
acteristics. Finally, his theories are arrived 
at inductively, and after laborious and cath- 
olic work in collecting data upon the behavior 
of crowds data which is objective, apposite, 
and full of interest. 

The crowd, as Sir Martin Conway sees it, is 
any aggregation of human individuals which 
realizes itself to have a distinct being and an 
internal unity. The British Empire has a 
separate existence, rudimentary in organiza- 
tion and weak in life, but capable of mani- 
festing an amazing crowd life when attacked, 
as it has just shown. The nation is yet 
more vital and more highly organized, its 
crowd life being bound together by patriot- 
ism. Classes are likewise crowds, from the 
proletariat to the "four hundred"; so are the 
professions : so are ecclesiastical and religious 
bodies. A disciplined regiment is the most 
highly organized crowd of all, the unit being 
merged in the whole, and its will lost in what 
we call esprit de corps. In general, the char- 
acteristic of a crowd is a pervading emotion- 
alism, which anneals and brings to a common 
level the rational faculties of the component 
individuals. It is for this reason that music 
opens and unites the hearts of men, and that 
in revival meetings a half hour of hymn sing- 
ing kneads the congregation into one body. 
An orator is the oldest and still the most 
powerful crowd-former. But there are hun- 
dreds of other agencies that can form a crowd 
newspapers, political theories, philan- 
thropic movements, philosophies, anything 
that breeds some common enthusiasm. The 
crowd has some of the virtues of high emo- 
tionalism sentiment and gallantry, for 
example; but it has all the blind brutalities 
and other vices of a low order of intelligence. 

Three types of crowd leaders are distin- 
guished by Sir Martin Conway. the crowd- 
controller, the crowd-exponent, and the crowd-

representative. The crowd-controllers, men 
like Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, Napo- 
leon. Disraeli, are those who can conceive 
far-reaching plans, and can fashion and mas- 
ter crowds big enough to give effect to these 
plans. The crowd-controller has an energy 
which compels him to project himself upon 
the crowd, to realize himself in its larger life, 
and to make it incorporate his brain as the 
centre of its brainless body. Among crowd- 
exponents are men like Gladstone and Lloyd- 
George the visible and audible incarnation 
of popular tendencies. In treating crowd- 
exponents of lesser calibre than these men. 
Sir Martin makes the forceful point that it is 
not the crowd that is caught by the dema- 
gogues, but the demagogues who are caught 
by the crowd. The crowd-representative is 
a picturesque figure-head rather than an indi- 
vidual force, a magistrate, a diplomat, an 
hereditary ruler, anyone typifying crowd 
sovereignty, but having in himself no special 
I power. Sir Martin, in estimating the value 
of the crowd-compeller, justly remarks that 
"that nation must always be the greatest in 
which the power of leadership is commonest, 
best acknowledged, and most employed.'' 

The crux of Sir Martin's book appears in 
his chapters on the degree of organization of 
different crowds, and on the distinction 
between kingdoms and crowd-doms. The 
degrees of organization are to be measured 
by the elaborateness of the crowd's constitu- 
tion, by its efficiency, and by the power to 
control the action of individuals which is 
conceded to the executive. The nature of its 
organization is healthy or unhealthy as it 
preserves a mean between the government in 
which an individual rules and in which unre- 
strained public opinion rules. between the 
kingdom and the crowd-dom. Kingship, Sir 
Martin readily grants, is no longer an admis- 
sible form of government. It exists only in 
politically backward countries, where the pop- 
ulation is scattered, communication difficult, 
and the level of education low. But he pro- 
tests vigorously against a state of affairs in 
which only the crowd rules, in which the 
executive and legislative bodies are thoroughly 
amenable to public opinion, and no crowd- 
compeller is allowed to stand out against the 
rank and file. The statesman of larger vision, 
the expert, the man of rare force of person- 
ality, have their due places, for crowd-rule 
pure and simple must proceed by agitation 
and irrational passion. He points to Great 
Britain and the United States conservative 
republics both as two national crowds 
whose governments have struck the golden 
mean between kingdoms and crowd-doms.

THE DIAL 



[May 11 



Any movement to break down the House of 
Lords in England or the power of the courts 
in this country Sir Martin would completely 
condemn. 

In this treatment of the pure democracy, 
Sir Martin is led into a distinctly one-sided, 
though still very searching and able, analysis. 
His scathing indictment of crowd-power con- 
tains some statements of an extreme sort. In 
order to estimate justly the worth of pure 
democratic rule, a sustained historical survey 
is not adequate, for our time is hardly like 
past times as regards the temper and intelli- 
gence of crowds. And in saying that crowds 
are "utterly irrational" and that all crowds 
are "born fools," in alleging that the only 
feeling one crowd can have for another is 
hatred and opposition, Sir Martin confuses 
the frequent fact with the absolute fact. If 
this were unqualifiedly true, many democratic 
aspirations of reasonable sort would be a 
dream, and the world's future one of per- 
petual war. The writer realizes the immense 
importance of the proper organization of the 
crowd; he should also realize the immense 
hopefulness in the gradual rationalization of 
the crowd which is going on all around us. 
Not even in backward parts of the world is 
the crowd, in any sense of the term, so excit- 
able and blind as it once was. But it is 
clearly true that any one principle of gov- 
ernment can be carried to excess, and in that 
case will end in reaction. 

The remainder of Sir Martin's book con- 
tains much that is interesting, but scarcely 
essential to the exposition of his central theme. 
He treats, and treats well, the distinction 
between morals and religion, morals being 
a social, religion an individual and personal, 
affair ; and points out that the essence of reli- 
gion is a thing appealing to men, not crowds, 
and that Christianity was taught to individ- 
uals by Christ but was socialized by Paul. 
In holding that the civilization of peoples may 
be gauged by noticing the manners of its 
lowest classes, he is certainly wrong, as a 
comparison between the manners of the nomad 
Arab and the English navvy at once suggests. 
Certain other assertions are questionable, but 
they are apart from the main subject of what 
is, on the whole, an excellent treatise. 

ALLAN NEVINS. 



An illustrated book on "The Future of South 
America," by Mr. Roger W. Babson, is expected 
next month. The author has studied the economic 
problems and business possibilities of South 
America for years, and in the writing of various 
chapters has received the cooperation of several 
Presidents and other government officials. 



THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE 
CIVILIZATION.* 



Among the contributions of American 
scholarship which have a high suggestive value 
the work of Dr. Ellsworth Huntington must 
not be overlooked. For more than ten years 
he has been studying the effect of climate upon 
human character, and in three volumes and 
numerous articles he has brought together the 
results of investigations carried on in many 
places and under varied conditions. His latest 
volume is entitled " Civilization and Climate, " 
and it sums up such conclusions as he has 
been able to draw from existing data. It 
should not, however, be considered definitive, 
and its conclusions will doubtless be modified 
as some of his earlier ones have been. 

Without going too much into detail, we may 
say that Dr. Huntington has made a study of 
the effect of climate, i.e., temperature and 
humidity, upon mankind. He has amassed 
data concerning the physical reaction of 
workmen under varying conditions, and the 
mental reaction of students. He has also, on 
the advice of well-informed men from all over 
the globe, prepared maps showing the distribu- 
tion of civilization in the various continents, 
and a striking similarity is found between 
these maps and the maps showing the distri- 
bution of human energy on the basis of 
climate. Certain conditions of temperature, 
humidity, and cyclonic storms seem to favor 
physical and mental energy, which must have 
no small effect upon what we call civilization. 

One paragraph sums up the conclusions 
drawn from this miscellaneous data : 

In point of time, though not of presentation in this 
book, the first step was a study of the climate of the 
past. Ten years of work along this line have led to the 
hypothesis of pulsatory changes, and finally to the 
idea that the changes consist primarily of a shifting 
of the belt of storms. After this conclusion had 
been reached, a wholly independent investigation of 
the effect of present climatic conditions upon human 
activity led to two conclusions, neither of which was 
anticipated. One was that under proper conditions 
a relatively high temperature is not particularly 
harmful provided it does not go to undue extremes. 
The other was that changes of temperature from day 
to day are of great importance. On the basis of 
these two conclusions it at once became evident that 
the stimulating effect of climates in the same latitude 
and having the same kind of seasonal changes may 
be different. It also becomes clear that the distribu- 
tion of civilization at the present time closely resem- 
bles that of climatic energy. From this the next 
step is naturally back to our previous conclusion that 
changes of climate in the past have consisted largely 
of variations in the location of the storm belt. If 
this is so, evidently the amount of climatic stimulus 
must have varied correspondingly. Thus we are led 
to the final conclusion that, not only at present, but

also in the past, no nation has risen to the highest 
grade of civilization except in regions where the 
climatic stimulus is great. This statement sums up 
our entire hypothesis. It seems to be the inevitable 
result of the facts that are before us. Other explana- 
tions may indeed be offered, and modifications will 
certainly be necessary. Yet unless we have gone 
wholly astray, the surprising way in which independent 
lines of investigation dovetail into one another seems 
to indicate that a favorable climate is an essential 
condition of high civilization. 

In order to account for the decline of early 
centres of civilization it was necessary to show 
that some serious change of climate has oc- 
curred, and an interesting phase of this 
investigation was the study of climatic 
changes as indicated by the rings of Califor- 
nia redwood trees, up to three thousand years 
old, and by the shore lines of desert lakes. 

The suggestive value of Dr. Huntington's 
work is great. If further data confirm his 
present theories, then we have a reasonable 
explanation of the decline of the ancient cul- 
ture centres, not only in the Middle East, but 
in Yucatan and the Andes. We have a 
sounder basis for interpreting the remark- 
able rise of Japan in the last century. We 
have an answer to the problems of "White 
Australia," and in fact to all the problems of 
the white man in the tropics. We shall be 
able to define the "ideal climate," and to take 
measures to avoid the ill effects of an unfavor- 
able one. And there is a material value in this 
research, as well. 

Our knowledge of the effect of both extreme humid- 
ity and extreme dryness is unfortunately still qualita- 
tive rather than quantitative. Some day, however, 
exact figures for all the various climatic elements will 
be obtainable, and we shall construct a map showing 
the actual efficiency to be expected in every part of 
the world. It will be so accurate that the manufac- 
turer, for example, who contemplates establishing a 
factory, will be able to determine the precise efficiency 
of labor in the different places which he has in mind, 
and can put the matter into dollars and cents for 
comparison with the cost of transportation, raw 
materials, and other factors. 

And if, as the present data indicate, certain 
seasons are favorable, and others unfavorable, 
for physical and mental work, then a read- 
justment of methods not only in our factories 
but in our schools and colleges should take 
place. 

The conclusions reached by Dr. Hunting- 
ton are so striking that the reader is likely to 
forget what the preface plainly states, that 
the work deals with but one of many cooperat- 
ing factors in the development of civilization. 
Other factors are "race, religion, institutions, 
and the influence of men of genius," "geo- 
graphical location, topography, soil," and 
other physical conditions. If each of these 
could be studied as scientifically, and with as 
broad a point of view, we would be well ad- 
vanced in our knowledge of how man has 



achieved and how future progress will be won. 
It is to be hoped that Dr. Huntington may be 
able to continue his special work of investiga- 
tion, which in its magnitude really requires 
the cooperation of many observers, until his 
data become abundantly convincing.

TYPES OF REALISM rx RECENT PLATS.* 



Excepting those who insist on a narrow and 
technical definition of realism, I suppose 
everyone would agree that the realistic play is 
the dominant type in recent drama. Defini- 
tion is risky business; but I shall run no 
great risk in saying that I here use the term 
"realistic" in what I conceive to be its 
ordinary sense. By a realistic play I mean 
a play which presents characters at least 
momentarily plausible, in plausible situations, 
and speaking the language of everyday life. 
On this definition, a large majority of the 
grist of plays which come to the reviewer's 
mill are realistic. Nevertheless, these plays 
differ widely in type, and some further dis- 
tinctions will be convenient. For purposes 
of classification, I have found useful a sort of 
scale, which I here offer for what it is worth. 
On the left, as in some legislative assemblies, 
I place the radicals, representing didacticism ; 
on the right, the conservatives, romance, 
farce, melodrama ; and in the centre realism.

that is, tragedies may be didactic, realistic, or 
romantic ; comedies may be didactic, realistic, 
romantic, or farcical. The scheme carries 
with it a convenient subdivision of realism. 
In realism of the centre, the author aims to 
give pleasure through an absolutely truthful 
representation of life as he sees it, subject, 
of course, to the principles of dramatic com- 
position. Neither for the sake of enforcing 
a lesson nor for the sake of an effective situa- 
tion or stage " point" will he sacrifice his sense 
of truth. Realism of the left verges toward 
didacticism; of the right, toward romance, 
farce, or melodrama. Of course the sharply 
drawn lines of such a scale are merely dia- 
grammatic ; a spectrum or scale of colors 
shading into each other would better repre- 
sent the reality. I recognize as clearly as 
anyone that no pigeon-hole plan can take the 
place of criticism ; but any simple scheme of 
classification may be a help to criticism. We 
have, then, three groups of realistic plays, to 
separate which it is impossible to draw hard 
and fast lines, yet which are in the main 
fairly distinct. 

Two plays recently published in the 
"Drama League Series" are excellent ex- 
amples of what I have called realism of the 
right. Bernstein's "The Thief" sacrifices so 
much to situation that it might almost be 
classified as melodrama. The play has been 
acted frequently in this country, and an out- 
line is perhaps scarcely needed. It will be 
recalled that Richard Voysin and his wife, 
Marie-Louise, are visiting at the country 
house of their friends, the Lagardes ; that 
Mme. Lagardes has missed sums of money 
from her secretary drawer, and that the detec- 
tive whom M. Lagardes has brought down 
from the city has found strong evidence point- 
ing toward Fernand, the host's son, who is 
in love with Marie-Louise. Act I ends with 
Fernand 's confession. In Act II, Richard 
Voysin and his wife have retired to their 
room, and Richard discovers that his wife is 
the thief, and that Fernand has assumed the 
guilt to shield her. Richard is furiously jeal- 
ous, though Marie-Louise declares that she 
stole the money only to buy clothes to please 
him, and that she has given Fernand no 
encouragement. This act, which in the literal 
translation is rather indecent, was consider- 
ably modified in the American production. 
But up to this point the dramatist does not 
violently sacrifice character to situation. It 
is only in Act III that he throws reality to 
the winds. The Lagardes show no resentment 
at being robbed by a trusted friend; and 
Richard, at first convinced of his wife's 
infidelity, suddenly and for no adequate rea- 



son, changes his mind and believes her faith- 
ful to him. He even leaves her alone to say 
goodbye to Fernand, and the play ends weakly 
with a sentimental scene in which that youth 
promises his inamorata not to kill himself for 

I love of her. Even Act III is doubtless effect- 
ive on the stage, and the play as a whole is 
skilfully put together. But it is absurd to 
say, as Professor Burton does in his intro- 
duction, that "the author . . penetrates into 
the very heart of character. The psychology 
of Marie-Louise is masterly." On the con- 
trary, the psychology of Marie-Louise is 
largely determined by the exigencies of plot. 
Mr. Buchanan's "A Woman's Way" is 
another example of the "well-made play" 
after the French model. In a prefatory note, 
the author expresses his contempt for "so- 
called 'literary dramas,'" and warns the 
reader that "this comedy acts much better 
than it reads." The mere reader looks for- 
ward with some apprehension of being bored ; 
but his fears are soon allayed. The play is 
ingeniously plotted ; and the dialogue, though 
it has by no means the brilliance of Wilde or 
Shaw, is at least superficially clever and read- 
able. "A Woman's Way" verges on farce 
much as "The Thief" verges on melodrama, 
though it is throughout less real than "The 
Thief." Except for the heroine, the charac- 
ters are the merest lay figures, and the heroine 
is all but impossible. The play is built on 
the ancient triangular foundation. Marion 
Stanton, a young and pretty society woman, 
has become estranged from her husband, a 
nearly worthless rake ; but she still loves him, 
and determines to fight to keep him. Her 
rival is Mrs. Blakemore, of the type "irresist- 
ible to men," and (of course) a woman with 
a past. Howard Stanton, however, is strangely 
blind to this fact. Matters are brought to a 
crisis by an automobile accident in which 

. Stanton and Mrs. Blakemore are involved. 
Marion takes the offensive, and invites Mrs. 
Blakemore to a dinner, inviting also several 
men and their wives. She has reason to 
believe that nearly all these men have had 
previous affairs with Mrs. Blakemore. She 
invites also an old admirer of her own, whom 
she persuades to make love to her in order to 
make her husband jealous. The men sep- 
arately take the innocent Stanton aside and 
call him to account for inviting their wives 
to meet their former mistress. By a good 
piece of acting, Marion bluffs the reporter 
who forces his way in to run down the facts 
as to the accident; and so wins a decisive 
victory on all fronts. Throughout the play 
situation follows situation with almost bewil- 
dering rapidity, and there is a continual

crackle of repartee and local (New York) hits 
in the dialogue. The reader who seeks ideas 
or living human character will be disap- 
pointed; the reader who wants rather 
thoughtless amusement will be abundantly 
satisfied. 

Mr. Vachell's "Searchlights" is a more 
serious piece of work than either of the plays 
just mentioned, but technically a much less 
skilful one. Its theme is the effect of the war 
on two families, one English, the other Ger 
man-English. The capitalist Robert Blaine 
has for years lived at odds with his wife, and 
dislikes and distrusts his spendthrift son 
Harry. His friend Sir Adalbert Schmalz is 
a naturalized and very patriotic Englishman, 
who has invested all his capital in Germany, 
and believes that Germany means peace. His 
loyalty to his adopted country, however, 
stands the test of war. Sir Adalbert's daugh- 
ter Phoebe is in love with Harry Blaine ; and 
he rather likes her, and sees in her father's 
wealth a guarantee of a comfortable life. 
Through the old device of resemblance to a 
photograph, Blaine is confirmed in believing 
what he had long suspected, that Harry is 
the son of his wife 's former lover. He refuses 
to pay Harry's debts unless his wife will give 
him legal ground for divorce by signing a 
statement that Harry is not his son. The 
war comes, and Harry, after engaging him- 
self, debts and all, to Phoebe, goes to France 
with his regiment. He comes back after a 
sunstroke followed by typhoid, and is pro- 
nounced unfit to return to the trenches. To 
secure his happiness, his mother signs the 
hateful statement, and then seriously offers 
to commit suicide if her husband will destroy 
the document and promise never to reveal the 
fact to Harry. This is too much for the 
stony-hearted Blaine, and he destroys the 
paper voluntarily. The outline indicates the 
theatrical character of the story, verging at 
times on melodrama. The plot is not sufficient 
in itself to hold the reader's interest; and the 
characters, with the possible exception of 
Phoebe, do not live. 

The same author 's " Quinneys ', " based upon 
the novel of that name, was, I believe, written 
before "Searchlights," though it has just now 
been published. It belongs in the same group 
of plays, but tends rather toward romance 
than toward melodrama. On the whole, it is 
a much stronger piece of work, containing one 
really memorable character, Quinney himself, 
and having a unity of tone which the later 
play lacks. Posy Quinney, daughter of the 
irascdble and eccentric old dealer in antiques, 
bears rather a strong resemblance to Phoebe 
Schmalz. She is in love with her father's 



foreman, James Miggott, and sometimes after 
her parents have gone to bed meets him in 
her father's "sanctuary," where he has gath- 
ered a priceless collection. In Act I, Quinney 
discovers and reads Posy's note to James, 
making such an appointment. With his wife 
he spies upon the lovers, and shows himself 
at the psychological moment. Though Mrs. 
Quinney turns against him, he is inexorable, 
and requires Posy to choose between him and 
her lover. His wife and daughter leave the 
house in anger, going with James to some 
relatives. Even after he finds they are in 
earnest, Quinney will not yield; and with 
great pertinacity and ingenuity he strives to 
break off the match. Of course he does not 
succeed; but in the struggle his own best 
traits are revealed to his wife and daughter, 
and the play ends with reconciliation. Prob- 
ably it owes its success in about equal parts 
to the novel and attractive setting, to the 
character of Quinney, and to the pretty and 
not altogether unreal love story. The changes 
from novel to play might be made the text for 
a little disquisition on the limitations which 
the taste of the theatre-going public imposes 
on the playwright. The love story must end 
happily; therefore the character of the lover 
(who in the novel is a rascal) must be 
changed, and Quinney must be proved wrong 
in his judgment of him. But there still 
remain in the play a number of indications 
that Quinney was right. In the novel, Quin- 
ney has really been a party to a dishonest 
transaction, and James really tries to black- 
mail him. Quinney shows the essential 
soundness of his character by risking ruin 
rather than give his daughter to a scoundrel, 
and James is shown up and goes off in dis- 
grace. But this is a little too complex for 
the average audience ; if Quinney has deviated 
from strict honesty in the slightest particular, 
he is in danger of losing their sympathy. 
Furthermore, it will not do for the play- 
wright to represent James as actually trying 
to blackmail his employer, for James is to 
win the heroine. Thus what is really the 
finest dramatic touch in the novel the 
searching test of Quinney 's manhood through 
James's attack on him is sacrificed to the 
public demand for a love story with a happy 
ending. 

We turn to a group of plays representing 
what I have called realism of the left, plays 
containing a didactic element, in which the 
dramatist wishes to emphasize some thesis 
through a more or less realistic representation 
of life. Very obviously didactic is Mr. Middle- 
ton's latest one-act play, "Criminals." The 
criminals are the highly respectable parents 



470 



THE DIAL 



[May 11 



who allow their daughter to marry in ignor- 
ance of the nature of the sex relation. They 
are sitting quietly at home in a reminiscent 
mood on the evening after their daughter's 
wedding ; it appears that she and her husband 
are to spend the night at a hotel in the city 
before starting on their honeymoon. The 
telephone rings, and their son-in-law informs 
them that Janet is on her way home, and that 
he is about to follow her. The girl appears, 
in a semi-hysterical condition. Before her 
husband's arrival, she reproaches her parents 
bitterly for their neglect. On his appearance 
she locks herself in her room and refuses even 
to speak to him. The play ends thus, rather 
inconclusively, but with the suggestion that 
they did not all live happily ever afterward. 
Mr. Middleton handles the difficult situation 
delicately; perhaps if he had had a keener 
sense of humor he would not have handled it 
at all. He assures us that the play "was 
founded on an actual occurrence," and that 
he has since heard of many similar experi- 
ences. But surely ignorance in this degree is 
exceptional ; and granting its occasional exist- 
ence, Mr. Middleton takes it too seriously. 
Even complete ignorance could scarcely wreck 
a marriage without the help of other forces. 
Janet's husband is a gentleman, willing to 
make every allowance for her ; and the reader 
does not despair of her ultimate happiness, 
though apparently the dramatist does. All 
the characters are the merest types ; the play 
illustrates the tendency of the didactic drama 
to turn away from the individual in charac- 
terization, and toward the typical. 

I hesitate somewhat to classify Herr Franz 
Beyerlein's "Taps" ("Zapfenstreich") in 
this group; for although it is clearly anti- 
militarist in purpose and effect, the author 
nowhere allows his thesis to interfere with 
dramatic truth. The theme is the cruel injus- 
tice which results from the German military 
caste system. The author is an Austrian who 
probably for personal reasons chose to expose 
the German army instead of that of his own 
nation. The play was very successful in Ger- 
many, and the Kaiser forbade officers and 
soldiers to attend it in uniform, which sug- 
gests that its blow at militarism went home. 
Yet personally all the officers in the story 
except one appear in an attractive light, and 
the exception himself seems the weak victim 
of a bad system rather than positively corrupt 
himself. The central characters are Sergeant- 
Major Volkhardt, a veteran of the Franco- 
Prussian "War who is beloved by the whole 
regiment, his daughter Clara, and Lieutenant 
Von Lauffen. At the beginning of the play 
we learn that Clara is in love with Von 



Lauffen, and is accustomed to visit him in 
his rooms after taps has sounded ; in a chance 
interview in her father's office, she promises 
to visit her lover that night. Meantime 
Helbig, Clara's foster-brother, has returned 
from the riding-school where he has spent 
two years. He is in love with Clara, and was 
informally engaged to her before he went 
away. Clara receives him coldly, but makes 
him promise to say nothing of the change in 
her to her father. Helbig 's suspicion of Von 
Lauffen is at once aroused; and in Act II, 
soon after Clara's arrival at Von Lauffen 's 
rooms, he knocks at the door. Von Lauffen 
sends her into the bedroom, hoping to get rid 
of Helbig; but the latter demands answers 
to his questions. Refusal to answer only con- 
firms his belief, and he insists on entering 
the bedroom. Though Von Lauffen strikes 
him with his sabre, Helbig succeeds in open- 
ing the door, and catches a glimpse of Clara. 
He is at once arrested at Von Lauffen 's order, 
and court-martialled for assaulting a superior 
officer. At the trial in Act III, Helbig admits 
his guilt, refusing to implicate Clara ; but the 
officers in charge are just and patient, and 
reluctant to condemn him. At last Clara 
herself gains admittance to the trial, and 
reveals the whole truth. Poor Volkhardt is 
restrained by main force from attacking Von 
Lauffen on the spot. In Act IV, he visits 
Von Lauffen 's chambers and demands satis- 
faction. The young lieutenant will neither 
marry the girl nor fight a non-commissioned 
officer. At the crisis Clara, who has followed 
her father, appears, and takes upon herself 
the whole blame of the affair. In a flash of 
anger the old man turns his revolver upon 
her and fires. Thus the play, without any 
direct attack, and adhering strictly to dra- 
matic truth, presents a striking and terrible 
indictment of the inhuman system with its 
iron lines of caste. The action is skilfully 
developed, and the characters, especially Volk- 
hardt, Clara, and Von Lauffen, are strongly 
and vividly drawn. The play has been well 
translated. 

The difficulty of any exact classification of 
realistic plays is illustrated by the next two 
on our list. Neither can properly be called 
a play with a thesis; neither advocates or 
even points the way to any particular reform ; 
yet each is intended to exemplify a central 
idea, a generalization in regard to human con- 
duct. Mr. David Pinski's "The Treasure" 
is, the translator tells us, "the first play of 
the modern Jewish theatre to be offered to 
an English reading audience." The nature of 
"The Treasure" is not such as to make us 
wish ardently for more of these Yiddish 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



471 



plays. The dialogue is painstakingly realis- 
tic, to the point of dulness ; and in proportion 
to the action there is a great deal too much 
of it. The chief characters are the family 
of a Jewish grave-digger in a town within the 
Russian Pale. The life represented is sordid 
and unattractive; yet the philosophy of the 
play is really hopeful. The central idea 
(emphasized by a sort of epilogue spoken by 
the dead) is that the desire for money is not 
altogether base, but is really a form of aspira- 
tion after greater freedom and a fuller life. 
Judke, the half-witted and epileptic son of 
the grave-digger Chone, discovers when he 
buries his dog a number of gold coins; and 
bringing them home gives them to his sister 
Tille, a girl who is starving for pleasure. She 
goes out and spends most of the money for 
fine clothes and gewgaws. The rumor of the 
treasure trove spreads rapidly, and Chone and 
his family become at once the objects of atten- 
tion from marriage brokers, synagogue 
authorities, and representatives of Jewish 
charitable societies. The old people are 
driven nearly crazy by these visitations, and 
at last Chone tries to get rid of his new 
friends by telling them the exact truth. The 
result is that the whole Jewish community 
invades the cemetery, hoping to find the rest 
of the treasure. Judke at last remembers the 
place where the dog was buried, on the grave 
of a distinguished rabbi; but further dig- 
ging results only in the mutilation of the 
rabbi's corpse, and in the finding of four 
more golden coins. After the cemetery is 
deserted, the dead rise from the tombs to 
point the moral. As a detailed picture of the 
wretchedness of Jewish poverty within the 
Pale, the play has value. But its wordiness, 
endless repetition, and gray monotony of 
tone make it dull reading. 

A much better play is M. Paul Hervieu's 
"The Trail of the Torch," first produced in 
1901, and now translated for the "Drama 
League Series." The theme is the willing 
self-sacrifice of the older generation to their 
children. The torch represents the joy of 
life, handed on by each generation to the next 
as in the festival of the torch race at Athens. 
Says the heroine to a friend in the first act, 
speaking of another friend: "She has ceased 
to have any personal existence. Sne no 
longer cares to have anything of her own; 
everything belongs to her daughter, and her 
husband works his fingers to the bone to pay 
for Beatrice's dresses, while Beatrice lords it 
over both of them in a way that is beginning 
to be just a trifle odious." Her friend 
replies: "I'm afraid I don't agree with you, 
Madame. With naively natural beings like 



these, I enjoy watching the family wheels 
function with such simplicity. People of this 
kind conform to the law which begins by 
demanding of the mother . . often her 
beauty, her health, and if need be, her life, 
for the formation of her child. And then, 
for the profit of the newer generation, Nature 
exerts herself to despoil the old. She exacts 
without stint from the parents . . all of their 
vital forces to equip, arm, and decorate their 
sons and daughters." The heroine, who is 
devoted to her mother as well as to her daugh- 
ter, stoutly combats this theory, but her own 
later conduct illustrates it. First she sac- 
rifices to her daughter the prospect of a happy 
marriage of her own, and for this her 
daughter afterward reproaches her. Later, 
compelled by an unusual combination of cir- 
cumstances to choose between risking her 
mother's life and risking her daughter's, she 
makes the inevitable choice, only to find after 
her mother's death that she holds a distinctly 
second place in her daughter's affections. 
The play is not only well constructed, indeed 
almost perfect in its logical plan, but thought- 
ful and suggestive. The characters are 
admirably drawn; yet for some reason even 
the heroine does not evoke our keen sym- 
pathy. She lacks sympathetic imagination. 
This, of course, is her "tragic weakness." and 
is so intended by the dramatist ; but it is not 
an amiable weakness, and this fact hurts the 
play. 

With less philosophical interest thaii these 
two plays, "Garside's Career" makes a much 
stronger human appeal than either of them. 
It clearly belongs to the "realism of the 
centre" group ; it has no proposition to prove 
or illustrate, and its wholesome solid human- 
ity makes the surface cleverness of such a play 
as "A Woman's Way" seem cheap and trashy 
enough. Though not a work of genius, it is 
an honest and intelligent study of live people. 
Peter Garside is a young Socialist workman, 
who, encouraged by his mother and by his 
school-teacher sweetheart Margaret Shawcross, 
works his way through college, apparently 
a rather rare achievement in England. He 
is a clever speaker, and against the advice of 
Margaret, who knows his weakness, he accepts 
an invitation to stand for Parliament as the 
Labor candidate. He is elected, and his head 
is turned by his success. He neglects his 
Parliamentary duties to make fiery speeches 
all over the kingdom. Having quarrelled with 
Margaret, he falls in love with the daughter 
of a Tory manufacturer, who is amused and 
rather flattered by his attentions, and some- 
what impressed by his Napoleonic self-con- 



472

fidence. His constituents find him out and 
force his resignation, and his career comes 
to a sudden end. In a most amusing scene, 
Margaret cures him of playing the martyred 
man of genius. All the characters are vigor- 
ously drawn, and the play has excellent acting 
qualities. 

Finally, we have to consider two plays by 
Mr. St. John G. Ervine, which reach a higher 
level than any others discussed in this review. 
Mr. Ervine is by all odds the strongest of 
the "new" men who have published plays 
within the past year. Before "Jane Clegg," 
he had to his credit a couple of novels, a 
volume of short stories, and four Irish plays, 
which have just been published in this coun- 
try and will be noticed in a later review in 
THE DIAL. Mr. Ervine writes for the Abbey 
Theatre in Dublin, and it is natural to com- 
pare him first with the earlier successful play- 
wrights of that theatre. It is not too much 
to say that as a dramatist he easily surpasses 
them all. Mr. Yeats is of course primarily 
a poet, not a dramatist. Synge at his best 
is superior to Mr. Ervine in sheer imaginative 
power ; but a large part of his work is tainted 
with a kind of insanity, and he has nothing 
like Mr. Ervine 's firm grasp of reality. Lady 
Gregory is often charming, but nearly always 
wordy; all her best work is in the one-act 
form, and in comparison with Mr. Ervine 's 
it appears superficial. It is noteworthy that 
Mr. Ervine has escaped or thrown off most 
of the mannerisms of the Irish school, and 
that he is not, like the others, narrowly 
national. The scene and characters of "Jane 
Clegg" are English; that of the other plays 
are Northern Irish. To find his match, we 
must turn to the real masters of the new 
English drama, to Galsworthy and Masefield. 

Both of Mr. Ervine 's plays are par excel- 
lence realism of the centre ; and both are 
tragedies of humble life. Jane Clegg is a 
woman of strong character and intelligence, 
married to a weak, unfaithful, and dishonor- 
able man. She has two children ; and having 
received a small legacy from an aunt, is keep- 
ing the money for their education, though 
her husband, Henry, has tried in every way 
to wheedle or force her to give it up. Henry, 
a travelling man who earns good wages, is in 
trouble because of debt to a "bookie," and 
because his kept mistress expects a child. 
He yields to a temptation thrown in his way 
by accident to appropriate a sum of money 
due to his employers, his intention being to 
run away with his mistress to Canada. But 
the theft is discovered too soon, and his wife 
undertakes to make good the loss. He tells 
her that he took the money to pay certain 



gambling and other debts. When she learns 
that the gambling debts are unpaid and the 
others fictitious, and that Henry has been 
steadily unfaithful to her, she pays his debts 
and sends him away to his mistress. His 
character comes out admirably in his parting 
request to her, to take care of his old and 
irritable mother, who is certain to spend the 
rest of her life in blaming Jane for Henry's 
downfall. Such a sketch of the action can 
give little idea of the power in the play. 
Jane Clegg, for all her sordid associations, is 
a tragic figure ; and Henry and Mrs. Clegg 
are portrayed with the keenest insight and 
with rare dramatic economy. 

"John Ferguson," the later of the two 
plays, is the tragedy of a small farmer in 
Ulster, deeply and sincerely religious. In old 
age and sickness, John is threatened with 
eviction from his home through foreclosure 
of a mortgage held by the brutal and grasp- 
ing banker, Henry Witherow. He has writ- 
ten for help to his prosperous brother in 
America, but has received no reply. The only 
hope is that his daughter Hannah may con- 
sent to marry James Caesar, a middle-aged 
grocer who has been ill-treated by Witherow 
and hates him. Caesar promises to pay off 
the mortgage if Hannah will have him. To 
please her father she consents ; but soon finds 
that she cannot endure the thought of the 
marriage. She is sent to Witherow to inform 
him that the debt cannot be paid. He violates 
her; and the vengeance vainly threatened by 
her coward lover is carried out by her brother 
Andrew. Meantime, the expected letter from 
America comes, with the money to pay off 
the mortgage. After a struggle first with his 
own conscience and then with his parents, 
Andrew gives himself up to justice, and Han- 
nah goes with him to give him comfort. The 
old people are left alone, John Ferguson 
with his profound faith unshaken, and read- 
ing in his sorrow the story of David and 
Absalom. The central figure is always the 
patriarchal John; his is the suffering and 
the faith of Job, without Job's reward. His 
part is less tragic, in the strict sense of the 
word, than Jane Clegg 's, for he does not 
struggle, he only endures. And the charac- 
ters %re on the whole less sharply individu- 
alized than in the earlier play. Yet "John 
Ferguson" makes a deeper appeal to the 
imagination, through its fine unity of tone, 
its noble simplicity, and its profound pathos. 
Never, I believe, have the tragedies of every- 
day life been presented in dramatic form 
more truthfully or more poignantly than in 

these plays. -^ , TT

RECENT FICTIOX.* 

Imagination. I suppose, is the main thing in 
Mr. -Jack London's work, the complete fill- 
ing out of an idea, the development of it. the 
application to every detail, the following out 
in every direction, and the whole held in mind 
securely enough for him to describe it and 
write it down. It does not seem to matter to 
him whether he is thinking about the relapse 
of civilization into barbarism, about the rein- 
carnation of a single soul in many forms, 
about the down-and-outs of the world, about a 
mutiny on board a tramp steamship, about 
prehistoric men and women, about how he 
used to drink, or indeed what it is. The main 
point is that if he thinks of it at all, he thinks 
it out. This, I should say. was imaginative, 
whether he happen to think of one thing or 
another. It is not really more imaginative 
to construct a new civilization than to recon- 
struct an old one. You must have materials 
and use them, but the manner of use seems 
to be the main thing. "The Little Lady of 
the Big House " is, then, quite as imaginative 
a piece of work as "The Star Rover" or "The 
Red Plague." and we can form a better judg- 
ment of it than we can of those works because i 
we have more idea of the circumstances, and 
therefore can get some notion of how well the 
imagination works. 

Dick Forrest, with whom the book begins, is 
an example of absolutely perfect efficiency, 
the sort of man who has every gift and pos- 
session that can be imagined, who does every 
thing that any one can think of with the most 
absolute ease and simplicity because he has 
arranged beforehand exactly how he can do 
it easily and simply; who lives, in fact, the 
mast wonderfully perfect life that can be 
thought of. He was a millionaire by inheri- 
tance, but early in life understood that it was 
best to have a wider experience than million- 
aires generally have, and therefore became a 
hobo for a time. He became an administra- 
tor; but having broad tastes, he used his 
powers to manage a great estate with regard 
not only to the development of its material 
resources but also to the arranging of the 
social side in quite as effective a manner. 
From the moment he wakes in the morning 
to the last instant of consciousness in the 
evening, everything goes right. He is a genius 
at perfection, a sort of god in his own self- 
i n vented machine, a master of specialists who

do everything they undertake in the very best 
way. 

It is hard enough for anyone to imagine 
even that such a thing is possible. It appears 
to be easy for Mr. London to imagine not 
only that it is possible but exactly how it is 
possible. If he had such an estate himself, 
he could hardly be more detailed. He oblit- 
erates the old distinction between theory and 
practice, which rises from the fact that the 
theorist is generally too lazy to think out 
details or otherwise unable to do so. Mr. 
London is neither lazy nor unable. He 
delights in detail, and spends almost half the 
book in telling what happened in a day. 

All this is exciting and exhilarating at first, 
but in course of time (like all sorts of other 
things excellent in themselves) it becomes 
rather tedious. Hence, along in the after- 
noon Mr. Evan Graham enters the story. His 
function and purpose may be imagined when 
we add that in all the efficient perfection of 
the Big House there was one little rift which 
(one will perhaps guess) arises from the 
existence of the Little Lady in it. Dick 
Forrest and his wife are devotedly attached: 
but it will probably be remarked at once that 
when Mrs. Forrest comes from her own patio 
to her husband's office at about eleven in the 
morning he pressed her closely to his side, 
"kissed her, but with insistent fore-finger 
maintained his place in the pages of the 
pamphlet" about hog-cholera. 

Perhaps it is not necessary to tell more of 
the book, or to explain further why it is not 
more interesting. For interesting it certainly 
is not, after the first few pages. Perhaps that 
is because it is not credible that a man who 
knows so much about running a stock-farm 
should be satisfied with anything but the 
stock-farm itself. If he is satisfied with writ- 
ing about, it, we feel that there must be 
something impracticable about his imagina- 
tion. If it will not work we do not believe in 
it. and if we do not believe in it (for the 
moment) we do not care for it. A sad but 
real paradox of the artistic life! 

An equally imposing work of the imagina- 
tion is Mr. Harre 's "Behold the "Woman!" 
Like Mr. London, Mr. Harre gives us all the 
details; where he gets them one can hardly 
conceive, but there they are. Whatever is 
in the book is there in immense detail. If 
there are purveyors of food, they have "bread, 
millet cakes, cheeses, dried mutton, fruits, 
peaches, Shami apples. Sultani citrons, 
oranges, almonds, figs, and resin-covered skins 
of wine. " If there are jewels in a coffer they 
are "necklaces of rubies, emeralds, and peach- 
colored pearls; wristbands and armhoops of

beryl, jade, chalcedony, coral, and chrysolite ; 
apodesmes of agate, lapis lazuli, and topaz; 
girdles of strung sapphires and carved tur- 
quoises; anklets dangling with onyx, jasper, 
and jacinth ; brooches set with great ame- 
thysts, carbuncles, and opals; ear-rings, curi- 
ously carved, representing winged creatures, 
studded with a myriad tiny gems, and serpen- 
tine, triple-horned, and crescent-shaped, ruby 
and diamond diadems." When Mary comes 
from her bath, her toilet assumes the char- 
acter of a dramatic panorama : she murmurs 
praises of her beauty while her negro slaves 
chant responsive rhapsodies; she continues 
her rhythmical purlings while her slaves 
scrape her with a strigil and rub her with 
essence of saffron flowers and jasmine ; she 
sings her own charms while the black women 
paint her lips and her breasts, burnish her 
finger-nails, scent her body, and do other 
things. Every noun becomes a page, and 
every sentence a chapter. 

Mr. Harre has taken for his subject one of 
the most remarkable things that happen, the 
passing of a soul from darkness to light, from 
insatiable desire to peace, from evil to good. 
But the remarkable element in this remark- 
able happening is (to my mind, at least) 
something that not only does not need elab- 
oration of a quantitative character but that 
will not endure it. One of the best known 
and most effective accounts of such a happen- 
ing is also one of the simplest, namely, that 
given in the seventh chapter of Luke, to which 
Mr. Harre alludes, the story of the woman 
that was a sinner and how she came to sin 
no more. It seems impossible that anyone 
who has read that account could imagine that 
it would be made more effective, or nearly as 
effective, by elaboration of detail. 

Such stories are often told by those who 
know most about them, namely, the persons 
who have themselves passed through the 
experience which is being told of. And it 
may often be noted that when such tellers 
make a mistake (and they often do) it is 
likely to be because they tell us too much of 
the evil from which they have been rescued, 
and more rarely by saying too much of the 
good that they have attained. Few are able to 
say much, and none too much, of the thing 
of most importance, the wonderful change 
itself which they feel has taken place within 
them. That is almost always a thing still 
wonderful to themselves, such that by no 
effort can they say much of anything about 
it. If we understand the little they can say, 
it is generally because we grasp by sympathy, 
perhaps by real fellow-feeling, what it is that 
they are trying to describe to us. 



For some such reason as this (if for no 
other) does Mr. Harre seem to me to labor 
in vain in his elaboration of the circumstances 
of Mary's life as a courtesan. Mr. Harre 
feels that some who read his story will find 
what may seem shocking, brutal, wanton, and 
terrible; and he points out that his book is 
not written for children, but for men, and the 
mothers and wives of men. Probably there 
is a good deal in the book which may shock 
even mothers and wives; but that does not 
seem anything very exceptional in current 
fiction, and the only question that would 
arise in most minds is whether they are 
shocked to any good purpose. 

Frankly, I do not think they are. I can- 
not see any more good in the elaborate details 
of Mary 's life in Alexandria than in M. Pierre 
Louys's earlier imaginations of the same 
thing, unless it be good to give such a con- 
fused notion of the whole thing that no one 
can really have any idea at all. Mr. Harre 
is doubtless serious, and it is only right to 
meet him on his own ground. "In Mary, the 
powerful Alexandrian courtesan," he writes, 
"whose beauty in its day was truly the 
glory of Egypt, is represented the eternal 
struggle of womankind over man's age-long 
injustice and exploitation, a struggle today 
finding its expression among those clear- 
visioned and valiant women who are demand- 
ing their right to equal place with men in 
the affairs of the nations." Had he not so 
written, I feel that few would have caught his 
idea. The actual impression of his book can- 
not be either of the eternal struggle of woman- 
kind or, as it seems to offer itself, of the 
eternal salvation of one woman, or of any- 
thing actually happening or ever having 
happened in the world. His detailed imag- 
ination meets the same fate as Mr. Jack 
London's. It lacks the touch of life, the 
only thing which makes us do the imagining 
ourselves. 

It is a relief to turn from such elaborated 
realism to the frank impossibilities of Mr. 
Edgar Jepson's "Alice Devine." Indeed, it 
may not be an impossibility that Lord 
Garthoyle, who had only five thousand pounds 
as an income, should inherit from his uncle 
twenty-five thousand pounds a year more on 
condition that he would act as his own agent 
in looking after the houses in Garthoyle Gar- 
dens. There seems no valid reason why such 
things should not be. And granted this fun- 
damental, everything becomes easy, and very 
much funnier than the normal mind would 
suppose it would be. Mr. Jepson's imagina- 
tion is of a different kind from Mr. London's 
or Mr. Harre 's. Somehow, when you once

imagine an impossibility (I cannot get it out 
of my head that the house-agent idea is impos- 
sible) you can suggest all kinds of things 
that are not only very possible but that seem 
quite probable, while if you begin on a real 
historic fact it seems as though every elab- 
oration became not only less suggestive but 
more impossible. 

Whether that is so or not, I read with 
equanimity and pleasure of J. Quintus 
Scruton, gum-millionaire from New Zealand, 
who occupied No. 9 Garthoyle Gardens and 
paid no rent because he arranged that Mr. 
Garthoyle should think his house haunted, and 
how the new house-agent visited the house and 
interviewed the ghost. Then the new house- 
agent, being this time Lord Garthoyle in his 
automobile, fell in with half-a-dozen children 
and a young lady who was playing with 
them, and took them all for a ride in the 
country, where they disclosed the fact that 
they were anarchists while he talked with the 
young lady, who reminded him strangely of 
the ghost whom he had interviewed shortly 
before. And so on with the rest of the book. 
Perfectly absurd each adventure, of course, 
the strange marks on the house that were 
thought to be messages from more anarchists, 
the empty house full of snakes that at the 
proper moment came out of their basket and 
bit their wicked owner. Quite absurd, and fit 
only for the tired business man; and yet on 
such a framework Mr. Jepson manages to 
give more sense of actuality than in the piled- 
up and thorough-paced facts which we so 
often meet with elsewhere. I prefer another 
kind still, the story that comes so direct 
from a keen sense of the reality of something 
that it carries with it still the sense of an 
actuality that gives us for the time the illu- 
sion of dealing with real people and things, 
and leaves us with the same sort of impression 
that we really have from people and things. 
But such stories are rare just at present.

Adjustment 
to life in 
past ages. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

Amidst the present ringing on the 
anvils 6f material events and the 
daily readjustment of things, it 
becomes the part of wise people occasionally to 
turn to the past and the great leaders of the past, 
stopping the ears to the din of the present and 
trying to catch the fundamental chord of Eternity. 
This has been the purpose of Mr. Henry 
Osborn Taylor in his recent book, "Deliverance" 
(Macmillan). Out of a rich and fertile erudition, 
the author recalls "those individuals who most 
clearly illustrate phases of human adjustment with 



life, its limitations, aspirations, and conceived 
determining powers, working within or from with- 
out." He remembers that "the needs of men are 
not the same universally; and the human adjust- 
ment may relate to conduct or to speculation, to 
distress at life's chain of torment, or to fear of 
extinction; it may relate to the impulse to specu- 
late and know, or to the need to be ' saved.' " The 
choice of these classic human adjusters is perforce 
somewhat conventional, but it is catholic in its 
breadth and wide in its sympathy and interpreta- 
tion. Beginning with the early gropings in 
Chaldaea and Egypt, the author treats succinctly 
China's messages of duty and detachment from the 
mouths of Confucius and Lao-tsze; the Indian 
solution by annihilation of individuality in the 
Upanishads and in the Paths of Gotama; the fiery 
militant adjustment to Mazda by Zarathushtra, the 
Prophet of Iran; the progressive revelations of 
the prophets of Israel in their efforts to adjust 
themselves to the growing conception of Yahweh, 
and especially the growth of individual conscience 
out of the earlier national conscience. (In 
America we shall need to reverse this latter 
process.) Then follow a charming account of the 
heroic adjustment by courage and fortitude as seen 
in the heroes of Homer, and a remarkably adequate 
discussion, for such brief compass, of the clear- 
eyed wisdom of the Greek philosophers. Thales, 
Anaximander, Anaximenes, Herach'tus, Democri- 
tus, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle pass before us 
in coherent glimpses, the adjustment rising in the 
last three to "the sublimest satisfaction of con- 
summate intellectual appetition." Next comes the 
confused welter of the later Greece-Roman world, 
where Mithra and Osiris, Lucretius and the Stoics, 
Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius pave the 
way for what the author regards in some respects 
as the final adjustment, that of Jesus in establish- 
ing the filial relation between God and man. Fol- 
lowing this are clear presentations of Paul and 
Augustine, in the latter especially the expediential 
adjustment of the Early Christian Church in the 
Western World becoming evident. Here the 
author ends; he does not attempt to follow the 
spirit of man in its complex strivings through 
the last millenium and a half. Indeed, in 
this little book of fewer than three hundred pages 
he has accomplished marvels in the way of com- 
pression. In general, the effect of the study is 
cumulative toward Christianity, which is presented 
as the final religious adjustment. Yet the very last 
word is, like the charactertistic religious utterances 
of our time, a question rather than an answer: 
"Less rapturous, more analytic, tempers also may 
conclude that only infinite life is suited to eternity : 
not man, but God." 



Lord Alfred Douglas once said 
publicly of Mr. Robert H. Sherard : 
"He writes books on Oscar Wilde. 
He is always writing books on Oscar Wilde. He 
does nothing else. It is, I believe, his sole source 
of income." This statement is quoted with amus- 
ing frankness by Mr. Sherard in the foreword to 
his latest study of his favorite topic, the book

[May 11 



being entitled "The Real Oscar Wilde" (McKay) 
and serving as a supplement (of 431 pages) to 
his well-known biography of Wilde which was 
issued ten years ago. The two portly volumes 
together ought to satisfy almost any lover of the 
brilliant but ill-fated apostle of a3stheticism. Of 
course the "real" Wilde as portrayed in this sec- 
ond book can be no other than the writer's admired 
friend whom the first work has already quite fully 
presented. Additional incidents and anecdotes are 
offered in abundance in the book's twenty-six gen- 
erously illustrated chapters. We learn for instance, 
in illustration of Wilde's talent for making enemies 
by his mordant sayings, that one of his most mis- 
chievous enemies was "an actor whom he had criti- 
cised for appearing in a New York drawing-room 
wearing his gloves during an afternoon call." The 
author observes in another connection: "In forty- 
six years from now the world won't be troubling 
about how a poet squabbled in the last century 
with the second son of an eighth marquess; it will 
have other tremendous problems to face." Has it 
not even now too many such problems to afford 
much time for reading the details, minutely per- 
sonal in large part, so industriously brought 
together in this book? Nevertheless, to Wilde 
enthusiasts the work will strongly appeal. 



A Carlylean 
disciple on 
the war. 



An attack of giddiness or vertigo is 
likely to be the result of any attempt 
to plough through the pages of Mr. 
Marshall Kelly's "Carlyle and the War" (Open 
Court Co.). "The conclusion," says the author, 
"will be written if at all, after the war is over." 
We beg him to forbear, unless in the interval, be 
it long or short, he has learned to use intelligible 
language. Imitating the styles of such authors as 
Browning, Meredith, and Carlyle has been a favor- 
ite form of amusement among writers with a taste 
for parody, and when offered in small doses this 
sort of thing is not without interest. But to have 
a book of considerable length written in a con- 
scious or unconscious imitation of the inimitable 
dialect of Carlyle is intolerable, and the more so 
in direct proportion to the reader's reverence for 
that great nineteenth century prophet. How the 
author has succeeded in maintaining throughout 
the jump, the hop, the hiatus, and the limp that 
form this wild caricature of Carlyle's writing, 
passes an ordinary man's comprehension. The 
result has been the spoiling of what might other- 
wise have been a useful book. The general point 
of view from which the author surveys the world- 
tragedy of to-day is one that requires emphasis 
among English-speaking peoples. Every reason- 
able thinker should be willing, whatever his natural 
pre-dispositions may be, to listen patiently to a 
frankly pro-German writer, and to make allowance 
for such explosive language as the due expression 
of sympathies may require. But when one's liter- 
ary sense is nauseated at the very start by a jargon 
that is neither good Carlylese nor readable English 
the arguments of the writer are likely to be re- 
jected along with the disagreeable medium in which 
they are conveyed. Apart, however, from this 
almost insuperable obstacle to a full understanding 



of Mr. Kelly's opinions, we venture to join issue 
'with him in what we do seem to understand, his 
argument that because of Carlyle's devotion to 
German genius and German literature his general 
attitude towards the part that country has played 
from the day when Belgium was first outraged 
would have differed from that of the average 
Englishman of to-day. It is surely unnecessary to 
remind Mr. Kelly that the Germany represented 
by Goethe, Schiller, Fichte, Richter, and Kant is 
not the Germany of Nietzsche, Treitschke, Bern- 
hardi, and the Kaiser. In imagination we see the 
shade of Carlyle protesting in indignation against 
not only the caricaturing of his chosen medium 
of expression, but against the assumption that his 
love for those great souls who owed their birth to 
Germany must necessarily commit him to a blind 
support of that country, right or wrong. 



in Eastern ^ n more than one masterpiece of 

lands of rhythm and romance for exam- 

ple, Pierre Loti's "Vers Ispahan "- 
Persia and Turkestan are portrayed as regions of 
enchantment. Presumably on that account, and 
also because, even in these days of dauntless globe- 
trotting, very few Europeans or Americans ever 
penetrate to Kashan or Samarkand, the prevailing 
conception of these lands is somewhat rose-colored. 
At all events, a recent visitor, Mr. Benjamin 
Burges Moore, gives in his book, "From Moscow 
to the Persian Gulf" (Putnam), a report which 
quite belies the current impression. The three- 
months' journey whose events and gleanings are 
recorded in the volume led the author by sail from 
Moscow to Tashkent, Samarkand, Merv, and 
Askhabad; thence by carriage and camel-train to 
Mashad, Kashan, and finally Bushire on the Persian 
Gulf; and thence by boat to Mascat and Karachi 
on the Indian frontier. The record of the trip is 
set down in diary form, and from first to last it 
makes an interesting recital. There is forced upon 
the reader, however, the feeling that Mr. Moore's 
view-point has been largely that of the vexed tour- 
ist, and that he has been more impressed by the 
lack of means of comfortable travel than by the 
ancient habits and the historic places that fell 
under his eye. It is true that he professes merely 
to have "noted a traveller's passing impressions as 
accurately as possible, not pretending to judge a 
historic race by the observation of a single visit." 
But the candid admission can hardly atone for 
the prevailing superficiality of view and for the 
deficient historic and artistic interest displayed 
throughout the book. The photographs in which 
the volume abounds are generally excellent.

Leslie, a brilliant young Irishman, 
an Eton and Cambridge graduate, has indulged 
in sundry reflections and reminiscences, which are 
offered in book form to the reading public. "The

because its writer imagines himself to have "wit- 
nessed the suicide of the civilization called Chris-

tian and the travail of a new era to which no 
gods have been as yet rash enough to give their 

name." He briefly reviews his "links with the | 
past," his descent from "the Fighting Bishop," 
John Leslie, through the tatter's great-grandson's 

grandson, Sir John Leslie, also a militant charac- ! 

ter; he gives us glimpses of life at Eton and Cam- 

bridge, a short chapter on the Hanoverian dyn- \ 

asty, one on the religion of England, another on j 
English politicians, and a well-informed one on 
Ireland, the land of his birth ; and finally, after a 

glance at the good old England of sport and free- | 

dom, he pictures "society in decay" and the mani- j 

festations of a decadent "post-Victorianism." The j 

call to arms he regards as a piece of good fortune. : 

"In a moment of time all the troubles and worries ! 

and threatenings of politics became ante-diluvian, j 

and the nation stepped down to do battle with | 

the cleansing flood!" He has certainly earned in | 

the smoke and heat of battle the right to glorify j 
war if he still thinks it glorious. 



The Southern 
attitude in 
the Civil War. 



On the fiftieth anniversary of the I 
downfall of the Confederacy there 
comes from the Johns Hopkins I 
Press "The Creed of the Old South" by Dr. Basil j 
L. Gildersleeve, the loved and honored professor j 
of the classics in Johns Hopkins University. The 
little book contains two essays: one from which 
the book takes its title; the other entitled "A 
Southerner in the Peloponnesian War." The first 
essay was printed in "The Atlantic Monthly" in 
1892; the other one in the same periodical in 
1897. Dr. Gildersleeve offers these essays not as 
a history of the Civil War or as an account of his I 
own experiences, but rather as an interpretation ! 
of the feelings and actions of one Confederate 
soldier who, perhaps, was representative of many 
others. "I am trying," he says, "to make others 
understand, and to understand myself, what it was 
to accept with a whole heart the ' creed of the old 
south.' " The title essay undertakes to explain the 
Southerner's attitude toward the issues which 
resulted in the Civil War: the South was fighting 
for civil liberty, not to perpetuate human slavery; j 
fighting for love of state a form of patriotism I 
closely allied to love of home and not incompatible 
with attachment to the Union; fighting against 
submission to encroachment which to them meant 
slavery. As to slavery, most of the Southern j 
people had no theory about it, though the aboli- 
tionist was looked upon rather as an enemy to j 
society than as a friend to the negro. Whether I 
opposed to or in favor of secession, the Confed- 
erate soldier went with a clear conscience into | 
the war. In the second essay Dr. Gildersleeve, who 
went from teaching Greek to the Confederate Army 
and back from Lee and Early to Aristophanes and 
Thucydides, traces the similarities of the two con- 
flicts. There were really no new issues in the 
Civil War, he thinks. Nearly all of them can be 
found in the Peloponnesian War, and many of 
them in every war; the basis of each war lies in 
selfish hatred and much misunderstanding. Full of 
classical allusion and historical parallel, of ripe 
philosophy and sympathetic understanding, these 



essays by a scholar, teacher, and soldier form one 
of the best expositions of the Creed of the Old 
South.

illustrious prisoner offers the happiest assurances 
of their attitude toward their present great enemy 
once he has vanished from earth. The latest 
evidence of this sort is a volume of "Letters of 
Captain Engelbert Lutyens" (Lane), edited by Sir 
Lees Knowles. Captain Lutyens was Orderly 
Officer at Longwood from February 10, 1820, until 
three weeks before the death of Napoleon, which 
occurred May 5, 1821. He lost his position on 
account of a dispute over Coxe's Life of Marl- 
borough, which Napoleon presented to the library 
of the 20th Regiment, and which Lowe ordered to 
be returned because it bore "the Imperial name 
on the title page." The long strain upon Lowe's 
temperament had evidently become too great, and 
his common sense had also given way. This affair 
was simply petty ; but it seems that Lowe required 
Lutyens to obtain ocular evidence every day of 
Napoleon's presence even if it became necessary 
to force his way into the sickroom. It is to the 
officer's credit that he disliked the task of "peep- 
ing." Captain Lutyens's letters contain little 
beyond the reports that Napoleon was seen here 
or there about Longwood. In one of the appen- 
dices are letters from a young English sergeant to 
his mother explaining how the dead emperor looked 
and what impressions the spectacle of fallen great- 
ness made upon him. The make-up of the volume 
will enhance its value to collectors of Napoleonic 
material. The illustrations are remarkable for 
the skill and beauty with which miniatures and 
colored prints are reproduced. The view of St. 
Helena from the sea is especially noteworthy. 



Discriminating readers have often 
observed that the bulk of recent 
works on South America tend to fall 
into two classes: either they are the books of dis- 
tinguished visitors who, travelling in a more or less 
official capacity, have been taken in hand by the 
various governments, royally entertained, and 
shown only such things 'as these governments wish 
to be seen; or else they merely embody a mass of 
superficial observations made during a flying visit. 
In "The Real Argentine" (Dodd, Mead & Co.), 
Mr. J. A. Hammerton has contrived to avoid both 
these extremes. A lengthy sojourn in Argentina, 
without any hampering official connections, 
afforded him an opportunity for an impartial and 
open-minded study of the country and its people. 
The picture which he draws of Argentina, particu- 
larly Buenos Aires, is far from flattering. In his 
desire to give an unvarnished and accurate account 
of what he saw, he lays the colors on too darkly. 
His first impressions of the capital are distinctly 
unfavorable. He has much to say about the nar- 
row and crowded streets, the incivility of the 
Argentines, the exorbitant cost of living, and par- 
ticularly the tawdry and unstable character of the

public buildings. Buenos Aires is in his judgment 
merely u a magnificent city of shams," a sort of 
grotesque replica of Paris in which stucco takes 
the place of marble and plaster that of granite. 
On every hand he finds evidence of a sordid spirit 
of utilitarianism which leaves little opportunity 
for the cultivation of the finer side of life. To be 
sure, a longer sojourn in the country has led the 
author to revise somewhat these first impressions. 
By dint of searching he finds evidence that there 
is a reaching out for better things. "Alongside 
the sheer brutality, unhappily still existing, the 
tender plant of intellectual culture has been grow- 
ing, and with it true humanitarianism must make 
progress." But the reader searches in vain in this 
volume for a satisfactory interpretation of those 
spiritual and cultural forces which are slowly 
bringing Argentina into the vanguard of great 
nations. This over-emphasis on the somewhat 
seamy side of the material development of the 
country is the chief defect of this cleverly written 
and entertaining book.

temporary wits to call the awe- 
journal. inspiring editor of the " Thunderer," 

J. T. Delane, by the classical nickname "Jupiter 
Tonans," which his initials and his commanding 
position might so easily have suggested, no his- 
torian seems to have explained. With this belated 
suggestion of an appropriate sobriquet, we turn 
to a brief consideration of his latest biography, 
entitled "Delane of The Times," by Sir Edward 
Cook. It must be by a sort of poetic justice that 
to the British Censor-in-Chief falls the task of 
writing the life of one who notoriously defied all 
censorship. The book, compactly inclusive of the 
main facts as already presented in Mr. Arthur 
Irwin Dasent's two-volume biography of Delane, 
which was reviewed at some length in these pages 
at the time of its appearance eight years ago, forms 
the initial number of a series to be known as 
"Makers of the Nineteenth Century" (Holt), 
edited by Mr. Basil Williams. Other authorities 
contributory to the fulness and accuracy of Sir 
Edward Cook's study of this prince of editors are 
duly enumerated in the appended Bibliography, 
after which follows a Chronological Table, and 
then a good index. A frontispiece reproduction 
of the National Portrait Gallery painting by 
Schiott conveys a good impression of the masterly 
quality in Delane's face and bearing. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



New and cheaper editions of Professor Brander 
Matthews's critical studies, "Moliere : His Life and 
His Works" and "Shakspere as a Playwright," 
bear further testimony to their usefulness and 
soundness of scholarship, as indicated in these col- 
umns when the volumes first appeared. Messrs. 
Scribner are the publishers. 

Belgian belfries, recently the object of immi- 
nent peril and tragic interest, have always held a 
particular fascination for many writers and tour- 



ists. In "The Carillon in Literature" (Lane), 
Mr. William Gorham Rice supplements his earlier 
study on "Carillons of Belgium and Holland" with 
an interesting collection of prose and verse from 
various authors who have immortalized the "magic 
numbers" of the bells. Rossetti, Thackeray, Victor 
Hugo, Stevenson, Longfellow, Rodenbach, and 
Edward Dowden are represented. 

Miss Ethel Stephens, of the Library School of 
the University of Wisconsin, has prepared a 
32-page bibliography of "American Popular Maga- 
zines," which is published by the Boston Book 
Company. Periodical articles about our best- 
known magazines, about writing for the magazines, 
and on other kindred subjects, furnish the greater 
number of entries, with occasional references to 
books. The term "magazine" is made so inclusive 
as to embrace other than monthly publications, as 
for instance "The Nation" and THE DIAL. Ex- 
haustiveness is not claimed for this modest 
bibliography, but it is a useful work in a field 
comparatively uncultivated by the bibliographer. 

Though announced on its wrapper as "a new 
book by Woodrow Wilson," the short treatise "On 
Being Human" (Harper) was in fact published 
nineteen years ago in "The Atlantic Monthly." 
It is, however, new in book form, and so the pres- 
ent publisher's assertion is in a literal sense true. 
The essay is worthy of its more permanent shape, 
for at any time it serves as a useful reminder that 
"to be human is, for one thing, to speak and act 
with a certain note of genuineness, a quality mixed 
of spontaneity and intelligence. This is necessary 
for wholesome life in any age, but particularly 
amidst confused affairs and shifting standards." 
Even more now than on its original appearance 
are the calm, wise counsels of the brief treatise 
needed by the public whom the author addresses. 

The general purpose and scope of Dr. Liberty 
H. Bailey's "Standard Cyclopedia of Horticul- 
ture" (Macmillan) were stated fully in connection 
with the appearance of the first volume (see THE 
DIAL of August 16, 1914). Volume IV has now 
appeared, and two more volumes will complete this 
important work. The new volume begins with 
"Labels" and ends with "Oxytropis." As usual, 
each important subject is presented by some 
specialist. In addition to the plant descriptions 
and accounts of cultural methods, the more exten- 
sive general articles are those dealing with land- 
scape gardening, light, machinery, marketing, 
nomenclature, horticulture in North American 
states, nut culture, orange culture, and orchid 
culture. The colored plates of the volume are 
especially attractive. 

The sixteen miscellaneous pieces, chiefly literary 
and critical, brought together in Mr. Arthur 
Waugh's " Reticence in Literature, and Other 
Papers " (Dutton) furnish much good reading on 
subjects of more than transient interest. They are 
described by the author as " covering twenty-five 
years of journalistic ' dust and desk-work,' " and 
they treat of reticence in writing, as the title in- 
dicates, of the abuse of the superlative, nineteenth- 
century fiction, some movements in Victorian 
poetry, the mood and the book, anthologies, a

number of English poets and prose-writers, chiefly 
of the last century, and a few other subjects. In 
asserting that " reticence is not a national char- 
acteristic far otherwise," the author invites 
contradiction. In the expression of emotion the 
Englishman has the reputation, deservedly, of 
being commendably reticent, which is not incom- 
patible with honesty and frankness, qualities that 
Mr. Waugh ascribes to his fellow-countrymen. 
" The Englishman has always prided himself upon 
his frankness," he declares. Both the enthusiasm 
of youth and the calm judgment of maturer years 
are exemplified in this quarter-century's harvest 
of a literary critic's occasional productions. 

In "The Masterpieces of Modern Drama" 
(Doubleday), edited by Mr. John Alexander 
Pierce under the supervision of Professor Brander 
Matthews, are contained some of the best modern 
plays English, Continental, and American, 
abridged in narrative form with textual repro- 
duction of the great scenes. In the Introduction 
to the two volumes, Professor Matthews refers 
to this editorial plan as "an ingenious and enticing 
compromise between the unadorned dialogue of the 
stage play and the unbroken narrative of prose- 
fiction." Some readers may agree with him. 
Others will feel that they are missing half the fun 
by accepting an abridged version of "The Impor- 
tance of Being Earnest" and "You Never Can 
Tell," or that they would take a long chance on 
trusting their own intelligence, without editor's 
exposition and comment, in reading and fully 
understanding a play like "The Return of Peter 
Grimm." 

Professor Tucker Brooke's edition of "Common 
Conditions," from the recently discovered quarto 
owned by the Elizabethan Club of Yale Univer- 
sity, is something of a "scoop" in the field of 
Middle English literature. Hitherto only the 
Chatsworth copy was thought to be extant. The 
new text is of an earlier edition, is less of a frag- 
ment, and revolutionizes completely prior impres- 
sions of the play by overthrowing the conventional 
happy ending which has been hitherto assumed. 
The editor whimsically suggests that we may have 
to wait another three hundred years before we 
really know if Lamphedon died of the poison or 
if Clarisia quaffed the cup. But what are three 
hundred years in the world of scholarship? In 
his treatment of the new text, in the comparative 
stud}- of the two manuscripts, in the Introduc- 
tion and the carefully prepared appendixes and 
notes, Professor Brooke throughout reveals the true 
scholar's enthusiasm and love for his task. (Yale 
University Press.) 

In commemoration of the life and work of Francis 
Asbury, first bishop of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church in the United States, sent hither by Wesley 
in 1771, there appears in this centennial year of 
Asbury's death a well-written volume about him, 
"Francis Asbury, the Prophet of the Long Road" 
(Methodist Book Concern). It is rather an esti- 
mate of the man, as is explained by the author, 
Mr. Ezra Squier Tipple, than an addition to the 
already numerous biographies of him. In his con- 
cluding summary the author compares and con- 



trasts Asbury with Lord Kitchener, finding that 
"just as Kitchener in an hour of crisis has seemed 
to be 'the living expression of the Will of the 
entire British Empire,' so Francis Asbury to his 
age was the Will of Jehovah and the heavenly 
hosts." Mr. Tipple shows a thorough knowledge 
of his subject, his previous work in editing selec- 
tions from Asbury's journal having helped to 
prepare him for this more ambitious undertaking. 
Illustrations and facsimiles add no little to the 
interest of the book. 

A line of type or two, or three at the most, is 
the space allotted to each name that appears in 
"A Dictionary of Universal Biography of All Ages 
and All Peoples" (Dutton), prepared by Mr. 
Albert M. Hyamson. The scope of the work is 
outlined in the Preface: "It is a guide to the 
biographies of, it may be said without exaggera- 
tion, every man or woman, not still alive, who has 
achieved eminence or prominence, from the dawn 
of history until this day [October 1, 1915] in the 
twentieth century on which this preface is being 
written. The work covers all countries and all 
generations. An endeavor has been made to include 
every one whose work or whose memory can be 
said to have survived until to-day, in the scheme 
of the undertaking." Many who use the volume 
will look in vain for at least one who by his work 
and memory merits inclusion, but this would be 
true of practically every similar compilation in 
existence. Words are successfully substituted for 
sentences, a few self-explanatory abbreviations are 
used, and the size of the volume is excellently 
adapted to general desk use. To have brought so 
much information within so comparatively narrow 
a compass is an achievement little short of 
extraordinary. 

A volume which might well be taken for a model 
in its kind is the catalogue of "Greek, Etruscan, 
and Roman Bronzes in the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art," prepared by Dr. Gisela M. A. Richter, 
assistant curator of the Museum's classical sec- 
tion. It is quarto in form, beautifully printed by 
the Gillis Press of New York, and lavishly illus- 
trated with fine half-tone reproductions of the 
treasures dealt with in the text. The technical 
processes of bronze-working in antiquity, and the 
origin of the ancient patina, are discussed at 
length in an Introduction; while the body of the 
work consists of concise descriptions of all the 
important objects in the Museum's collection. A 
selected bibliography and an index, both prepared 
with excellent judgment, are included. The col- 
lection in the Metropolitan Museum began in 
1872-6, when the objects discovered in Cyprus by 
General di Cesnola were purchased. Twenty years 
later the Baxter and Frothingham collections were 
bought, and the late Henry G. Marquand gave 
twenty bronzes of exceptional importance. In 
1903 the Museum authorities bought the famous 
chariot from Monteleone; and from 1906 onwards 
they have every year made one or more first-rate 
acquisitions. The beautiful catalogue now pub- 
lished is a worthy cicerone and memorial to one 
of the finest collections of art objects in the 
world.

Mr. Zane Grey's forthcoming novel, to be issued 
this month by Messrs. Harper, is entitled "The 
Border Legion." 

"Present-Day China," by Mr. Gardner L. 
Harding, being a survey of the ancient nation as 
it appears today, will be issued this month by the 
Century Co. 

Mr. Granville Barker has in preparation a 
dramatization of Robert Louis Stevenson's "The 
Wrong Box," which will be published by Messrs. 
Little, Brown & Co. 

"The Restoration of Europe" is the title of a 
new book by Dr. Alfred H. Fried which Messrs. 
Macmillan will shortly publish in an English trans- 
lation by Mr. Lewis Gannett. 

"Benighted Mexico" by Mr. Randolph Wellford 
Smith, announced by the John Lane Co., is a narra- 
tive of the Mexican revolution revealing the condi- 
tions in that disintegrated land. 

A complete edition of the novels of Tchekov, 
in eight volumes, translated by Mrs. Constance 
Garnett, is soon to appear. The first volume will 
include an Introduction by Mr. Edward Garnett. 

A volume entitled "Inviting War to America," 
embodying Mr. Allan L. Benson's ideas on the 
evils of the preparedness propaganda, will be 
brought out immediately by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. 

English translations of M. Paul Claudel's 
"L'Annonce Faite a Marie" and "L'Otage" will 
shortly come from the Yale University Press under 
the titles, "The Tidings Brought to Mary: A Mys- 
tery" and "The Hostage." 

"Culture and War," by Professor Simon N. 
Patten, is a study of the differences between the 
German mind and the English which Mr. B. W. 
Huebsch announces. There is no discussion of the 
merits of the present war. 

Mrs. Dorothy Canfield Fisher's new book, "Self- 
Reliance," will shortly be issued by the Bobbs- 
Merrill Co. From the same house will come "The 
Door of Dread" by Mr. Arthur Stringer, and a 
volume of verse by Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson 
which will comprise his work written since 1914. 

A volume of Clark University addresses by 
various American thinkers on "The Problems and 
Lessons of the War" is announced by Messrs. Put- 
nam. The papers are in part devoted to the sub- 
ject of preparedness in the United States and in 
part to certain aspects from the point of view 
of economics. 

Among library publications of monthly or quar- 
terly periodicity, appreciative mention should be 
made of such book-bulletins as that of the Provi- 
dence, the Grand Rapids, the Cleveland, and the 
Chicago public libraries. "The Open Shelf" 
(Cleveland) and the "Quarterly Bulletin" (Provi- 
dence) are especially well annotated. 

Publication of Messrs. Holt's "Home University 
Library" will shortly be resumed with three new 
volumes, bringing the total number up to 101 
volumes. The new books will be: "Dante," by 
Mr. .7. B. Fletcher; "Poland," by Mr. W. A. 
Phillips, and "Political Thought in England: The 



Utilitarians, from Bentham to Mill," by Mr. W. L. 
Davidson. 

Mr. Frank B. Sanborn is at work upon a final 

Life of Thoreau having already written two, and 

I edited a new edition of the one written by his 

I neighbor, Ellery Charming, first published in 1873, 

I and which Mr. Sanborn republished in 1902. This 

final Life will contain one hundred pages of 

Thoreau's earlier writings never before published, 

and some interesting facts about his ancestors. 

The New York State Library issues, somewhat 
belatedly (as is often the way with public docu- 
ments), the yearly reports of its Director for 1913 
and 1914, each an illustrated pamphlet of nearly 
one hundred pages. Since its disastrous fire of 
five years ago this library has been a busy insti- 
tution, as indeed it was before; but the labor of 
rising from its ashes has been especially arduous. 
Two immediately forthcoming contributions 
to the Shakespeare tercentenary are "Shakespeare 
in Italy: His Influence on Literature and the 
Theatre," by Mr. Lacy Collison-Morley ; and 
"Shakespeare and his Fellows," by the Chancellor 
of the University of Dublin, Mr. Justice Madden, 
author of "The Diary of Master William Silence: 
A Study of Shakespeare and of Elizabethan 
Sport." 

Rev. John Haynes Holmes, who has rendered 
invaluable service in the peace movement in Amer- 
ica, will publish this month through Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. a book entitled "New Wars for Old." 
The volume comprises a statement of the pacifist 
argument from the standpoints of expediency, 
human nature, and religion, and an exposition of 
I the logic of force, its fallacies and the true mean- 
I ing of non-resistance. 

Sir Charles Waldstein has in preparation a work 
| entitled "Aristo-democracy : From the Great War 
back to Moses, Christ, and Plato," including a 
picture of the old Germany as contrasted with the 
new, and a constructive plan for the avoidance of 
war among civilized nations in the future by the 
establishment of an International Tribunal, with 
an effective army and navy at its command to 
enforce its decisions. 

"The Dangers of Half -Preparedness : A Plea 
for a Declaration of American Policy," by Mr. 
Norman Angell, will shortly be issued by Messrs. 
Putnam. The author argues that unless the ulti- 
mate purposes of our increasing power are made 
manifest to ourselves, the world at large, and par- 
ticularly our prospective enemy, that power, how- 
ever great, will fail in its object of protecting our 
interests and rights and ensuring peace. 

The Carnegie Library School of Pittsburgh, a 

training school for children's librarians, issues its 

I catalogue for the sixteenth year of its existence, 

| showing an imposing array of names on its faculty 

j list and staff of lecturers, an enrolment of thirty - 

! four pupils, and a register of more than two 

hundred and fifty graduates, most of whom are 

now engaged in their chosen work in different 

parts of the country. Matrimony has to answer 

for a considerable proportion of the remainder. 

"Books to Grow On," issued by the Buffalo 

Public Library, is a 24-page "experimental list

selected from the Open Shelf Room," compiled as 
"an attempt to gather the books which have 
proved acceptable to young people as they pass 
from the children's room to the adult departments." 
Beginning with romance and poetry and ending 
with prose fiction, the arrangement is by subjects 
and brings to view a great number of excellent 
books for the young in years and in heart. 

The Riverside (California) Public Library issues 
a descriptive illustrated pamphlet concerning its 
summer school, its winter school, and its plan for 
one-year training in library service. This library 
is a county library as well as a city library, and 
serves a territory about as large as Massachusetts. 
It has sixty branches and stations. The next sum- 
mer session of the school opens June 26 and closes 
August 12 ; the winter session will begin January 8 
or 15, 1917, date not yet determined, and duration 
not indicated. 

Sir A. W. Ward has written the first volume 
of a short history of "Germany, 1815-1890," 
shortly to be published by the Cambridge Uni- 
versity Press in the "Cambridge Historical Series." 
For the second volume, which it is hoped to have 
ready in the course of the year, the author has 
secured the collaboration of Mr. H. Spenser 
Wilkinson, Chichele Professor of Military History 
in the University of Oxford, who has undertaken 
to write the sections dealing with the wars of 
1864, 1866, and 1870. 

The first number will soon appear in England 
of a quarterly journal entitled "History," which 
has become the official organ of the Historical 
Association, edited by Professor A. F. Pollard, 
with the assistance of an editorial board repre- 
sentative of teachers in universities, secondary and 
primary schools, appointed by the association. One 
of the functions of "History" will be to act as a 
channel of communication between the members 
of the Association and between the education 
authorities and the general public, with regard to 
questions of historical education, the policy to be 
pursued in teaching history, and the like. It is 
intended also to appeal to intelligent sections of 
the general public. 

In the list of volumes to be added during the 
present year to the "Loeb Classical Library" 
(which series, by the way, will hereafter be pub- 
lished in this country by Messrs. Putnam), the 
names of American scholars figure with unusual 
and gratifying prominence. Some of these names, 
with the classics which they are to supervise, are 
as follows: (In the Latin section), Professor F. J. 
Miller of the University of Chicago, Ovid's 
"Metamorphoses" and Seneca's "Tragedies"; Pro- 
fessor Paul Nixon of Bowdoin, a four-volume 
Plautus; Professor R. M. Gummere of Haverford, 
Seneca's "Epistles"; Professor H. R. Fairclough 
of Stanford, Virgil. (In the Greek section), 
Professor Horace L. Jones of Cornell, a nine- 
volume Strabo; Professor A. T. Murray of Stan- 
ford, Homer's "Odyssey"; Professor B. Perrin of 
Yale, continuation of a ten-volume Plutarch; Pro- 
fessor C. L. Brownson of the College of the 
City of New York, Xenophon's "Hellenica" and 
"Anabasis."

MAN- 
God's Masterpiece 

By FRANK CROWELL 

As soon as possible in life one should ask of himself 
the question, "Why am I here?" And when he has 
found the correct answer, he should follow it up 
diligently if he would know happiness. A proper 
viewpoint is everything in life, for it enables us to 
seek out the law and comply with it. This book 
attempts to give that answer and to point out the 
way as well. It tells of health, happiness and salva- 
tion to be attained now, not in some distant, uncer- 
tain future. 

This interpretation of religion, founded as it is on 
a philosophical and scientific basis, will increase 
greatly one's powers to meet the requirements of 
every-day life, in all its aspects, from a business, 
social and religious standpoint, and will accomplish 
results.

ByPercivalW. Well* 
One of the greatest literary successes of the age 

"A yer or so ago Perclval Wells wrote 'The Major ot the 
Kettledrum, 'a brilliant satire on picayune politics; a work 
which interested discriminating readers all over the coun- 
try. Now he has appeared in a role other than satirist or 
poet (both of which he has graced heretofore) and in a 
small volume entitled 'The Martyr's Return' he has dis- 
cussed with keen Insight and criticism some of the para- 
mount Issues of today." OAKLAND (Gal.) TRIBUNE 
"The work has come out at an opportune time to help 
guide national thought Into serious channels. It is worthy 
an hour or two of any loyal American's time." 

PA8SAIC HERALD

TX7RITERS professional or amateur like THE 
EDITOR, the fortnightly Journal of Infor- 
mation for Literary Workers. THE EDITOR is 
now in its 22nd consecutive year of publication. 
pROM the days when Jack London, Mary Rob- 
erts Rinehart, Peter Clark Macfarlane, Albert 
Bigelow Paine, etc., were unknown aspirants,writ- 
ers have made THE EDITOR a great exchange 
through which they have transferred to one an- 
other the results of their valuable experiences. 
A/TARY Roberts Rinehart has said: "THE 
A EDITOR helped to start me, cheered me 
when I was down, and led me in the straight path 
until I was able to walk alone." 
JACK London has said: "The first number of 
k THE EDITOR I read aroused in me a great 
regret for all my blind waste of energy. I may 
not tell a hundredth part of what I learned from 
THE EDITOR, but I may say that it taught me 
how to solve the stamp and landlady problems." 
TN addition to practical, inspiriting articles on artistic and 
A business phases of the art-trade of writing, THE 
EDITOR prints each fortnight news of markets for all kinds 
of literary material. 

UP-TO-DATE news of photoplay markets and of oppor- 
tunities to sell post-card, second serial and other rights 
of already published manuscripts is a feature. 

THE regular departments are "The Literary Market," 
" The Experience Exchange ,"" The Rhetorical Corner," 
"The Plot and Idea Forum," " Questions and Answers," and

In trying to straighten out my own rather 
vague ideas about realism, the other day, I 
stumbled on a discovery. It wasn't anything 
new to human thought, I suppose, but it was 
new to me the feeling me, if not the think- 
ing one. It was simply the discovery that the 
important and sensible thing I ought to 
be about was not contrasting realism and 
romance, but contrasting true realism and 
false realism, true romance and false romance. 
I seemed to see for the first time that there is 
about as much sense in putting realism and 
romance in the scales together as in balancing 
a side of beef against a bale of eiderdown 
No question of competitive merit is really 
involved. One commodity may be more 
important than the other, but you cannot 
fairly say that one is more legitimate than 
the other, or that one can take the place of 
the other. So I came to the comforting and 
perhaps obvious conclusion that we need them 
both in our business of living, the interpre- 
tation of character in action which is true 
realism, and the high illusion which is true 
romance. When realism has suitably embod- 
ied life, do we not still need romance to give 
it glamour? 

Now glamour is most readily to be achieved 
by appeal to the remote, in time or place or 
both. You may, it is true, have a treasure 
buried in your woodshed, or a secret cup- 
board bricked into your chimney. But the 
past with its quaintness is a safe and inex- 
haustible background. In the lost land of 
costume, at least, it is possible for all absurd, 
desirable things to befall. Next-Door Jones 
may have had strikingly romantic adventures 
on his way to his office, but he finds difficulty 
in investing them with glamour: he doesn't 
look or sound the part. Creased trousers and 
a pot hat may be the current uniform, the 
accepted livery of our service to the world 
of fact and every-day. But it is a good deal 
easier to make a credible hero of Jones by 
throwing him back a century or two rig- 
ging him out with doublet and hose, or glaive 
and morion, or queue and knee-breeches, or 



492 



THE DIAL 



[May 25 



even stock and gaiters. In pursuit of 
romance the costume novel, like the costume 
play, quite naturally and legitimately follows 
the line of least resistance. A good many 
years ago I went to see an excellent company 
in "She Stoops to Conquer." The Marlow 
pleased me particularly, a graceful fellow, 
master of his limbs and his sword and his 
ruffles and his lines, the Marlow of my 
dreams. The next night I was to see the 
same company in a modern play, and I looked 
forward with not a little confidence to my 
Marlow man in his new role. Alas, he was 
a pitiable object, his fine calves wasted in 
their clumsy modern swathings, his manner 
finicking and ineffective, his action even 
clumsy. I got the impression of a man ham- 
pered and embarrassed, Marlow awkwardly 
disguised as Next-Door Jones. The truth is, 
that young actor needed the grace of costume 
and accent to set him at ease, to release his 
spirit from the bondage of yesterday's tailor 
land to-day's haberdasher, and to give it the 
freedom of the city of romance. 

I think the great romancers have most of 
them been like that Scott and Dumas and 
Hawthorne, for example, or, for a current 
instance, Mr. Maurice Hewlett. They have 
dealt most successfully with the past because 
it was only with the aid of the past that they 
could capture their glamorous vision, achieve 
their fine illusion. Kealism shows us what we 
are and what we mean; but it is romance 
which gives to airy nothing a local habitation 
and a name. 

Of all airy nothings, perhaps the most 
reprehensible and the most engaging is the 
spirit of the gamble. In sober moods we 
agree that for the most part, in the fortunes 
of this world, men reap what they sow, get 
"what is coming to them." But as natural 
men, as those children of larger growth for 
whom romance prepares its cheering potion, 
we do not cherish the admission. We prefer 
to stow it away, among various uneasy 
doctrines, in the wooden bosom of that handy 
repository, Man. It is just the kind of thing 
to keep in that kind of place. We can take 
it out now and then, and look it over and say 
how well preserved it is, and put it back with 
perfect confidence that it will stay put till 
called for. Murder will out, and man is the 
contriver of his own fortunes, and figs can- 
not be gathered from thistles or pears from 
an elm-tree. But the wind bloweth where it 



listeth, it's an ill wind that blows nobody 
good, and the rain descends upon the unjust 
as well as the just. A less salutary form of 
truth, this latter, but it is only Man who can 
be always thinking of his health : He has no 
palate. 

"Happiness" means good luck; and the 
natural man is content to have it so. When 
he parts with you he does not ask heaven to 
bless you according to your deserts; he 
wishes you luck. He would not give over- 
much for life without its savor of chance. 
Unless she offers him fortune, religion her- 
self is a dingy business. 

Take away his miracle, and you leave him 
with a mess of theories, too plain a dish for 
him to relish, though he may contrive to swal- 
low it. One miracle he never tires of: that 
miracle which, we are told, may happen to 
any of us. Morally, men make their own beds 
and must lie upon them. But the natural 
man believes, or longs to believe, in a power 
capable of lifting him heavenwards, bed and 
all, like the man in Holy Writ. The Reverend 
Billy Sunday knows what he has to reckon 
with when he calls his thousands to repent- 
ance and a place under the spotlight. The 
TTOV o-To) of all Reverend Billies is their 
ground of converted sinner. How thrilling 
to hear what a reprobate the prophet was 
before the wonderful unexpected thing hap- 
pened ! Conversion stupendous bit of luck 

windfall of almighty grace! Salvation 

a bonus, a prize, a sublime fluke, the thing 
men covet most and longest something for 
nothing ! No faith based on this cheerful arti- 
cle can be lacking in romance : what else was 
it that gave fatness to the lean religion of the 
New Englander or the Scot? 

But art? Well, of course the graver art, 
the art of interpretation, busies itself, not 
with windfalls and sudden transformations, 
but with an orderly development of character 
and action. But the art of romance, of illu- 
sion, of diversion from reality, has no such 
business. Shakespeare knew that by summar- 
ily converting his two wicked brothers in 
Arden, he would not be making them absurd, 
he would be investing them with a special 
kind of charm. Romance at least is honest 
she makes no bones of her dependence on the 
fluke. You may joke her on her free use of 
chance, the long arm of coincidence, or what 
not. She knows better than to be laughed 
out of it. What would you give her instead ? 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



493 



the short thumb of probability, with its 
neat and dull little rules? Heaven forbid! 
If we are to get nothing better than a row 
of orderly occurrences, spare us your pains, 
well-meaning story-teller. Character? It's 
neither here nor there, though of course if 
you want to try to make us believe in your 
people, go ahead. Action? By all means, if 
you don't mean by that mere logical events. 
What we want is incidents, happenings: let 
things befall, don't bore us with outcomes. 
Things are eventuating all about us, and 
we're tired of them. Give us adventure, the 
fortune Chance fetches, the thing (see dic- 
tionary) that is coming to us. 

An honest romancer has this plea always 
in his ears. It gives him no uneasiness. He 
knows we are not demanding prodigies of 
him. The cruder appetite for a thrill on 
every page he can afford to ignore, the more 
generous craving he cannot and need not. It 
is a vicarious business. We ask him to treat 
his own people handsomely in the long run; 
that being understood, he has a clear road 
before him. If he has the trick of handling, 
he may safely reduce the unexpected to for- 
mula. When our hero is assailed by ten vil- 
lains in a dark alley, our fear for him is the 
perfectly tolerable fear of an exciting dream. 
It costs us nothing. We know we shall be 
comfortably awake presently, and our friend 
Tom the ex- Yale halfback, or our friend Sir 
Drivel of the Brand-new Spurs, will be safe 
out of the late unpleasantness with nothing 
worse to show for it than a wound or two of 
the self-healing kind: "The ethereal sub- 
stance closed, not long divisible." Thou- 
sands of years ago the human race constituted 
itself a committee of the whole for the Pro- 
tection of Romantic Heroes. 

And this brings us to the compromising 
fact that the gamble is not a square one. The 
dice are loaded, the wheel has a secret brake, 
to our advantage. The goddess of fortune 
has no chance at all against us. And there 
is no denying that this goddess as pictured 
by romance is often a plump and earthy per- 
son. Though money be dross and rightly 
despised by moral Man, romance reminds us 
that it still glitters for our delight. And 
under the guidance of romance we may safely 
pursue it, daring the sea sharks about the 
treasure-laden coral reef, or the land sharks 
about the green tables of Monte Carlo. There 
is the dead hand, too : it can make only 



feebly hostile demonstrations against us. 
Doubtful wills, long-lost heirs, the whole 
field of inheritance with its cloth of gold lies 
open to us. Certain quaint survivals in Brit- 
ish family usage are of incalculable value to 
the story-teller. Entail and male succession 
still make possible the most romantically 
satisfying stock situation in modern life. A 
fortune plus a title here we have the 
summum bonum of the fate genteel, the grand 
prize in the gamble of material fortune. 
Democracy offers nothing like it unless, as 
in the instance of a Little Lord Fauntleroy 
or a T. Tembarom, it offers everything. No 
doubt there are always a few American citi- 
zens who stand a chance of fauntleroying into 
a British title and estates. But the kind of 
truth that is stranger than romantic fiction 
is, after all, too rare for impressive tabula- 
tion. We suspect the average Yankee has his 
chances of British succession "figgered pretty 
close." 

But why stress the dingy material side of 
romance? Isn't it love that makes the world 
go round? Yes, but here too the cynic may 
cap us with his counter-saw, since what is it 
but money that makes the mare to go ? Even 
the romance of simplicity is lighted by that 
yellow reflection. Love in a cottage has the 
charm and piquancy of a paradox. If we did 
not secretly believe it a desperate thing to 
scorn wealth, what romance would there be in 
the act of scorning? Therefore, despite a 
recent tendency in favor of proletary hero- 
ines, the daughter of the rich holds her own 
pretty well with the romancers. For there 
is always the poor and noble youth to pair 
her off with. She may effect a minor thrill 
by threatening to cast away her all for his 
sake as he may by declaring that he can 
never, never marry an heiress. But we are 
reasonably confident that neither of them will 
| be so inept when the time comes; and the 
romancer who knows his business sees to it 
that they are not. Otherwise he might as 
well be a mere novelist. 

But the glamour of gold that shall be won, 
the glamour of adventure and of battle, the 
glamour of love, calf-love victorious and 
undying, these are only manifestations of 
the larger glamour of youth young blood, 
young hope, young folly. Youth cares noth- 
ing for subtleties of character and action, so 
why should romance ? Youth cares for things, 
for acts, for types, for dreams above all for 



494 



THE DIAL 



[May 25 



itself. Therefore romance commonly begins 
and ends with the business of being young, 
ardent, striving, successful; with the busi- 
ness of reaching goals, the goal of wealth, 
the goal of fame, the goal of mating. When 
a man has reached or definitely failed to reach 
these goals he may as well be dead, as far as 
youth or romance cares. It is this sublime 
and innocent egotism which middle age 
knocks out of us, and which, in certain moods 
at least, we sorrowfully regret. I have heard 
men say they wished they could live life over, 
school days and college days particularly. 
Sometimes they wished it because they thought 
they might make a better job of it in one 
way or another; sometimes, it seemed to be 
simply a longing, or a theory of a longing, to 
live things over literally, to have one's cake 
again. I doubt if it is much more than a 
theory in most instances: I for one would 
not be a child again, or a boy again, or a calf- 
lover again, even "just for to-night." And 
yet it is good for age to be reminded of youth, 
now and then, as something more than a 
mere object of discipline or condescension. 
And romance so reminds us. Sentimentalism 
smears us with syrups, it tries to divert us 
from solid fare by cloying us with sweet- 
meats; and cheap romance is always encum- 
bering itself with sentimentalism. But true 
romance, high romance, is not a jelly or a 
condiment. A real if primary and vague 
idealism informs it. Youth has faith, if only 
in luck, if only in desire, if only in the man 
at the top; and romance bears the standard 
of the faith. It bears, at its best, the standard 
of a higher faith in chivalry, in selfless 
devotion, in aspiration for something nobler 
than good luck, or satisfied desire, or "suc- 
cess." It enwraps "life," half -conceals it 
from us in a golden mist. Illusion? Yes: 
the fruitful illusion of youth, the healing 
illusion which we can never quite afford to 
outgrow or outface, later on. ' 

H. W. BOYNTON. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



UTOPIA'S QUADBICENTENNIAL falls in this year of 
1916, and we may picture to ourselves the people 
of that happy commonwealth as this summer cele- 
brating, with pageants and oratory, music and 
dancing, and other forms of innocent jubilation, 
the four-hundredth anniversary of their country's 
birth in the brain of the gentle and cultured Sir 



Thomas More. We will overlook the fact that 
"Utopia" was written some time before 1516, and 
as no one knows exactly when it was conceived in 
the author's mind we will unhesitatingly date the 
ideal republic's beginning in the year when, at 
Louvain (the place is notable), the political 
romance was first made public naturally in the 
tongue of all European scholars of the time, Latin. 
How far we non-Utopians still fall short of the 
high standards, or of some of the high standards, 
maintained by the Utopians, becomes apparent on 
opening the book at almost any page. For exam- 
ple, gold is so little valued by these people that 
they show their contempt for its meretricious glit- 
ter by using it for making some of their meaner 
utensils, and an earring of gold is regarded as a 
badge of exceptional infamy. Silver likewise is 
mere rubbish in their eyes; "and thus they take 
care by all possible means to render gold and 
silver of no esteem; and from hence it is that 
while other nations part with their gold and silver 
as unwillingly as if one tore out their bowels, those 
of Utopia would look on this giving in all they 
possess of these metals (when there were any use 
for them) but as the parting with a trifle or as we 
esteem the loss of a penny!" A glimpse of the 
home life of him to whom the world owes this 
celebrated work is refreshing in these days. 
Erasmus in one of his letters has immortalized 
that happy household, wherein "none, man or 
woman, but readeth or studieth the liberal arts, 
yet is their chief care of piety. There is never any 
seen idle; the head of the house governs it, not 
by a lofty carriage and oft rebukes, but by gentle- 
ness and amiable manners. Every member is busy 
in his place, performing his duty with alacrity; 
nor is sober mirth wanting." 



HUMOROUS ASPECTS OF A SERIOUS CALLING will 
be found in a modest pamphlet of twenty-two 
pages which the uninstructed might dismiss with 
a hasty glance and thereby miss an opportunity 
to prolong their lives with a hearty laugh. In 
a valedictory utterance intended for the people 
of Newton, Mass., but likely to find a larger audi- 
ence, Miss Elizabeth P. Thurston, retiring librarian 
of that city, says in her yearly Report: "It is 
not necessary to remind you that a librarian must 
of necessity know everything: must be ready to 
dictate papers through the telephone to club mem- 
bers at a moment's notice, and Newton has prob- 
ably more clubs than any other city in the world. 
A librarian is called upon to give a synopsis of 
Herbert Spencer's system of philosophy and the 
best receipt for doughnuts: readers wish to know 
who wrote Gray's 'Elegy,' how to find Bunyon's 
'Paradise Lost,' or how to spell 'morage, that kind 
of a lake you see in the air.' Some little girl 
after having read 'Elsie's Girlhood,' 'Elsie's 
Motherhood,' 'Elsie's Widowhood/ says, 'Can I 
have "Elsie's Boyhood"?' A small boy of per- 
haps thirteen years, after wandering helplessly 
about the Reference Room for some time, asks for 
something on 'methodized reproductive invention/ 
for school use." But the Newton librarian is not 
for a moment perplexed by any of the inquiries; 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



495 



for, as it is stated concerning the resources of 
that library, "there is no library that can be com- 
pared with it for constitutionalistic ratiocination, 
for indef atigation of superinerrability and per- 
fection generally." Miss Thurston resigns her 
office after thirty-five years of highly successful 
discharge of its duties, and her going is cause of 
deep regret. Mr. Harold T. Dougherty, formerly 
librarian at Pawtucket, R. I., is her successor. 



JOURNALISM'S INCREASING DIGNITY AS A PROFES- 
SION during the last two decades cannot but rejoice 
the heart of all who hold that to contribute to the 
moulding of public opinion through the press is 
among the noblest of callings. Twenty years ago 
the school-trained candidate for a position in news- 
paper work was either an unheard-of being or, if 
not that, an object of mirthful derision. In no 
event was he to be taken seriously. Since then 
schools of journalism have arisen and prospered, 
and their number is growing. Their standards are 
being raised, and it is becoming clear that no 
training can be too good, too broad, too liberal, for 
those who are to furnish the people with the daily 
reading matter that with too many readers is their 
only reading matter. Illustrative of this tendency 
to recognize the importance of the journalist's 
work is the recent step taken at Columbia Uni- 
versity in lengthening the course in its School of 
Journalism from three to four years, experience 
having shown that the education thought neces- 
sary for journalistic work cannot be given in less 
than the period required for obtaining a college 
diploma. Only a few years ago, as it now seems, 
the addition of a third year to the course in vari- 
ous schools of journalism throughout the land was 
hailed as momentous. Shall we before long see 
a fifth added to the now prescribed four years? 
Art is long, and journalism is no exception; yet 
practical considerations will set a limit to the time 
that can be given to preparation for even the most 

exacting art. 



THE SOFT ANSWER THAT TURNETH AWAY WRATH 

has been discovered by the spelling-refonnei-s. At 
an "entheuziastik" meeting of educators, further 
specified as the "Aneual Konferens ov Edeukai- 
shonal Ascesiaishonz in the Euniversiti of London," 
no less an authority than Professor Gilbert 
Murray, LL.D., D.Litt,, F.B.A., expressed himself, 
as reported by "The Pyoneer ov Simp Kf yd Spel- 
ing," to the effect that the cause so dear to these 
reformers "woz not entyrli without referens tu 
the grait strugel in which the kuntri woz engaijd. 
Thai wer aul ekspekting and hoeping that, at the

wun spoeken and won riten." How many would 
they have to learn if the various schools of sim- 
plified spelling should make any considerable 
progress in their several undertakings? In read- 
ing the foregoing quoted passage an unreformed 
speller is puzzled to account for the escape of 
"English" from molestation or mutilation at the 
hands of the reformers. One would have expected 
"Inglish." "Tu" and "too," for "to" and "two" 
respectively, might invite comment, especially in 
connection with "kood" and "book." There is 
food for mild mirth in the spellings "foolfilment" 
(of hopes) and "hrepfool." 

THE AUTHOR OF "SAFETY FIRST," the slogan now 
heard round the world, is said to have been the 
late Josiah Strong, whose recent death deserves 
more general notice than it has received. He 
devoted the greater part of his life and energies to 
the improvement of the condition of his fellow- 
men, especially the urban portion of his fellow- 
men. Such books of his as "Our Country," "The 
Challenge of the City," "Religious Movements for 
Social Betterment," "The New Era," "Expansion," 
and "The Times and Young Men" show clearly 
enough the causes that he had most at heart. For 
twelve years he was secretary of the Evangelical 
Alliance, resigning this post in 1898 to give himself 
more unreservedly to the "safety first" movement, 
organizing for this purpose the American Insti- 
tute of Social Service. He was born at Naperville, 
111., Jan. 19, 1847, was graduated from Western 
Reserve College in 1869, and two years later from 
Walnut Hills Theological Seminary, Cincinnati. 
He was chaplain at Western Reserve from 1873 to 
1876, and also instructor in natural theology and 
rhetoric. But before many years he was devoting 
himself to social service and writing books and 
articles in its interest. "Our Country" was trans- 
lated into a number of foreign languages, and that 
with other books of his had a large circulation at 
home and abroad. More than three hundred thou- 
sand copies of works from his pen are said to have 
been sold in English-speaking countries. 



A QUESTION OF GRAMMAR has arisen. It is noth- 
ing short of this : Shall the study of formal gram- 
mar in school be continued or dropped * Dr. Abra- 
ham Flexner has aroused considerable discussion 
by advising that formal grammar be no longer 
studied as a regular school course, such evidence 
as we possess pointing to the futility of this study 
as an aid to correct speaking and writing. This 
alleged utterance of his contains nothing to startle 
one in these days. The unconscious acquisition of 
grammar by reading the best authors and hearing 
the best speakers has long been held by many to 
be the only sensible method to follow in this de- 
partment of learning, to which formerly so much 
attention was given that the name "grammar 
school" was used to denote the school immediately

below the high school. Now we hear of nothing 
but "grades." Parsing one's way through "Para- 
dise Lost," or through the first book at least, was 
one of the severer intellectual exercises in the old- 
fashioned curriculum. No wonder the reading of 
the poem for the pleasure of it became something 
unheard of. But the old methods did seem to 
inspire more respect for grammar, for correctness 
in speech and writing, than the present compara- 
tive neglect of "formal grammar." All young 
pupils ought in some way to have impressed upon 
them the sinfulness (in an intellectual sense) of 
violating the rules of intelligible speech, the few 
principal rules that can be easily enough taught 
even to the very immature. Later a dip into the 
Latin language, or if possible some study of both 
Latin and Greek, will give a grasp of grammatical 
principles that will tend to make an observance of 
those principles almost second nature. But how- 
ever it may best be done, there should be incul- 
cated some sense of the fitness, the propriety, the 
ultimate necessity, of obedience to the rules of 
grammar. If something of formality, some little 
drill in formal grammar, is necessary to this end, 
let it be retained. ... 

BOOKS VERSUS BOMBS with this alliterative 
heading we note the competitive struggle now in 
progress for the possession of rags. Rags have 
always entered into the composition of high-grade 
paper, the best paper being pure linen, the cheaper 
grades part linen and part something else, gener- 
ally wood-pulp. At present the manufacture of 
high explosives such explosives as wrecked the 
library at Louvain is monopolizing the supply of 
rags, and the world's printing is more and more 
done upon cheap and perishable paper. In fact, 
the paper-makers seem to have retired from the 
contest, and the bomb-factories have it now all 
their own way, so sternly imperious are the ways 
of war. "The Library Journal," which has hith- 
erto made a point of using only good and durable 
paper, largely composed of rags, announces its 
inability to secure its usual supply of such paper 
and the possibility of its issues for the next year 
or two being of such perishable material that a 
century or more hence its files will reveal a con- 
spicuous gap marking the period of the Great 
War. It points out this possibility in more gen- 
eral terms, however, making it one that applies 
to all the literature of the present time; for the 
insane and disastrous conflict between books and 
bombs is nothing short of worldwide. 



FITTING THE VERB TO THE NOUN is often as nice 
a task as fitting the punishment to the crime. In 
the England of bluff King Hal and of good Queen 
Bess justice was satisfied with exacting the death 
penalty for all offences from minor derelictions to 
deliberate murder; and in the English of most 
users of that language the sense is held to be suffi- 
ciently expressed if all events are made to "occur" 
or to "take place," if all expectations "materialize" 
or fail to do so, and if all those who are straining 
after success either "put it over" or "fall down. 
It takes much less time and thought, and it calls 



for much less selective skill, to phrase our meaning 
in general terms than to put it into the verbal mold 
which it exactly fills, no more and no less. The 
first process is like thrusting the hand into a mitten, 
the second like fitting it neatly with a glove. 
Delane, the great editor of "The Times," devoted 
a large part of his editorial energy to the correc- 
tion of inaccurate or slipshod expressions on the 
part of his subordinates. This insistence upon the 
right word for the given thought is referred to in 
Sir Edward Cook's recent life of the man who for 
thirty-six prosperous years guided the fortunes of 
London's leading newspaper. Dean Wace, one of 
his editorial staff, wrote of him: "I remember his 
being particularly indignant with the use of the 
slipshod phrase that a marriage, or a funeral, or 
a race, had ' taken place.' It was mere slovenliness 
of expression, he said, instead of saying that a 
marriage had been solemnized or a race run. He 
exerted a valuable influence in this way toward 
maintaining in the public mind a standard of cor- 
rect English writing." Easy, as distinguished from 
nicely accurate, writing may not always be hard 
reading, but it is often what might be called drowsy 
reading as compared with that difficult writing in 
which the expression of the thought is as clean-cut 
and as clear as a crystal, and in which the exquisite 
fitness of each word sends a little thrill of delight 
through the reader of discernment, and keeps him 
ever agreeably on the alert. 



THE DEMISE OP "HARPER'S WEEKLY" after fur- 
nishing wholesome entertainment and no little 
instruction to thousands of readers for half a cen- 
tury, and to somewhat fewer thousands for nine 
years beyond the half -century, is cause for regret. 
With older readers this famous periodical is 
largely associated with scenes and events in the 
Civil War, and with Thomas Nast's war sketches 
and political cartoons, and later with the noble and 
commanding editorial utterances of George William 
Curtis and Carl Schurz. But what gave to the 
paper its enviable popularity with general readers 
was its generous and skilful use of the timely 
illustration, the cartoon and the caricature. When 
the Sunday newspaper acquired the same facility, 
and in lavishness outdid the pictorial attractions of 
"Harper's Weekly," the fate of the latter, though 
averted for a time, was inevitable. Not any marked 
decline in the periodical itself, but the turning of 
its patrons more and more toward the cheaper 
substitute, was the undoing of this famous pub- 
lication. Not even a George Harvey or a Norman 
Hapgood could turn back the trend of things and 
restore the "Weekly" to its old place. 



A FALLACY OF THE TIMES would have the war- 
harassed world take comfort to itself in the fond 
hope that this bath of blood is a cleansing flood 
from which mankind will emerge with higher ideals 
and nobler aims. In literature there are to be 
no more decadent novels, no more sexual studies 
in the guise of fiction, no more morbidly introspec- 
tive essays posing as wholesome tales. But is 
it not time that some of these regenerative effects

should show themselves in our current literature? 
Is the tone of our printed matter any higher than 
it was two years ago? Is it even as high? In 
England we hear of a "Rainbow Society" for the 
private circulation of such dubious productions as 
Mr. D. H. Lawrence's novel, "The Rainbow," said 
to have been visited with the censor's disapproval, 
and other similar -works. In Germany there is 
reported to be an unprecedented circulation of 
vicious fiction. And everywhere the far from ele- 
vating, rather the brutalizing, realistic war-nar- 
rative is in eager demand. The London book- 
market is improving, is already notably brisker 
than a year ago; but it is the war-book and the 
cheap novel that bring in the shillings, not the 
noble and purified work of literature that was 
expected to mark the rebirth of a world baptized 
in blood. 



A REALISTIC CONCEPTION OF EDUCATION, by which 

the pupil is imagined as climbing, not exactly a 
hill of knowledge, but rather a succession of 
flights of stairs, was prevalent some years ago 
among a portion of our uneducated southern pop- 
ulation; and it may not yet have disappeared. In 
that recent notable autobiography, "The Black 
Man's Burden," its author, Mr. William H. Holtz- 
claw, who worked his way through Tuskegee Insti- 
tute and became the founder and head of a similar 
school in Mississippi, alludes to this curious con- 
ception as follows: "Before I left home we had 
some peculiar ideas about what a 'college' (as we 
all called boarding-schools at that time) was like. 
We all thought it was composed of one immense 
building with, say, four stories, and that the first 
year you were at school you were placed on the 
first floor, and promoted from floor to floor until 
you reached the top floor, when you would have 
finished school. Exceptionally bright students 
might skip a floor. Well, it so happened that 
when I reached Tuskegee I was placed to begin 
with in the attic, and there was great rejoicing at 
home when I sent back the intelligence that I was 
on the highest floor. It was a confirmation of 
what the old folks at home had said, I already 
knew enough without going to school." To know 
a thing "from the ground up" must have had a 
very real meaning to Mr. Holtzclaw's friends and 
relatives at home. 



A CONTRIBUTION TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF JOHN 

CALVIN, credited to "a catalog 'made in Oregon' 
by a trained librarian" is just now promoting the 
gaiety, perhaps not exactly of nations, but of the 
readers of the magazine, "Public Libraries." In 
its current issue a chapter of a series entitled 
"Adventures among Libraries" makes mention of 
a catalogue entry under the Genevan reformer's 
name referring the reader to Charles Dudley 
Warner's "My Summer in a Garden." In that 
ever-enjoyable classic it is said of Calvin, as the 
above-referred-to anonymous writer points out, 
that "although he was of Maltese race, I have 
reason to suppose that he was American by birth 
. . his antecedents were wholly unknown. . . 
He preferred as his table-cloth on the floor, a cer- 



tain well-known church journal. . . He had no 
religious prejudices. . . He could do almost 
anything but speak. . . Mice amused him. . . 
His conscience never seemed to interfere with his 
slumbers." Thus it seems that in his (or her) 
straining for completeness the Oregon person even 
i included Mr. Warner's pet cat, named after (by 
about three centuries and a half) the celebrated 
contemporary and antagonist of Servetus. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



"HAMLET" AND "THE ADVANCEMENT OF 

LEARNING." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your correspondent Mr. H. S. Howard, in the 
issue of April 27, cautions your readers against 
"concluding that Bacon is not 'Shakespeare' " until 
they have decided by whom and why Hamlet's 
words, "Sense sure you have Else could you not 
have motion" were omitted from the 1623 edition 
of Shakespeare's works. He asserts, as Mr. Baxter 
did before him, that the erroneous belief that "in 
the absence of sense there can be no motion" was 
contained in the 1604 edition of "Hamlet" and in 
the 1605 edition of Bacon's "Advancement of- 
Learning," was omitted from the 1623 edition of 
the play, and was corrected by Bacon in the 1623 
edition of his book. The explanation for this 
coincidence if it be one is very simple. 

In the first place, Hamlet's words do not mean 
what Bacon's words mean. Hamlet, in his fierce 
upbraiding of his mother, wholly forgetting the 
obligations of filial piety, this talking Lord 
always throws restraint and convention to the 
winds when he "accosts" the women he loves, tells 
her she must be endowed with mental faculties else 
could she not have sensual desires. That the words 
"sense" and "motion" had the meaning we give 
them is proved by a very similar passage in 
"Measure for Measure" (I. 4, 57-59) : 

Angelo, a man whose blood 
Is very snow-broth, one who never feels 
The wanton stings and motions of the sense. 

In "Othello" (I. 3, 333) "motions" is defined 
as "carnal stings," "unbitted lusts." Hamlet's 
words are true, and could not have been omitted 
from the later edition on the ground that their 
author no longer believed that locomotion without 
sense was impossible. For aught we know, 
Shakespeare never believed or heard of this absurd 
"classical" doctrine if there ever was such a 
doctrine. Bacon did not credit the ancients with 
the belief that motion without sense was impossible, 
as Messrs. Howard and Baxter imply, but that 
motion "at discretion" was impossible without 
sense. The omission of the words "at discretion" 
makes all the difference in the world, as any one 
knows who has ever seen the antics of a freshly- 
beheaded chicken. Bacon made his meaning per- 
fectly clear by adding the words "or sense without 
a soul" to the preceding "motion at discretion 
without sense" words that the Baconians slur 
over. Had Shakespeare intended Hamlet to say 
what the Baconians would put into his mouth, he 



498 



THE DIAL 



[May 25 



must have added the words "at discretion"; with- 
out them, Hamlet's words can be understood to 
mean only one thing. 

Why Shakespeare or the Globe stage-director 
or the Folio editors omitted the words in question 
is answered when we explain why some 220 other 
lines which appear in the 1604 Quarto have been 
omitted from the 1623 Folio. These cuts involve 
chiefly passages of a philosophical character, and 
were made because the play is too long for acting 
purposes and because these passages retard the 
dramatic movement of the action. It is not impos- 
sible that Shakespeare himself omitted some of 
these lines when he revised the play. That the 
reader may judge for himself how the dramatic 
effectiveness of this part of Hamlet's speech is 
improved by the omission of the italicized verses 

I append part of it : 

At your age 

The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, 
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment 
Would step from this [man] to this [man] ? Sense 

sure you have 
Else could you not have motion: but sure that sense 

[i. e. judgment] 

Is apoplex'd: for [even] madness would not [so] err, 
Nor sense to ecstasy [i. e. madness] was ne'er so 

thrall'd 
But it reserv'd [i. e. retained] some quantity [i. e. 

power] of choice, 

To serve in such a difference. What devil was't 
That thus hath cozen 'd you at hoodman-blind ? 

Read the speech with the italicized lines and then 
without them. For the study, we want every word 
that Shakespeare put into Hamlet's mouth; but 
on the stage much can be spared. 

Why is it, I wonder, that Baconians never stick 
to facts? Are they wilfully perverse, or are they 
merely obsessed? Here is Mr. Howard, who in all 
other respects may be "a piece of virtue," saying 
that I avoided answering the last part of 
Mr. Baxter's book "because it 'deals with ciphers,' 
etc." I refused (cf. THE DIAL, Dec. 9, 1915) to 
consider the latter half of Mr. Baxter's book 
because he there tries to prove that Bacon was 
Shakespeare without having first disproved, in the 
first half of his book, that Shakespeare was 
Shakespeare. SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM.

MOKE ABOUT "SPOON EIVEE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of April 27 appeared a communi- 
cation inspired by a few impressions of the " Spoon 
River Anthology" recently printed in these col- 
umns. 

I agree with your correspondent that "Spoon 
River" needs no apologia. No one to-day would 
suggest a defence of the laboratory method. Many 
of us, however, have firm "personal convictions" 
that the laboratory method is unsuited to the high 
purposes of poetry. "Spoon River" is an excel- 
lent laboratory manual. I think we can classify it 
as good science, a faithful tabulation of a certain 
type of psychological or physiological fact. As 
such it needs no apologia. I have no quarrel with 
scientific truth, but I do feel disgusted when the 



wild-eyed iconoclast in his mad desire to improve 
the "accepted oracles of criticism" drags into liter- 
ature, by the hair, a set of scientific facts which no 
more make good literature than the bull of Bashen 
could make good music. No one denies that 
"things do happen as they happen in 'Spoon 
River.' " Without questioning the valuable infor- 
mation of the things that happen in "Spoon 
River," we turn them over to the professor of 
psychology and the sociological investigator. There 
is a vital difference between science and art. The 
method of the first is analysis; but art does more 
than analyze and reflect life. When science has 
examined and classified its facts, its work is 
ended. Art may stoop to the results of science, 
but it uses them freely for the purpose of a higher 
synthesis. 

Your correspondent clamors for a full recogni- 
tion of Me by literature. Truly, literature has 
partially failed when it does not turn all of life, 
the lights and the shadows, the good and the evil, 
to account. Literature must reflect life. This 
much and no more both psychology and the social 
sciences do ; yet no one will call either of these art. 
Literature does more than merely reflect life, its 
sublime function is to react upon life. It elevates 
life and informs it with a higher meaning. 
Emerson, Carlyle, Browning, Shakespeare are not 
great because they reflect life. The poorest drunk- 
ard in his "last delirium" can do that. They are 
great, and their writings are real literature, because 
they do what the drunkard does not do they 
reanimate life, they modify it, they lift it above 
the level of analysis by pouring into it the fulness 
of their thought and feeling. Literature contrib- 
utes something original to life. This is a distinc- 
tion between art and science. 

Too often art, and philosophy likewise, must 
endure the insolence of science. Too often in this 
skeptical world science has claimed the last word, 
and has trampled the rich things of the spirit in the 
dust. Its business is to analyze and to classify the 
facts of the material world. The function of art 
and of philosophy and of religion is to lead us 
deeper into the realm of the spirit. Here science 
must remain dumb. I object to those votaries of 
science who leave the outer porch to set up their 
brazen image in the inner shrine of the temple 
where poetry worships. Science has its legitimate 
field, but the nature of that field renders science 
inadequate to those needs of life which only poetry 
and her sister arts can satisfy. 

We need not fear that truth will disappear from 
the earth if literature does not speak in vulgar 
accents. Truth has the happy faculty of caring 
for itself. Moreover, the type of truth demanded 
by your correspondent will be cared for by science. 
Rather should we be fearful lest the truth of poetry 
shall die. We can get any number of psychologists 
and sociologists, the woods are full of them. It 
is the poet for whom we strain our eyes. 

I deplore with your correspondent the "decadent 
sentimentality" which renders much literature dis- 
gusting. Nevertheless, we need not in denouncing 
this go to the other extreme. In a recent essay in 
THE DIAL occurred these excellent words; "I for 
one believe that reticence, in life and in art, is a

JAPANESE PALINDROMES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The subject of palindromes happened to come 
up in my class the other day. After I had given 
the most common English example, I asked for 
some examples of Japanese palindromes. This 
brought out specimens of three or four kinds: 
those which appear when written in the Japanese 
syllabary (kana) ; those in Chinese ideographs; 
those in Roman letters; and those in two of these 
kinds at one and the same time. A few of these 
examples may be cited here. 

Sa-to To-sa (also read To-sake) is a personal 
name that makes a palindrome in both the Japa- 
nese syllabary and the Chinese ideographs. Mi-wa- 
ta Rin-zo, Ku-bo-deva Yassu-hisa, and Wata-nabe 
Watara are personal names that form palindromes 
only with Chinese ideographs (indicated by sylla- 
bles), although in the last case there is a hint of 
the palindrome in the Roman letters. A-ka-sa-ka, 
the name of one of the districts of Tokyo, is a 
palindrome only when Romanized; and Ta-ba-ta, 
the name of one of our suburbs, is a palindrome 
only in Japanese. Ki-tsu-tsu-ki (wood-pecker) is 
another example. Ta-ke-ya ga ya-ke-ta ("The 
bamboo shop has burned") forms a palindrome in 
Japanese kana only. 

There are two Japanese poems (of thirty-one 
syllables) that make good palindromes; but, being 
artificial, they do not make good sense, so I shall 
not attempt any translation thereof. The first one 
is called "Hatsu-yume," or "First Dream" (of the 



less corrupting influence than loose babbling. By 
all means let us tell our children all the essential 
facts of sex. But it does not follow that we need 
to introduce them into brothels, or even into our 
own bed-chambers." The writer of these sentences 
decries that frankness which has so arrogantly 
taken possession of recent life and literature. 
Literature as art must ever minister to the higher 
needs of man, to his feelings, thought, imagination, 
and to his sense of the good and the beautiful. It 
cannot do this by presenting evil in lurid pictures. 
At best, this is only negative; more often it is 
seductive. Literature can fulfil its higher mission 
by informing life with new vitality and with posi- 
tive and original strength. It remains science as 
long as it merely reflects life; it becomes art when 
it recreates Me. 

By all means let us have careful and scientific 
investigation of the essential facts of life, but let 
not the fire-breathing iconoclast throw the dirty 
stuff in our faces and bid us call it poetry. Let us 
turn these facts over to the social and psycholog- 
ical analyst. He is equipped with the germproof i 
uniform and the disinfectants and the smelling j 
salts that are necessary in handling them. 

"Spoon River" thoroughly analyzes and reflects 
a certain type of life; but I seriously doubt that 
it meets the requirement of "high seriousness" 
which makes poetry an art. As science, it needs ] 
no apologia; as poetry, it needs some chloride of

New Year). It is written on a sheet of paper, 
folded in the shape of a ship, and laid under the 
pillow, as a charm to ensure a good dream. It 
reads as follows: 

Na-ga-ki yo no 

To-o no ne-mu-ri no 

Mi-na me-za-me 

Na-mi no-ri fu-ne no 

O-to no yo-ki ka na. 

It should be explained that ka and ga are written 
with the same character, with diacritical marks 
(in prose) to indicate the "muddy" sound of ga; 
and that mu and fu are interchangeable. So the 
poem is a better palindrome in Japanese kana 
than when it is transliterated into Roman letters. 
The other poem is a first-class palindrome in the 
Japanese syllabary, as follows: 

To-ku ta-ta-shi 

Sa-to no ta-ka-mu-ra 

Yu-ki shi-ro-shi 

Ki-yu-ra-mu ka-ta no 

To-sa-shi ta-ta-ku to. 

Note how the verbal palindrome, "shi-ro-shi," 
forms the pivot, exactly in the centre. This poem 
was written by a famous scholar, Dr. Haga. 

The Japanese syllabary lends itself admirably to 
the forming of palindromes.

MORE NOTES ON POE'S FIRST SCHOOL IN 

LONDON. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As a postscript to my letter in your latest issue 
concerning Edgar Allan Poe's first school in 
London, two additional items which have since 
come to my notice may be of interest. 

The school at 146 Sloane Street, Chelsea, kept 
by the Misses Dubourg, which Poe attended in 
1816, was a small private house of ordinary type. 
It was erected about the beginning of the 19th 
century and was removed in 1885 to make way for 
the present building. 

"Pauline Dubourg" is the name of one of the 
characters in Poe's tale, "The Murders in the Rue 
Morgue." He took the surname, beyond doubt, 
from the list of his personal friends and acquaint- 
ances, precisely as he took the name of Bransby, 
the schoolmaster of Stoke-Newington, for his tale 
of "William Wilson." These autobiographical 
references in disguise make one wonder how many 
other instances, as yet undetected, may lie hidden

Since the surname Dubourg is founded on fact, 
it is not, I think, unreasonable to assume that the 
Christian name Pauline goes with it. In other 
words, this family, all traces of which had been 
lost until a few months ago, now contributes three 
names to be henceforth associated with Poe's child- 
hood in England, Francis, presumably the father 
since he was the tenant according to the poor rate 
books from 1816 to 1822 ; George, the brother, who 
was Allan's clerk; and Pauline Dubourg, in fiction 
a laundress of Paris, in life Poe's school teacher 
in London. LEWIS CHASE.

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A "STAND-PAT" 
REPUBLICAN.* 



When an American political leader of dis- 
tinction, one who served as a governor of 
Ohio in the transitional eighties and as a Sen- 
ator of the United States throughout the 
administrations of McKinley and Roosevelt, 
who had a conspicuous part in the nominations 
of Elaine, Harrison, and McKinley, and had 
differences of national prominence with 
Hanna, Roosevelt, and Taft, writes at sixty- 
nine and "in retirement" his "Notes of a 
Busy Life," it is an event of importance to 
students of political history and of interest 
to all who follow with care the constantly 
changing politics of the nation. "When the 
writer is Joseph Benson Foraker, the reader 
is assured a vigorous account including 
eulogies of countless Republicans, here and 
there a sparing comment upon a Democrat, 
and a frank acceptance of all that goes to 
constitute " stand-pat" Republicanism. 

We were recently given the autobiography 
of an insurgent Republican, and somewhat 
later the account of certain phases of "the 
most interesting American"; but neither the 
first, which dealt largely with the personal 
politics of Wisconsin, nor the second, which 
gave us little more than a background of 
personal interest, revealed a great deal of 
Republicanism. It was left to Mr. Foraker 
to write a painstaking, if not impartial, polit- 
ical account of the more important develop- 
ments within the Republican party in the 
period since the close of Reconstruction. 
These two bulky volumes are not in a class 
with the briefer recollections of John 
Sherman, Shelby M. Cullom, and Adlai 
Stevenson; although they have in common 
with these a large emphasis upon the personal 
element in political relationships. The only 
account of this period which one may care to 
use with Mr. Foraker 's work is Mr. Herbert 
Croly 's biography of Marcus A. Hanna ; and 
where the editor of "The New Republic" has 
led in critical interpretation of the changing 
phases of Republicanism, Mr. Foraker excels 
in realistic presentation of the rough-and- 
tumble politics of the thirty years that fol- 
lowed the Civil War. 

Enlisting as a private in 1862, when barely 
sixteen years of age, Foraker served through 
the war, marching with Sherman and acquit- 
ing himself with distinction on the staff of

General Slocum. He records General Sherman 
as saying, in substance: "Don't forget that 
when you have crossed the Savannah River 
you will be in South Carolina. You need not 
be so careful there about private property as 
we have been. The more of it you destroy 
the better it will be. The people of South 
Carolina should be made to feel the war, for 
they brought it on and are responsible more 
than anybody else for our presence here. 
Now is the time to punish them." Cherishing 
such a recollection, Mr. Foraker twenty years 
later became, in the words of ex-President 
Hayes, "popular with the hurrah boys." 
When charged in 1885 with waving the 
"bloody shirt," he answered that the shirt was 
undoubtedly bloody, but that "the Democratic 
hoodlums and thugs of the South had made it 
so." Later, in a joint debate with his antag- 
onist in the gubernatorial contest, cheers and 
applause and election followed his sally : 
"While one Democrat was killing Lincoln 
another was trying to kill William H. 
Seward. " 

Serving as Governor of Ohio during 
Cleveland's first administration, Foraker was 
brought into great prominence as the exponent 
on the stump of the Republican party "that 
fought the war." He was a relentless critic 
of Cleveland. It was Foraker who, after 
Cleveland's famous order for the return of 
state flags, telegraphed a protesting former 
comrade-in-arms: "No rebel flags will be sur- 
rendered while I am Governor. V In the midst 
of his second term as Governor, he went as a 
delegate to the Republican national conven- 
tion of 1888. John Sherman was Ohio's can- 
didate, and Foraker seconded the nomination. 
As it became evident that Sherman could not 
secure the nomination, two other Ohio men 
were widely discussed as possibilities, 
Congressman William McKinley and Governor 
Foraker. It was charged at the time, and 
the charges have reappeared from time to 
time, that Foraker was not faithful to the 
Sherman candidacy. This was partly due to 
the presence in Chicago of the Foraker March- 
ing Club of Cincinnati and partly to the effect 
of one of Foraker 's earlier speeches in this 
convention. One correspondent wrote: "The 
effect of the speech was to make Governor 
Foraker the favorite of the convention. It 
was manifest he stood before it an ideal parti- 
san, reckless of the censure of his enemies, 
proud of its achievements, and indifferent to 
every effect except that upon party success. " 

After several ballots without decisive result, 
the convention adjourned over Sunday. Dur- 
ing this recess a message came from Blame 
positively refusing the use of his name. The

pressure increased in certain quarters to break 
from Sherman. The latter, although in Wash- 
ington, knew of this, and of the rumor that 
Foraker was being considered as a vice- 
presidential candidate by certain Elaine dele- 
gates. He telegraphed Foraker of his refusal 
to withdraw at that time. Foraker tele- 
graphed in reply: "I have refused to allow 
my name to be mentioned by anybody for 
anything, and I do not think it will be men- 
tioned in the convention ; but if it should be, 
it will be without my consent or approval, and 
if I should be nominated it will be declined 
unless you should request me to accept." This 
telegram was sent on Sunday. "At two 
o 'clock Monday morning, " writes Mr. Foraker, 
"I was wakened by a delegation of Blaine 
men, among whom were Senator Stephen B. 
El kins of West Virginia and Honorable 
Samuel Fessenden of Connecticut. . . They 
told me they had just come from a meeting 
of Blaine leaders, at which it was determined 
to throw the entire Blaine strength to me on 
Monday morning, if I would accept the nomi- 
nation. . . I told them I could not and 
would not accept the nomination, no matter 
how cordially it might be tendered unless 
preceded or accompanied with the request 
from Sherman that I accept." The nomina- 
tion went to Governor Harrison of Indiana, 
and Foraker 's one opportunity was gone, 
although he received votes for the nomination 
in the convention of 1908. The reputation 
acquired in this convention remained his title 
to national prominence until he came to the 
Senate. In the meantime he had nominated 
McKinley three times, had written the 
Minneapolis platform, and "his face had 
become as familiar as that of Grant or Blaine." 
Mr. Foraker has devoted his second volume 
to the period since the campaign of 1896. 
During twelve of these years he was in the 
Senate. To this period belong the disagree- 
ments with Roosevelt, particularly over the 
Brownsville affair, the sensational Hearst 
charges of 1908, and Foraker 's final break 
with Taft. To the present reviewer, it seems 
that the second volume is less valuable, as a 
political record and a personal revelation, 
than the first. The reason may be surmised. 
Up to 1896, Foraker was fighting the battles 
within his party with weapons dear to him 
from a young and emotional association. 
Moreover, he led the forces of aggression. 
After 1896 he represented the old tradition. 
he was "standing pat." The party tenets of 
the new age did not excite his approval. As a 
conservative he held attention by satire and 
ready grasp of questions that arose in debate. 
But he will be remembered in this period, it 



is safe to say, for his aggressive campaign in 
behalf of the negro soldiers dismissed by 
Roosevelt. Into this cause he put his heart, 
and in doing so he was true to himself and the 
generation he typifies. 

Of the reform campaign of 1876, the 
author writes: "No reforms were needed, but 
a fact like that never interfered with a 
reform campaign." Ten years later he was 
saying: "We Republicans are too old, have 
had too much experience, fought too many 
fights, and stand charged with too many 
responsibilities, to waste time listening to im- 
practical teachings about theoreticalisms." 
This attitude was still dominant in 1904, when 
he wrote of an opponent: "Instead of repre- 
senting railroads and corporations that were 
developing and carrying forward the great 
business interests of the country, which in the 
opinion of his nominator would have disquali- 
fied him for the Senatorship, he had a good 
general practice based on the quarrels of liti- 
gants, divorce suits and criminal cases, and 
that according to the same opinion, fitted him 
exactly for the public service." It is revealed 
repeatedly in these volumes that Mr. Foraker 
was, as he has been described elsewhere, "a 
proud, self-contained, and self-confident man 
whose nature it was to play a lone hand." 

In the midst of his revelation of the intrica- 
cies and maladjustments of our political 
system there are flashes of the man as an 
observer of the play he frequently directed. 
Early in the administration of McKinley it 
was the wish of the President to appoint a 
certain Ohio man to a consulship at Manila. 
Mr. Foraker records McKinley as saying: "It 
is somewhere away around on the other side 
of the world. He did not know just where, 
and had not had time to look it up." Mr. 
Foraker comments that this was the first time 
(1897) he had ever heard of the Philippine 
Islands in such a way as to remember them. 
He recalls that it was one of his appointments 
while governor that placed William H. Taft, 
then a young man of twenty-nine, on the judi- 
cial bench in Cincinnati ; and doubtless it was 
with some enjoyment that he included this 
newspaper comment upon Roosevelt, then a 
young man of twenty-four, in the Republican 
convention of 1884: "The person attracting 
the most attention was Roosevelt, who is a 
rather dudish-looking boy with eye-glasses and 
an Olympian scowlet-for-a-cent." 

Although Mr. Foraker modestly feels that 
he "has written of past events in which there 
is no present interest." no student of Ameri- 
can history and no thoughtful observer of our 
national politics can afford to ignore these

A MATURE VIEW OF GOTHIC 
ARCHITECTURE.* 

In his eightieth year, Sir Thomas Jackson 
has undertaken to supplement, his " Byzan- 
tine and Eomanesque Architecture" (reviewed 
in THE DIAL for October 16, 1913) by a com- 
panion work on Gothic architecture. The 
book shows the experience and mellowness of 
age without its dogmatism, and easily takes 
rank as the most important general work on 
the subject in English. As in the "Roman- 
esque Architecture, " the author discusses only 
buildings which he himself has seen, which 
here include all those of first importance 
within the field covered by the title, and 
illustrates them by preference from his own 
inexhaustible sketch books. The method fol- 
lowed is an extended, but by no means 
complete, description of these buildings, 
arranged within each country in a generally 
historical order, and accompanied by tech- 
nical and historical introductions and a 
running commentary of artistic criticism. 
Although thus doubtless conceived as a gen- 
eral history of Gothic architecture, the book 
proves to be rather a vehicle for the presen- 
tation of the experiences and the views of a 
man whose professional contact with the sub- 
ject matter is wider, and whose critical views 
are in this regard more broadly based, than 
those of any other man now living. 

The deficiencies of the work are those of 
its predecessor in common, it must be con- 
fessed, with most writings in English on the 
history of art. They arise from the general 
confusion of thought regarding the applica- 
tion of historical methods to the treatment of 
artistic subjects, and regarding the categories 
of historical and critical writing. These mat- 
ters are well understood in France and Ger- 
many, and it is time that we ourselves should 
understand them and so put an end to the 
hybrid and unsatisfactory books which, with 
their useless duplication of effort, are the 
bane of history and criticism alike. The 
modern principle is a scientific division of 
labor, made necessary by the vast multiplica- 
tion of objects of historic interest and by the 
obscurity and intricacy of the ultimate evi- 
dences concerning them. Such a scientific 
method aims to substitute, in place of uncer- 
tain speculation on probabilities, the erection 
of an orderly historic edifice. The founda- 
tions consist of numerous monographic studies 
of the relevant monuments, and the multi- 
tude of obscure documents concerning them:

trated. University of Chicago Press. 



the superstructure, of studies in interpreta- 
tion and in the combination of a few elements. 
Only when these foundations are laid, and 
this superstructure erected, can the crowning 
feature of all, the synthetic presentation of 
historical development, be attempted. Con- 
siderations of wise economy, as well as of 
clearness and adaptation to purpose, suggest 
that in such a synthetic view the detailed 
description of individual monuments, the 
attempt to weigh individual bits of documen- 
tary evidence, be suppressed, and that, on the 
other hand, the widest reference be made to 
the individual studies of previous writers and 
the most recent views and discussions in ques- 
tions of interpretation. 

The Benedictines of France in the eigh- 
teenth century and the German historians of 
the nineteenth realized this, and turned first, 
with self-sacrificing energy and pains, to the 
minute study of the ultimate facts, which is 
so ignorantly spoken of as "German scholar- 
ship." Ignorantly, because the practitioners 
have well understood that it is not the whole 
of scholarship, and have been the first to reap 
the fruit of their own earlier efforts. There 
have arisen fresh interpretations and fresh 
syntheses, which have the novel merit of rest- 
ing at every point on a complete and logical 
substructure. In the construction of such an 
historical edifice, critical judgments, whether 
moral or artistic, have no place. Their place 
is another and not less honorable one, lying 
in the realm of ethics or aesthetics, but not 
of history. If the function of the critic, like 
that of the historian, is understood, it will 
be recognized that it is safest to practice the 
two independently, though both may conceiv- 
ably be practiced by the same person. 

In the study of Gothic architecture an 
enormous quantity of minute research has 
already been done. Satisfactory interpreta- 
tions of many of its single phases exist, and 
possibly the time is ripe for at least a pro- 
visional synthesis, either historical or critical. 
Such an historical synthesis has been recently 
attempted, a trifle hastily, by Mr. Arthur 
Kingsley Porter in his "Mediaeval Architec- 
ture" ; and something of the sort, written with 
fuller personal knowledge of the monuments, 
one might have hoped for in a new book with 
the title and obvious purpose of Sir Thomas 
Jackson's. As an alternative possibility, one 
might hope for a book devoted to artistic 
interpretation and criticism, likewise presup- 
posing the establishment of the details of 
historic fact by others. 

It proves that in Sir Thomas's book we 
have neither of these things in purity, but a 
mixture of criticism and historical general- 



1916]

ization, cumbered with a wealth of descriptive 
detail and of first hand observations on indi- 
vidual points. The author defends himself in 
his preface against critics who complained 
that his descriptions in the earlier book were 
not complete. As the material is easily access- 
ible elsewhere, he would have been wiser to 
omit detailed descriptions altogether. The 
many fresh points of detail noted in regard to 
English buildings, on the other hand, might 
best have formed the subject of treatment in a 
briefer independent work. We might then 
have had in more convenient compass the 
admirably clear historical introductions and 
summaries, or the equally admirable exposi- 
tion and sane artistic appreciation. Freed 
from his unnecessary burdens, the author 
might thus have found time to enrich his gen- 
eralizations by reference to the views of such 
important writers as Male and Brutails, who 
seem to have lain outside the field of his 
reading. 

After allowance has been made for the con- 
fusion of genres, and the resulting failure to 
achieve fully the merits of any one, we find, 
nevertheless, that Sir Thomas has made 
notable contributions alike in personal obser- 
vation of individual facts, in historical inter- 
pretation, and in artistic criticism. The 
additions to our knowledge of detail fall 
almost entirely in the field of English Gothic, 
especially in the numerous cases of buildings 
with which Sir Thomas has been profession- 
ally connected. The practical observations 
on the effects of thrusts by vaults and flying 
buttresses, the establishment that there is no 
thrust at certain points, with other well 
attested conclusions, are corrective of current 
ideas too hastily adopted. 

In historical interpretation the author ren- 
ders his greatest service by setting right the 
question whether a specific structural system 
is the differentia of Gothic architecture. Mr. 
Charles H. Moore, the author of the best 
known general work on Gothic in English, 
has insisted that the name of Gothic must be 
confined to buildings showing the system of 
vaults with balanced thrusts, found especially 
in the cathedrals of the Ile-de-France. Mr. 
Moore's emphasis on the existence of a dif- 
ference in structural principle between such 
buildings and others, which include the 
majority of later mediaeval buildings outside 
of France, has been valuable. His restriction 
of the term Gothic to the first group, however, 
is certainly a wrenching of all usage ; and the 
contention that the difference in structural 
system constitutes the chief point of division 
in the architecture of the Middle Ages is 
based on the assumptions of a previous gen- 



eration, certainly untenable. It is as if one 
were to deny, as Ferguson did, that lintels and 
round arches could both belong in the 
Roman "style." All "this has been repeatedly 
pointed out by reviewers of Mr. Moore's 
books, and by writers on English architec- 
ture; but the misapprehension can only be 
finally dislodged by a general book which shall 
replace Mr. Moore's as the most authoritative 
work on the subject in English. This Sir 
Thomas Jackson has now furnished. 

It is really in the matter of artistic criti- 
cism, rather than of historical research or 
interpretation, however, that Sir Thomas's 
book makes its chief contribution. It is a 
signal evidence of his continued growth and 
intellectual hospitality that he is able at his 
advanced age to voice what one must feel, in 
most instances, are the critical judgments of 
the younger generation. While it is doubtful 
whether critical judgments of any generation 
will ever retain permanent validity, it is pos- 
sible to believe that the constantly growing 
catholicity given us by increasing historical 
understanding of previous ages is really a 
tendency of progress. This tendency Sir 
Thomas carries on by his sympathetic treat- 
ment of long mistreated phases like Italian 
Gothic, Flamboyant, and Perpendicular. In 
these cases and others, there can be little 
doubt that he expresses the feelings of a mul- 
titude. With all its catholicity, of course, our 
age still has its purely intuitive favorites, 
differing from the favorites of even a few 
years ago. In his choice of these, Sir Thomas 
is still young. Thus, when he prefers the 
soaring ambition of Beauvais to the classical 
perfection of Amiens, the gorgeous facade of 
Rheims to the peaceful one of Paris, he is 
expressing that reaction against logic which 
seems to be the esthetic temper of our own 
day. 

The publishers have spared no pains to give 
the work a form which corresponds with the 
importance of the text. Light and fine tex- 
tured English paper, wide margins, a legible 
type face and attractive vellum backed bind- 
ing, with the multitude of excellent half-tones 
justify the not immoderate price set upon the 
volumes. 

Personal in its composition of diverse ele- 
ments and in its assemblage of individual 
observations; unnecessarily descriptive at 
times, yet always readable ; clear and trench- 
ant in historical exposition, though sometimes 
less concerned with flux than with static con- 
ditions, Sir Thomas Jackson's "Gothic 
Architecture" has yet its greatest value as a 
representative of our newest critical appre- 
ciation. FlSKE KlMBALL.

THE GREAT SAGA OF IRELAND. * 



It is only the apple tree in one's own back 
yard that remains neglected. Ireland is Eng- 
land's back yard. Its rich apples of saga and 
song are left to rot upon the ground unob- 
served. 

Suppose a thousand-year-old treasure house 
in England had been dug up in 1914. The 
world war would not have prevented the 
monthlies, the weeklies, and even the dailies, 
from devoting columns to the wonders of by- 
gone days thus revealed: There would have 
been pictures of the weapons and of the war 
chariots which we may imagine dragged into 
daylight from their long concealment, and 
there would have been thoughtful speculations 
upon the kind of people who built this house 
and laid away these treasures. 

Suppose that not a treasure house but only 
a poem, another English epic older than the 
"Beowulf," or another Greek poem resembling 
the "Iliad," had been discovered. Would 
there not have been intelligent and enthusias- 
tic discussion of it, and would not by this 
time books have been written setting forth 
fresh ideas which the new epic had suggested 
concerning the life of our ancestors ? 

Why should stories translated from Irish 
meet with no more attention than if they 
had been brought out of Egyptian or of 
Gujerati? The Irishman, with his brothers, 
the Highlander and the Welshman, is nearer 
to the Englishman than anybody else. Even 
if English insular habits of thought ostra- 
cize Irish culture as belonging to the history 
of another island, no explanation exists for 
the neglect of Irish literature in the United 
States, where live more people of Irish descent 
than in Ireland itself. And yet the publica- 
tion of Ireland's greatest saga, translated by 
Miss Faraday, in 1904, from the short version 
has not met with much attention, perhaps 
partly because the shorter form of the saga 
is too rugged to be attractive to modern 
readers. 

The Tain Bo (pronounced "thawn bo"), 
which is now for the first time completely 
translated from the longer form by Professor 
Joseph Dunn of the Catholic University at 
Washington, was actually written down in the 
manuscripts as we have them about eight 
hundred years ago. It must have been sub- 
stantially composed fifteen hundred years ago, 
and the historical events with which it is con- 
nected must have taken place at the beginning 
of the Christian Era, when the Irish were not 
only pagan but were well nigh untouched by

lated and edited by Joseph Dunn. London: David Nutt. 



influences from Greece and Rome. The Tain 
Bo is by several centuries older than the 
"Beowulf," far older than the oldest German 
poem, the oldest French epic, or the oldest 
Norwegian saga. It is the most ancient exist- 
ing literary monument of any of the peoples 
who dwell this side of the Alps. 

The Tain Bo is not an epic, but rather the 
materials for an epic. Like all the old Irish 
sagas, it is in prose, with every now and then 
a poem inserted. It is by no means a finished 
literary whole, even in the sense that we can 
say of "Beowulf" or of the "Niebelungeii 
Lied" or of the "Song of Roland" that they 
are literary wholes. It was not written, as 
these were, by a cultivated artist who retold 
old hero tales in a skilful way and for a chosen 
audience. In the Tain Bo collected hero tales 
appear very much in their original form. 
Much of the art which it has is outrageously 
unlike any literary art with which we are 
familiar. It requires to be thrice translated 
to become intelligible to a modern reader. 
First, it must be accurately and completely 
rendered into English. This task Professor 
Dunn has accomplished in the volume before 
us. Second, someone with a voice and a pres- 
tige such as Matthew Arnold possessed must 
advertise it, get it talked about, and make its 
strange names familiar to readers. Finally, it 
must be explained and illustrated in a hun- 
dred ways : it must be retold in diluted para- 
phrases, and perhaps, if fortune smiles, it may 
serve as the inspiration for a modern poet who 
shall represent the old and yet be new. 
Professor Dunn 's introduction is so good that 
one could wish it longer, but he has not 
thought it right to increase the size of his 
book. He has reserved explanation and com- 
ment for another volume, which the reader 
will be glad to note he has in mind. 

Since a relish for story outlines is not com- 
mon except among college professors and 
members of Chautauqua circles, no attempt 
will be made here to tell the story of the 
Tain Bo. Moreover, the plot of the Tain Bo 
is the simplest thing in the world: a cattle 
foray, and a war which ensued to recover the 
stolen herd. 

The people of the Tain Bo were at a ruder 
stage of culture than the warriors of 
"Beowulf." They had not yet, like the 
English thanes, learned from Caesar's 
legionaries the use of helmet and coat of mail. 
Some of the warriors of the Tain Bo entered 
the battle stark naked. Warfare was con- 
ducted by a series of single combats between 
chosen heroes, exactly as in the "Iliad." If 
some time-machine could transport us to the 
year "one" in Ireland, we should certainly

mistake Cuchulinn (pronounced "kuhoolin"), 
fighting from his two-wheeled chariot, guided 
by a faithful charioteer, for one of the war- 
riors of Agamemnon. The machine gun of 
the Tain Bo battles was the scythed chariot, 
which is the same engine of war that is de- 
scribed for us in the "Anabasis" and in the 
Book of Judges. Sisera's "nine hundred 
chariots of iron," with which "he mightily 
oppressed the children of Israel," doubtless 
resembled those with which Queen Medb 
(pronounced "mave") broke the line of the 
men of Ulster. In some respects the Irish 
warriors were at a lower stage of culture than 
Hector and Achilles. Warriors carried about 
the heads of slain foes attached to their belts, 
like the Red Indian 's scalps, or stuck them on 
posts outside the tent door to advertise their 
prowess. Perhaps the ancestors of all Eu- 
ropean peoples passed through such a stage 
of culture in their struggle through millions 
of years from the beast up to the man. 

Yet the rough picture of the Tain Bo con- 
tains glimpses of a certain wholesome kindness 
and even courtesy which are hard to match 
in the more advanced civilization of the 
"Beowulf" or even of the "Iliad." Evidently 
the pagan Irish must be likened to children 
rather than to savages. A word led to a blow, 
to the flash of bloody swords, and then perhaps 
to a reconciliation and to a kiss for the sur- 
vivors. Some of these bits of chivalry may 
have been exalted into prominence by those 
who wrote down the saga in Christian times. 
Cuchulinn and Ferdiad. sharing each other's 
food and medicine in the intervals of deadly 
conflict, and their charioteers sleeping beside 
the same fire, may be exceptional. But noble 
traits are clearly inherent in the saga. 
Cuehulinn will not slay women, charioteers, 
or unarmed men. As he is about to cut down 
Loch, his deadly foe. the latter asks that he 
may be allowed to fall forward with his face 
towards the enemy, and Cuchulinn grants his 
prayer. "For 'tis a warrior's request that 
thou makest." 

The King in "Beowulf" is descended from 
the gods, but remotely through several genera- 
Jions. Cuchulinn ? s own father was a god, and 
the divine parent enters one of the conflicts 
of the Tain Bo to give aid to his son. The men 
of "Beowulf" stood in awe of the marvellous 
monsters with whom they fought, but they 
were not superstitious about them. Beowulf 
seems to act by the cold light of reason, 
whereas Cuchulinn was led by impulse and by 
supernatural scruples. The supernatural pro- 
hibition geis (pronounced "gas") plays an 
important part in the action of the Tain Bo. 
A warrior must not drive his chariot toward 



Tara with the city on his left hand, because 
that was forbidden by a geis. The whole army 
of Connaught must stop for a day because 
Cuchulinn had put a geis upon them not to 
advance till one of their number could make 
his chariot leap over an oak tree, as Cuchulinn 
had done. 

If the Tain Bo is of great historical and 
anthropological interest, this is not saying, I 
hope, that its interest is inhuman. It is shot 
through with coruscating phrases which prove 
that the fili (men of letters), though they 
never gained the sustained power necessary 
to fashion into unity a long artistic work, 
were masters of many of the details of story 
telling. One of the commonest and most 
powerful of the narrative devices is the triad 
arranged in climax, as in the description of 
the arrival of the hero Cormac: 

First came a great company of warriors with a 
powerful man at the head. "Is that Connac yonder!" 
all the people asked. "Not he indeed," Queen Medb 
made answer. 

Then came a second troop with better armor than 
the first. "Is yonder man Cormac?" all and everyone 
asked. "Xay, verily, that is not he," Medb made 
answer. 

Then came the greatest troop of all, and their 
spears were as long as the pillars of the King 's house. 
"Is that Cormac yonder?" asked all. "Ay! It is he 
this time," Medb answered. 

The choice and arrangement of words in the 
Irish narrative are often wholly admirable. 
Thus for example, when Queen Medb explains 
why it took her so long to choose a husband: 
" 'I desired,' she said, 'to wait, for I must 
have a husband without avarice, without 
jealousy, and without fear. ' ' 

Nor is the Tain Bo as a, whole without a 
rough sort of unity. The reader notes a 
progress in the series of single combats of 
which the saga is largely made up. They are 
at first gay and bombastic in their character, 
but become gloomier in tone, until they cul- 
minate in the tragic and terrible battle of the 
closing pages. 

Professor Dunn has kept his translation 
readable without sacrificing faithfulness to 
his original. I cannot pretend to have com- 
pared his translation with the twelfth century 
manuscripts which contain the Irish tale, 
although this would now be possible, since 
the Newberry Library in Chicago numbers 
facsimiles of these famous manuscripts among 
its treasures. I have, however, compared in 
several places his English with the Gaelic 
original as printed by Windisch (Irische 
Texte, Extroband, Leipzig, 1905), and with 
Windisch's German version, and have noted 
no variations worth recording. 

The Tain Bo in its new English dress will 
find its place on the shelves of every great

A XEW HISTORY OF FRANCE.* 



In a famous phrase, Brunetiere has defined 
the essential trait of French literature as the 
social spirit, One manifestation of this char- 
acteristic is the undisputed precedence held 
by the French in the art of giving artistic 
form to erudition. A striking example is the 
great "History of France," published under 
the general editorship of Professor Lavisse. 
As invaluable as charming to students of his- 
tory, the work has proved rather too long for 
the general reader. A warm welcome should 
therefore be extended to a shorter work in 
this field, modelled on the same lines, to be 
issued under the direction of M. Funck-Bren- 
tano. The first volume to appear in English 
(the second of the series) is "The Century of 
the Renaissance," by M. Batiffol. The French 
title of the complete work, "L'Histoire de 
France racontee a tous," defines its purpose. 
Each volume is the work of a specialist, but 
the general public is always kept in view. If 
the remaining volumes equal the first in inter- 
est, the enterprise should be a distinct success. 

Following the custom of Lavisse 's History, 
M. Batiffol has added much to the charm and 
vividness of his narrative by the frequent 
citation of picturesque phrases and charac- 
teristic comments from the memoirs of con- 
temporaries, letters of ambassadors, or the 
utterances of the protagonists themselves. 
Among the latter, Henry IV 's bons mots 
naturally hold a prominent place. Besieged 
by partisans demanding vengeance on former 
enemies just after his accession to the throne, 
he replied: "If you said the Lord's prayer 
every day with real sincerity, you would not 
talk as you do." An effective use of such 
citation is the title of the first chapter, 
"Smoke and Glory of Italy," borrowed from 
Commynes, who also observes of the first of 
the Italian invasions that if it had not proved 
a disaster from the start the reason was

nam's Sons. 



"because the expedition had been guided by 
God, and owed but little to the good sense of 
the leaders." M. Batiffol is not one of those 
who overestimate the effect of these invasions 
on the subsequent development of French 
civilization, and we occasionally feel inclined 
to wonder whether he has done justice to the 
influence of Italian culture. 

The history of this period is a most com- 
plicated one, but the author has succeeded by 
the suppression or careful choice of detail in 
giving a picture at once lucid and calculated 
to make a lasting impression. The brief but 
vivid narrative of great battle scenes and the 
striking character sketches of the actors in 
the drama hold the attention of those who 
seek primarily the panorama of history. The 
reader's curiosity is whetted by the acquaint- 
ance thus offered with princes and statesmen, 
and he follows eagerly the more sober busi- 
ness of history which explains the milieu and 
the superficially less imposing problems with 
which these men had to deal. 

Considerable attention is paid to the devel- 
opment of the fine art and letters. The treat- 
ment of the latter is perhaps the least satis- 
factory part of the work. One feels, for 
instance, that scant justice is done Etienne 
Dolet, "a learned printer of Lyons who was 
a sceptic and an atheist. He printed and 
hawked heretical books, which led to his being 
arrested and tried. . . The Parlement 
sent him to the stake." With that, and a bit 
of Calvin's thunder against him, he is dis- 
missed. Again, there does not seem to be suf- 
ficient recognition of Italian influence in the 
work of the Pleiade. We hear nothing of the 
debt of their manifesto to Italian sources. 
Of the "Defense et Illustration de la Langue 
Francaise," we read: "Du Bellay's ideas . . 
were productive of three results : an imitation 
which grew closer every day, till it amounted 
almost to plagiarism, of the ancients; the 
bestowing of a more and more rigorous clas- 
sical education on the rising generation; and 
a contempt for the so-called barbarous works 
of the Middle Ages." The statement of the 
first result seems unhappy, as the slavish imi- 
tation of the ancients characterizes especially 
the earlier work of the Pleiade; the second 
and third seem overstated, as on these points 
the doctrine of the Pleiade is merely one 
expression of the humanistic revival. 

The work of the translator is, with a few 
minor reservations, highly commendable. One 
point that may lead to confusion is the con- 
stant use of the word "pounds" in pecuniary 
calculations. If the original reads "livres," 
it would perhaps have been better to retain 
that word with a note explaining the approxi-

RECENT FICTION.* 



Some may have turned to Mrs. Alice Duer 
Miller's "Come Out of the Kitchen!" with the 
thought that they were to get something about 
the value of woman in spheres other than the 
domestic. Of course there are not many at 
present who really feel that woman's sphere 
is absolutely the kitchen; still, that term 
might as easily stand for the old-fashioned j 
conception as the oft-quoted (but doubtless 
rarely true) utterance, "My mother could 
have made a better pie." So a book by Mrs. 
Miller with this engaging title might obviously 
have sociological or even political significance. 
Such readers, however, have been disappointed j 
in any such idea, for Mrs. Miller's book is a j 
Romance and not a Novel with a Purpose. ! 
Whatever disappointment there may be on the | 
part of some, there are others who will be glad 
of this. 

I should myself think that the book was not 
a romance, but an extravaganza, of much the 
same kind as a number of others of the present 
day. The writer takes a perfectly possible 
but highly improbable supposition, and then 
gravely follows it through all sorts of permu- 
tations and combinations. I believe "Robinson 
Crusoe" was one of the first books of this sort, 
and there have been many since. It is clearly 
possible that a man should have been ship- 
wrecked on a desert island, because there was 
Alexander Selkirk and his narration. Perhaps 
that was even more possible than that a gentle- 
man should lease a fine old Southern man- 
sion in delightful hunting country, and find 
that four extraordinary servants went with 
the house. Why not have servants go with 
the house, and why not have them extraor- j 
dinary? In such circumstances would there j 
not be plenty of occasion, too, for one to say 
things of value, concerning the position of ser- 
vants, of woman, and of other such matters? 
Mrs. Miller does not wholly waste her oppor- 
tunity : there are some very amusing conver- 
sations between these extraordinary servants

(especially the cookj and their employer, in 
which appears that attractive form of irony 
possible when the author and reader know 
more than the characters. But any attempt 
to give Mrs. Miller's work a sociological or 
political character would fail if based on such 
passages, for they are not many and only show 
a general common sense applied to domestic 
affairs. 

I believe one cannot recommend Mrs. Miller 
to the reader in this case better than as having 
written an amusing book that seems to have 
little but its amusingness to recommend it. 
It is a pleasing interlude among the many 
ferociously serious pieces of fiction of the year, 
whether that seriousness come from profound 
studies in sociology or hectic labors of the 
imagination, whether it be a novel "that 
makes one think" or one that lifts one to 
undreamed-of heights of shimmering, entran- 
cing, vital imagination. It is amusing in its 
kind and better than many others, for it gives 
a chance for tact, ease, imagination, and 
humor, all of which qualities Mrs. Miller has, 
in quantity indeed far greater than her pres- 
ent work requires. It is only on some such 
ground that a sour-faced carper and kill- joy 
might find fault with her book. It was cer- 
tainly a well-imagined opportunity, and Mrs. 
Miller has certainly had the power to make 
more of it ; but she apparently did not want 
to, and the aim and the desire are generally 
important things in fiction. Mrs. Miller, I 
suppose, wanted to take a little vacation from 
the grinding task of proving that women were 
people, and other such obviousnesses ; at any 
rate, she has taken one, and the result of her 
dalliance will give the same opportunity to 
others. 

Mr. Stephen Whitman's "Children of 
Hope" deals with a somewhat similar possi- 
bility in rather more serious fashion. A 
father and his three daughters suddenly get 
a legacy of one hundred thousand dollars, and 
go to Europe to spend it. That is perhaps a 
little more probable than that a man should 
lease a fine old Southern mansion with four 
extraordinary servants, but in my (rather 
limited) view of the world not much more so. 
Whether more probable or not, it is much less 
imaginative and more conventional. But just 
as the one conception (however out of the 
way) offered Mrs. Miller a chance to give the 
amusing little narration which she liked to 
imagine, so does this other conception (how- 
ever conventional) give Mr. Whitman a 
chance to pour out a rich and varied store of 
experience and knowledge of life and love and 
art and human nature, as well as to express 
all manner of opinions (mostly satirical) on

subjects which have interested him. I believe 
the most wonderful Bokharan rugs and the 
most delightful thirteenth-century tapestries 
have very ordinary stuff for woof (or perhaps 
it is the warp I am thinking of) ; the wonder 
and the delight come from the lovely stuffs 
that are so skilfully woven in and out of the 
commonplace framework. So I would not 
make too much of the framework that Mr. 
Whitman sets up, but would give most atten- 
tion to the vari-colored, glittering, emotional 
tapestry that he weaves upon it. Aurelius 
Goodchild has three lovely daughters, whom 
he has named after the three Graces, Aglaia, 
Euphrosyne, and Thalia. It would seem that 
they should have been named after some of 
the Muses instead, although it would have 
been hard to find the right ones ; for the three 
young ladies, besides being possessed of much 
personal beauty and charm, had each of them 
a considerable gift, the one for music, the 
next for writing, the last for painting. They 
are all, however, of the clever, easy-going, 
bohemian type not wholly unknown to pre- 
vious fiction, and live in very desultory fash- 
ion on the outskirts of a town of the central 
west. Here they get their hundred thousand 
dollar legacy, and hence their leisurely start 
for Europe takes place. What are we to 
think? Do the three lovely daughters get 
married? Does Aurelius Goodchild lose his 
hundred thousand dollars? Do they finally 
return to Zenasville, Ohio? Is there a single 
reader above the age of twelve who would 
give or take a bet on the subject? I do not 
know ; I only know that I guessed right from 
the outset. But what does it matter? The 
book depends for its interest on its picture of 
life abroad, chiefly in Florence, on its touch- 
ing upon a hundred things of interest in the 
current art and life of to-day, and also, if 
rather less, on some of its characters and on 
the general impression of life and reality that 
it gives. For however conventional or uncon- 
ventional the general idea may be, the book 
certainly gives the impression of reality, and 
is full of things that ( even with so little know- 
ledge of circumstances and situation as I 
have) one can see are really excellent. 

I do not remember whether Mr. Whitman's 
book has been pronounced "gripping" by com- 
petent authorities; it probably has been. I 
think Miss Juliet Wilbor Tompkins's "The 
Seed of the Righteous," both in theory and in 
practice, really takes a good deal of a hold on 
one, which I take it is the idea that the 
word "gripping" may be supposed to convey. 
From a theoretical standpoint one would say 
that Miss Tompkins had a better idea than 
either Mrs. Miller or Mr. Whitman. I do not 



know whether there really are any families 
left by earnest reformers who have the 
instinctive idea that to raise money for good 
works is a normal way of making a living; 
but whether there be or not, the situation does 
present a sentiment widely existent at the 
present day, a sentiment of mingled fine- 
ness and blindness, mingled altruism and 
selfishness, mingled earnestness and conven- 
tionality. And that is a very good thing to 
base a story on, better, to my mind, than the 
notion of hiring a house with exceptional ser- 
vants or that of inheriting wealth and going 
abroad ; because as one reads on, one continu- 
ally says to oneself: "The thing is so, and one 
cannot get away from it." In fact, one can- 
not get away from it, because it is meeting 
one every day: Burton Crane went off to 
Virginia where his house was, Aurelius and 
his daughters went to Florence, but not a day 
passes that we do not hear from "causes" to 
which we really owe any part of our income 
from one one-hundredth up to ninety -nine. 

So that is a good starter. It has its diffi- 
culties, however, which come from its excel- 
lence. An idea like Mrs. Miller's ought to 
carry itself; it would be ungracious to say 
that one could not spoil it, but certainly as 
soon as one gets well into the book one is 
amused even at the possibilities that come up, 
let alone at Mrs. Miller's treatment of them. 
An idea like Mr. Whitman's certainly would 
not carry itself; but given Mr. Whitman's 
well-stocked armory of ideas on life, Europe, 
art, war, love, it does not seem so very difficult 
to use them in the opportunity which he has 
made for himself. But Miss Tompkins's idea, 
instead of making the matter easier, makes it 
harder. Suppose it be true that the organi- 
zation of altruism as a business leads to ego- 
tism, that people who are most earnest in the 
service of others are strangely likely to feel 
that they have a right to enlist others in the 
service of themselves, suppose all that to 
be true, still it is not easy to imagine just the 
people, just the situations, that will bring out 
strongly, effectively, poignantly the rights and 
wrongs of all concerned. It is here, and espec- 
ially in her people, that Miss Tompkins has 
been most successful: I do not feel that the 
young playwright or the practical cousin are 
much more than lay-figures; but Mrs. Gage 
and her twq daughters are well-conceived, 
and on them rests the chief burden. 

So the chief work of conceiving before 
writing is well done. There have been those 
who when they had thought of a good idea 
and a good name felt that the thing was sub- 
stantially finished ; and perhaps it was. In 
this case there is much more done: the idea,

the situation, the people, are all there. In 
an oft-quoted remark, Tourguenieff said he 
was sure (in such a position) that the people 
would do interesting things. We might well 
leave Miss Tompkins here, but it is but right 
to say that she has carried out her idea (i.e. j 
written the book, which some people think an ! 
important part of the matter) with much ; 
sympathy and much humor. I do not make ! 
very much of the plot, but that is rather a 
minor matter; the rest is quite enough to 
carry the book* 

The first thing to be said of "Captain 
Margaret 1 ' is that it is a story of buccaneer 
adventure by Mr. John Masefield; and so 
much being said, many will think it enough, 
and will go to the book to read for themselves. 
But for others it might be added that here we 
have a tale of how, along about 1710 or so, j 
Captain Margaret sailed for the Spanish Main 
in the "Broken Heart" (with another captain 
who had been with Coxon, and I believe 
Morgan too, in their campaigns in the Spanish 
Main) with the idea that he might do rightly 
what many had done or were doing wrongly. 
The story tells what happened to him. Cap- 
tain Cammack was a true prophet when he 
said : ''He ain't going to do much on the main, 
if he's going to worry all the time about a 
young lady." Yet if he failed, it was only 
as all artists fail, because his conception 
was too fine for realization. So far as the 
absolute exploits themselves are concerned. I 
confess they remind me of an account of the 
exploits of Captain Swan of the "Cygnet," 
of whom it is said: "The history of their 
cruise is a history of bold incompetence. They 
landed, and fought, and again landed; but 
they got very little save a knowledge of geog- 
raphy." And that rather confused impres- 
sion I take to be "very like the real," as it 
has been put. 

That, at any rate, I take to be Mr. 
Masefield 's ideas, or one of them, to give 
us the touch, the feeling, of life. Life as they 
see it at sea, of course, for it all happens on 
the "Broken Heart," and most of the people 
are sailors, except for Stukely and his lovely 
wife. Captain Margaret is really a poet, 
Captain Cammack is by way of being "the 
tarry Buccaneer," Olivia is the lovely lady 
who gives beauty and charm to men's thoughts. 
And there are others, too, and we have their 
life bound together with ties of love and self- 
ishness and indifference and duty, as a novel- 
ist will see it. Being by Mr. Masefield, the 
book is full of feeling for the beauty and the 
brutality of life, and the beauty also of sea 
and land. It is not an ordinary story of 
adventure, or an ordinary story of realism. 



If it were either, I should pick flaws in both. 
But as it is no ordinary story, but instead a 
poet's story, I think the best thing to do is to 
try to look at the thing as he looks at it, and 
if we can get in our minds even a touch of the 
love of the picturesque, the realism of beauty 
in attitude and in act, the tenderness for fool- 
ishness and wrong, the humor, and the delight 
at strong action, and the other such things 
that go to make up Mr. Masefield 's view of the 
world, why, I think we can well enough dis- 
regard the dotting the i's and crossing the t's.

Ballad criticism In publishing Dr. S. B. Hustvedt's 
in the isth monograph on ''Ballad Criticism in 
centum. Scandinavia and Great Britain 

during the Eighteenth Century," the American- 
Scandinavian Foundation has manifested hyphen- 
ated activity of the kind we like to commend. 
Besides tracing the marked interdependence 
of ballad criticism in the several countries during 
the period designated, Dr. Hustvedt provides us 
with an instance of the continued relations in schol- 
arship of the English-speaking and the Scandina- 
vian peoples. The standard editions of Danish 
and British ballads came from the hands of 
Grundtvig and Child, men who cooperated gener- 
ously in their monumental labors. By peculiar 
good fortune, Dr. Hustvedt has received great assis- 
tance from the respective successors of these two 
masters from Professor Olrik of the University 
of Copenhagen and Professor Kittredge of 
Harvard. He presents adequately the mass of 
material that his subject involves. In Great Britain 
the advance during the century was more decided. 
At the outset Addison praised "Chevy Chase," but 
largely through rules and precedents that he found 
in the "^neid"; while the editor of "A Collection 
of Old Ballads," "the first garner of traditional 
verse issued in English," concealed the approba- 
tion he may have felt behind a mask of levity. 
Even Percy, supported by the counsel of Shenstone, 
felt it necessary to improve the old pieces. Kitson 
and Herd were leaders, however, in an increasing 
distinction between ballads and other poetry and 
in a growing reverence for the unchanged text. By 
the end of the century the normal rather than the 
abnormal attitude was revealed in Wordsworth's 
approval of ballad simplicity. In Denmark and 
Sweden, though progress was slower, the way was 
prepared for editions of ballads early in the fol- 
lowing century. Moreover, Denmark had accom- 
plished far more than Great Britain before the 
opening of the period under consideration. Begin- 
ning with Yedel in 1591, Danish scholars had 
brought together important editions of ballads, and 
had obtained considerable insight into the nature of 
the literary type. The Danish movement was 
retarded, however, during the first half of the cen- 
tury by the opposition of Holberg, a man who 
resembled Samuel Johnson in intellectual eminence

and whose conservatism at this point was more 
effective. The influence of Scandinavian scholar- 
ship upon British decreased during the century 
because the vernacular was supplanting Latin. 
After Percy's work, British influence upon the 
Scandinavian countries increased. 



Lake Michigan's Neutral tints and landscapes having 
wind-swept no striking features appeal only to 
the educated eye. To the discerning 
they have charms surpassing the beauties of gor- 
geous sunsets and radiant autumn views. Such a 
lover of nature in her quieter, less obtrusive moods 
is Mr. Earl H. Reed, artist with pen and pencil of 
the sandy stretches running back from the shores 
of Lake Michigan. His latest book, "The Dune 
Country" (Lane) continues the theme of his earlier 
work, "The Voices of the Dunes." Expert with the 
etching needle and the lead pencil, he intersperses 
his narrative and descriptive matter with sixty 
illustrations admirably suggestive of the various 
aspects of nature, animate and inanimate, that 
have caught his eye in his study of the region. In 
addition to the endless struggle between shifting 
sands and a more or less determined vegetation, 
he gives pictures of the bird life, the animal life, 
and the human life that he has encountered. 
Among quaint human types reproduced with pen 
and pencil are Old Sipes, Happy Cal, Catfish 
John, Doc Looney, J. Ledyard Symington, and 
Judge Cassius Blossom. Catfish John sells fish on 
credit to Dan'l Smith, an inventor, and waits for 
his pay until Dan'l gets the money that's coming 
to him from his invention. Meanwhile Dan'l has 
"got fat settin' 'round an' eatin' everything in 
sight." Doc Looney is a "yarb'man," of moth- 
eaten appearance and wearing an old pair of 
smoke-colored spectacles. In the general store of 
a little village somewhere in "the back country" 
our attention is caught by several large boxes of 
plug tobacco conspicuously placarded, "Don't use 
the nasty stuff." Under a wall-lamp is another 
legend, "This flue don't smoke, neither should 
you." Still other inscriptions there are, as, "Credit 
given only on Sundies, when the store is closed," 
and "Don't talk about the war it makes me sick." 
A philosopher and a sage is Elihu Baxter Brown, 
the store-keeper. Excellent in its reading matter 
and its numerous drawings, the book is little short 
of sumptuous in its plan and execution. 



Present-day I n "The Twelve Apostolic Types of 
prototypes of Christian Men" (Re veil) , Mr. 
Edward A. George has written an 
unusual type of religious book which should prove 
helpful to a large class of readers. The twelve 
apostolic types are presented in the persons of the 
twelve Apostles. The author has gathered in con- 
venient form all that we know of the careers of 
these twelve men before and after the brief period 
of their association with Jesus; then, without put- 
ting any undue strain upon the text, he has made 
of them men of the twentieth century. In impetu- 
ous Peter, doubting Thomas, prosaic Philip, mystic 
Nathaniel, Matthew the man of affairs, and the rest, 



we recognize our contemporaries. To take the 
Apostles from their niches in history and art, and 
to translate them into flesh and blood, was in itself 
a worthy task; but Mr. George's wide experience 
as a minister and a broad-minded citizen has 
enabled him to make some very suggestive comment 
upon the types of men with whom Jesus sur- 
rounded Himself and to whom he committed His 
cause. His disciples were only average men, and 
his cause is still in the hands of only average men. 
Association with a man like Jesus was able to 
transform such humble and unheroic folk as 
Galilean fishermen and Jewish tax-gatherers into 
saints and martyrs. This transformation of char- 
acter, still operative to-day, is the real miracle of 
Christianity, and in this miracle we may all take 
a part. There are many such paragraphs as the 
following, which contain more help than many a 
sermon, and enough matter to start the train of 
profitable reflection: 

What a mighty power of Christian cooperation 
trade associations suggest: If Christian business men 
should unite in Christian work as they unite in finan- 
cial enterprises, if they should cooperate as Christians 
as they cooperate as partners, directors and stock- 
holders, the Church would receive fresh efficiency. 
Walking by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus called to His 
service the brothers fishing in one boat, and then a 
little further the brothers working in another. Can 
we conceive of Simon and Andrew in the one boat 
ignorant of or uninterested in the Christianity of 
James and John in the next? But is this not often 
the case with us: men in one store knowing nothing 
of the faith of men in the next, knowing nothing often 
of the faith of associates at the same desk and 
behind the same counter? Why should not the 
apostles of to-day unite in groups of three and four 
and twelve and one hundred and twenty-five thousand, 
as business proximity and syndicates bring them 
together? Why should not Christianity be forwarded 
in these days by present trios of Peter, Janes and 
John, partners in business? 



Humor, the With much truth Mr. Stephen 
Devil, and some Leacock suggests, in his new volume 

other matters. j> uin 3 T '. CIL J B TJ 

or Essays and Literary Studies 
(Lane), that for everyday, homely purposes of 
life the theory of the ludicrous still remains unde- 
fined even after Schopenhauer has declared such 
concepts amusing in which there is a subsumption 
of a double paradox, or after Kant has explained 
that he found everything exciting laughter in which 
there is a resolution or deliverance of the absolute 
captive by the finite. And so, in the introductory 
paragraphs of an essay on American humor, 
Mr. Leacock endeavors to find a simple definition 
"for simple people." Tracing the development of 
humor as arising out of the want of harmony 
among things, he determines upon three stages : the 
humor of discomfiture and destructiveness, that of 
the incongruous, and (the final and highest type) 
"a prolonged and sustained conception of the 
incongruities of human life itself." Tested by his 
own analysis, the humor that pervades Mr. 
Leacock's volume as a whole belongs not infre- 
quently to this last stage. In formulating for the 
college professor a new apologia pro vita sua, there 
is real pathos in the truths that "modern scholar-

ship has poked and pried in so many directions, 
has set itself to be so ultra-rational, so hyper-scep- 
tical, that now it knows nothing at all," and that 
our studies "consist only in the long-drawn proof 
of the futility for the search after knowledge 
effected by exposing the errors of the past." And 
is there not something almost Shavian in the 
thought that it is the Devil (or the fear of him, to 
be more exact) that for centuries has kept the 
world straight? "There he stood for ages a simple 
and workable basis of human morality; an admir- 
able first-hand reason for being good, which 
needed no ulterior explanation. . . Humanity, 
with the Devil to prod it from behind, moved 
steadily upwards on the path of moral develop- 
ment." More might have been made of the "new" 
movement of to-day which has supplanted him. Its 
supporters, in their preoccupation with being 
wicked, so wicked, fail to realize that an uncon- 
scionable interest in morals, bad as well as good, 
is merely a yielding to the same old-fashioned 
puritanical instinct which they do all they can to 
decry. 



Th story 
of a second 
Tuskegee. 



In barely a dozen years a Tuskegee 
graduate regarded by Booker 
Washington as his foremost gradu- 
ate, has built up at Utica, Mississippi, a school 
patterned after that at Tuskegee, and the only one 
of such schools for colored youth that can be com- 
pared with it. From an old log cabin in which the 
school started in 1904, it has grown, under its 
founder's unremitting efforts, to an institution 
having thirty-five instructors, more than five hun- 
dred pupils, fourteen buildings, and seventeen hun- 
dred acres of land, the entire property being now 
valued at $160,000 and every year increasing in 
extent and value. This is the work of Mr. William 
H. Holtzclaw, whose account of the undertaking, 
and also of his own life, is to be found in "The 
Black Man's Burden" (Neale), a book comparable 
in character and interest with the autobiographies 
of Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington. 
Incidentally, too, it gives a near view of the 
founder of Tuskegee in the daily routine of his 
administrative task, and conveys some adequate 
idea of the great work done and still remaining to 
be done by leaders and educators like Booker 
Washington and the author of the book himself. 
In literary quality the narrative is a credit to its 
writer, who on entering Tuskegee could not tell in 
what country he lived, much less the parts of 
speech, though he hazarded a guess that these were 
the lips, teeth, tongue, and throat. The volume is 
well illustrated and has an introduction by Mr. 
Washington. 



Essays on 
artists and 
thinkers. 



"Is the Artist a Thinker, and the 
Thinker an Artist?" This is the old 
but ever fascinating problem 
brought before us by Professor Louis W. Flaccus 
of the University of Pennsylvania, in the vivid 
and thoughtful pages of his book, "Artists and 
Thinkers" (Longmans). The artist as an uncon- 
scious philosopher, be the medium of his thought 
sculpture or drama or music, the philosopher as 
a real creative artist, building like the artist his 



vision of the world, what conception could be 
more fruitful for a criticism fallen so often into 
personalities or mere flamboyant impressionism? 
So these essays on Rodin, Maeterlinck, and Wagner 
are real intellectual portraits, type-figures relieved 
against a background rich in allusion, rich in vistas 
of the whole complex panorama of modern art and 
thought. No less vividly typical are the philoso- 
phers chosen, Tolstoy, Hegel, Nietzsche, whose 
creative self -expressive thought is woven into our 
very life. And best of all, a fine discrimination is 
sensed in the construction of these essays, distinct- 
ive in thought and pithy in style. One may object 
that Professor Flaccus has not impaled his butter- 
fly, settled the tantalizing question of the bond 
between Artist and Thinker. But after all, such 
dreadfully definite results are only possible or 
desirable in the realm of science. Modern art, 
divine philosophy herself in her new robe of 
Humanism, are at one in rejecting such absolutism. 
Their truth is not finality but the infinite problem, 
not the dead butterfly, but the living fluttering 
Psyche. Ours too, if like Professor Flaccus we 
have in us any of the vitality of modern artists and 
thinkers. 



The Bolivians 
painted in 
gloomy colors. 



An interesting and suggestive con- 
tribution to the study of the popu- 
lation of the highlands of Bolivia is 
embodied in Dr. Alexander A. Adams's "The 
Plateau Peoples of South America: An Essay in 
Ethnic Psychology" (Dutton). The sub-title of 
the book is, however, a misnomer. Rather should 
it be called "an essay in racial pathology." After 
a survey of the climatic, social, and political con- 
ditions existing in this region, Dr. Adains advances 
the somewhat startling thesis that the present in- 
habitants of the Bolivian plateau are not only 
incapable of further progress but show marked 
tendencies toward degeneration. The influence of 
geographic environment, the deadening and stupe- 
fying effects of the high altitude, the small pro- 
ductivity of the soil, combined with isolation from 
the outside world, have brought about a condition 
of arrested development, at least as regards the 
Indian population. Such seemingly progressive 
factors of Bolivia as her railways, electric trams 
in the cities, schools, hospitals, etc., are at best 
merely incidental rather than fundamental features 
in the country's progress. The bulk of the popu- 
lation is quite unaffected by these foreign importa- 
tions, the trappings of a civilization in which they 
have neither part nor lot. Symptoms of degenera- 
tion, according to the author, are also present; the 
most striking of these are intellectual deficiency, 
imperfect nutrition, abuse of toxic agents, particu- 
larly the cocoa leaf, and sexual irregularities. 
Conditions, instead of improving, are growing 
steadily worse. The picture which he draws of the 
future of Bolivia is gloomy in the extreme. Dr. 
Adams's contentions, though skilfully advanced 
and buttressed with considerable evidence, are only 
partially convincing. Conditions are really not as 
parlous in Bolivia as he would have us believe. 
The steady economic progress of the country, com- 
bined with increasing educational facilities and 
protective legislation for the Indians, must inev-

itably tend to raise the status of the population, 
and in the long run react favorably on the racial 
stamina of the Bolivians. Yet Dr. Adams's book 
has a distinct value, if only as an antidote to those 
hastily written and roseate impressions of South 
America with which we are all too familiar. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



An attractive and practical new school edition 
of "The Hudson Shakespeare" (Ginn) is in course 
of publication, nine volumes being now at hand. 
The notes and introductions retain all the valuable 
features of Dr. Hudson's work, and have been 
revised, where necessary, and brought in accord 
with the latest results of Shakespearean scholar- 
ship. The earlier edition has been tested by so 
many years of service that a warm welcome for 
the new series is a foregone conclusion. 

To "Longmans' Pocket Library," which now 
contains so much of William Morris's work in 
well-printed and inexpensive form, has recently 
been added "The Pilgrims of Hope," the narrative 
poem with Socialistic background which Morris 
contributed to "The Commonweal" in 1885-6. Al- 
though this poem has long been available in Mr. 
Mosher's handsome edition, the present reprint 
should find a wide circle of readers who could not 
afford the Mosher volume. It has also the advan- 
tage of including Morris's stirring "Chants for 
Socialists." 

The latest of the always welcome special num- 
bers put forth by "The International Studio" 
(Lane) is devoted to "London: Old and New." 
Its main purpose is "to picture various aspects 
of our contemporary London . . through the 
diverse visions of a number of artists who happen 
to have found in London subjects a pictorial 
appeal which happily enlists also the topogra- 
pher's interest, and to contrast these essentially 
modern impressions with the views and picturings 
of the earlier London." This purpose is carried 
out by means of nearly one hundred and fifty 
plates (including eight in color), reproduced and 
printed in irreproachable style. A few brief chap- 
ters of text by Mr. Malcolm C. Salaman supply 
a pleasant background of fact and comment. 

Recent additions to the series of "Oxford Gar- 
lands," so skilfully edited by Mr. R. M. Leonard, 
comprise the following: "Modern Lays and Bal- 
lads," "Elegies and Epitaphs," "Poems on Ani- 
mals," "Songs for Music," and "Epigrams." 
Particularly welcome is the last-named volume, 
which gives us a gleaning from the entire field of 
epigrammatic verse in English, ranging from the 
honied amatory to the venomous political. One 
would like to fill a page or two with quotations 
from this delectable little anthology; but we will 
content ourselves (apropos of M. Jusserand's new 
volume) with this specimen of Canon Ainger's 
neat wit: 

A Frenchman, straying into English fields 

Of letters, seldom has a locus standi. 
But if there's one to whom objection yields, 
'Tis Jusserand he has the jus errandi. 



"Memoirs of a Physician," by Vikenty Ver- 
resayev, is announced for publication this month 
by Mr. Alfred Knopf. 

A new volume of verse by Mr. J. C. Squire, 
entitled "The Survival of the Fittest, and Other 
Poems," is nearly ready for publication. 

Among the forthcoming publications of the 
University of Chicago Press will be a volume of 
"Essays in Experimental Logic," by Professor 
John Dewey. 

"The Hermit Doctor of Gaya" is the title of a 
new love story of modern India, by Miss I. A. R. 
Wylie, which Messrs. Putnam announce for publi- 
cation this month. 

Mr. George Moore's forthcoming novel, "The 
Brook Kerith," which was announced in these 
columns several months ago, will soon be issued 
in this country by the Macmillan Co. 

Mr. Boyd Cable, whose "Between the Lines" 
has already gone through many editions, has a 
companion volume nearly ready continuing his 
vivid impressions of the war under the title of 
"Action Front." 

Miss Betham-Edwards, whose first novel ap- 
peared fifty-eight years ago, will soon issue a new 
romance entitled "Hearts of Alsace," a tale 
founded on the tragedy of French life under 
Prussian rule. 

It is sixteen years since a new novel appeared 
from the pen of Sir Frederick Wedmore. Early 
next month he will have a new novel ready enti- 
tled "Brenda Walks On" a story of the English 
stage of to-day. 

Two midsummer volumes to be issued by Hough- 
ton Mifflin Co. are "Tish," a collection of short 
stories by Mrs. Mary Roberts Rinehart, and "The 
Unspeakable Perk," a novel by Mr. Samuel 
Hopkins Adams. 

Early next month the Oxford University Press 
will publish "Sir Walter Raleigh: Selections from 
his 'History of the World,' Letters, and Other 
Writings," edited, with notes and an introduction, 
by Mr. G. E. Hadow. 

Mr. William W. Ellsworth, who recently resigned 
from the presidency of The Century Co. after 
thirty-seven years of service, will next autumn 
make a lecturing tour of the country, his subject 
being "Publishing and Literature." 

The second volume of Mr. W. B. Bryan's 
comprehensive "History of the National Capital" 
will be published at once by the Macmillan Co. 
This new volume gives a detailed account of 
Washington during the years 1815-1878. 

Mr. Horace A. Vachell's new story, "The Tri- 
umph of Tim" the longest novel he has yet pro- 
duced will be published this month. The scenes 
are laid in England, California, and Brittany, and 
many of the incidents which he depicts are auto- 
biographical. 

"Ian Hay" (Captain Beith) has written a sequel 
to his "First Hundred Thousand," which has 
proved one of the most popular of recent war

books. "Carry On" is the title of the forthcoming 
volume, to be published by Houghton Mifflin Co. 

Miss Alice Brown's new novel, scheduled for 
publication next month by the Macmillan Co., is 
entitled "The Prisoner," and deals with the career 
of a brilliant young man after his release from 
prison where he has been sent because of a false 
step. 

Among other publications announced for early 
issue by Messrs. Appleton are: "Americanism 
What It Is," by Dr. David Jayne Hill; "The Tide 
of Immigration," by Dr. Frank Julian Warne; 
and " Vocational Psychology," by Dr. Harry Levi 
Hollingworth. 

"Love, Worship, and Death,"* some renderings 
from the Greek anthology by Sir Rennell Rodd, 
will shortly appear. It is described as "the sole 
and grateful distraction of the British Ambassa- 
dor at Rome during the period of ceaseless work 
and intense anxiety in the tragic years of 1914 
and 1915." 

The new edition of "The Breadwinners" (a book 
published more than thirty years ago), which 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers will shortly bring out, 
will for the first time bear on the title page the 
name of the author, John Hay. Mr. Hay's son 
contributes a preface telling how bis father came 
to write the story. 

Subscribers to Dr. Elroy M. Avery's "History 
of the United States" will be glad to know that 
a detailed Index to the seven volumes of the His- 
tory now ready has just been published by Mr. 
William Abbatt, of Tarrytown, New York. The 
Index is uniform in size and appearance with the 
volumes of the History. 

Professor Chester Lloyd Jones has prepared a 
study of "Caribbean Interests of the United 
States," which will be published by Messrs. Apple- 
ton. The author treats of the varied phases of 
recent Caribbean development, social, political, 
and economic, especially as they bear upon the 
United States and its future policy. 

Among other forthcoming publications of Messrs. 
Longmans are: "A Physician in France," by Sir 
Wilmot Herringham; "Serbia in Shadow and 
Light," by the Rev. Nicolai Yelimerovic, D.D. ; 
"Promotion of Learning in India," by Narendra- 
nath Law, M. A.; and "Black and White in South-

The first number of "The American Proof- 
reader," devoted (as the prospectus states) "to the 
interests of the correcting profession," will be 
issued June 1 by Mr. Jacob Backes. 121 Bible 
House, New York. It is said that this will be the 
first periodical of its kind ever published, and we 
believe it should find a wide field of usefulness. 

The following volumes will be published at an 
early date by Messrs. Crowell : " The Life of Hein- 
rich Conreid," by Mr. Montrose J. Moses; "Mas- 
tering the Books of the Bible," by Professor 
Robert A. Armstrong; "Reflections of a Cornfield

"Personality in German Literature" is the title 
of a new book by Professor Kuno Francke an- 



nounced for publication in June by the Harvard 
University Press. From the same press will come 
"Genetics and Eugenics," by Professor William E. 
Castle, and Professor George Lyman Kittredge's 
address on Shakespeare delivered on the three 
hundredth anniversary of the poet's death. 

"Shakespeare's England: Being an Account of 
the Life and Manners of his Age," which the Ox- 
ford University Press hopes to have ready in two 
volumes early next month, will include an "Ode 
on the Tercentenary Commemoration," by Robert 
Bridges; a preface by Sir Walter Raleigh, who 
also contributes a chapter on "The Age of Eliza- 
beth"; and forty odd sections by various authori- 
ties on practically every aspect of the world in 
which Shakespeare lived. Sir John Sandys con- 
tributes two chapters, one on "Education: Schools 
and School Books, Universities, etc.," and the

Our Chief Magistrate and

By WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT 

Twenty-seventh President of the United States 

limo, cloth, pp. vii + 165. Price, %i.y> net 

A notably comprehensive statement of the duties and 
responsibilities of the Chief Executive of the nation 
from the intimate point of view of a President of the 
United States. 

The whole is not only a distinct contribution to 
our actual knowledge of the workings of the govern- 
mental machinery of the Republic and a scholarly an- 
alysis of the functional powers of the President clearly 
and plainly stated, but it is from first to last written 
with the geniality characteristic of its author which 
makes it to a notable extent a personal document 
replete with human interest.

which interested discriminating readers all over the coun- 
try. Now he has appeared in a role other than satirist or 
poet (both of which he has graced heretofore) and in a 
small volume entitled "The Martyr's Return' he has dis- 
cussed with keen insight and criticism some of the para- 
mount issues of today." OAKLAND (Cal.) TRIBUNE 
'The work has come out at an opportune time to help 
guide national thought into serious channels. It is worth; 
an hour or two of any loyal American's time.' 1

mation for Literary Workers. THE EDITOR is 
now in its 22nd consecutive year of publication. 
T7ROM the days when Jack London, Mary Rob- 
erts Rinehart, Peter Clark Macfarlane, Albert 
Bigelow Paine, etc., were unknown aspirants, writ- 
ers have made THE EDITOR a great exchange 
through which they have transferred to one an- 
other the results of their valuable experiences. 
X/fARY Roberts Rinehart has said: "THE 
EDITOR helped to start me, cheered me 
when I was down, and led me in the straight path 
until I was able to walk alone." 
JACK London has said: "The first number of 
J THE EDITOR I read aroused in me a great 
regret for all my blind waste of energy. I may 
not tell a hundredth part of what I learned from 
THE EDITOR, but I may say that it taught me 
how to solve the stamp and landlady problems." 

T N addition to practical, inspiriting articles on artistic and 
JL business phases of the art-trade of writing, THE 
EDITOR prints each fortnight news of markets for all kinds 
of literary material. 

T TP-TO-DATE news of photoplay markets and of oppor- 
U tunities to sell post-card, second serial and other rights 
of already published manuscripts is a feature. 

THE regular departments are "The Literary Market,"

DELIGHTFUL READING 

THE OUTLOOK: "Mrs. Pennell 
always writes agreeably, and never 
more so than when, as here, she 
tells about the art and literary 
circles abroad. . . Whistler, Stev- 
enson, Burne-Jones, Edward Fitz- 
gerald, Barrie, Lang, Kipling, Rodin 
these are only a few of the many 
notabilities of whom cheerful and 
friendly chat and anecdote are re- 
counted. Altogether the book makes 
delightful reading." 

AN INTERESTING COMPANY 

NEW YORK TRIBUNE: "Abounds 
in reminiscences, half portraits and 
anecdotes of and allusions to the 
artists and authors whom she and 
her husband have met in the course 
of thirty years. . . It is an inter- 
esting company the reader meets in 
these pages." 

NIGHTS 

FAMILIAR NAMES AND FACES 

BOSTON TRANSCRD7T: "Rich and 
very full in its human acquaintance 
has been Mrs. Pennell's life. More 
than once we have listened with 
unaffected delight to her recital of 
certain phases of its contact with 
men and women. Her memoirs of 
her uncle, Charles Godfrey Leland; 
her biography of Whistler written 
in collaboration with her husband, 
and especially her intimate account 
of her experiences in 'Our House,' 
the apartment at 14 Buckingham 
Street, London, where she dwelt and 
received her many friends of the 
artistic and social world, have all 
revealed the wonderful hours that 
come to those who write, or paint, 
or draw, or do any one of the other 
numerous professional things that 
result in a fame accomplished. . . 
Into her pages come many familiar 
names and faces. . . Mrs. Pennell 
finds this life of which she was a 
part very vital. It is the stuff out 
of which will be woven the history 
of literary and artistic movements 
during the last years of the nine- 
teenth century."

ENGLAND'S EFFORT 

LETTERS TO AN AMERICAN FRIEND 

By MRS. HUMPHRY WARD 

"Has England done all she could?'. That is the question, often asked in America, 
that Mrs. Ward has undertaken to answer in this inspiring book. It is impossible 
to conceive a more graphic picture than that which she has given us of the intense 
activity of the English people at home in their part of the war: The vast munitions 
and equipment industries into which women are pouring by tens of thousands to 
take the place of men; the men working literally "till they drop"; the transformed 
England that has come with a realization of her needs. 

THE HON. JOSEPH H. CHOATE in his Preface to the book 
says: "All America is vastly indebted to Mrs. Ward for her 
triumphant success in proving that England has done her best and 
for making this great story so clear." $1.00 net

STRAIGHT AMERICA AMERICANIZATION 



By FRANCES A. KELLOR 

The United States is a huge melting-pot 
wherein are mixed the conflicting traditions 
and ideals of every race and people in the

and train the immigrant to make him indis- 
tinguishably American an integral and 
necessary element in an enlightened and 
united nationalism. Ready in June.

Psychologically speaking, the New Criti- 
cism, the New Poetry, the New Art, of which 
we are hearing so much, is easily understood. 
It reminds us of a child who, after much listen- 
ing to the talk of its elders, pulls its mother 's 
skirt and says: "But Mamma, I am here 
too ! ' ' And the public, which is always tired 
of hearing Aristides called the just, or Shake- 
speare the great, is more or less ready to 
respond to any irreverence. "The aspiring 
youth who fired the Ephesian dome" no doubt 
found a good deal of sympathy in his day. 
People probably wrote to their newspapers 
saying that they were dead tired of the old 
marble shack, and that Diana had no right to 
a "dome" anyhow, because she was merely the 
Goddess of chaste propriety and as such was 
entirely out of date in Ephesus. 

This last charge is the gravamen, the 
attack of the modernists on the writers of the 
preceding epoch. They assert that the Vic- 
torian age was given over to the domination 
of Mrs. Grundy, that its literary creations 
could utter nothing but "prunes, prisms, and 
persimmons." Now there undoubtedly was a 
general sobering down from the intoxications 
and riots of the Georgian period. The liter- 
ature which preceded and accompanied the 
French Revolution was possibly the most 
world-upsetting that has ever been known. 
Even in politics and social reform, our radi- 
cals have hardly caught up with Rousseau, 
Malthus, Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft 
Godwin. And Goethe, Schiller, Burns, Byron, 
Shelley, and Leopardi could give aces and 
spades to any modernist and beat him in the 
revelation of the nudities of human nature. 
Byron was in act and thought and literary 
production the superman whom Nietzsche 
has only philosophized about. But neverthe- 
less we think it quite untrue that the Vic- 
torian Age was the dull, drab, Quaker domain 
of propriety which critics have accused it of 
being. Great literature cannot exist without 
the exhibition of the good and evil inherent 
in humanity; and as the Victorian Age un- 
doubtedly produced great literature, it must

[June 8 



have dealt with such forces, chief among 
which are the problems of sex. 

No modern poet has realized more fully than 
Tennyson the Miltonic law that poetry should 
be simple, sensuous, and passionate. In 
meaning, music, and picture, he is prevail- 
ingly sensuous ; and he never hesitates to deal 
with any subject that would yield him the 
agitations, clashes, and climaxes of great art. 
His largest poem, "The Idylls of the King," is 
a tale of adultery, and its central theme is 
repeated in some of the minor episodes, 
"Merlin and Vivien" is a study of sexual 
temptation. A great part of Tennyson's early 
work betrays an extreme susceptibility to fem- 
inine beauty and charm, and a most frank 
portrayal of these things. Very few poets 
have celebrated so many women, painted from 
so many different models. "The Sisters" is a 
tragic story of betrayal and revenge. 
"Locksley Hall" and "Maud" were called 
Byronic in their day, though in each case 
the passion developed is a thwarted one. It 
must not be forgotten, too, that he stated the 
whole problem of the intellectual equality of 
the sexes in "The Princess." The modern 
education of woman owes a good deal to his 
initiative. Tennyson always leans to virtue's 
side, but prudery is the last defect of which 
he can be accused. 

Of prudery there is of course none in 
Browning. He is the poet who sympathizes 
with women, and the one whom women conse- 
quently take to their hearts. He protects the 
erring woman with his shield, as other poets 
protect the erring man. "The Ring and the 
Book" is one long plea for a tempted woman. 
"The Statue and the Bust" is about as abso- 
lute a statement of the right of passion to 
have its way as has been put forth by any 
present-day author. And "A Blot in the 
'Scutcheon" is a pathetic and sympathetic 
study of a wronged girl. 

So far as we are aware, no recent writer 
has gone any further in the revelation of sex- 
uality than Rossetti in "The House of Life." 
Some of the sonnets of this poem drew forth 
Robert Buchanan's puritanical outburst on 
"The Fleshly School of Poetry." The flesh 
does get about all that is due to it in the 
poem; although, on the whole, it is, if any- 
thing, too subtly spiritual. The sex interest 
is also supreme in several of Rossetti 's ballads. 

The young Swinburne was a Victorian, and 
we do not know of any modernist who would 



not be, in the language of the street, "a 
piker" in sex revolt compared with the author 
of "Laus Veneris," the creator of "Dolores," 
"Fragoletta," and other daughters of joy who 
put aside "the lilies and languors of virtue" 
for "the roses and rapture of vice." 
Swinburne also gave up a great part of his 
life to rehabilitating, or rather justifying, 
Mary Queen of Scots. His plays on this sub- 
ject may pass with "The Ring and the Book" 
as the most extended study of a frail womari 
in poetry. 

Turning to the novel, we come to Becky 
Sharp, who towers over the bad women of 
that literary form almost as Lady Macbeth 
and Clytemnestra do over the evil dames of the 
drama. It is true that Taine depreciates 
Becky in comparison with Valerie Marneffe, 
and that a good many modern critics would 
give the palm to Emma Bovary. They are all 
three as full of original evil as possible; but 
for our part, we think that Becky has more 
variety of wickedness in her than the other 
two. At any rate, they are all anterior to the 
art of the modernist, and we fail to see where 
the latter has improved upon them. It was 
Thackeray who uttered the plaint about the 
restrictions which Victorian prudery placed 
on the novelist; but in Blanche Amory he 
managed to suggest a good deal of depravity, 
just as in Pendennis's Fanny he developed a 
good deal of honest though irregular passion. 
Beatrix in "Esmond" is a splendid minx. 

Dickens was hardly a sex novelist. His 
outlook on life was too prevailingly comic to 
take women as seriously as they want to be 
taken, as indeed they must be taken to pro- 
duce the greatest effects. But has any Rus- 
sian novelist of them all painted a more tragic 
and tremendous character of low life than 
Nancy in "Oliver Twist" ? And Little Em'ly 
is not all sentimental; certain scenes in her 
career are unflinching in their realism and 
their force. Lady Dedlock and Edith Dombey 
are more shadowy; but they show, at least, 
that Dickens was not afraid to violate the 
conventions. 

Passion has never thrilled through any 
novel as it does through those of Emily and 
Charlotte Bronte. It is true that there is no 
actual infraction of virtue in their stories. 
But what earthly difference does that make 
when, in nearly every case, the passion is a 
prohibited one, and sex attraction is expressed 
with the utmost poignancy and abandon ? In

"Wuthering Heights" especially, the lovers' 
spiritual possession of each other makes all 
matters of the flesh seem shallow and imper- 
tinent. 

George Eliot was perhaps more responsible 
than any one else for the impression that the 
atmosphere of Victorian literature was the 
atmosphere of a Sunday school; that its 
novel was the antithesis of the French novel 
or the earlier English one of Fielding and 
Smollett. She really was a Sunday-school 
teacher of genius, and she got on the nerves 
of William Ernest Henley and other critics, 
who have for a time written her down in spite 
of her immense merits. Yet, though she 
preached over vice, she needed vice to spice 
her novels. Hetty falls, and Maggie Tulliver 
is tempted. To a good many minds, the tri- 
umph of virtue and the condemnation of sin 
excuse a good deal of dallying with sin by 
the way. A dozen years or so ago, there was 
a play, founded on "Quo Vadis," which was 
immensely popular in this country. Clergy- 
men recommended it to their flocks as a great 
moral spectacle. "We remember taking a 
young woman to see it, and, hardened theatre- 
goer as we were, we sat on pins and needles 
through some of the scenes. We should cer- 
tainly never have felt, in any company, such 
a shock to modesty in witnessing "The School 
for Scandal," for instance. However, George 
Eliot's humor and pathos and wisdom are 
most genuine, and they will finally weigh 
down her over-much preaching and vivisec- 
tion of characters. 

Until recently, in America, sex problems 
have hardly entered into our literature. The 
one great exception is "The Scarlet Letter," 
in which Hawthorne proved himself a mighty 
tragedian. Puritan as he was, he had an 
abiding interest in strongly sensuous scenes 
and characters, as witness Zenobia in "The 
Blithedale Romance." Poe, his rival and 
opposite, though a Cavalier by temperament 
and a Greek by instinct, was an absolute 
Puritan in his literary creations. At least 
he managed to give the effect of chastity or 
virginal unconsciousness to figures which are 
projected with the utmost vividness of sen- 
suous painting. Herman Melville's "Typee" 
is a sunny, irresponsible picture of sex attrac- 
tion. Most of our older poets and prose 
writers, moralists or humorists, whichever 
they were, have taken the sex question as 
read, and ordered it laid upon the table. 



But the Victorian age in England, we 
think, concerned itself with women, or with 
the relation between the sexes, more than does 
any other literature, except perhaps the 
Shakespearean drama. The previous litera- 
ture of the world dealt overwhelmingly with 
men. Woman was an adjunct, of course, but 
she was not encouraged to develop any indi- 
viduality of her own. She was to be either 
an Egeria or a handmaid. The Victorian 
literature changed all that. It retired men 
into the background, and devoted itself very 
largely to feminine characterizations. Nearly 
every one of its chief poets or novelists, 
Tennyson, Browning, Swinburne, Thackeray, 
Meredith, Charles Reade, was a Perseus 
breaking the bonds of Andromeda. If the 
modernists have done very much more salvage 
of this kind, we are perhaps too "near blind" 
to see it. 

There is a certain type of mind which is 
always rediscovering the elemental facts of 
human nature. We have no wish to discour- 
age any Columbus of this kind. But we would 
suggest that the differences between the liter- 
atures of various epochs is more a difference 
of form than of matter. When poetry is 
dominant, an ideal factor enters into litera- 
ture, harshnesses are smoothed down, discords 
are harmonized, and power is subjugated by 
Beauty. When prose rages unchecked, the 
reportorial instinct is at work, huge chunks 
of life are flung in our faces, and Beauty is 
dragged about the stage by the hair of her 
head. We have had many able reporters of 
life in recent times; but, for our part, we 
still continue to prefer the poets.

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN FRANCE. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

I see it stated in some French publications, 
and the statement has been repeated in at 
least one American newspaper, that the 
United States has formally adhered to the 
Berne Convention concerning authors' rights. 
But the first condition of this pact is that each 
state shall place on precisely the same basis, 
as far as its international copyright relations 
are concerned, the status of the books of all 
other states. In this connection, perhaps the 
best authority on the subject of copyright in 
the United States, Mr. George Haven Putnam, 
says to me : 



526 



THE DIAL 



[June 8 



No present action is practicable, and, so far as I 
know, no action is now in train, in regard to the 
relations of the United States with the Convention 
of Berne. As you know, but as these French writers 
on the subject do not seem to know, under the influ- 
ence of our protective system and of the labor unions, 
the copyright law of the United States contains a 
manufacturing provision which declares that no work 
may secure copyright in our country that has not 
been entirely manufactured within American terri- 
tory. This provision makes it impracticable for the 
United States to accept membership in the Berne 
Convention. The statute which went into force in 
July, 1909, not only confirms but extends the manu- 
facturing requirements of the statute of 1891, which 
was the first that accorded copyright to foreigners. 
As long as our nation maintains a protective policy, 
and as long as our national legislation is largely under 
the influence of the labor unions, we have no prospect 
of securing an abolition of the manufacturing condi- 
tion for copyright. It is of course in no way germane 
to copyright law, but we should have had no interna- 
tional copyright if we had not been willing to accept 
this manufacturing condition. 

Mention of Major Putnam reminds me that 
his house has recently taken over the Ameri- 
can end of the "Loeb Classical Library," and 
suggests my repeating here two foreign judg- 
ments, though they be rather severe, on our 
Latin and Greek scholarship. Here is what 
one of the most thorough British classical 
scholars wrote me last winter : 

American scholars seem to me behind English 
scholars in literary interest in the classics. They 
have, in my judgment but I am much prejudiced 
in the other direction far too much devoted them- 
selves to grammatical, technical, and archaeological 
study; in fact have taken the German rather than 
the French or English line. To my mind this is a 
defect, and I think the "Loeb Classical Library" 
ought to do much to remedy it. But unhappily, the 
Library seems to be imperfectly appreciated as yet 
in America. 

And here is what an equally competent 
French scholar has said to me on this same 
point : 

I consider the English work in the "Loeb Library" 
superior to that of the American scholars. But Dr. 
Page and Dr. Eouse, the editors-in-chief of the enter- 
prise, take so much trouble with the revision that 
faulty manuscripts must appear correctly under their 
guidance. 

A discussion has lately been going on in 
French literary circles about the effect of the 
war on periodicals in Europe. I have a few 
facts which I can contribute to the question. 
In Belgium, for instance, the conflict has 
caused the entire suppression of the reviews, 
which were always rather weak, being largely 
overshadowed by those of France. But beyond 
the borders of this unfortunate country some 
new Belgian periodicals have been founded. 
Thus, at Paris (Rue des Colonnes) is issued 
the weekly, "La Patrie Beige"; at Havre, 
where the Belgian government sits, appears 
"Le XX e Siecle"; while the well-known 
Brussels daily, "L'Independance Beige," is 



now being published at Tudor House, London. 
Then there is "La Belgique Independante," a 
sort of semi-monthly brought out at Geneva 
(18 rue du Chene), whose editor, M. Jean 
Bary, formerly at the head of the Ghent daily, 
"La Flandre Liberale," seems to consider it 
his chief aim at this crisis to throw mud at 
the Belgian public men without distinction 
of party. But perhaps the most interesting 
of these Belgian periodicals struggling for 
an existence on foreign soil is "La Wallonie," 
whose office is at 14 rue St. Georges, Paris, 
and whose editor is M. Raymond Colleye. The 
purpose of this semi-monthly is to support, as 
its name would indicate, the French side in 
Belgium, without, however, attacking in any 
form the Flemish interests of the country. By 
the way, this word "Wallonie," invented in 
1884 by M. Celestin Demblon, of the Belgian 
Parliament, became immediately popular, and 
now seems to have entered into the language 
of Belgium. It is meant to designate the four 
and a half Walloon provinces in contradis- 
tinction to the four and a half Flemish 
provinces of this same bilingual nation. 

For what I intended to say about the Scan- 
dinavian reviews, I substitute this extract 
from a communication which I have just 
received from Georg Brandes, written from 
Copenhagen : 

None of our Scandinavian periodicals have had to 
suspend publication on account of the war. I have 
not read them all but I know their views. In a 
general way all try to remain neutral and are not 
disposed to publish articles which clearly or violently 
attack either side. For imports, we depend upon 
England; for exports, we depend upon Germany. Our 
sympathies are manifested, but not too directly, in 
the newspapers rather than in the reviews. On 
account of the war of 1864, which robbed Denmark 
of territory, the feeling here in Copenhagen is anti- 
German, and it is especially so because of the brutal 
way in which the Prussian government treats con- 
quered Sleswick. The Norwegians are for England 
and France. In Sweden only the socialists are truly 
neutral, or are friendly to England or France. The 
majority of the nation has very good grounds for 
hating and fearing Eussia, which is a constant threat 
to her security and which has filled the country with 
spies. The Allies have made a bad impression in 
Sweden as elsewhere by trying to deny that Eussia 
is a menace to liberty not only in Finland and Poland 
but everywhere. You well know what the average 
human being is worth. They cannot think and can- 
not feel soundly. In . Denmark prevails a certain 
fanaticism, too merited alas! against Germany. In 
Norway the people are cooler because in a less dan- 
gerous position. In Sweden, sentiments are dictated 
by fear of Eussia, the terrible neighbor. All this 
comes out in our Scandinavian periodicals in one 
shape or another. 

Ultra-Frenchmen have accused Brandes of 
being too German and ultra-Germans have 
accused him of being too French, but the 
above paragraph shows him holding the bal- 



1916]

ance rather evenly in these difficult times. 

Spanish periodicals are particularly inter- 
esting just now for the light which they throw 
on the efforts of the two belligerent sides to 
influence neutral public opinion through the 
printed page. In a general way it may be 
said that the Spanish publications are very 
much divided in their allegiance. Thus, the 
"Nuevo Mundo" gives more space to the cause 
of the Allies than to that of the Central 
Empires, especially in the articles of that 
clever writer, Gomez de Baquero. The illus- 
trated press is, on the whole, on the side of 
England. "Blanco y Negro" desires to be 
considered neutral, but its caricatures and 
cartoons would find a welcome place in any 
German magazine, though the articles signed 
Angel M. Castell are decidedly favorable to 
France. "A. B. C.," which is owned by the 
same company as "Blanco y Negro," was at 
first so furiously pro-German that it was not 
allowed to enter any of the Allied countries. 
The London "Times" has been very severe on 
it. But to-day it appears to have changed its 
tactics slightly, and its Germanophile military 
correspondent has left its staff. The "Illus- 
tracion Espanola y Americana" is openly on 
the side of Germany. The same thing is true 
of "El Montidero," while "Espana" is a 
friend of France. In fact, in Spain are sev- 
eral publications which do not try to conceal 
their propagandist character. Thus, on the 
German side are "Germania," "El Mundo 
Ilustrado," "Hamburgo Nachrichten," and 
"Hojas Devulcadoras," which are printed in 
Barcelona or even in Hamburg itself. The 
Allies' organs are "La Razon," "America 
Latina," "El Mundo Latino," and "El 
Bollatin de la Alizanza." A German watch- 
maker in Madrid named Coppel publishes 
gratis a paper whose very name tells its pur- 
pose, "El Propoganda Germanofila." In 
this connection, a journalistic friend at 
Madrid writes me : 

The consulates of the neutral nations are inun- 
dated with pamphlets and circulars of German origin, 
and papers of the same sort written in perfect 
Spanish are handed to passers-by in the streets and 
left in the churches and public establishments, and 
sent to convents and schools. In a word, Germany 
is spending millions on propaganda in Spain. This 
state of things would seem to give color to a remark 
attributed to our witty young king when he declared 
that "I and the rabble are alone with the Allies." 

From Rome, M. Jules Destree writes me 
that "in Italy the reviews are probably more 
active than in any other part of Europe, and 
are engaged in publishing articles of the high- 
est interest" In fact most of them, with two 
or three exceptions, such as the "Rassegna 
Contemporanea" which was very feeble before 
the war came, have continued to appear. But 



they are still very sharply divided on the 

question which, however, would seem to be 

settled, of participation or non-participation. 

1 In the latter division belong the "Revue 

I Socialiste" of Signer Turati and the Naples 

I "Critica," edited by the philosopher Bene- 

< detto Croce, still an impenitent admirer of 

', Germany. The most important of Italian 

reviews, the "Nuova Antologia," though in 

this same camp when the hostilities began, is 

now squarely on the side of the Allies. The 

same is true of the young reviews, as for 

instance the "Voce," organ of the "futuri- 

estes" both in art and letters. Archbishop 

Henry Doulcet, who knows his Rome as well 

as he does his Paris, writes me as follows on 

these points: 

The present state of Italian public opinion is well 
revealed by the position of the reviews. At the same 
time that we see disappear non-intervention period- 
icals, we also note the foundation of very solid inter- 
ventionist periodicals. In a word, it may be safely 
said that the grand majority of the Italian reviews, 
and especially the younger and more active of them, 
are squarely of the latter category. 

In Switzerland at least one review calls 
for a word apart. "La Revue Politique 
Internationale," founded at Paris in January, 
1914, was, when the cloud burst a few weeks 
later, carried to Lausanne, where it is still 
appearing, and in its pages some of the best 
periodical literature now being printed in 
Europe is coming out. Its energetic and 
accomplished editor, M. Felix Valyi, said to 
me recently: 

Our aim is the spreading of scientific internation- 
alism. I myself am more a philosopher than a poli- 
tician, and my programme is to remove politics from 
the exclusive influence of the personally ambitious 
; and to introduce into its domain those unselfish intel- 
lectuals who up to the present balk at the idea of 
associating themselves with politics. 

Something, too, ought perhaps to be said 
here about the Dutch monthly printed in the 
French language at The Hague, "La Revue 
de Hollande," whose purpose is to spread 
French ideas and the French language in the 
Low Countries and to draw more closely 
together intellectually the two nations. This 
is the very time for such a periodical to do 
good work; but while the editorial side is 
fairly well conducted, the administrative side 
is rather weak and inactive, with the result 
that the review is not at all exerting the influ- 
ence that it should be exerting. It is printed 
on good paper, in type pleasing to the eye, 
while the level of the articles is far above that 
found in the average European monthly ; but 
somehow it does not appear to prosper. 

Much might be said in this connection con- 
cerning the periodicals of France, but I shall 
speak briefly only about one of them,

THE DIAL 



[June 8 



"L 'Opinion," published at 4 rue Chauveau- 
Lagarde. The chief founder of this interest- 
ing weekly was M. Paul Doumer, "the 
Eoosevelt of France," whose five sons were 
in the trenches, where one has been killed and 
two wounded already. In shape and spirit 
this paper somewhat resembles "The New 
Kepublic," with the saving salt of what the 
French call the spirituel. Since the outbreak 
of the war one of its strongest features has 
been the sturdy bold drawings of Forain. Its 
editor, M. Maurice Colrat de Montrozier, who 
has a most pleasant personality and brains 
that go with it, is a close friend of both the 
President of the Republic and the President 
of the Ministry; so that when the editorial 
columns speak out, they speak with consider- 
able authority. This periodical and this editor 
will surely be heard from in a powerful way 
in the New France, especially when the weekly 
becomes a daily, which I am authorized to say 
will be the case when the peace comes. 

Another Paris daily, "Le Temps," charac- 
terizes that gifted Nicaraguan, the late Ruben 
Dario, as "the Prince of Hispano-American 
poets"; the "Mercure de France" places at 
the head of its number for April 1, a very 
eulogistic article on him from the pen of 
Ventura Garcia Calderon; the New York 
Hispanic Society announces a volume of his 
translated poems to be issued under its aus- 
pices; and now Senor Julio Llanos, Paris 
correspondent of the Buenos Ayres "Nacion," 
informs the public that he and a little group 
of friends of the poet are collecting funds 
with which to raise a monument in his honor 
in the French capital which he loved so dearly. 
Very timely, therefore, is this note from the 
young American critic and publisher, Mr. 
Robert J. Shores, who presents the poet in a 
more intimate manner than I have seen him 
presented elsewhere. Speaking of Dario 's 
sojourn in New York during the winter of 
1914-15, Mr. Shores says: 

Though I saw Euben Dario a number of times and 
talked with him in rather intimate fashion regarding 
his plans and his work, he was something of an enigma 
to me. In personal appearance he was swarthy, 
stout, and gave the impression of being a larger man 
than he really was. He was not, in fact, very tall; 
but he seemed tall as well as broad. He had a very 
pleasant smile; but when his face was in repose, he 
had almost an oriental cast of countenance. His 
head was fine, the sort a sculptor likes; the sort 
which looks well upon a medal or coin. Dario was 
not sociable. He did not like to meet people; 
seemed really to be averse to making new acquaint- 
ances, though he was affable enough when he did 
meet them. In many respects he was like a child; 
when he was pleased with anything, he showed his 
pleasure very plainly. He was vain but not conceited ; 
he did not boast but accepted praise, and even flat- 
tery, with great equanimity. He liked to hear his 
poetry praised, and on one occasion asked me to read 



three times a letter which he had received from a 
lady who admired his poems, and each time he 
exclaimed, "That is good for me." During his stay 
in New York, he complained very much of the cold, 
and did not like to go out unless the sun was hot. 
He was very remiss in keeping his engagements, and 
would often telephone at the last moment to say he 
could not attend a repast given in his honor. So when 
George Sylvester Viereek invited him to luncheon, 
Dario decided at the eleventh hour that he could not 
go. I telephoned the message to Viereek, who was 
not at his office, and two days later he wrote me 
saying he hoped Dario had not been disappointed as 
he (Viereek) had quite forgotten to go to the rendez- 
vous for the luncheon! I heard Dario read in public 
in Spanish from his poetry. He spoke very well and 
read very effectively. While in New York he was pre- 
sented with a silver medal by the Hispanic Society, 
and with an address of honor drawn up by the 
American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE SEARCH FOR THE PERMANENT in these days 
of demolition and overturn has occupied more 
than one earnest soul. When the bottom seems to 
be dropping out of everything there is an impera- 
tive need of something solid to cling to. This 
need, in an intellectual and spiritual sense, is 
keenly felt by a writer in "The Unpopular Review" 
who, under the heading " ' Efficiency ' and 
Efficiency," pleads for a return to the ancient 
classics, to the "humanities" as they were culti- 
vated by our grandfathers in the good old days 
before the warfare of science with the elder learn- 
ing. Denning humanism as "the critical study of 
the experience of man in his search for standards 
of worth," the writer finds no such study more 
productive of satisfying results than a serious par- 
suit of the classics. But the rare scholar of to-day 
who pursues the classics for the pure love of it, 
finds himself suffering a degree of spiritual isola- 
tion. As our courageously "unpopular" pleader 
says of the humanist, "in the face of a world of 
things, against those whose god is the science of 
speed, he alone, as it sometimes seems, upholds 
the primal gift of man, the power to discriminate 
and to choose." To quote further, and without 
too strict regard to immediate connection: "Partly 
because of this natural relation of the ancient 
writer to his environment, partly because of some- 
thing which must be set down simply as genius, 
his work, unlike all but the rarest and least read 
of contemporary writing, rings true because it 
comes from the heart and centre of things. Though 
not given to uncharitableness, one cannot but find 
much of even the most able literature of recent 
years given not to the portrayal of the broadly 
human, not to the observation of the will in action 
and the workings of the laws of human nature, but 
to the exploitation of idiosyncrasy for idiosyn- 
crasy's sake. This absence of the central, this 
stress on aimless mood and easy-going sentiment 
at the expense of character, this failure to dis- 
criminate among values, is responsible for the 



1916] 



THE DIAL

impetus that modern literature has given to our 
already violent tendency to prefer quantity to 
quality. And it would be a sufficient reason, were 
there no other, for us to refuse to accept modern 
literature as an adequate substitute for the classics. 
For, in a word, modern literature, compared with 
ancient, is a relaxation and a confusion of the 
spirit rather than a discipline.' 1 For a real and 
not a seeming efficiency we are directed back to 
the study of the classics. 



Ox THE SUBJECT OF CAPITALS certain remarks 
suggest themselves which may be not out of place 
here and not too wearisome to the reader. An 
initial capital letter adds dignity and importance 
to a word. Our national legislature we appro- 
priately call ''Congress," not ''congress." The 
founder of Jamestown is known as John Smith, 
not John smith; and any person who should write 
"george Washington" in naming our first Presi- 
dent would stamp himself as little better than 
illiterate. The accepted library usage of begin- 
ning with a capital only the first word of a book- 
title and any proper names in that title is to be 
commended on the score of economy, if economy 
in the use of capitals is itself desirable. But a 
title seems to stand out better in large initial 
letters (except to the insignificant words like 
articles and prepositions) than in small. "All's 
Well That Ends Well" shows itself at once as 
Shakespeare's play of that name. "All's well that 
ends well" would at first glance be taken for a 
popular maxim. In the current "Quarterly" of 
the Carnegie Library of Atlanta are several refer- 
ences to well-known books and periodicals, the 
titles of which are printed with a rather puzzling 
variability in respect to capitals. We find Mrs. 
Trollope's ''Domestic Manners of the Americans," 
but very soon afterward Dickens's "American 
notes," and on the next page Henry James's 
"The American scene." We note also references 
to "The Boston Transcript," "The dial" and 
"Book review digest." What is there in the words 
"manners" and "transcript" to entitle them to 
greater honor than the words "notes," "scene," 
"dial," "review," and "digest"? One of our fore- 
most newspapers aims at consistency in the use 
of capitals by employing them only (as is jocu- 
larly maintained) to indicate the founder of the 
journal and the founder of Christianity. This is 
going a little too far, as even the most scrupulous 
library cataloguer would admit. 



A FOE TO INTELLECTUAL NARROWNESS is a friend 

to liberal culture. This self-evident truth will 
serve as an introduction to a readable chapter in 
Mr. Henry Jones Ford's recent study ("a 
biographical study" he calls it on his title-page) 
of our present chief magistrate. "Intellectual 
narrowness," Mr. Ford affirms, "is his great aver- 
sion. I have heard him describe the class of schol- 
ars who dwarf themselves by confinement to one 
subject as ' ignorant specialists.'" Whatever con- 
cerns humanity interests this anti-specialist, it 
seems, "so that at one sitting at his table," con- 



tinues the author, "one may hear talk of Kip ling's 
latest poem, of Chesterton's most recent paradox, 
of football prospects, events in the religious world, 
the latest limerick, the political myths by which 
people are imposed upon as regards the nature of 
our Constitution, the trend of contemporaneous 
philosophy, personal anecdotes, and interspersed 
throughout a lot of apposite stories." As one 
happy consequence of the above-named Horatian 
quality (lively interest in all things human), "he 
seems to be little or not at all exposed to boredom, 
and arrives fresh and buoyant at the end of what 
to most people would be a wearying experience. 
So far from being tired of it all, he may rehearse 
its humorous phases with dramatic gusto when he 
gets back to the hearthstone." Something of 
Luther's universality of theme and of interest, as 
noted in the reformer's table-talk, would seem to 
characterize the table-talk of him who is here 

described. 



THE AMERICAN - SCANDINAVIAN FOUNDATION, 
established by the late Niels Poulson in 1911, is 
doing excellent work in spreading the knowledge 
of North-European culture. A mutual understand- 
ing of national aims and ideals and educational 
methods is considered essential to friendly relations 
between nations, and so this organization is a pro- 
moter of peace as well as of other good things. 
Mr. Poulson, born in Denmark, came as a poor 
mechanic to this country, amassed a fortune, and 
devoted half a million of it to the cause here 
mentioned. Dr. Frederick Lynch is President of 
the Trustees of the American-Scandinavian Foun- 
dation, and Dr. Henry Goddard Leach is Secre- 
tary. Associates now number more than four 
thousand ; a bi-monthly magazine, " The American- 
Scandinavian Review," has been published by the 
society since January, 1913; two series of books, 
a set of translations from the Swedish classics, 
and one of monographs by Scandinavian scholars, 
are now in process of publication ; and fellowships 
have been founded to enable Scandinavian students 
to take courses in our universities and technical 
schools, and American students to do the same in 
Scandinavian institutions of learning. As is ex- 
plained by a writer in "The Independent," to 
whom acknowledgment is due for these facts, "the 
propaganda conducted by The American-Scandi- 
navian Foundation in the United States is consist- 
ent at every point with loyal Americanism. Even 
when exhorting descendants of Scandinavians to 
keep alive in English dress their inherited tradi- 
tions of art and literature, this Foundation is not 
encouraging the perpetuation of alien groups 
within our midst, but rather is aiding these children 
of Northern stock to assimilate and to support 
with their high idealism the principles of American 
liberty." 

EX-PRESIDENT DWIGHT, who died May 26, in his 
eighty-eighth year, almost seventeen years after 
resigning that administrative control of Yale Uni- 
versity in which the institution gained in material 
resources more than it had gained during all the 
previous century and three-quarters (and a 
decade) of its existence, came to his high office 



530 



THE DIAL 



[June 8 



eminently fitted for it by both inheritance and 
training. His grandfather, Timothy Dwight, had 
been president of Yale from 1795 to 1817, and 
both grandfather and grandson fulfilled the estab- 
lished tradition by passing from the pulpit to the 
presidential chair; that is, both wore the cloth with- 
out which, in the old times, no one could be con- 
sidered an eligible candidate for the headship of 
the college founded especially for the education of 
future ministers of religion. The later Dwight 
is to be credited with raising Yale to the rank of a 
university, though he opposed with unyielding 
conservatism the modern elective system of under- 
graduate studies and also, as was to have been 
expected as well as desired, the increasing inroads 
of athletics upon the time and energies of the 
student body. Timothy Dwight, the second, was 
born at Norwich, Connecticut, Nov. 16, 1828; was 
educated at Yale, Bonn, Berlin, and at the Yale 
Divinity School; taught sacred literature and New 
Testament Greek in the latter school from 1858 to 
1886, when he was chosen president of Yale, con- 
tinuing in office until 1899. He was a member of 
the American committee for revising the English 
version of the Bible, and was the editor and 
annotator of various commentaries on parts of the 
Bible, also author of "Thoughts of and for the 
Inner Life" (a collection of sermons) and "Mem- 
ories of Yale Life and Men." 



WHAT SHAKESPEARE THINKS OF HIS PLAYS, if he 
be still in some state of being that renders him 
capable of thought, must have been the query of 
many and many a reader of those plays. A Japa- 
nese Shakespeare scholar has put into words what 
may be the present opinion held by the actor- 
playwright from Stratford concerning his work. 
"A Shakespeare Soliloquy," by Professor W. 
Asano, is printed in English in "The Far East" 
of April 22. "I feel ashamed in heart," the poet 
is represented as saying, "to think that there are 
many persons who talk of me in high terms, call- 
ing me a genius or even a second creator. It is 
clear to me that every work of mine is full of 
faults and drawbacks which I desire to correct. 
The first thing to explain is that I was a very 
busy person, to whom the luxury was not permitted 
of writing in a clean, quiet study, as you enjoy it, 
but on a contrary, irregularity was the rule with 
me, for I had to give up my work for the present, 
after writing in a hurry five or six lines in a noisy 
place behind the stage, or I ran the pen on twenty 
or thirty pages with an aching head after coming 
back drunken late at night from roystering. It 
was really beyond description how irregular it 
was." There is more in the same vein, illustrating 
the abashed sense of failure, or of something very 
like it, with which the really great artist must, 
oftener than not, survey the work of his hand, 
overcome with dismay at the inferiority of his 
accomplishment to his ideal. Shakespeare might 
not be moved to express himself in an idiom 
savoring of Tokyo rather than of London, but 
in substance he might well have such thoughts as 
are ascribed to him by this Japanese writer. 



AN EVENING CONTINUATION SCHOOL, though not 

under that name, is conducted by every public 
library that keeps its reading-room open after the 
customary hours of daily work. Especially may 
the young people's room be regarded as such a 
school, giving to the boy and girl whose formal 
schooling has ended early a chance to keep alive 
the intellectual curiosity aroused in the classroom. 
The librarian at Manchester, N. H., reports on 
the results of opening, three evenings in the week, 
the lately established department for young read- 
ers in that city, saying that it has been difficult to 
maintain the service with the present staff, and 
adding : " We believe it desirable to have the room 
open every evening from six to nine. There are 
a good many boys and girls who leave school and 
go to work as soon as the law allows. In most 
cases such young people are not sufficiently devel- 
oped mentally to find suitable reading in the adult 
department. They constitute a class which greatly 
needs to continue its education. The city has 
thought it worth while for the good of society to 
educate these children thus far. It is just as truly 
for the economic good of society that their educa- 
tion should be continued in order that they may 
become intelligent and enlightened citizens. This 
is the function of the library. The public library, 
is a continuation school and a recreation field in 
one, and these young people should be attracted 
to the library and directed in recreative and help- 
ful reading in such a way as to influence their 
lives and make them better citizens." In all this 
there may be some inevitable admixture of plati- 
tude, but the platitude has its uses no less than the 
paradox. 

A MUCH-QUOTED JUVENILE CLASSIC was the other 
day cleverly drawn upon to point his moral by 
President Wilson in a speech at the National Press 
Club. Emphasizing the necessity of rapid forward 
motion on the part of all who would not be left 
behind as hopelessly unprogressive, he said : " You 
will remember the Red Queen in ' Alice in Won- 
derland ' or ' Alice through the Looking-Glass ' 
I forget which, it has been so long since I read 
them who takes Alice by the hand and they rush 
along at a great pace, and when they stop Alice 
looks around and says: 'But we are just where 
we were when we started.' ' Yes,' says the Red 
Queen, ' you have to run twice as fast as that to get 
anywhere else.'" Remarkably near to the words of 
the original does the speaker here come in his 
impromptu quotation ; but for the benefit of those 
who, like him, are a little rusty in their Alice books, 
but who are in the habit of quoting snatches 
from their entrancing pages, it may be well to 
point out that the queens and the kings who figure 
in Lewis Carroll's whimsical narrative are, in one 
book, characters from our familiar playing-cards, 
and, in the other, personages from the noble game 
of chess. It is "Alice's Adventurers in Wonder- 
land" that has the card characters, while "Through 
the Looking-Glass" is diversified with the chess 
pieces. The Red Queen is, obviously, a chess char- 
acter, and so belongs in the looking-glass story; 
the corresponding royal personage in the other tale 
is the Queen of Hearts. This is manifestly very

important to remember; for to be caught mining \ 
up these two royalties would be hardly less humil- 
iating than, for example, to assign Hecuba to the 
"Odyssey" and Penelope to the "Iliad," or to make 
Sarah the wife of Elkanah and Hannah the wife 
of Abraham. 

* 

UNIONIZED AUTHORSHIP certainly has at first a 
rather queer sound. To think of the enamoured 
architect of airy rhyme as belonging to Local No. 
so-and-so of the Federated Quill-drivers of Amer- 
ica gives one a sort of shock. Apostles of litera- 
ture and art, ministers of religion, benefactors who 
give their lives to philanthropy all these we 
like to picture to ourselves as raised far above 
such sordid considerations as must of necessity 
influence to some extent those who band themselves 
together in a trades-union. And so when we hear 
of the steps recently taken by the Council of the j 
Authors' League of America toward affiliating that j 
body with the American Federation of Labor, we j 
are not exactly displeased to note, in the list of 
those writers favoring the move, blank spaces for 
certain of our best-loved living American authors. 
Possibly their failure to participate in these I 
momentous proceedings was due to nothing but a 
missed train, or a mislaid umbrella, or a fit of 
indigestion, or a previous engagement to play auc- 
tion bridge, or a too great absorption in a current 
novel; but we are not averse to imagining other- 
wise. Some comfort we derive, too, from the 
announcement that it is not so much the poets and 
the philosophers who demand trades-union pro- 
tection of their rights as laborers for hire, as it is 
the makers of plays for the moving-picture pro- 
ducers. It is possible, in fact highly probable, that 
the best of what is being thought and said and 
written in this world of ours will still escape the 
withering blight of commercialism. 



THE USEFUL ART OP "CUMULATION," carried so 
nearly to perfection by the publishers of the useful 
"Cumulative Index," indispensable to research 
workers in periodical literature, is also turned to 
good accou8| in other quarters. A late illustration 
of its value is furnished by the public library of 
Cleveland in its cumulated annual edition of "The 
Open Shelf," wherein the successive monthly 
issues of that publication have been combined in a 
classified and alphabetically arranged list of acces- 
sions to the library for the year 1915. An author- 
and-title index is appended. As the compiler 
points out, "nearly every title listed is followed 
by a note giving considerable information in the 
briefest possible space. These notes are intended 
to do any or all of the following things: To 
describe the scope and contents of the book, to 
mention its distinctive points of merit and less 
often its shortcomings, and to compare it with 
other books on the same subject. Many of the 
critical judgments in the notes are quoted from 
authorities like the Dial, Nation, Athenaeum, etc.; 
unaccredited verdicts are usually those of Cleve- 
land Public Library staff readers." 



COMMUNICATIONS. ^ 

THE NEGEO IN LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The interesting article in your issue of May 11 
on "The Negro in American Fiction" impels me 
to offer some comments on the negro in literature. 
I agree with Mr. Brawley that the possibilities of 
the negro as literary material have by no means 
been exhausted, though I think the American peo- 
ple have botched the question of what to do with 
him considerably less in their books than in actual 
life. In general, we may say that the negro as a 
comic character has been adequately presented. 
Enough has been made of him, too, as a sentimental 
character; indeed, it has often been asserted that 
the sentimentality and pathos of the negro shown 
in Foster's songs and similar works distort and 
falsify his nature. The question then arises 
whether the negro as a tragic character has been 
sufficiently regarded. I think he has not. The 
theme has not been neglected (witness, for example, 
the somewhat melodramatic but sincere and im- 
pressive story "The Mulatto," by Mr. Don Marquis, 
in the April "Harper's"), but it has not been 
presented with anything approaching finality. The 
negro in comic or sentimental aspects rollicks or 
sniffles through countless pages; the negro in his 
tragic aspects has been portrayed rarely, and then 
in half-hearted or else exaggerated ways. 

At this juncture we are confronted with the 
question whether the negro is suited to tragedy. 
The question is perhaps debatable. At the outset 
let me confess that, like nearly everyone who 
writes about the race problem, I personally know 
little about negroes. Though I have lived in the 
South almost all my life, I did not have any inti- 
mate contact with negroes during those formative 
years when one's powers of observation are so 
keen and so active. Hence my ideas are to be dis- 
counted, like those of anyone else who proceeds 
mainly upon theory. I have talked over the very 
question we are here discussing with Southern 
college men whose opportunities to know have 
been better than mine, and I am fain to acknowl- 
edge that they do not think as I do. The negro, 
most of them say, is light-hearted, irresponsible, 
careless; he lives in the present, like a child or a 
beast; he does not aim high or persist; he is 
fond of big words and gay colors; he wants to 
strut, to display himself, rather than to be; and 
therefore, seen against the background (or the 
foreground, if you will) of a civilization which 
he apes with fantastic imitation, he is a subject 
for comedy, not for tragedy. While I have no 
conscious prejudice against the negro, I am forced 
to admit that there is much to justify such a view. 
In my opinion, however, it makes too much of 
shortcomings and not enough of merits. But 
whether it is sound or unsound, it is not con- 
clusive in regard to our question; for if we cut 
deeply we shall see that it takes into consideration 
only the average negro, whereas the average man 
of whatsoever color does not lend himself readily 
to tragedy. The tragic hero has been through the 
ages a person of exalted qualities and usually of 



532 



THE DIAL 



[June 8 



world eminence. To be sure, we are paying more 
attention nowadays to exalted qualities in everyday 
humanity, but we shall probably never make it our 
custom to cull tragic heroes from the ranks. We 
turn instinctively to the exceptional man. Now 
surely among people of dark skins there are excep- 
tional beings of both sexes whose positions are 
tremendously tragic. Think of the negro of good 
education, artistic sensibilities, or high social pur- 
pose who never gets away from his origin, who 
meets galling rebuffs from the whites in all sec- 
tions of the country, and is scorned or suspected 
by his own people ! Possibility enough for tragedy 
there! Booker Washington without his poise and 
persistent optimism would have been the protago- 
nist of a tragedy unspeakable. There must be 
thousands like him except that they do not pos- 
sess his saving qualities for temperament. Is it 
not a mere question of time until a tragedy thus 
inherent and inevitable shall find expression 
through someone with insight to read it truly and 
with genius to set it forth artistically? 

So much for the question as to what may be 
done with the negro in literature. What shall we 
say on the question as to what the negro, in litera- 
ture, may do for himself? The idea has grown 
upon me that some day the colore4 race will pro- 
duce a great lyric poet. Negroes are assuredly 
emotional, possibly the most emotional people the 
world has known. Moreover, they have an ele- 
mental freshness in their point of view and in 
their feeling for words ; they have an extraordinary 
knack for brushing refinements aside, thrusting to 
the heart of the matter, and crystallizing its 
essence in picturesque language. These are the 
qualities that make lyric poetry. Cultivation and 
conscious skill may add something, sophistication 
nothing. Already lyric poets of negro birth have 
been near enough to the heart of their race to sing 
broken snatches of the music that is resident there. 
May we not hope they are only an earnest of the 
inspired singer who is yet to come? The time of 
his appearance among us, it would be hazardous 
to prophesy. Possibly he will be in our midst 
to-morrow; possibly not until centuries have 
passed. We can afford to be patient. Scotland 
waited long for her Burns.

HOMER IN ENGLISH HEXAMETERS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
No modern language, I believe, has to its credit 
or discredit as many translations of the Homeric 
poems as ours: at the mere mention of the "Iliad," 
the names of Chapman and Pope, of Cowper and 
Bryant, will immediately occur to all lovers of the 
classics. It would be too much to say that the 
work of these and other men has been an utter 
failure; yet it can hardly be denied that none of 
these versions, despite great individual merits, has 
succeeded in winning anything like general ac- 
ceptance from the English-speaking world. The 
reasons for this deplorable fact are plainly set 
down in Matthew Arnold's famous lectures "On 
Translating Homer"; they are not the same for 



any two of the works mentioned, but there is one 
criticism which applies to them all: the transla- 
tor's choice of metre and a number have been 
tried was such as to preclude him from achiev- 
ing the right Homeric flavor. Having clearly 
exposed the inevitable shortcomings of nearly every 
other verse-form, Arnold then proceeds, with 
what seems to me admirable force and effective- 
ness, to state the obvious arguments in favor of 
the hexameter as the desirable medium for ren- 
dering Homer. 

The question naturally arises why no one has 
as yet attempted a hexameter translation in all 
the years that have elapsed since Chapman's day. 
I believe there are two principal reasons. 

In the first place, modern English is unques- 
tionably a very refractory language for the com- 
position of dactylic verse (it is significant that 
Tennyson and Swinburne, who tried everything 
else, never attempted it) because the vast body 
of the poetical vocabulary of our speech is mono- 
syllabic or at best disyllabic, and because far 
more than half of our verse is iambic in move- 
ment, that is, begins with unstressed syllables. 
From these circumstances it follows that we must 
lay down certain simple rules for the English 
hexameter, which my own experience leads me to 
formulate as follows: 

1. Each verse must begin with a strong accent. 
This rule is repeatedly violated by Arnold, thus: 
Between that and the ships, the Trojans' numerous 

fires. 

2. Each verse must read itself, its rhythmic 
flow dare not be ambiguous, or we are reduced to 
rhythmic prose: 

And yet not that grief, which then will be, of the 
Trojans. 

3. Homer uses a spondaic fifth foot in about 
four lines to the hundred; in view of the difficulty 
of producing anything like a genuine spondee in 
English, we shall do well to limit that number still 
more, and to put only our best spondees in that 
foot. Failure to observe this rule is the chief fault 
of Dr. Rouse, whose verse in the main represents 
a distinct advance over Arnold: 

So he rejoicing goes in the light of a larger wisdom. 

4. Similarly, the English verse cannot digest 
more than two successive spondees, hence the bad 
effect of 

For than man, indeed, there breathes no wretcheder 
creature. 

It would perhaps not be surprising if Arnold's 
own verses, halting and unmelodious as they are, 
had discouraged those to whom his theoretical argu- 
ments seemed to be well taken. 

But there is another and more important reason 
why the hexameter has so far not been attempted 
on any large scale: it is the frequently iterated 
dictum that the hexameter in English does not 
even suggest the classic rhythm except to the clas- 
sically trained, and these it offends. The same argu- 
ment, let me remark in passing, would logically 
lead to the rejection of any modern metre for the 
translation of any classical one: for the English 
trochee is not a Greek trochee, and so on down the 
list. But I believe that the differences between 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



533 



the classical and the modern metres have been very 
greatly exaggerated. There is a steadily growing 
body of evidence to support the theory, which has 
been advanced in some quarters, that the Homeric 
verses were not read, in our modern sense, but 
sung. Dr. Rouse alludes to the recitation of the 
Vedic hymns, which like Greek have both quantity 
and musical accent; this recitation has been handed 
down by immemorial tradition, and he says, "It is 
a sort of intoned recitative, most impressive and 
agreeable to the sensitive ear." If this is compar- 
able to the delivery of the Homeric verses, it fol- 
lows that when we contrast the movement of a 
modern with that of a Greek hexameter, we are 
simply proving the inequality of a spoken verse 
and a chanted one. 

But it would be fruitless to dwell on this some- 
what contentious matter, since for my feeling the 
point is not at all whether an English hexameter 
is the equivalent of a Greek one. It represents in 
any case, rhythmically considered, the closest 
approximation to it of which our speech is capable, 
and it seems to me that there are only two ques- 
tions which we need to ask about it: first, is the 
dactylic hexameter a priori adequate for the ren- 
dering of Homer; and second, is it in practice 
capable of producing satisfactory English verse? 
For we must always be mindful of Coleridge's 
first rule for a translator: "Thou shalt not turn a 
good poem into a bad one." 

Now, there is much bad hexameter verse in 
English, and I confess that I had grave doubts as 
to the capacities of our language in that direction, 
especially in view of Arnold's unsatisfactory verses, 
until a friend called my attention to Kingsley's 
"Andromeda," a truly beautiful epic poem which 
seems to me to banish all doubt of the possibility 
of creating admirable English hexameters. With 
regard to theoretical adequacy of the hexameter 
as a medium for translating Homer, I am con- 
tent to cite Arnold's masterly discussion of that 
question, which he answers with an emphatic 
affirmative. 

But poetry is in one respect like pudding : if the 
proof of the one is in the eating, the proof of the 
other is in the reading of it; and I am so bold as 
to append here three short passages from the first 
book of the "Iliad," which I have recently done 
into hexameters. 

148 Darkling eyed him Achilles, the fleet of foot, 

and retorted, 
"Woe, thou king that art clothed in insolence, 

crafty of counsel, 
How may a man of the Danaans heartily hark 

to thy bidding, 
Whether to go on a foray, or to fight with the 

foe in the forefront? 
Xot for revenge on the Trojan spearman 

journeyed I hither, 
Ready to fight, for they have not wronged me; 

neither my cattle 
Drove they away, nor my horses, nor ever have 

harried my harvest 

Yonder in rich-soiled Phthia, the land that nour- 
ishes heroes, 
Seeing there lieth much distance beween, here 

shadowy mountains, 



There the resounding sea: nay, thee we fol- 
lowed, O shameless, 

Tnee, thou dog-face, hither to make thee glad 
by obtaining 

Quittance for thee at the Trojans' hands, and 
for thy Menelaus. 

458 Now having prayed and sprinkled the barley, 

they went to the victims, 
Drew up their heads and slaughtered and flayed 

them, and took each thigh-piece, 
Folded it double with fat, and laid raw collops 

upon it. 
Fagots consumed the flesh, and of gleaming 

wine a libation 
Made the old man; and five-tined forks held 

the young men beside him. 
Now when the thighs had been burnt, and when 

they had tasted the vitals, 
All the remainder they sliced and spitted and 

carefully roasted, 
Drawing it then from the fire. And when they 

had rest from their labors, 
Having prepared the repast, they feasted; the 

banquet was goodly, 
Nor was their pleasure stinted. But when their 

desire was accomplished, 
Sated with eating and drinking, the young men 

poured to o'erflowing 
Wine in the bowls, whence they filled all the 

cups for libation and feasting. 
Thus through the livelong day they worshipped 

the god with their music, 
Hymning the praise of Apollo: his heart was 

rejoiced as he heard it. 

586 "Courage, mother ef mine, and endure, howso- 

e'er thou art angered, 
Lest I behold thee, dear as thou art, undergoing 

chastisement 
Under my very eyes; nor then, for all of my 

sorrow, 
Shall I be able to save thee: for Zeus is not 

good to encounter. 
Yea, one day heretofore, when I fain would have 

saved thee, he caught me 
Fast by the foot and flung me afar from the 

heavenly threshold; 

All day long did I fly, and at sunset I fell upon 
Lemnos 

Barely alive, and the Sintians forthwith nursed 

me, the fallen." 
Thus he spake, and the ox-yed goddess, the 

white-armed Hera, 
Smiled and accepted the cup from the hand of 

Hephaestus. And ladling 
Nectar sweet from the bowl, from the right to 

the left did he serve them, 
Filling the cups; and the blest gods shook with 

unquenchable laughter, 
Seeing the limping Hephaestus puff through the 

halls of the palace. 
Thus through the livelong day did they feast 

till the sun was descending, 
Nor were they stinted in heart as to joy of 

the bountiful banquet, 
Nor of the lovely lyre in the fingers of Phoebus 

Apollo, 
Nor of the Muses, singing in turn with their 

beauteous voices. 

It is my wish to complete a hexameter trans- 
lation of the entire "Iliad" and "Odyssey." How- 
ever, I should not proceed with this arduous task

NEW "OLD" POETEY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The old order changeth. It always has, and 
probably always will. But no word that even ap- 
proaches the authority of this declares change 
to be always for the better or for the good. Just 
now, in poetry, the old order appears to be chang- 
ing, or, as many a soul dedicated to vers libre 
affirms, has already changed. If the change shall 
prove good remains to be seen. The sole judge is 
Time. One thing, however, is certain. A wise 
man never accepts affirmation for proof; least of 
all when the delicate truths of art are hanging in 
the balance. Those truths are too sacred, as well 
as too delicate. 

Poetry, like every other form of art, and like 
the memory of man upon the earth, is chiefly 
mortal; but now and then it is eternal, at least 
it is so, under time, as Sir Thomas Browne says. 
Year on year sees reams of poetry die; but cen- 
turies own to the ever-deepening life of such 
as Milton's "Avenge, Lord! thy slaughtered 
Saints." 

Why is this so ? Attempts to answer the ques- 
tion form no small part of the whole stock in trade 
of the teaching profession. Then heaven forbid 
and it does that the question be answered ! 
Again, the efforts to separate at birth the sheep of 
poetry from the goats is the breath in critic nos- 
trils, another occupation, or profession, capable 
of noble practice, though often followed ignobly. 
But how about those who neither criticize nor teach, 
'those to whom poetry is truly "the breath and 
finer spirit of all knowledge," those to whom "it 
is indeed something divine"? They, too, must have 
their place in the sun of genius, even though the 
teaching of genius, the emanations of which are" 
beauty, be unknown to them, and the vivisection of 
beauty be blasphemy, those happy creatures who 
love poetry but have never heard a lecture on it. 

Because I believe in the utter truth of Dante's 
observation that the more there are to share a 
good the more of that good there is, for this 
reason I am eager to have printed, where many 
will see it, on this side of the Atlantic, a poem 
by Lord Crewe, whose son-in-law, Captain the 
Hon. A. E. B. O'Neill, M. P., was killed in action 
in November, 1914. The poem appeared in "The 
Harrovian," the Harrow School magazine, and 
was reprinted in the weekly edition of the Lon- 
don "Times" in March, 1915. It will comfort all 
those who, by nature and custom, are averse to 
what is called "new" poetry. It will reassure 
those whose lot is. still more unhappy because 
they weep the present as an age without poetry. 
To all those who consciously or unconsciously 
accept Shelley's definition of poetry as being that 
which "makes immortal all that is best and most 



beautiful in the world," this poem will come as 
a welcome boon. It is war poetry ; it is the poetry 
of faith. In form it is both old and beautiful; 
in tissue, fresh as dawn; in wisdom, profound; 
in humanity, exalted. It proclaims the perfect 
freedom of the artist, the teller of truth in guise 
of beauty, who sets and keeps bounds. It speaks 
(and herein lies its poetic value) for those to 
whom reality has been both dear and sad, and no 
less for the many who have the heart to sympa- 
thize with, and the soul to imagine, such reality, 
though fortune has spared them the experience. 

Here in the marshland, past the battered bridge, 

One of a hundred grains untimely sown, 
Here, with his comrades of the hard-won ridge 
He rests, unknown. 

His horoscope had seemediso plainly drawn 

School triumphs, earned apace in work and play; 
Friendships at will; then love's delightful dawn 
And mellowing day. 

Home fostering hope; some service to the State; 

Benignant age: then the long tryst to keep 
Where in the yew-tree shadow congregate 
His fathers sleep. 

Was here the one thing needful to distill 

From life's alembic, through this holier fate, 
The man's essential soul, the hero will? 
We ask; and wait.

SHAKESPEAEE IN JAPAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The international sympathy and cosmopolitan 
spirit of the Japanese are well evidenced in edu- 
cation and literature. The Fifth Article of the 
late Emperor's "Charter Oath," taken in 1869, 
read as follows: "Wisdom and ability should be 
sought after in all quarters of the world for the 
purpose of firmly establishing the foundation of 
the Empire." And ever since that time the Japan- 
ese have been earnestly seeking for wisdom and 
ability, and have assimilated foreign learning and 
literature into the Japanese spirit. 

It is therefore no wonder that the Japanese 
desired to take an active part in the celebration of 
the Shakespeare Tercentenary. The original plans 
for such a celebration could not be carried out in 
their entirety, because it was impossible to secure 
the Imperial Theatre at the proper time. But the 
authorities of Waseda University, under the lead- 
ership of Dr. Tsubouchi, the greatest Shakespear- 
ean scholar in Japan, were able to carry out, on 
a somewhat smaller scale, a celebration which 
reflected great honor upon Japanese interest in 
Shakespeare and their ability to represent him 
to their people. 

There is scarcely space to go into the details 
of the celebration at Waseda on April 22 and 23; 
but the following were the principal features of 
the programme. There was an exhibition of Shake- 
speareana, consisting of books, pictures, and other 
mementoes. There were lectures on Shakespeare's 
writings, and memorial services, followed by a 
memorial dinner. On the evening of April 22, a 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



535 



few scenes from "Julius Caesar" were presented in 
Japanese; and on the following evening scenes 
from both "Julius Caesar" and "Midsummer 
Night's Dream" were presented in English. 

I cannot refrain from mentioning one incident 
of the celebration, although it may not seem 
exactly in harmony with the dignity of the occa- 
sion. A Japanese friend of mine has a neighbor 
who is afflicted with deafness and a tendency to 
conviviality. On the morning' of April 23 this man 
gathered a few friends in his house and loudly 
informed them that the day was a Shakespeare 
anniversary, and that, as Shakespeare was a very 
famous man, it was right to drink much sake in 
his honor! Then they celebrated in true Fal- 
staffian style. This incident at least shows the 
intensity of the Japanese admiration of Shake- 
speare. 

I must not omit to add that the current maga- 
zines are properly celebrating the anniversary, 
either by scattering articles on Shakespeare 
through several numbers or by getting out special 
Shakespeare numbers. Even the moving picture 
shows must fall into line, and are presenting 
"Hamlet" as interpreted by Sir Forbes Robertson. 
And the English and Americans in Tokyo and 
Yokohama, not to be outdone by the Japanese, are 
now engaged in practicing for a presentation of 
"A Winter Tale, to be given on May 29, 30, and 
31, at the Imperial Theatre, Tokyo, by the Ama- 
teur Dramatic Club. 

Some notes dealing with the question as to how 
Shakespeare came to Japan may be added here. 
According to one version, the original story of 
"The Merchant of Venice" came from India, via 
Persia, or Egypt, or Turkey, to China, and thence 
to Japan. Anyhow, Chikamatsu, "the Japanese 
Shakespeare" (1653-1724), has a play based on 
a biography of Shaka, or Buddha, and in that 
play he introduces an incident resembling the 
pound of flesh incident. But Chikamatsu's version 
of such a complication is much weaker than 
Shakespeare's; especially it lacks the interesting 
legal features. 

It is reported that "Romeo and Juliet" was pre- 
sented in 1810 at one of the oldest theatres in 
Tokyo; but it is not definitely known from where 
the Japanese playwright got the original. It is, 
however, conjectured, not unnaturally, that he 
took the plot from Dutch translations. In the 
Japanese version, Romeo becomes "Tsunagoro," 
and Juliet" becomes "Fusa." 

In the beginning of the Meiji Era, English lit- 
erature began to be rather freely translated into 
Japanese. The first of Shakespeare's plays thus 
translated seems to have been "Julius Caesar." 
Moreover, the first translation of "The Merchant 
of Venice" was made, not directly from the orig- 
inal, but from Lamb's "Tales." It is only in com- 
paratively recent times that Shakespeare has been ; 
"seriously translated," by Dr. Tsubouchi and others. 
It is interesting to note that Shakespeare's plays 
are so popular here that once the proprietor of 
the theatre known as "Hongoza" was able to 
"unburden the theatre from heavy debt with the 
profits derived from the successful presentation 



of ' Hamlet ' by the late Otojiro Kawakami, a 
leading actor of the new school." I may add that 
Dr. Tsubouchi has translated, in all, ten of Shake- 
speare's plays. ERNE8T w Csjaamm

"SHAKSPEBE" VS. "SHAKESPEARE" AGAIN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Dr. Tannenbaum, in your issue of May 11, 
attempts to confound the Baconians by his elabo- 
rate letter intended to show that the various modes 
of spelling the name of the Stratford actor, and 
of the pseudonym of the author of the plays and 
poems, were all variants of the patronymic of one 
man. Methinks the gentleman doth protest too 
much! 

It is of course generally known that spelling in 
those days was not marked by its modern uniform- 
ity. If it had been, the interesting question now 
being discussed could not have been raised. All 
available records of the time have been searched 
by Dr. Tannenbaum to discover anyone with a 
similar form of name to the actor's, and he thinks 
he shows that the Baconians are wrong. But the 
evidence is too extensive to be useful. The enquiry 
should be confined to the spelling of the actor's 
name in records that have no connection with the 
plays, on the one hand, and to the spelling of the 
name on the title-pages of the early editions of the 
plays and poems, on the other hand. The reason 
for this limitation is clear to any unprejudiced per- 
son, because in places where the two individuals 
are sought to be identified, as in the preliminary 
matter attached to the first folio, there we natur- 
ally find the actor's name corresponding with the 
author's pseudonym. 

The general result of the enquiry so limited goes 
to show that the spelling of the actor's name was 
"Shakspere" the a being short as in "Jack," 
and the middle s forming part of the first syllable, 
as is proved by the alternative "Shaxpere." And 
further, that the spelling of the author's pseudo- 
nym was "Shakespeare the first a being long 
as in "take," and the middle s being part of the 
second syllable, as is proved by the alternative 
"Shake-speare." 

This general distinction is clearly illustrated at 
the present time in the show-cases in the Boston 
Public Library, where may be seen photographic 
copies of the baptismal and burial entries in the 
Stratford parish registers, as well as the title-pages 
of several of the early quartos and of the folio 
editions of the plays. It is fair to add that a 
photographic copy of the mortgage of the Black- 
friars property has the name spelled both ways, 
this being one of the partial exceptions to the 
general rule. This deed is very interesting as 
furnishing evidence that the man of Stratford was 
unable to write, his name being appended by a 
law clerk in law script, whereas the other parties 
sign in ordinary italic handwriting. 

In concluding, it may be remarked that by 
referring to "the poet" Dr. Tannenbaum quietly 
assumes the point he endeavors vainly to prove.

SHAKESPEARE POTPOURRI. 



The last ten years have almost completely 
revolutionized our conceptions of Shakespeare, 
his relations to his associates, the conditions 
under which he worked, and the stage for 
which he wrote. It is with no little satisfac- 
tion that we point out that this is almost 
wholly the result of American scholarship. 
Those who have chiefly contributed to bring 
this about are, first and foremost, Professor 
Wallace and his wife; then come G. F. 
Reynolds, V. Albright, and F. S. Graves. 
Among foreigners we mention only W. J. 
Lawrence and T. Murray; two others are 
very commonly spoken of as pathfinders in 
Shakespeare exploration, but as they came not 
by their materials handsomely we do not 
name them. Owing to these important addi- 
tions to our knowledge, and to the advent of 
the tercentenary of Shakespeare's death, Sir 
Sidney Lee has brought out a new edition of 
his "Life of William Shakespeare," revised, 
enlarged, and almost wholly rewritten. 
Whereas the first edition of his book, in 1898, 
(an expansion of his sketch in the "Dictionary 
of National Biography"), contained only 461 
pages, divided into twenty-one chapters and 
ten appendices, the present issue contains 713 
pages, divided into twenty-seven chapters and 
ten appendices. In addition to this, there is 
an exceedingly elaborate and valuable Index 
of forty-four double-columned pages, in all of 
which we have noted but few errors or omis- 
sions. It is a bit of false modesty or care- 
lessness on Sir Sidney 's part that the Index 
contains not a single reference to himself, 
although in the book itself he refers to almost 
every scrap of his writings. A very commend- 
able feature of this new "Life" is the 
abundance and scrupulous exactness with 
which references are given to the writings of 
others, especially Americans whom the author 
had slighted in former editions. The book is a 
good specimen of the printer's art; and the 
proof-reader, too, has done his work remark- 
ably well. That a volume of this size 
should contain less than a dozen misprints is 
a phenomenon deserving special mention. We 
are also pleased to note that Sir Sidney has 
reformed, even if only indifferently, his habit 
of saying "doubtless" when speaking of mat- 
ters wholly conjectural, an indication, we 
hope, that some day he may learn to realize 
the usefulness of such words as "possibly," 



*A LIFE OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. By Sir Sidney Lee.

York: The Macmillan Co. 



"probably," and "perhaps" (important words 
when dealing with Shakespeare), to say 
"seems" for "would seem," and to place the 
word "only" where it belongs. 

This book calls for a very critical examina- 
tion because of the author's reputation for 
scholarship, the tone of finality with which he 
speaks, the authority with which he "imposes" 
(as the Germans say) on those who have not 
investigated the facts of Shakespeare's life 
for themselves, and the incalculable mischief 
that errors in such a book may work. The 
truth is that we do not yet know enough about 
Shakespeare positively ; that we still have to 
piece out with guesswork and conjecture the 
few scattered fragments that have escaped 
time's devastating influences; and that we 
have to resort to a deal of padding to make 
a plausible "Life" which is to sell for two 
dollars. To reconstruct Shakespeare for us, 
his biographer must be not only a competent 
compiler of other men's work and a scholar, 
but must be richly endowed with the bio- 
graphic imagination and a fine psychologic 
insight. Sir Sidney's book gives abundant 
evidence of the first two qualities, but not a 
trace of the second. In his work the general 
reader and teacher will find nearly all the 
known facts, traditions, and guesses pertain- 
ing to Shakespeare's parentage, education, 
marriage, training, work, financial transac- 
tions, property, sources, theatrical conditions, 
retirement, death, will, descendants, signa- 
tures, portraits, etc. There are excellent 
chapters on the Baconian heresy, the growth 
of Shakespeare's fame at home and abroad, 
the Quartos and Folios, his editors, etc. We 
miss, however, an account of the Shakespeare 
apocrypha, the numerous anti-Willian obses- 
sions, an account of the Northumberland and 
Promus manuscripts, a transcript of the poet's 
will and other important documents. Almost 
a fourth of the book is devoted to the discus- 
sion of the Sonnets the only department of 
Shakespeare study to which Sir Sidney may 
be said to have contributed anything original ; 
but we must not withhold from him the credit 
of having discovered that the sculptor of 
Shakespeare's tomb was Garret Janssen, the 
son, not Gheeraert Janssen, the father; that 
John Combe was not the owner of "The 
College House"; and that this same John 
("Shakespeare's especial friend") was "a 
confirmed bachelor," unless we also accord 
him the distinction of having discovered that 
Shakespeare must have known that the Ameri- 
can Indians kept the fish-dams of the Virgin- 
ians in good order. 

Sir Sidney devotes too much space to the 
marshalling of hordes of facts, facts, facts, 



1916]

which are not only uninteresting in them- i 
selves but which contribute absolutely noth- ! 
ing to our understanding or appreciation of 
Shakespeare. According to this method, there j 
is absolutely no limit to the size a Shakespeare 
biography may reach. In subsequent edi- j 
tions we may be regaled with chapters on the j 
lives of each witness to Shakespeare's will, | 
his attorneys, his theatrical associates, his 
neighbors, etc., etc. The author's guiding ; 
principle seems to have been to include every [ 
fact that can in any way be brought into 
association with the poet. The result is a 
maze of shreds and patches without any sense ; 
of unity. It would be much nearer the truth : 
to call this volume a dictionary or manual of . 
Shakespeareana than "A Life of William 
Shakespeare. " 

Shakespeare scholarship is not advanced a ; 
jot by any such false, misleading, or ill- ' 
founded assertions as that William left Strat- 
ford "in the later months of 1585," especially 
when we are subsequently told with as 
little reason also that his departure was 
"doubtless [ !] in the early summer of 1586"; | 
that John left Snitterfield "about 1552"; i 
that the bulk of John's stock-in-trade came 
from Snitterfield; that he was a keen man 
of business and that he married Mary Arden 
because she had a handsome dowry (accord- 
ing to Sir Sidney the Shakespeares all lived 
for money) ; that he had a "ready command ' 
of figures" and that this "relieves him of the 
imputation of illiteracy"; that John's mar- 
riage "doubtless" took place at Aston Cant- 
low: that parents "invariably" played ! 
foremost parts in the betrothal of their chil- ; 
dren; that William had no means of liveli- 
hood at the time of his marriage; that he i 
received aid and encouragement from Richard : 
Field; that Shakespeare "doubtless knew ! 
Florio first as Southampton's protege"; that 
in Sonnet 107 reference is made to Queen 
Elizabeth's death; that there is "no dim- ! 
culty" in detecting the lineaments of the i 
Earl of Southampton in those of the youth i 
of the Sonnets (this from the man who was j 
once a Pembrokist is good) ; that Barnes sat- 
isfies "all the conditions" of the problems of i 
the identity of the rival poet (except, we may ; 
note, that no sane poet could ever have \ 
spoken of "the proud full sail of his great j 
verse") ; that the Sonnets were put together j 
at haphazard; that John's negotiations for ' 
heraldic distinction in 1568 "were certainly I 
abortive"; that John's "customary role" in 
the Stratford Court of Record was that of 
defendant (had Sir Sidney read Halliwell- ] 
Phillipps's "Outlines" more carefully he 
would have known that John was plaintiff ! 



as often as defendant) ; that William inher- 
ited from his father his litigious tendency 
(Sir Sidney has peculiar notions about hered- 
ity) ; that "The Tempest" was the last play 
that Shakespeare completed (perhaps it was 
'The Winter's Tale") ; .that only two c-f 
Shakespeare's works were published with his 
sanction and cooperation ; that no play of his 
reached the printer in his own handwriting 
(there is positive evidence to the contrary) ; 
that Heminge and Condell lied when they 
asserted they had access to their friend's 
manuscripts; that theatrical managers some- 
times bought off piratical publishers (an 
"absurd notion" Miss Albright calls this) ; 
that at Shakespeare's death "no mark of 
honor was denied his name" (an assertion 
that has no foundation in recorded fact) ; 
that the poet "uncomplainingly submitted to 
the wholesale piracy of his plays and the 
ascription to him of books by other hands" 
(this is flatly contradicted by Heywood; cf. 
Lee, p. 269) ; that the 1599 negotiations with 
the College were crowned with success (an 
assertion wholly at variance with all known 
facts or logical inference) ; that the heralds 
proposed to assign to the Shakespeares the 
arms of a family living at Alvanley to 
which they were not related; that the red- 
nosed Bardolph in "Henry V" is a satire on 
"Sir William Phillipp/ Lord Bardolph" 
(there were Bardolphs enow in Stratford if 
the dramatist needed a living model) ; that 
the "treble sceptres" in "Macbeth" relate to 
the 'union of England, Scotland, and Ireland 
(the allusion is unquestionably to England, 
Ireland, and France) ; that Prospero's 
enchanted island was one of the Bermudas 
(Shakespeare himself tells us it was not) ; 
that Shakespeare's name occurs sixty-six 
times in the Stratford Council books; that 
Camden was mainly responsible for the grant 
of arms to Shakespeare (it was certainly 
Dethick) ; and so forth. It would be impos- 
sible to enumerate here all of Sir Sidney's 
unwarranted assertions of fact and ill-con- 
sidered inferences, and to disprove them 
would require several volumes the size of his. 
But we cannot let the opportunity go by to 
correct some of the most grievous errors cur- 
rent about Shakespeare, for some of which 
Sir Sidney is responsible. 

Discussing Shakespeare's handwriting and 
autographs, Sir Sidney makes several state- 
ments that are not in accord with the known 
facts. We are told (p. 519) that the poet, 
as a result of his provincial education, never 
troubled to learn the fashionable Italian script 
but adhered throughout his life exclusively 
to the old English or Gothic script. But, as 



538 



THE DIAL 



[June 8 



a matter of fact, Shakespeare 's six signatures, 
the only admitted evidence on the subject, are 
written in a mixed Italian and Gothic a 
characteristic of the handwriting of some of 
the best educated men of his day, for example : 
Raleigh, Drake, Cecil, Spenser, Bacon, Jonson, 
etc. Sir Sidney boldly asserts (p. 520) that 
"it is certain [ !] that [William] wrote [his 
surname] indifferently Shakspere, Shakespere, 
Shakespear or Shakspeare." My knowledge 
of Elizabethan script, based on fifteen years' 
study of the subject, enables me to say that 
Shakespeare's extant autographs are either 
written "Shaksper'" (mortgage and deed), 
" Shakspere" (testament and Florio's "Mon- 
taigne"), and "Shaksp'r'" (deposition). The 
abbreviated signature on the title-page of 
Ovid's "Metamorphoses," the property of the 
Bodleian Library, Sir Sidney reads "Sh e ," 
although it is unquestionably "Sh r "; and he 
is inclined to regard it as a genuine autograph 
on the authority of Leo and Macray 
although a careful scientific examination 
would surely have convinced him that it is an 
impudent forgery. The Montaigne signature 
is rejected as spurious, although it has a much 
better claim to be regarded genuine than the 
Ovid. Sir Sidney 's facsimile of the mortgage 
signature is spoiled by the heavy shadow 
across the upper part of the parchment strip, 
and the Wallace signature is defective in 
lacking the insignificant little blot under the 
S which sceptics pretend to consider as 
Shakespeare's "mark." Impartial students 
ought to be permitted to judge for themselves 
as to this. Baconians are sure to discover a 
motive in the omission of the blot. Graphi- 
ologists will be amused to read (p. 647) that 
in the opinion of Sir Sidney the rascally 
young Ireland "had acquired much skill in 
copying Shakespeare's genuine signature." 
Anything more clumsy than Ireland's fabri- 
cations cannot be imagined. Sir Sidney has 
probably never laid eyes on any of these for- 
geries. That our author is in the habit of 
quoting from documents that he has not con- 
sulted is certain. Thus, speaking of the sec- 
ond 1596 heraldic draft, he says that it differs 
from the first in only two alterations 
(although it differs from it in many respects, 
especially in the important matter of the 
description of the coat-of-arms), and that the 
last one of the memoranda at the bottom of 
this document reads: "That he mar[ried a 
daughter and heyre of Arden, a gent, of wor- 
ship]." An examination of the draft a 
transcript of which ought to be given shows 
that the clerk never got beyond "That he 
mar" and that the bracketed words which 
Sir Sidney says are an interlineation 



existed only in the imagination of the writer 
from whom Sir Sidney copied. While we are 
on this subject of handwriting we may refer 
to Sir Sidney's repeated assertions that Mr. 
Ernest Law has "completely vindicated" the 
genuineness of certain suspected entries in the 
Master of the Bevels 's Account Books for 
1604-5 and 1611-12. Mr. Law has, as a matter 
of fact, done no more than to re-open the 
subject and to show the necessity for a genu- 
inely scientific investigation of these play- 
lists by an allowed handwriting expert. We 
strongly suspect that George Steevens had 
something to do with them. 

The characters of John and William 
Shakespeare suffer past thinking on at the 
hands of Sir Sidney. No matter how shadowy 
an item he may be discussing, he always man- 
ages to give it an ugly interpretation. No 
wonder the Baconians and the pious New 
Englanders whose achievements always 
harmonize with their morals and characters! 
cannot marry the man to his verse. Lee 
finds that in 1601 Mrs. Anne Shakespeare 
was indebted to Thomas Whittington, her 
father's ex-shepherd, in the sum of forty 
shillings, and he at once jumps to the con- 
clusion that up to 1595 (why 1595?) William 
did not provide for his family, (hoarded all 
his income for the purchase of a coat-of-arms), 
so that his wife had to "borrow" money of a 
shepherd that she and her children might live ; 
and what makes matters worse is that up to 
1601 the parsimonious and money-grubbing 
hack had not paid his wife's debt. A little 
legal training or a course in logic would do 
Sir Sidney yeoman service. Is it not possible 
that Mistress Anne gave her father's shep- 
herd employment on her husband 's estate, and 
that the forty shillings (the equivalent of 
about $35.00 today) were unpaid wages? Or, 
as Mr. Fraser suggests, that Thomas had put 
this money "in the hand of Anne Shaxspere 
wyffe unto Mr. Wyllyam Shaxspere" for safe- 
keeping? "Deliver all with charity," says 
Katherine; and a biographer of Shakespeare 
might be expected to heed her. Sir Sidney 
errs (p. 26) in his statement that Whitting- 
ton 's will is dated "1602." 

According to Sir Sidney, Anne Hathaway 's 
friends forced William to marry her, without 
the knowledge and consent of his parents, 
because they feared he might seek to evade 
the obligation incumbent upon him in conse- 
quence of his illicit relations with her. But 
there is absolutely nothing in the known facts 
to exclude the theory that William loved 
Anne; that, for social reasons and perhaps 
because of the disparity in their ages, his 
parents objected to the match ; that the lovers 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



539 



had been formally betrothed several months 
before the marriage; and that they solicited 
the aid of the bride's friends to unite them 
in wedlock. Sir Sidney meets this theory with 
the wholly invalid objections that a formal 
betrothal of this sort required the consent 
of the parents of both parties, and that 
Shakespeare's references to betrothal deny 
the betrothed the right of cohabitation. Sir 
Sidney errs in both these points. As to the 
former, he is flatly contradicted, on unques- 
tionable evidence, by Halliwell-Phillipps, and 
as to the second by no less an authority than 
Shakespeare himself ("Measure for Meas- 
ure," V. I, 425; "The Winter's Tale," I. 2, 
278; and especially "Cymbeline," II. 5, 9). 
Posthumus and Imogen were troth-plight 
without the knowledge and consent of 
Imogen's parents, and he complains that she 
"restrained" him of his "lawful pleasure." 
To what desperate lengths Sir Sidney will go 
to make a point is evidenced (p. 30n) by the 
forced and coarse interpretation of Rosalind's 
words in "As You Like It," III. 2, 233. 

In some respects our author is childishly 
amusing, as, for instance, in his determina- 
tion not to acknowledge that Professor 
AVallace has unquestionably determined the 
true site of the Globe Theatre and that he 
(Lee) and Sir Herbert Tree had wilfully 
placed a commemorative tablet on the wrong 
site. Rather than acknowledge that Professor 
Wallace has determined that money toward 
the end of the sixteenth century was worth 
three and a half times what it is worth to-day, 
Sir Sidney gives the valuation as five an 
evident compromise between the valuation, 
eight, given by him in former editions of his 
book and Professor Wallace's present valu- 
ation. At page 301 we are amused to read 
that "a proof that [William's] reputation 
excelled that of any of his partners" is the 
fact that in an inventory of an estate of which 
the Globe formed a part the property was 
described as in the occupation of "William 
Shakespeare and others." With this kind of 
logic one might prove that Shakespeare was 
held in contempt at court in 1604 because in 
a warrant for payment to the Grooms of the 
Chamber he is not mentioned by name, 
whereas Heminge and Phillipps are. To 
prove that William did not take an active 
part in "the war of the theatres" he inter- 
prets the words "Shakespeare hath given 
[Jonson] a purge that made him bewray his 
credit" as meaning no more than that 
Shakespeare "had signally outstripped Jonson 
in popular esteem. " 

Of merely aesthetic criticism there is fortu- 
nately very little in this book. Sir Sidney's 



interpretation of the Sonnets as the artificial 
exercises of a very adaptable poet's leisure 
moments is too well-known to be set forth at 
length and in this place. To us there is abso- 
lutely nothing to commend it. Unfortunately, 
the positive data about these poems are so few 
that there is nothing to hinder anyone so 
inclined from indulging in the most fantastic 
speculations concerning them. Of all the 
methods of approaching these difficult prob- 
lems, that chosen by Sir Sidney the method 
of comparative study is the simplest, most 
superficial, and most barren in results. The 
themes of Shakespeare's Sonnets are differ- 
ent from those of any of his contemporaries 
except Barnfield. The intensity of the emo- 
tions exhibited in these poems and the fact 
that they were not intended for publication 
prove that they were the sincere outpourings 
of a man consumed by an overwhelming pas- 
sion. That passion was a forbidden attach- 
ment to a young, handsome, accomplished 
young man the typical effeminate homo- 
psychic "love-object." That Shakespeare was 
homosexual admits of no doubt to one free 
from the current moral prejudices and 
acquainted with the facts of modern sexology. 
That the poet's passion was ideal only is cer- 
tain from Sonnet 20:13-14. Any critic who 
finds, as Sir Sidney does, in the "Willobie his 
Avisa" a reflection of the story in the Sonnets 
is too deep-rooted in his preconceptions to 
be able to shed any light on the great 
Shakespeare mystery. Sir Sidney's moment- 
ous conclusion that the Sonnet-story comes 
nearer the confines of comedy than of tragedy 
(p. 221) is worthy of a critic who finds 
Barnes's sixty-sixth Sonnet "a first-rate 
poem," Lear's poor Fool a "half-witted lad," 
and in Lady Macbeth an absence of a moral 
sense. 

In a former edition of his book, Sir Sidney 
gravely announced that he had independently 
investigated the matter of the Shakespeare 
application for a coat-of-arms and had 
reached very important conclusions. And so 
he had; but with what dire results to 
Shakespeare's character may be gathered 
from the fact that every Baconian quotes him 
with gleeful avidity, and even Churton Collins 
speaks of William's "bogus coat-of-arms." 
How hastily and ill-advisedly Sir Sidney 
reached his conclusions, and with what little 
regard for the characters of the men involved 
(John and William Shakespeare, William 
Camden, William Dethick, and the Earl of 
Essex), will be evident upon a reconsidera- 
tion of the evidence. Puzzled by the fact that 
in 1599 the College of Arms drafted a docu- 
ment purporting to assign to the Shakespeares 



540 



THE DIAL 



[June 8 



the right to impale and to quarter with the 
arms of Shakespeare (incorrectly depicted on 
the cover of Sir Sidney's book) with those of 
Arden, the writer concludes that John 's appli- 
cation for arms in 1596 had failed, and he 
thence spins out a contemptible conspiracy 
between the Shakespeares, especially William, 
and the officers of the College to make the for- 
mer butcher's assistant, stable-boy, and 
poacher a "gentleman." All this falls to the 
ground if we can show, as we have no doubt 
we can, that the 1596 application was granted, 
and rightly granted, and that there was there- 
fore no occasion for a conspiracy. After 
1597 the poet and his father are almost invari- 
ably accorded the honorable addition of 
"Master'' or "gentleman" unequivocal evi- 
dence that they had been admitted to the rank 
of gentry before that year. Mr. Charles H. 
Athill, Richmond Herald, assured me in 1908 
that "the fact that the [1596] arms appear 
again in the assignment for Arden in 1599 
clearly proves that the 1596 patent did pass, 
otherwise they would not have been included 
in that patent." John Guillim, in his monu- 
mental "Display of Heraldry," without reli- 
ance upon any Shakespeare biographer, 
credits the granting of the Shakespeare arms 
to William Dethick, Garter King-at-arms. 
Had the grant been made in 1599 the name of 
Sir William Camden, who had in the interim 
been made Clarencieux King-at-arms, would 
have been added to that of Dethick. In the 
British Museum is a manuscript known as 
"Harl. MS. 6140" (fol. 45), in which the 
Shakespeare "pattent" is sketched and 
ascribed to "William Dethike." In the 
"Index College of Arms," a record which is 
preserved in the College, John Warburton, 
Somerset Herald (1720-1759), describes the 
Shakespeare coat and says it was "granted 20 
October, 1596, per Will Dethick." The fail- 
ure of any member of the Shakespeare fam- 
ily anywhere to display the Arden arms proves 
that the 1599 application did not terminate in 
a grant. This fact, taken in connection with 
the other facts just mentioned, and also with 
the further fact that the Shakespeares, the 
Halls, and the Nashes freely displayed the 
Shakespeare arms, proves with the utmost cer- 
tainty that the 1596 application was approved 
by the College. The unlawful assumption of 
a coat-of-arms was strictly prohibited. In the 
reign of Henry VIII the Kings-of-Arms had 
been empowered "to reprove, control and 
make infamous by proclamation all such as 
unlawfully and without just authority, 
usurped or took any name or title of honor or 
dignity, as esquire, gentleman, or other." It 
is of course true that a negative pregnant such 



as is implied in our last argument proves 
nothing; but it is equally true that justice 
requires us to regard all even poets as 
law-abiding subjects until the contrary is 
proved against them. Why the 1599 appli- 
cation was made, why the heralds struck out 
one sketch and substituted another, why the 
1596 application was made, and why the 
Shakespeares were entitled to arms, I have 
already discussed in these columns. 

William Shakespeare, as portrayed by Sir 
Sidney Lee, is not only very mercenary and 
litigious but is a very revengeful judgment- 
creditor, insisting on having his pound of 
flesh even when his debtor is his childhood's 
playfellow or the town's apothecary. That 
the poet personally had nothing to do with 
these petty suits, and that they we*e probably 
prosecuted without his knowledge or consent, 
may be reasonably inferred from the fact that 
he did not figure as plaintiff in a single suit 
for debt after he retired from London and 
took personal charge of his estate. 

If Sir Sidney thinks it logical and correct 
to refer to two lines in "Troilus and Cressida" 
a play which he elsewhere tells us 
Shakespeare did not write as evidence that 
Shakespeare knew something about poaching 
and that this lends color to the poaching tradi- 
tion, we may, more warrantably, be permitted, 
notwithstanding Pope 's cleverly-worded coup- 
let, to refer to Hamlet's contempt for those 
sheep and calves who seek out assurance in 
parchment as proof that Shakespeare knew a 
higher goal than the pursuit of wealth. And 
similarly, Sir Sidney could readily enough 
have found abundant material in the plays to 
show that the poet was above the petty snob- 
bishness that craved for a purchased coat-of- 
arms as a means of social distinction; this 
the more so as there is nowhere the slightest 
hint that William had anything to do with 
the applications to the College. The refer- 
ence to the poaching story leads us to point 
out that Sir Sidney characterizes almost all 
the traditions handed down by late seven- 
teenth century and early eighteenth century 
gossips as "credible" or "well attested," 
though they have nothing to commend them, 
but rejects as "idle gossip" the Rev. Richard 
Davies's report that the poet "dyed a papist" 
the only one of the traditions that is corrob- 
orated by collateral testimony. The current 
belief that for years the Shakespeares suf- 
fered from poverty Sir Sidney accepts with- 
out question, notwithstanding the existence of 
a large body of positive evidence to the con- 
trary. 

Shakespeare was a great genius but, judged 
by our standards, not a great man. He was 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



541 



a man like other men, a tangled skein of good 
and ill together. We shall never know much 
about him as he lived in the flesh; but Sir 
Sidney Lee 's picture of him as a lawless, prof- 
ligate, snobbish, sycophantic, and mercenary 
opportunist accords but ill with the "gentle," 
"sweet," "friendly" Shakespeare whom Ben 
Jonson described as "of a free and open 
nature," and whose honesty, civil demeanor, 
and "uprightness of dealing" Chettle extolled.

SENTIMENTAL, ARISTOCRA.CT.* 



An astronomer at his vigils, viewing light 
travelling with incredible speed over incred- 
ible distances, may be observing to-day move- 
ments of his favorite constellation which 
occurred during the American Revolution. A 
similar but too often a far less impressive 
experience is not seldom the lot of the critic. 
It is indeed with an emotion quite as exalting 
as an astronomer's that the critic finds in a 
modern opinion the confirmation of some- 
thing which Plato wrote more than two thou- 
sand years ago, some current of thought 
which perhaps has flowed on like a deep 
stream under the earth until it gushes forth 
to refresh a faint traveller far distant who 
drinks, perchance, without knowing its source. 
But the critic has experiences more often 
grotesque than idyllic. Again and again he 
finds to his distress that a stream of thought 
which he had fondly believed to have found a 
just oblivion in some desert has survived to 
feed with its brackish streams some scrawny 
oasis. 

The reader of Mr. Ludovici's "A Defence 
of Aristocracy" will find a thought-current 
that flowed with turbid force in the middle 
of the nineteenth century. I had supposed 
it dead, at least among ambitious essayists, 
to-day. I could even have hoped that it had 
been killed by a passage in that queer but 
stimulating farrago. "The Communist Mani- 
festo" by Marx and Engels, which appeared 
in 1848, when essays and speeches like Mr. 
Ludovici's began to emerge in considerable 
numbers. Marx and Engels wrote : 

In order to arouse sympathy the aristocrats 
[whose cause had been dealt a death-blow in the 
French Bevolution] were obliged to lose sight appar- 
ently of their own interests, and to formulate their 
indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of 
the exploited working classes alone. Thus the aris- 
tocrats took their revenge by singing lampoons on 
their new master, and whispering in his ears sinister 
prophecies of coming catastrophe. 



* A DEFENCE OF ARISTOCBACY. 
Boston: Le Roy Phillips. 



By Anthony M. Ludovici. 



In this way arose feudal socialism: half lamenta- 
tion, half lampoon ; half echo of the past, half menace 
of the future; at times by its bitter, witty, and inci- 
sive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie [Le. the mer- 
chant capitalists large and small] to the very heart's 
core, but always ludicrous in its effect, through total 
incapacity to comprehend the march of modern 
history. 

The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to 
them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a 
banner. But the people, so often as it joined them, 
saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats-of- 
anns, all deserted with loud irreverent laughter. 

Something of Mr. Ludovici 's crocodile lamen- 
tation over the sorrows of the modern serf, 
coupled with a sentimental longing for the 
return of the robber-baron (so much more 
picturesque than the robber-merchant), viti- 
ates much of Carlyle's "Past and Present," 
that brilliant, sombre, richly-suggestive con- 
temporary of the dithyramb by Marx and 
Engels. But Mr. Ludovici (who refers occa- 
sionally to Carlyle in the language of the 
proverbial fish-wife) has none of Carlyle's 
great virtues, though he has all of Carlyle's 
vices with not a few of his own, and a few 
private virtues which are at best but a sorry 
substitute for the earlier mode of neo-aris- 
tocratic hero-worship. 

In the first chapter, on "The Aristocrat as 
the Essential Ruler," Mr. Ludovici thus 
defines the principle of aristocracy : 

The principle of aristocracy is, that seeing that 
human life, like any other kind of life, produces 
some nourishing and some less flourishing, some 
fortunate and some less fortunate specimens; in 
order that flourishing, full and fortunate life may 
be prolonged, multiplied and, if possible, enhanced 
on earth, the wants of flourishing life, its optimum 
of conditions, must be made known and authorita- 
tively imposed upon men by its representatives. 

Observe some of the presuppositions of this 
definition, if you can be sure of any pre- 
suppositions in a definition so vague. The 
eternal truth of all things, it would seem, has 
been discovered by some persons who were 
thrown at a lucky angle from Dame Nature's 
indefatigable dice-box. Man, it seems, has 
discovered so much about Dame Nature that 
he knows that Dame Nature knows more than 
he does (whoever or whatever Dame Nature 
may be) ; and so, with a finely heroic fatalism, 
he is willing to leave it to Dame Nature's 
"flourishing" productions (whatever "flour- 
ishing" may mean) to cram the law and the 
prophets down the maws of Nature's numer- 
ous little human jokes very much as medi- 
cine was once administered to horses by 
enthusiastic but somewhat primitive veter 
inaries. Mr. Ludovici throws away immedi- 
ately one of his most plausible arguments for 
a new aristocracy by denouncing " the fanatics 
and followers of Science" with all the tradi- 
tional fear of aristocrats in times past. His 



542 



THE DIAL 



[June 8 



sneer at science recurs again and again 
throughout the book, though on a few occa- 
sions he condescends to quote anthropological 
and biological dicta which seem to bear out 
his case. Had Mr. Ludovici overcome that 
age-long aristocratic dread of all innovation 
which once dealt so crudely with Galileo he 
would have found a powerful ally in some 
students of genetics. But the aristocracy in 
which genetics is interested would be too 
rational for his taste. A relish of his polemics 
will make clear to the reader just how much 
Mr. Ludovici cares for the somewhat unpop- 
ular processes of calm reason. 

This is not a "matter of opinion," it is not a 
matter concerning which every futile flaneur in Fleet 
Street can have his futile opinion. It is the Divine 
Truth of life. And the democrat who dares to deny 
it is not only a blind imbecile, he is not only a cor- 
rupt and sickly specimen of manhood, he is a rank 
blasphemer, whose hands are stained with the blood 
of his people's future. 

Mr. Ludovici quotes Bolingbroke 's fine say- 
ing that "A divine right to govern ill is an 
absurdity: to assert it is blasphemy." He 
protests justly against Puritanical and bour- 
geois dualisms of body and spirit which lead 
to asceticism, morbidity, or hypocrisy. He 
blames modern aristocracy severely for its 
forgetfulness of noblesse oblige. But the true 
aristocrat he defines with all the characteris- 
tic vagueness, fatalism, and sentimentality of 
such reactionary paternalism. The true ruler 
must have "taste and good judgment, arising 
from the promptings of fortunate and flour- 
ishing life in the superior man," "one who 
has that spontaneous and unerring taste ivhich 
is the possession of nature's 'lucky strokes'"; 
he is to rejoice in the onerous but "noble duty 
of caring for the hearts of the masses." (The 
italics are mine.) "When men exist," con- 
tinues our rhapsodist, "whose characters and 
achievements shed a glamour upon everything 
that surrounds them, no duty they can impose 
upon their immediate entourage, no effort 
they can demand of it, whether it be the bear- 
ing of children or the building of a pyramid, 
can be felt as a humiliation or as an act of 
oppression." 

In the second and third chapters, Mr. 
Ludovici denounces the English aristocrat of 
later days as a failure. No democrat could 
be more fearless and abusive. He bids him 
"drink copiously at the fount of Bolingbroke, 
Pitt and Beaconsfield. " He finds much scrip- 
ture in Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Nietzsche 
(all of whom are indeed suggestive thinkers 
when not in the hands of one who would brew 
of them all a strange and sentimental witches ' 
broth). He deals implacably and justly with 
the confusion of aristocracy and irresponsible 



plutocracy. He attacks the lust of modern 
capitalism, but idealizes the old Tudor and 
Stuart fear of capitalism into a prophetic 
vision of its nineteenth and twentieth century 
evils. 

The best instincts of the Tudors and the Stuarts 
were against this transformation of England from 
a garden into a slum, from "Merrie England" into 
a home of canting, snivelling, egotistical, greedy and 
unscrupulous plutocrats, standing upon a human 
foundation of half -besotted slaves. 

Doubtless there is an element of truth in this. 
But the reviewer must also subscribe enough 
to the doctrines of those "fanatics and fol- 
lowers of Science" whom Mr. Ludovici hates 
on principle and cites for convenience to inter- 
pret that fear as also the desire for self- 
preservation in a more sordid sense and as too 
often a fear with staring eyes glued strictly 
on the present. Mr. Ludovici says defiantly : 

I submit that it was on the battlefields of Edgehill, 
Marston Moor and Naseby that trade first advanced 
in open hostility against tradition, quantity against 
quality, capitalistic industry against agriculture and 
the old industry of the Guilds, vulgarity against 
taste, machinery against craftmanship, grey and 
mournful Puritanism against cheerful and ruddy 
Paganism in fact, plebian democracy against aris- 
tocracy. 

One need not pause here over the familiar 
exaggeration and cant about Puritanism and 
art to remind the reader of Colonel Hutchin- 
son, of Marvel, of Milton. There is some 
truth in what Mr. Ludovici says, and it should 
never be forgotten, especially in twentieth 
century America. But we must remember 
also that this "ruddy Paganism" of the 
Stuarts, which they affected in imitation of 
the more truly vigorous Tudors, too often took 
the form of a blind and deceitful conserva- 
tism and a feline hedonism that made radical- 
ism all the cruder when it forced its way 
upward with violence ; that blind feudal con- 
servatism (not the tempering enlightened 
conservatism) shares the responsibility for the 
horrors of the age of machinery with bour- 
geois Puritanism. And later on, Mr. Ludovici 
somewhat contradicts himself by admitting 
the wolfish depredations on the peasants by 
Henry VIII and his "ruffianly favourites," 
and by tracing from the time of Edward VI 
"the capitalistic and greedy element in the 
landed gentry and aristocracy." He speaks 
of the yeoman prowess of labor on the fields 
of Crecy and Poictiers, and (writing just 
before the outbreak of to-day's great war) he 
warns the English aristocracy that their abuse 
of the pleb will vitiate English soldiery, a 
warning that sounds strangely prophetic to 
us who read daily of the just obstinacy of 
labor in England in these critical days. He 
reminds us sensibly that "again and again 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



543 



mere change has falsely been welcomed as 
Progress." He quotes the wise words of Adam 
Smith, who warned men that "the earlier 
economists, like ourselves, were hypnotised by 
the spectacle of the extreme poverty prevail- 
ing in the lower ranks of labour, and, as a : . 
result, they were induced to pursue comfort 
and hygiene as if they were ends in them- 
selves, and as if the whole industrial problem 
were to be discovered in their attainment." 
}Ir. Ludovici shows a fine but somewhat near- 
sighted scorn of trade "where sheer speed is ! 
often a means to success," combined with that 
sentimental conception of leisure which would 
remedy the evils of quick-lunches and railway 
accidents by the restoration of picturesque 
stage-coaches. He blames Darwin and his fol- 
lowers rather unfairly for that unscientific 
confusion of biological and moral law which 
has been such a devil's advocate among mod- 
ern business men. He makes an excellent 
attack on "charity and benevolence" (as 
usually interpreted to-day) as "not the coun- 
ter-agents chosen by rulers and deep think- 
ers" but "essentially the counter-agents which 
occur to the shallowest and least thoughtful j 
minds." But his vague aristocratic panacea 
is not very reassuring: 

It requires ruler qualities of the highest order, I 
knowledge covering the widest range, and thought of 
the deepest kind, correlated with all the leisure that 
would render these possessions fruitful and operative. 

He blames the English aristocracy for becom- 
ing hedonists, but he does not realize that the 
English bourgeoisie, partly because the old 
aristocrats were already hedonists, reduced j 
their power and now keep them as decora- 
tions. In other words, he does not realize 
that because the earlier aristocrats chose to 
be hedonists, they are now forced to be hedon- j 
ists by a plutocratic middle class which in 
turn practises a gross hedonism itself. In ; 
short, though Mr. Ludovici is very effective in 
his denunciation of both contemporary aris- 
tocracy and bourgeoisie, he is utterly blind 
to the great contributions of the middle classes 
to civilization, and with the typical Arcadian- 
ism of his sect he would create Utopia by 
restoring the idealized feudal aristocrat whom 
he is forced to define in vague and sentimental 
terms simply because such a creature as he | 
describes never existed and never will exist, 
a dim shadow of that paragon whom Aristotle 
described much better in terms more suave 
and beautiful, more clear but still too vague, ! 
the magnanimous man, the versatile, the 
benevolent, the detached, the heroic self with 
an Olympian ennui. 

From Chapter V, "The Metamorphosis of 
the Englishman of the Seventeenth Century," ; 



one might well gather that to Mr. Ludovici 
"the unscrupulous spirit of gain and greed" 
now attained to power for the first time in 
centuries. He traces the deterioration of 
physical beauty. It is certainly true that 
many seventeenth century Puritans and many 
twentieth century heads of corporations are 
not objects lovely to the contemplation of the 
portrait painter; but it does not follow, as 
Mr. Ludovici asserts, that faces and bodies 
which a minority of fastidious people declare 
to be beautiful are the sure concomitants of 
noble character. However much the reader 
may believe in a Platonic union of the idea 
of beauty and the idea of goodness (a doc- 
trine to which the present reviewer subscribes 
emphatically), it is not always easy to accept 
one whom many of aristocratic taste have 
called beautiful as empirical evidence of the 
union of these two ideals even partially real- 
ized. But Mr. Ludovici is at least consistent ; 
he classes Socrates among "the men who have 
created or established things that all good 
taste must deplore things of which the 
whole world will one day regret to have 
heard," one of the "ugliest beasts that ever 
blighted a sunny day." It is somewhat diffi- 
cult to follow him, even after accepting his 
postulates, when he places Napoleon among 
those who were at once good and beautiful. 
But perhaps that is because I have never seen 
a decent portrait of Napoleon or because my 
taste is hopelessly bourgeois. Mr. Ludovici 
writes with just indignation against the influ- 
ence of the Industrial Revolution on the 
physical well-being of the children of labor. 
But he seems to describe the Puritan 
tactics of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries as a nation-wide conspiracy not only 
to create a crudely dualistic conception of 
soul and body but also to so depress the phys- 
ical well-being of those who worked in modern 
industries as to starve out the sexual desire. 
It all reads like the alarmist interpretation 
of the deep-scheming, well-unified capitalists 
that we hear from street corner orators in 
twentieth-century America. Perhaps this 
conspiracy is a matter of indisputable history, 
but I have not yet been made aware that psy- 
chology and sociology have confirmed the 
notion that modern industry succeeds in mak- 
ing the sexual desires less active. 

In the sixth chapter, Mr. Ludovici deals 
with "The Decline of Manners and Morals 
under the Modern Democracy of Uncontrolled 
Trade and Commerce." After a rather good 
criticism of the sordidly abstract point of view 
which he and some other people call Socialism, 
he sets forth his own fundamental criterion, 
Taste : 



544 



THE DIAL 



[June 8 



Very well, then, Taste, which is the power of dis- 
cerning right from wrong in matters of doctrine, 
diet, behavior, shape, form, constitution, size, height, 
colour, sound and general appearance, is the greatest 
power of life; it is a power leading to permanence 
of life in those who possess it and who can exercise 
it. The absence of taste, or bad taste as it is some- 
times called in these same matters, is a defect involv- 
ing death, it is a defect leading to sickness or tran- 
siency in life in those who suffer from it. 

To a less vague definition of taste we never 
attain in this book. Against the philosophy 
of unbridled economic determinism (if we 
may be allowed to call a quack-science a phil- 
osophy by accepting the connotations of the 
man in the street), Mr. Ludovici opposes the 
even cruder and more tarnished philosophy 
of a world of moral and aesthetic conflict 
between the snow-white purity of a minority 
party thrown into the world by some "lucky 
strokes of nature" and a majority party of 
fast-black sordidness, all of which is an alle- 
gory which would do credit to his arch-foes, 
the Puritans, even in their most naive 
moments of measuring the universe with a 
yardstick. How in these days when, as Mr. 
Ludovici admits, the twisted and warped have 
undue power, are we to select as rulers these 
"lucky strokes of nature," or how are they 
going to select themselves and awe the mob? 
One feels the need of science, or of some mode 
of thought more sinewy than Mr. Ludovici 's 
sentimental verbosity. We shall later find 
Mr. Ludovici forced to retreat to the trenches 
of what he calls science. Meanwhile he grows 
more and more loosely intuitional. How are 
the people to appreciate these aristocrats who 
have this vague superiority which Mr. 
Ludovici calls taste? The people "do not 
need to understand or to judge the examples 
of flourishing life." Suffice it that they say 
gushingly: "We want them because we feel 
that they understand us." Like most aris- 
tocrats, then, Mr. Ludovici would keep the 
masses in submissive ignorance, although 
later on he prescribes a limited and severely 
winnowing process of education conducted by 
aristocrats who will occasionally single out a 
rare spirit whose ideals can be stamped with 
aristocratic notions. To be sure, we are told, 
the masses may rebel should aristocracy 
become unworthy. Well, the saddest thing 
about rebellions in the past has always been 
that fine principles have been muddled, by 
the ignorant uprisers, with superstition and 
hysteria. Imagine the horrors which would 
arise with a rebellion in Mr. Ludovici 's 
Utopia. Truly the golden age of feudalism 
would return with its reverse side ; rebel- 
lions conducted in the manner of the brutish 
Jacquerrie, the convulsive hydrophobia of 
men whose wrongs and disillusionments have 



not been such as to inspire enlightened revolt 
or to strengthen them against equally bru- 
tish reprisals. Mr. Ludovici goes on, how- 
ever, with an admirable analysis of bourgeois 
democracy : the tawdriness of its leisure-class, 
the laissez-faire of its economics, the low 
attitude of men towards women and of women 
towards themselves, the ugly clothes, the sala- 
cious theatricals on and off the stage, the 
rushing automobiles with their peremptory 
honkings, the vulgar display of wealth with- 
out any knowledge of its true worth, the 
decline in physical comeliness, the mania 011 
the part of many of our most vulgar to collect 
old masterpieces merely as symbols of the 
owners' power. Then he turns to review the 
causes of the gradual passing of the gentle- 
man. We are presented with another char- 
acteristically vague and rosy definition: 

A gentleman in body and soul is a creature whose 
very tissues are habituated to act in an honourable 
way. For many generations, then, his people must 
have acted in an honourable way. 

We note again the typical defect of most neo- 
aristocrats: these gentlemen of Utopia are 
moved only by the dynamic force of fatalistic 
traditionalism. Another definition, as lumi- 
nous as a heavy fog, confirms the aristocratic 
fatalism: "Conscience, . . to the non- 
Christian [who is to Nietzschean Ludovici the 
only possible gentleman], is simply the voice 
of his ancestors in his breast. " In order that 
modern consciences and tastes may be puri- 
fied, we must have aristocrats entirely immune 
from the dirty work of the world. And so 
these innocents are to be our guardians much 
as the swooning mid-Victorian women in 
Tennysonian harems nurtured the morals of 
the twentieth century conservatives and para- 
sites. This cult of the innocents, together 
with Mr. Ludovici 's utter loathing for machin- 
ery, we must always expect from the senti- 
mental aristocrat. Machinery is often sor- 
did. True, the best democrat will admit 
that machinery has reduced the world to a 
new and singularly terrible form of economic 
slavery. But it would never occur to an aris- 
tocrat to ask whether this might not be a 
transitional period, whether we could not 
make machinery our slave. The sentimental 
aristocrats have much in common with two 
famous characters once described with much 
shrewdness by a certain vulgar tinker who was 
the son of a tinker : 

I saw then in my dream, that when Christian was 
got to the borders of the Shadow of Death, there 
met him two men, children of them that brought up 
an evil report of the good land (Num. XIII.), making 
haste to go back; to whom Christian spake as fol- 
lows : - 

Chr. Whither are you going? 

Men. They said, Back! back! and we would have 
you do so too, if either life or peace is prized by you. 



1916] 



THE DIAL

Mr. Ludovici caps the climax with a defence 
of Machiavelli 's double code of morality for 
princes. Heaven forbid that such an admir- 
able book as "The Prince" should fill modern 
readers with the devil-exorcising fear with 
which it inspired Elizabethan dramtists ! But 
even irrational people are to-day growing 
more and more numerously aware of the eth- 
ical impossibility of double standards within 
the field of morals, whether sexual or politi- 
cal. 

In the last three chapters, Mr. Ludovici 
turns more particularly to his constructive 
work: "The Aristocrat as an Achievement," 
"The Aristocrat in Practice," "What is 
Culture?" Now, at last, he is fain to throw 
himself on the protection of "the fanatics and 
followers of Science" who, you will remember, 
"are not the representatives" of "the princi- 
ple of aristocracy" because "their taste is too 
indefinite'' and their conclusions too slowly 
reached. If one were to derive his notion of 
science from the citations that follow in Mr. 
Ludovici, one would be compelled to agree 
with Mr. Ludovici 's earlier mood of contempt 
and give prompt allegiance to his more funda- 
mental principle, which is to leap before you 
look. One would feel absolutely compelled 
to cite Herodotus, Deuteronomy, and Ezra, 
as Mr. Ludovici does, to bolster up and 
amplify the laborious findings of modem sci- 
ence. One would cite, with all Mr. Ludovici 's 
disapproval of its radical tinge, the state- 
ment of Aristotle, who, in an age of deca- j 
dence, makes the fatal admission that "Slaves 
have sometimes the bodies of freemen, some- 
times the souls." (The italics are mine). 
Mr. Ludovici has often blamed democracy 
justly for its excessive and vague individu- 
alism. But now, in his neo-aristocratic pro- 
gramme, he follows a Nietzschean individu- 
alism, different in some respects, but equally 
excessive and equally vague. With Reibmayr, 
he classifies man's instincts "under three 
heads. (A) the self -preservative, (B) the 
reproductive, and (C) the social," all of 
which, we are told, may be present in fairly 
well balanced or unequal degrees. It then 
becomes necessary to define Will. Mr. 
Ludovici (evidently recreating the history of 
human thought from his insides, much as a 
spider weaves a web) astounds us with the 
assurance that "the whole discussion about 
free will and determinism could only have 
arisen in a weak and sickly age." With his 
healthy aristocratic mind, Mr. Ludovici dis- 
poses of the trivial problem in about three 
pages. His conclusion, "determinism from j 
within,'' seems to be a sort of crude teleolog- 
ical determinism, a conception of a self deter- 



mined by his own loyalty, but a loyalty based 
not on reason but on certain unplumbed emo- 
tions, "a voice within his own heart," a 
loyalty directed towards heaven knows what 
goal. It is easy to understand from this why 
Mr. Ludovici, when as in these later chap- 
ters he chooses to tolerate science for conven- 
ience sake, warns us that all the conclusions to 
which biology and anthropology have slowly 
and blunderingly attained, all their conclu- 
sions and infinitely more, were present in the 
sure instincts of Brahmans, Egyptians, and 
other races of uncontaminated intuitional- 
ism. Nothing daunted by the daedalian turns 
of Mendelian law, and in fact ignoring 
Mendelianism altogether, Mr. Ludovici now 
proceeds to cite his few adopted scientists in 
proof of the supreme necessity for in-breeding 
within a family or caste. While he admits 
that occasional judicious cross-breeding is 
necessary, he holds that wanton cross-breed- 
ing has been the chief cause of the decadence 
of all the good races of past and present, and 
now threatens the English aristocracy. He 
would find not a few students of genetics who 
would listen respectfully to his conclusions 
were they stated with anything like temper- 
ance and with a reasonable amount of evi- 
dence. But although I could well imagine 
myself as ignorant of these fascinating 
humanistic sciences as Mr. Ludovici himself, 
I find that my meagre knowledge is enough to 
assure me that his procrustean treatment of 
biology and anthropology would make many 
of the most reckless of "the fanatics and fol- 
lowers of science" gasp. But Mr. Ludovici, 
I suppose, would remind me that he has sup- 
plemented the results of the scientists from 
the sure instincts of Osiris, the Ptolemies, the 
Brahmans, the Jewish Levites, and many 
others whose examples and whose lore he now 
cites with great profusion. Only, when he 
says that the Brahman practice of not insult- 
ing but merely avoiding drunkards, lepers, 
"those who subsist with shopkeeping," "a man 
with deformed nails or black teeth," etc., 
when Mr. Ludovici cites such conduct as 
"more merciful and more practical than the 
methods of isolation, segregation and sterili- 
sation proposed by the eugenists," I find 
myself wondering on what grounds Mr. 
Ludovici finds modern science by contrast to 
be so "bungling" as he so often implies and 
says. Also, if this divine instinct of the 
Egyptians, Brahmans, Levites. early Greeks, 
Roman patricians, and others taught them to 
avoid resorting to cross-breeding, except judi- 
ciously, when their in-breeding threatened 
exhaustion, I find myself wondering what it 
was, either in the way of in-breeding or cross- 



546 



THE DIAL 



[June 8 



breeding, that impelled this divine instinct 
into that contamination which has recurred in 
all his great races which fill our modern 
thought with deep brooding over the tragic 
cycles of human progress. Lax cross-breed- 
ing, says Mr. Ludovici, causes the deteriora- 
tion of the divine instinct. But what first 
causes these divine instincts to lend them- 
selves to the practice of lax cross-breeding? 
Here again we seem to find ourselves at the 
heart of that fatalism which has sooner or 
later bred self-destruction in all aristocracies 
yet conceived, and which, as far as I can see, 
vitiates the very centre and basis of Mr. 
Ludovici 's creed. 

Nor can I be appeased when Mr. Ludovici, 
who has had so much to say about the "flour- 
ishing life" of aristocracy produced by " lucky 
strokes of nature," asserts that it is "one of 
the most incontrovertible facts of science and 
human experience, that there is extraordinar- 
ily little chance of accident in the production 
of great and exceptional men." Just how, 
I wonder, does he distinguish between the 
instincts of "most European aristocracies" 
which have "always relied more or less indo- 
lently and ignorantly upon chance" and the 
divine instincts of his favorite ancients, 
except in degree? For the best that can be 
said of his ancient aristocrats is that in some 
cases their instincts seem to have kept them 
longer from instinctively falling into that 
practice of cross-breeding which was their 
ruin. One is not surprised to find Mr. 
Ludovici, after an interesting and plausible 
attack on primogeniture, admitting the need 
of heavy gambling in propagating, even when 
it is practised on the most divinely instinc- 
tive basis. You must have plenty of children, 
if you are an aristocrat. Then, from the midst 
of failure, at least one great man will arise. 

Once more Mr. Ludovici circles back to an 
onslaught on decadent British aristocracy. 
He shows how from the days of the younger 
Pitt there has been a tendency to increase the 
peers of England on economic and other capri- 
cious incentives. He advocates an educa- 
tion of lower classes placed in the hands of 
active aristocrats who would weed out in the 
early grades all those who seem unworthy to 
the traditionalizing gaze of aristocrats and to 
the myopia inevitable in their native habitat 
and environment. 

Finally, Mr. Ludovici has altogether 
avoided the questions which would arise in any 
philosophy of history, which should command 
the attention of any theorist on human prog- 
ress. Has it been for the worse that aristo- 
crats have faded and fallen? Would it have 
been better if the world had always had noth- 



ing but the glory that was Greece or nothing 
but the grandeur that was Rome? Does the 
human race at large move towards "that one, 
far-off divine event," and does the "whole 
creation" move towards it? Or should we 
agree to take a severely empirical attitude, 
and regard this last question as full of temp- 
tations involving dangerous presuppositions 
or prejudices ? Should we hope for an era of 
unprecedented nationalistic individualism, 
and in-breeding not only physical but moral 
and aesthetic? I know that such questions 
might seem naive to an advocate of the 
Marxian "materialistic conception of history." 
I know they would seem impertinent to the 
so-called "scientific historian," with his wor- 
ship of Von Ranke and his amazing notion 
that the historian can deal with what he styles 
"pure facts" without even raising an eyebrow 
by way of interpretation. I am well aware, 
too, that many empiricists of a much finer 
sort than the old-fashioned followers of Von 
Ranke and his successors would not be very 
much interested in my questions. And for 
the point of view of the most sensible empiri- 
cists I have the most cordial respect, though 
I cannot, at least in my present stage of 
enlightenment, give them my poor bewild- 
dered allegiance. But Mr. Ludovici is clearly 
no empiricist. He is an emotional idealist. 
He is a philosopher-artist, or an artist-philoso- 
pher, and he is therefore under Druid bonds 
to pay attention to questions like those I have 
asked. If he does not ask them, his book is 
fundamentally meaningless. And I cannot 
perceive that he asks them.

Within its limitations as to space, Dr.

is scattered through the pages of periodicals 
and costly publications to which few have 
access. 

Buddhahood signifies enlightenment. Hav- 
ing attained the infinitely expanded vision, 
the Buddha Sakyamuni must have become the 
possessor of all knowledge. He must, there- 
fore, have foreseen the use that his followers 
would make of art in spreading the faith, 
and the influence that Buddhistic philosophy 
would have upon the development of the fine 
arts throughout the Far East. Nevertheless, 
the view of art held by him and his immediate 
disciples was strictly hedonistic. Dr. Anesaki 
tries to get around this fact by asserting that 
"Buddha was an artist," a statement which 
he immediately qualifies by adding "not in the 
sense that he ever worked with brush or chisel, 
but in the sense that his perception of life 
was artistic." This may be dismissed as a bit 
of special pleading. There is nothing in 
Sakya's life as we know it, or in his teaching, 
to show that he realized the possibility of a 
mental uplift through the contemplation of 
physical beauty in any form. His mission 
was to spread spiritual illumination among 
his fellows, to break down the barriers of 
caste, and to establish the principle of human 
equality and brotherhood. His philosophy 
has been described as an interpretation and 
popularization of the Veda, made over into 
a moral code "at once intuitive and prac- 
tical," the dominant idea being "the attain- 
ment of salvation with one's own mind." 

After the Buddha's death, his injunction 
to his followers to abjure the pomps and vani- 
ties of worldly life was interpreted in many 
ways. He had required all who adhered to 
his cult to shave their heads and put on 
priestly robes. And in the early years the 
brethren were forbidden to allow figures of 
human beings to be painted on monastery 
walls. Dr. Anesaki points out that as late 
as the reign of King Asoka, during the third 
century B. c., the person of the Buddha was 
regarded as too sublime to be represented as 
a human figure, and was symbolized by such 
tilings as the holy wheel of eternal truth, or 
the tree under which he attained Buddhahood. 
But before long the priests found it neces- 
sary to their teaching to have "something 
tangible to recall the magnetic influence of 
his presence. " There is a tradition that in an 
endeavor to supply this need, Sakya's bones 
were distributed among the eight kingdoms 
where his faith had been embraced, and were 
there enclosed in mound-like repositories 
known as stupa. But this failed of the desired 
effect, and led only to superstitious worship 
of the relics. 



Whether the making of sacred images began 
prior to the development of sculpture in India 
under Greek influence may never be known, 
for there is some reason to suppose that the 
earlier statues were of wood and have not 
been preserved. If tradition may be believed, 
the first of these was an image of Buddha 
carved by order of Udayana, King of 
Kosambi, from wood of the sendan (Pride of 
India) tree. That some of the figures were 
of comparatively early date seems probable, 

| for among the adherents of the Hinayana 
schools that grew up in the centuries follow- 
ing Sakya's death, dissensions arose, regard- 
ing them and the stupa, the votaries being 
divided in their opinion as to whether these 
things were or were not efficacious aids to 
salvation. Not until the second and third 
centuries B. c. is there clear evidence of any 
general patronage of artists and craftsmen 
by the Buddhist Sangha : not until the begin- 
ning of the Christian era do the types of Bud- 
dhist art begin to take definite form. At first 
we find, as Dr. Coomaraswamy puts it, "only 
the popular Brahmanical and animistic art 

: of the day, adapted to Buddhist require- 
ments." The earliest type to emerge is that 

I of the Buddha-yogin, the seated figure in the 
practice of Yoga, "seeking enlightenment and 
emancipation by meditation calculated to 
release the individual from empirical con- 
sciousness," until, as Schelling expresses it, 
"the perceiving self merges in the self -per- 
ceived." 

As Buddha reached his final enlightenment 
while seated in yogi fashion under the Bodhi 

; tree at Gaya, the cross-legged figure seated 

I upon a lotus-flower asana (support) became 
the most characteristic and symbolical out- 
ward representation of spiritual achievement, 

I and as such it has persisted through all the 
centuries down to the present day. Much 
has been written about the influence of the 
Gandhara sculptors during the period from 
the first to the fourth centuries A. D., when 
this classic conception was taking shape, but 
there can be little doubt that its importance 

; has been over-rated. Dr. Coomaraswamy 

; regards the Gandhara sculptures as the work 
of Greco-Bactrian craftsmen employed by the 
Gandhara kings to interpret Buddhist ideas; 
and Havell is probably right in his estimate 
that their art, so far as it is Greek or Koman, 
is lifeless, and "the more it becomes Indian 
the more it becomes alive." Dr. Anesaki, 

i however, says they represented Buddha "in 
all the beauty of an Apollo." 

The great development of Buddhist art 
came about through the evolution of Northern

Buddhism, the Mahayana, or Greater 
Vehicle. This school was the outcome of an 
emotional transformation which carried its 
votaries away from the purely intellectual 
concepts of Sakya and his early followers. It 
promulgated doctrines at variance with those 
taught by the Founder. It peopled the 
universe with Dhyani-Buddhas and Boddhi- 
sattvas, and extended its metaphysical specu- 
lations until they embraced the idea of an 
Adi-Buddha as Supreme Lord and Creator, 
and, under a new terminology, included the 
orthodox Hindu pantheon in the Buddhist 
hierarchy. Its ritual became elaborate, and 
was designed to put before the devotee vivid 
mental images of the divinities evoked. The 
Mahayana sutras represent an attempt of 
Buddhism to absorb the Brahmanistic creed. 
"They are," says Dr. Anesaki, "to leave 
untouched the metaphysical doctrines preached 
in them, descriptions in words of the pictures 
representing the glorious assembly of celestial 
and human beings around Buddha. " Through 
their tacit approval of the worship of images, 
these sutras gave an impetus to the employ- 
ment of art in spreading the faith. 

The development that brought Buddhism 
into the closest union with art was, however, 
the rise of the Yogacharya, or Tantric sect. 
The essence of its special creed is that Buddha 
lives in a spiritual world of the imagination 
whose secrets are veiled in mystery to the 
uninitiate. These secrets it professed to 
reveal through mystic formularies, and by 
"vizualizing in pictures, statues, and rites, the 
symbolic or anthropomorphic manifestations 
of Buddha and of the various deities which 
are his emanations. " It was the outgrowth of 
a cosmotheistic concept which Dr. Anesaki 
describes as "the fundamental ideal common 
to nearly all branches of Buddhism," and 
concerning which he says : 

The final substratum of Buddhahood is, therefore, 
the cosmos, including the spiritual and material 
aspects, and Buddha is the Lord who rules it, not from 
above, but from within. His spirit is the cosmic soul, 
which, like a seed, evolves out of itself all the 
phenomena of the universe. 

For concrete representations of this ideal 
world recourse was had to painting and sculp- 
ture and music. Much was made of the Man- 
dala or groups of sacred figures. The 
Sanskrit word signifies "whole," "circle," 
"assemblage," etc., but as applied to these 
pictures had the wider meaning of the cosmos 
symbolized in terms of its moving forces. The 
Mandala were of four kinds : Maha-Mandala, 
representing Buddhas and Boddhisattvas 
with all their distinguishing marks and 
attributes ; Karma-Mandala, illustrating their 
actions ; Samaya-Mandala, showing their 



mudras, or mystic poses of hands and feet, 
and their various sacred belongings; and the 
j Dharma-Mandala, setting forth the letters of 
the so-called Lancha alphabet as applied to 
them with symbolic meaning. These Mandala 
merged into one another on the principle of 
"The whole in one and one in the whole," 
and from being considered merely as repre- 
sentations of the ideal world they were trans- 
figured by the mass of believers who came to 
look upon them as in themselves objects of 
worship. 

A history of Buddhist art being beyond Dr. 
Anesaki 's purpose in this book, he does not 
attempt to trace the spread of the Mahayana 
doctrines from India into Tibet, China, and 
other countries on the continent of Asia, and 
its absorption of various pantheons into one 
cycle central in Buddha, but, with only casual 
reference to the importance of the works of 
the painters and sculptors of the T'ang and 
Sung dynasties, wrought under its influence, 
passes to the introduction, in the ninth cen- 
tury A. D., of Mystic Buddhism into Japan, 
where it was designated as Shingon or "The 
True Word." The iconography of Shingon 
art, its signs and symbolic inventions, fur- 
nishes the subject of his third lecture ; but as 
"the possible deities and symbols are as many 
as the atoms of the universe," he offers only a 
general view of the subject and brief descrip- 
tions of some of the figures most commonly 
represented by the artists. At the end of the 
chapter he touches upon the syncretic religion 
called Ryobu Shinto, which was an extension 
of the Shingon concept to include Shinto 
within its purview, as in India the Yoga- 
charya had gathered the Hindu divinities into 
its fold. 

The elaborate and richly colored paintings, 
noble statues, and ornate temples with their 
splendid furnishings and imposing rituals, of 
the mystic sects, represent only one phase of 
Mahaj^ana Buddhism. Equally characteristic 
is the idealistic and supremely poetic art that 
is the outcome of the contemplative school, 
known in Japan as Zen. This school lays 
special emphasis upon meditation. In the 
words of Dr. Anesaki, "its adherents believed 
that to them had been directly transmitted the 
spiritual illumination of Buddha, and they 
cultivated its method of meditation simply 
and purely without admixture of mysterious 
rituals and doctrinal analysis." Its tenets 
were carried from India to China about 526 
A. D. by Bodhidharma, the twenty-eighth and 
last Indian Patriarch of Buddhism, who 
became the first Patriarch of Zen Buddhism in 
China, where he was called Tamo. To the 
Japanese he is known as Daruma. He main-

tained as a principle that one should not be ; 
bound by the words of the scriptures, and 
asserted that Buddhahood is not to be attained 
by works, but by the purity and wisdom that 
comes from meditation. It should, therefore, 
be sought in one's own heart. 

The influence of this doctrine upon the Art 
of the Far East was profound and far-reach- > 
ing. A few sentences from what Dr. Anesaki 
has to say about it tell the story very con- 
cisely, and serve also as an example of his 
lucid style. 

As a method of achieving a union of the individual 
soul with the cosmic spirit Zen training manifested 
itself in art of a transcendental kind. Naturalism 
and intuitionism enabled the Zenist not only to absorb 
the serenely transient beauty of nature, but also to ; 
express it, distinct from human passions and interests 
in placid dignity and pure simplicity; while individu- 
alism, a necessary consequence of Zen practice, found 
expression in a vigor and freshness of artistic treat- 
ment implying always a touch of original genius. 
Thus the aesthetic sense developed by the culture con- 
sisted essentially in disinterested observation and 
penetrating insight which produced a feeling of inti- 
macy with the universe and caused man to mould his 
life and taste in accordance with the "air-rhythm" of i 
nature. Since, however, high attainment in Zen was 
limited to a few men of indefatigable persistence, the 
best products of its art showed an intellectual lofti- j 
ness suggestive of aristocracy. Yet its influence ; 
pervaded the lives of the people and moulded their 
perceptions in every branch of art, in the composi- 
tion of poems, the building of houses and furnishing i 
of rooms; in methods of flower arrangement, of 
gardening, and even of preparing and drinking tea. 
Indeed there is in Japan hardly a form of thought or 
activity that Zen has not touched and inspired with 
the ideal of simple beauty. 

It would not be fair to the author of this j 
very interesting volume to criticize it for what 
it does not contain. Instead, it is to be com- 
mended for the extent of the information that 
lias been compressed within the space of four 
short lectures, and the clarity with which the : 
dominant ideas are made to stand forth. The 
book is illustrated with forty-seven full-page 
reproductions of paintings and statues, 
accompanied by explanatory text. The front- 
ispiece is a chromo-lithograph of the famous 
triptych of "The Arnita Triad rising over 
Hills" traditionally ascribed to Eshin Sozu 
Genshin and now deposited in the Imperial 
Museum, Kyoto. The other subjects are 
chiefly from paintings and sculptures in the 
Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. If the repro- i 
ductions are not, in every instance, satisfac- 
tory it is because many of the originals are 
ancient works which it is very difficult to 
photograph. This does not apply to the repro- 
duction of Zen paintings, which might be 
better. It must be said of them also, that not 
all of the works selected are of such merit as 
to warrant their inclusion. As for the two 
Ukiyoe travesties of Buddhist subjects, they 



are quite irrelevant and would wisely have 
been omitted. And in the legend appended 
to Plate XLIV, instead of stating that the 
deity Fugen "is represented as a courtesan." 
it should have been put the other way around. 
But in spite of these shortcomings, the illus- 
trations form an important and most useful 
feature of the book.

THE 3IOXROE DOCTBIXE INTERPRETED.* 



In the year 1901, Professor Albert Bushnell 
Hart published in "The American Historical 
Iteview" a brief paper entitled "The Monroe 
Doctrine and the Doctrine of Permanent 
Interest" which went a long way toward 
clearing up the hazy notions upon the subject 
at that time prevalent. Other contributions 
of the sort have been made from time to time : 
and at last we have from Professor Hart's 
facile pen a volume of ample proportions 
which comprises the most ambitious, and the 
most generally useful, treatise upon the sub- 
ject at present available in the English lan- 
guage. 

The first clue to the actual nature of the 
volume in hand is supplied by the sub-title, 
"An Interpretation." What the reader 
expects to find, and does find, is far more 
than the Doctrine's history. Of the seven 
"parts" into which the book falls, only three 
are purely historical. In the first of these 
are recounted the circumstances and events 
attending the original pronouncement of 
1823 ; in the second are recorded the fluctua- 
tions of American foreign relations from 
about 1827 to 1869, together with the efforts 
of presidents, secretaries of state, and other 
public men "to frame new forms of doctrine 
to correspond"; in the third the narrative is 
carried from 1869 to 1915. Of the four suc- 
ceeding "parts," two are strictly interpreta- 
tive, one is essentially prophetic, and one is 
bibliographical. 

The fundamental service which Professor 
Hart has rendered has been the clarification 
of ideas concerning a very confused but very 
live subject. "No public policy," he cor- 
rectly observes, "has taken such hold upon 
the imagination of the American people as 
the so-called Monroe Doctrine. It has been 
quoted, discussed, stated, re-stated, revised, 
and re-issued for nearly a hundred years. 
During the last fifteen years the Doctrine has

been applied to a much wider range of objects 
than in its earlier history. . . Its meaning 
and its immediate cogency are still uncertain 
and disputed." The causes of the obscurity 
which surrounds the subject are not difficult 
to discover. In the memorable message of 
December 2, 1823, President Monroe made 
certain assertions relative to the attitude of 
the United States toward the affairs of Latin 
America and of the Northwest coast. The 
phrases employed were put forward "for 
immediate consumption, in order to forestall 
difficulties then serious but now mostly passed 
by." But in succeeding decades the attempt 
was made, as it still is made, to apply these 
Monrovian phrases to every aspect of our 
international affairs to which, by the wildest 
stretch of the imagination, they can be 
regarded as pertinent. As necessity has 
arisen, or as inclination has led. presidents, 
secretaries of state, writers, and publicists 
have introduced glosses on the original Doc- 
trine, adding element to element of confusion. 
And it is difficult to say whether the grossest 
anachronisms and incongruities have arisen 
from the exploitation of these glosses or from 
the occasional impossible attempts to apply 
the phrases of 1823 literally to existing situ- 
ations. 

Underlying and antedating all of these 
more or less ephemeral and contradictory doc- 
trines, Professor Hart finds "a perpetual 
national policy which needs no authority from 
President Monroe, or any later public man, 
to make it necessary or valid." It is "the 
daily common-sense recognition of the geogra- 
phic and political fact that the United States 
of America; is by fact and by right more 
interested in American affairs, both on the 
northern and southern continents, than any 
European power can possibly be." For the 
ultimate basis of this "American doctrine" 
one must turn to the physical make-up of the 
American continent and the remoteness of 
the Americas from both Europe and Asia; 
and for the earliest deliberate expressions of 
the doctrine one must go back beyond Presi- 
dent Monroe and Secretary Adams to, at all 
events, Thomas Pownall's "Memorial to the 
Sovereigns of America" in 1781 and John 
Adams's conversations with the British peace 
commissioner at Paris in 1782, as well as the 
more familiar pronouncements of President 
Washington. Viewed in this way, the dec- 
larations contained in the Monroe message of 
1823 become, not a new and final statement of 
national policy, but a reiteration, adapted to 
contemporary circumstances, of a long-recog- 
nized principle of fundamental and continu- 
ous national interest; and, in their varying 



guises, subsequent declarations by Polk, Cass, 
Seward, Grant, Fish, Evarts, Cleveland, 
Olney, Roosevelt, and Root have been only 
fresh assertions of the one abiding doctrine 
of "permanent interest." For purposes of 
convenience this eternal doctrine may be 
denominated the "Monroe Doctrine." But 
the user of the phrase must understand that 
in essence the doctrine was no more originated 
by Monroe than by any one of a score of 
American publicists; while in its form of 
expression it has ever been, and must ever be, 
changeable as the chameleon. 

It is easy for the author to demonstrate 
that men are as absolutely disagreed to-day 
concerning the meaning of the "Monroe Doc- 
trine" as they have been at any earlier time, 
and that so long as our foreign relations are 
managed in deference to a rule or theory of 
such uncertainty the United States will suf- 
fer in dignity and influence. That the United 
States has need of a Doctrine of some variety 
indeed, that the maintenance of a Doctrine 
is inevitable is regarded as axiomatic, and 
it becomes a question of the kind of Doctrine 
which is most desirable and of the form in 
which it shall be stated. The Doctrine which 
is affirmed to be desirable is that which may 
be designated by Secretary Evarts 's phrase 
"paramount interest," or the author's "per- 
manent interest." And the essentials of it 
are asserted to be (1) a declaration of the 
continuing interest of the United States that 
Europe shall obtain no new footholds in 
America, and (2) an explanation that the 
reason for this interest is "the honest repub- 
lican desire that our near neighbors may be 
given the chance to practice republican gov- 
ernment." The omissions will be observed to 
be significant. The United States is not to 
disclaim desire to annex territory south of 
the country's present boundaries, "because 
we have never recognized any limitation on 
that subject in the Monroe Doctrine, and 
because we are now, from year to year, pick- 
ing up territory which is not likely ever to 
see independence again." In the next place, 
the principle of the two spheres must be given 
up, because the United States has become "a 
Canal power, a Pacific power, and an Asiatic 
power," and must remain such. And, finally, 
there is no longer to be pretence that the Doc- 
trine is international law, public law, inter- 
American law, or indeed law at all, "except 
in the sense of the physical sciences." The 
Doctrine is not law for the people of the 
United States, "because none of them is 
required as an individual to believe and 
obey." It is not law for the Latin-American 
states, for they did not make it and they 



1916] 



THE DIAL 



resent every part of it that imposes limits 
upon what they might otherwise do as sov- 
ereign nations. It is not law for other for- 
eign nations, but simply "a warning of the 
disagreeable things that may happen to them 
if they ignore it." 

Even in this moderate form, the Doctrine, ! 
it is asserted, will be difficult, if not impos- 
sible, to maintain by peaceful means. "Unless 
Europe is about to enter on a new regime of 
international understandings and good will, , 
which seems very doubtful, the Doctrine is 
likely to be tested by some ambitious military 
power. For such a contest the naval prepara- 
tion of the United States is insufficient and 
her military organization is preposterous. 
Either the country must face the responsibil- 
ity which it assumes and prepare itself 
accordingly, or it must give up the Doctrine." 
But giving up the Doctrine, the author con- 
tends, will not be so easy; and not even by 
such a course can peace be assured. "The 
Doctrine will not give up the United States; 
for European settlements in America can only 
be made by war upon American countries, 
which would inevitably involve the United 
States sooner or later, with or without a Doc- 
trine." The conclusion to which the author 
comes is, therefore, that the present demand 
for military and naval preparedness is well 
founded, and he rounds off his luminous 
exposition with a few telling arguments in its 
behalf. On its face, the view of things which ' 
is expressed seems pessimistic, and even pan- 
icky. Yet in consideration of the many hap- , 
penings since August, 1914, which had been 
asserted to be, and were generally believed to 
be, altogether impossible, one hesitates to 
demur. At the least. Professor Hart's char- 
acterization of the status of the Americas in j 
relation to the affairs of the world at large 
will provoke much thought and discussion. 

Mr. Charles Sherrill is a former minister 
to Argentina, and in his "Modernizing the j 
Monroe Doctrine" he writes from first-hand i 
knowledge of Latin American sentiment and 
policy. Upon the subject of Pan-American- 
ism he feels deeply and speaks forcefully. ; 
His arguments in favor of the cultivation of j 
the Pan-American spirit are irrefutable; 
although in his enthusiasm he occasionally 
ventures assertions of somewhat extravagant 
character. The most noteworthy feature of 
his book is, however, not the appeal for Pan- 
American cooperation, but certain novel and 
even radical proposals concerning the mode of 
attainment of peace and comity in the 
Western world. 

In his contention that the Monroe Doctrine 
stands in need of modernization to bring it 



clearly into conformity with the times, and 
of fresh definition to dispel the misunder- 
standings that have gathered about it in the 
past, Mr. Sherrill is in substantial agreement 
with Professor Hart and other recent writers. 
It is insisted by him, further, that now is 
peculiarly the time for such reconstruction 
and for drawing the twenty-one American 
republics into closer relations. It is his plan 
for accomplishing this end that specially 
enlists attention. This plan embraces a series 
of actions working out in the erection of a 
Pan-American "triangle of peace," an inter- 
national arrangement guaranteed to preserve 
the United States and her sister republics 
from the menace of European or Asiatic 
aggression and from the ravages of interna- 
tional war. 

The base of the triangle is to be supplied 
by a more substantial harmony among the 
Western republics; and the joint mediation 
of the United States and the A. B. C. powers 
in the Mexican situation in 1914 is cited as 
evidence that the desired condition of comity 
is being attained. The Eastern side of the 
triangle is to be "a completed Monroe Doc- 
trine to prevent friction with Europe." At 
this point the scheme as outlined by Mr. 
Sherrill becomes dubious, if not fantastic, 
and, in the reviewer's opinion, quite breaks 
down. For, the completion of the Monroe 
Doctrine which is advocated involves persua- 
sion of the European powers forthwith to 
give up all of their surviving possessions in 
the western hemisphere (with the possible 
exception of Canada) and financial compen- 
sation of the powers for these territories 
should it be demanded by the United 
States. Arguments presented by the author 
in defence of the practicability of this pro- 
posal, while ingenious, are in no wise con- 
vincing. The third step is the erection of the 
Western side of the triangle, to ensure peace 
on the Pacific. It involves simply, we are 
told, "practicing across the Pacific what the 
Monroe Doctrine preaches." Mr. Sherrill 
considers this the easiest part of the task; 
for all that is necessary is for the United 
States "to stay at home and mind her own 
business." This, however, under conditions 
that have grown up, is asking a good deal 
particularly when it is explained that adop- 
tion of the course proposed would mean not 
only that the United States should discon- 
tinue the effort to maintain the Open Door 
in China but that she should give up the 
Philippines. To facilitate the adoption of his 
plan, however, the author proposes the sur- 
render of the Philippines to Great Britain, 
France, Holland, and Denmark, in exchange

for the liberation of the colonies at present

that in some quarters this last suggestion has 
been accorded support. But to most men it 
must yet appear chimerical.

RECENT FICTION.* 



Mrs. Watts always writes something worth 
reading. She is always (it would seem) so 
really interested in life as she knows it and 
in a broad way so pleased with it, that her 
report of it is worth listening to. The first 
few pages of "Nathan Burke" were enough 
to show a competent observer that a new 
planet had somehow got itself together out of 
the nebulous chaos of fiction writers which 
jars and joggles about nowadays, and started 
off in some sort of orbit. The precise nature 
of this orbit has not yet been calculated by 
our literary astronomers; it would seem not 
to be comet-like or to have the wholly reliable 
characters of some other literary luminaries. 
There are .those who think that "Nathan 
Burke" is finer than anything that Mrs. 
Watts has done since; that was perhaps 
because the historic element gave a sort of 
romantic flavor that many people like. There 
are also those who think that "The Rise of 
Jennie Gushing" is her best book, which 
may come from the particular interest that 
is undoubtedly felt by the present literary 
generation in following out the story of some- 
body's life. In "The Rudder" Mrs. Watts 
has neither of these advantages, besides which 
she has elected to make something of a diffi- 
culty for herself by having, as she puts it 
herself, several heroes. It might also be said 
that the symbolic name of her novel does not 
seem (at least to one sympathetic reader) 
really to show the course of the book ; it seems 
to be a rudder, to make a feeble joke, that 
does not do much steering. 

In spite of these disadvantages, largely self- 
imposed, Mrs. Watts is as obviously herself 
in "The Rudder" as in her other books. She 
is really so interested in life as it goes on 
about her that no passionate delight in allur- 
ing fancy and no deep resolution of the 
troubles of the present generation and no one 
of the current catchwords which nowadays

stand for ideas, in fact that nothing can 
distract her from putting down her view. She 
may be called old-fashioned; people may say 
they do not care for phases of life in a small 
metropolis of the central states. But Mrs. 
Watts is not by any means a purveyor of local 
color; the orator and the baseball player and 
the contractor are really national types. In 
the dreadful Mrs. Maranda she emerges into 
the sphere of general humanity. And the 
other chief figures, the novelist and the young 
lady, whatever they are, are not particularly 
typical of the central states. So Mrs. Watts 
has the main thing to her credit, a fine 
material; though she lacks in this book the 
molding power of one sort or another, the 
power of shaping things into just the right 
form, which some people seem to have acci- 
dentally, and which others seem to have as a 
matter of conscious art. 

She does not give an encouraging view of 
life. It must be that there are a great many 
handers-out of balderdash like T. Chauncey 
Devitt; one can hardly imagine otherwise. 
But he is a sad figure for all that. So is Amzi 
Loring. It may be doubtful if there are many 
millionaires' sons who become professional 
ball-players; but there certainly are many 
young gladiators very like him, both in the 
college world and out. Mrs. Watts 's types 
are pretty true, so true, indeed, that it may 
be fancied that they are too much the crea- 
tion of the general idea and too little of the 
particular impression so needful for art. 
Whether of one kind of another, they all 
together the walking delegate, the . labor- 
leader, the bright boy, the base-ball player, 
the millionaire, and a number more give 
rather a dull idea of life which is hardly 
lighted up by anything else. Certainly Mr. 
Cook, the novelist, presents little more than 
an amused tolerance, and Nellie Loring the 
social worker has only a pained feeling that 
she will find out about it all some time. 

It is not, of course, the duty of the novelist 
to be optimistic, nor is optimism as a duty a 
very interesting thing in fiction. But almost 
everybody feels that there is something worth 
while in life, something beyond mere stoical 
endurance : and if one 's novelist does not per- 
ceive anything, one believes there must be a 
false view somewhere. So I think that Mrs. 
Watts has this time not got her focus quite 
right. 

Whether her focus be right or wrong, her 
book is immeasurably nearer truth than is 
Mr. W. H. Wright's "A Man of Promise." 
Mr. Wright was writing a different kind of 
novel for one thing, and at best would not 
have had the kind of realism in which Mrs.

Watts excels. But it is only in a way that 
he himself possibly did not plan that Mr. 
Wright appears to me to give in any sense 
a true note of the world to-day. His chief 
figure and Mrs. Watts 's T. Chauncey Devitt, 
though superficially very different, are really 
men of much the same intellectual type, 
unconscious intellectual charlatans both, play- 
ing, the one to the vast mediocre audience of 
our country, the other to the much smaller 
set which prides itself on being cultivated 
or perhaps here one should say "cultured." 
Stanford West, the man of promise, is con- 
stantly presented to us as a man of ideas, 
and evidently seemed so to himself and to 
those about him. It is clear, however, from 
the book that he was nothing of the sort. He 
conceived himself as one whose thought could 
dissolve the present structure of society and 
construct another. But he says and does noth- 
ing that gives any such idea. Men of that 
kind do not keep their thought for one or two 
books or newspaper articles: they talk, act, 
live so that people know that there is some- 
thing to them. Stanford West is said to have 
published a book which "stripped the illusion 
and sanctity from the whole fabric of life 
and replaced them with doctrines which 
seemed to reverse the accepted moral code." 
Yet nothing that he says or does strips the 
illusion or sanctity from any part of the fabric 
of life. It surely does not strip the illusion 
or sanctity from the relation of sex (which is 
the only part of the fabric of life in which 
he had the slightest interest) that a young 
man should make his beginnings in such 
things with services of girls from the street, 
should go on with two (consecutive) mis- 
tresses, follow with a wife, leave her for a 
third mistress, and come back to his wife. 

Stanford West was "a man of promise" 
just as T. Chauncey Devitt was. He talked 
as if he had ideas, as if he were an intellectual 
giant ; whereas he really was a muddle-headed 
sensualist. Mr. Wright has made a mistake 
in telling us that he wrote a beautiful play 
full of the Greek spirit. There is nothing 
in the book to show that Stanford West had 
any real comprehension of Greek culture. Mr. 
Wright is also mistaken in telling us that 
West wrote either articles or books which 
criticized the present social structure in a 
destructive and a constructive manner. Such 
'a man could have done nothing of the sort, 
though he might easily have thought he had, 
and very probably told Mr. Wright that he 
had. Such people often think more highly 
than they ought to think of their own doings. 

The chief difference between these two 
charlatan-rhetoricians is that Mrs. Watts (of 



course) does not believe in hers, while Mr. 
Wright solemnly and even pathetically takes 
his hero seriously. I suppose the reason for 
this is that Mrs. Watts has long been inter- 
ested, amused, astonished, disgusted, allured 
by the antics of such people and their unfort- 
unate audiences; so that finally she created 
the character by a species of necessity. Mr. 
Wright, on the other hand, has taken a stock 
figure, a common and conventional character 
of our generation, the wonderful intellec- 
tual and social heretic, and has tried to tell 
us how such a person would act. But he has 
not even studied the conventional type care- 
fully enough. 

Mr. Wright also, and perhaps primarily, 
wishes us to understand that a man of genius 
will find it hard to arrange his relations with 
women so that they will not interfere with 
his more important affairs. But this is a 
matter which has been dealt with so often of 
late that it does not seem to call for especial 
discussion here. 

Those who do not like either good or bad 
books like the above may be tempted by two 
other books of a very different character. In 
"Frey and His Wife" and "The Portion of 
a Champion," Mr. Maurice Hewlett and Mr. 
o Sullivan tighe have caught the spirit, the 
one of the old Norse Saga, and the other of 
the old Irish Hero-story. I am perhaps too 
bold in regard to Mr. o Sullivan tighe 's book, 
for I have never really read much of the 
literature that evidently inspires him. But 
his book seems as if it must be right. I 
would like to find some faults : I feel that the 
utterances of the shannachies and brehons 
should be given in triads instead of quatrains. 
There is something strangely distinctive in a 
triad, for example: 

Hast thou heard what Garselit said, 
The Irishman whom it is safe to follow? 
"Sin is bad, if long pursued." 

That is not exactly Mr. o Sullivan tighe 's doc- 
trine; yet he, like Garselit, is in this tale an 
Irishman (as I guess) whom it is quite safe 
to follow, at least in pursuit of amusement. 
Then I feel as if some of the adventures and 
incidents were a little conventional. But that, 
to tell the truth, is one of the characteristics 
of the Bed Book of Ulster (if that, by chance, 
be a correct name) or the Book of the Dun 
Cow, as of a good deal of fiction since. So 
fault-finding comes really to little ; if one likes 
stories of this sort, as many do, one will like 
Mr. o Sullivan tighe 's, for it is a very good 
one. 

"The Portion of a Champion," however, has 
more to it than a sequence of adventure, good 
or bad. It is in its implications the picture

THE DIAL 



[June 8 



of an old civilization now long passed away, 
a civilization very different from ours, so 
different indeed that it is wellnigh impossible 
for us really to imagine it, however much we 
may be amused or attracted by some of its 
details. It has been the fashion for a good 
while in the neo-Celtic group to look back to 
those days with a vague sentiment of desire, 
as though there were something there that 
might be restored to the life of our own time. 
No pictures of Oisin or of Deirdre have given 
me so much of an idea of a something worth 
while in that old Celtic otherworld as this 
tale of adventure by Mr. o Sullivan tighe. 
Deeply engrained in the minds of those people 
was the respect for law. Not very good law, 
perhaps, and good or bad not always easy to 
get at; but such as it was, whether found in 
custom, in poem, or in decree, it was a dom- 
inating factor in life. That in itself was a 
good thing : to have some really steadfast guide 
for life, even if it were no better than the 
rather rigid guide of law. Mr. o Sullivan 
tighe is aware of other guides, and he pre- 
sents his champion as once or twice coming 
under the influence of that other great guide 
of life which has gradually subverted the idea 
of law without as yet imposing itself uni- 
versally in its place, namely, the guide of 
life which brought St. Patrick to Ireland. 
That is something which made a great change 
in the world, both in the social tradition of 
ancient Erin and in the Stoic discipline of 
Rome which the Champion met with in his 
expedition into Gaul. 

Mr. Hewlett's "Frey and His Wife" is a 
most entertaining saga, written with all Mr. 
Hewlett's skill in getting into the form and 
spirit of ancient ways of word and thought. 
It is a very curious story. Beginning with 
some unimportant matter about Osmund Dint, 
useful merely in showing how things came 
about, the real story is about a man named 
Gunnar, who fled from Norway across to 
Sweden in the days of Olaf Triggvason. In 
Sweden he fell in with some people who held 
a god Frey in great esteem. Frey was a fine- 
looking god made of wood, and handsomely 
painted and clothed. He was married to an 
attractive girl, and blessed the fields and 
crops. The saga tells how Gunnar became 
concerned in this strange combination. There 
may be some deep hidden meaning in the 
story, though I judge not. It seems to be 
what it is on the surface, an amusing and 
astonishing tale of a simple kind of life. That 
is a good kind of story to tell, for in it the 
writer can say all sorts of things that are 
interesting. Mr. Hewlett, of course, is equal 
to the opportunity. EDWARD E. HALE.

NEW BOOKS. 



Leaders in ^ * s now nearly seven hundred and 

Ireland's fight fifty years since the sons of Nesta 
for freedom. crossed the i r i s h Sea and began the 
conquest of Ireland on the suggestion of the 
English king. The process of subjugation was long 
and wearisome; there have been many revolts on 
Irish soil, much blood has been shed in the name 
of Irish liberty, and apparently the end is not yet. 
These revolutionary uprisings have, however, as a 
rule ended disastrously, and have served merely to 
fasten the chains more securely on the necks of 
the restless Irishmen. Far more important has 
been the long and continuous parliamentary con- 
flict of the last century and a half, which has 
actually brought the Irish people in sight of the 
promised land. This phase of the struggle for free- 
dom in Ireland may be said to have been begun 
in 1759, when Henry Flood entered the Irish par- 
liament. Since that day there has been an unin- 
terrupted succession of brilliant and picturesque, 
though not always discreet, Irish political leaders 
in the parliaments of Dublin and Westminster. In 
a volume entitled "The Irish Orators" (Bobbs- 
Merrill Co.), Mr. Claude G. Bowers has brought 
together a series of studies of the personalities 
and careers of the more eminent among these 
leaders, which taken together give a continuous, 
though very incomplete, "history of Ireland's fight 
for freedom." Mr. Bowers has selected nine of 
the leading agitators of the period covered, and 
the list is one that every Irishman is likely to 
approve. It comprises Henry Flood, the spokes- 
man of the Irish "Volunteers"; Grattan, whom 
Fox called the "Irish Demosthenes"; Curran, the 
great advocate of Irish rights at the bar of jus- 
tice; Lord Plunkett, who led the fight against the 
Act of Union in 1800; Robert Emmet, who headed 
the ill-considered uprising of 1803; Daniel O'Con- 
nell, the "Liberator"; General Meagher, who was 
involved in the revolutionary movement of 1848, 
and later won fame in our own civil war; Isaac 
Butt, who led the Irish membership in parliament 
just before the organization of the Nationalist 
party; and Charles Stewart Parnell. The larger 
part of the work is, however, devoted to the careers 
and achievements of Grattan, O'Connell, and 
Parnell. In these essays Mr. Bowers does not 
pretend to give biographical sketches; his discus- 
sions are rather in the form of appreciations, 
attempts to determine what each one of his sub- 
jects has contributed to the cause of Irish freedom. 
The author writes in a glowing, vigorous, and 
eloquent style, and has produced a most interesting 
work; but the instincts of the historian, whose 
purpose is to present all the truth, he apparently 
does not possess. There is another side to the Irish 
question, which is also important, but which Mr.. 
Bowers wholly ignores. One is also led to feel 
that in his discussion of the merits of his heroes he 
has not always preserved a proper balance. One 
rises from the reading of the essay on Grattan with 
the feeling that in him Irish oratory reached its 
greatest perfection ; but a little further on we meet 
the statement that "the Irish race has not

given the world a greater orator than John Philip 
Curran"; and in the essay on O'Connell we are told 
that as an orator "he was one of the most marvel- 
ous the world has known." There can be no doubt 
that all these nine men were masters .of eloquence, 
but it is generally wise to be sparing in the use 
of superlatives, even when discussing Irish oratory. 



What the Not so much a biography of the 

President has man as a review of his public serv- 

omplished. iceg ig ^ Henry Joneg Ford , g 

"Woodrow Wilson" (Appleton), even though it 
bears as sub-title, "The Man and his Work." But 
with so diligent and productive a worker the work 
is the man, and the man is the work, to a great 
extent. Accordingly the larger part of the book 
is given to Mr. Wilson's record as an educator, his 
published writings, his entrance into public life, his 
governorship of New Jersey, and, in six successive 
chapters, his presidency of the United States. One 
chapter has to do with his personal traits, and the 
book ends with "a mid-career appreciation." As 
a writer Mr. Wilson has accomplished an amount 
of solid work unsuspected by many. In the 
Princeton University Library is a bibliography of 
these published writings from the time he entered 
Princeton as a student to the day he resigned its 
presidency to become governor of New Jersey; 
and this list, though admittedly incomplete, con- 
tains seventy-five entries showing a liberal range 
of scholarly interests with a due measure of con- 
centration and specialization. As an administrator 
in high office he is, as was to have been expected, 
represented as* conspicuously successful. A ten- 
dencj r to not unnatural and not unpardonable 
excess of eulogy appears in such passages as this 
reference to a public utterance of his on the tariff 
question: "Probably no other presidential utter- 
ance ever had such a tremendous reverberation 
throughout the country." Illustrative also of the 
tone of the book is the following: "With the war 
still going on it would be rash to make any pre- 
diction as to the permanence of any arrangement, 
but the indications are that President Wilson has 
successfully vindicated neutral rights in the midst 
of the greatest war the world has ever known." 
His administration has been of so high an order 
"that the character of the presidential office will 
be permanently affected." And, finally, as a last 
word at the end of the closing chapter, "Woodrow 
Wilson's Administration will figure as the begin- 
ning of a new era." Appended is Mr. Wilson's 
utterance of three years ago on the eligibility of a 
president to reelection, and on the length of the 
presidential term. Four portraits of the subject 
of the book are inserted. 



Mountain 
scenery and 
mountain art. 



The lover of mountainous country 
will welcome Professor John C. Van 
Dyke's "The Mountain" (Scribner), 
in which the author, regarding the mountains as 
pictures as well as matter in evolution, reveals a 
great deal to those who observe with less knowl- 
edge, if not with less ardor. Beginning "From 
Afar," Professor Van Dyke, in Chapter I, 



approaches the distant Rockies from the great 
prairie, and in Chapter II he approaches them 
from afar in another sense from the nebular 
hypothesis and the planetessimal theory. These 
introductory chapters are followed by pains- 
taking discussions of the natural appearances of 
"The Hills," "The Timber-Line," "The Uplands," 
"Mountain Waters," "Glaciers and Avalanches," 
"The Snow-bine," etc. The following extract, 
relating to the beautiful, graceful bines of hills (as 
contrasted with "the abrupt line of a splintered 
mountain ridge"), illustrates the author's pene- 
trating comment: "Now, these lines of beauty are 
shown to the best advantage only on sparsely cov- 
ered hills that is, hills devoid of thick brush or 
trees. The heather of the Scotch hills or the grass 
of the English hills along the sea does not per- 
ceptibly check the flow of the bines, but the trees 
of the Harz or the Catskills muffle and confuse. 
As soon as timber covers the slopes the lines are 
softened, weakened, perhaps destroyed. It is pos- 
sible in sculpture to place drapery over the human 
figure and make it reveal the very thing it covers; 
but you cannot have foliage covering the hills and 
still show through it the rock structure or the earth 
curves beneath it." One of the most interesting 
chapters is the last one, in which Professor Van 
Dyke asks why the painters have not succeeded in 
following Ruskin in the mountains. His answer 
is that high mountains are not pictorial. "The 
qualities of sublimity in the mountains, such as 
bulk and mass, are the very qualities that cannot 
be realized or placed upon canvas." In particular, 
"the quality of looming in the peak" cannot be 
rendered by the painter. Again, the decorative 
aspect of a picture is unmanageable when the 
subject is a mountain. So, too, the colors 
lead to ineffectiveness, being too cold there are 
too many whites, blues, and purples. And ' again, 
" The light has little or no warmth and is too clear, 
too penetrating. It robs the scene of all mystery 
and is inclined to be glaring." All of these diffi- 
culties have been minimized with great skill in the 
beautiful reproduction of a photograph of "The 
Weisshorn from above Tasch Alp," which serves 
as an impressive frontispiece. The book appears 
at a strategic moment: many a perfervid mount- 
aineer, and summer cottager, and week-ender will 
take a copy with him to the unpaintable mountains. 



It is not a simple matter to convey 
the spirit and message of " The Psy- 
chology of the Unconscious" (Mof- 
fat, Yard & Co.), a large volume by Dr. C. G. 
Jung of the University of Zurich. The explana- 
tory titles, "A Study of the Transformations and 
Symbolisms of the Libido: A Contribution to the 
History of the Evolution of Thought," are but 
modestly helpful. The whole is a significant 
example of the Freudian psychology of the day. It 
is introduced with an admirable statement of this 
psychology by the translator, Dr. Beatrice M. 
Hinkle, which is itself a worthy contribution. The 
libido is generalized into the underlying striving 
which sustains life and animates resolve and con- 
duct. It derives vitality from the deepest phases 



556 



THE DIAL 



[June 8 



of nature, most centrally and richly from the sex 
impulses which preserve the race and set the pat- 
tern for desire. The major argument of the book 
maintains that the symbolism of myth is a racial 
record of the libido, a revelation of the subcon- 
scious workings and the mechanism by which they 
attain expression. A wide sweep of myths and 
cults, fables and traditions, religious beliefs, and 
mystic practices is drawn upon to enforce this 
view. Parallel with this is the interpretation of 
a series of impressions, moments of inspiration 
leading to poetical effusions, on the part of one 
Miss Miller. These, when subjected to the Freud- 
ian interpretation, are held to reflect the same 
type of subconscious emanations of the libido as 
have given rise to the ancient myths. A common 
source in the libido, a common transformation by 
the poetic or mystic symbolism, and consequently 
a common significance, underlies the individual and 
the racial expression. This thread of argument is 
crossed and intertwined with others until an intri- 
cate design results, which the reader will find it 
difficult to follow; for symbolism is a treacherous 
guide to proof; and sympathy, if not preposses- 
sion, is needed to keep one on the trail. The view 
that the dream-thought, the revery, the inspira- 
tion, the emotional impression, the poetic theme, 
is as natural, as intimate a type of thinking as 
the conscious and accredited argument, will find 
assent; but the view that such complex symbol- 
isms are constantly at work, and that the libido, 
however generously interpreted, is ever seething 
and breeding, and through this indirect escape sat- 
isfies its repressed yearnings, is hardly so accept- 
able. That the ''Song of Hiawatha" and the myths 
of Brahma, the Christian mysteries and the classic 
wonder-tales, are likewise products of the Freudian 
activities of the psyche is rather a difficult and 
comprehensive thesis. The courage to maintain it 
and the erudition to carry through the exposition 
are the notable qualities of this remarkable book. 



Notwithstanding that Wordsworth 

"l{ZS? has written the longest autobio- 
graphical poem in the language, to 
read that poem is not really the best way to begin 
acquaintance with its author. As Matthew Arnold 
pointed out long ago, Wordsworth is one of the 
few poets to be seen at his best through judicious 
selections rather than through the whole body of 
his verse, which was written during an industrious 
life of eighty years. The reader who happens to 
make a beginning by way of "The Idiot Boy" or the 
prologue to "Peter Bell" is unlikely to be tempted 
further. Thus a book on "How to Know Words- 
worth" would be not without value at any time; 
but there could scarcely be a happier moment than 
the present for Dr. C. F. Winchester's volume 
with that title. For it is in Wordsworth that the 
Englishman of to-day will find expression of the 
deepest needs of the present hour. Nowhere does 
love of country find loftier utterance than in 
Wordsworth's splendid sonnets; no poet is more 
sure that his countrymen are "sprung of Earth's 
first blood, have titles manifold." The best of 
these sonnets were written one hundred and four- 



teen years ago, at a time when Wordsworth feared 
that the brief security from the peace of Amiens 
was lulling Englishmen into indifference to all 
noble ends; but they embody as ringing a call for 
to-day, toward loftier ideals and a higher national 
life. This is not to say that Wordsworth can ever 
be termed, in any strict sense, a popular poet, a 
fact acknowledged by Dr. Winchester in one of his 
early chapters, where he calls attention to the 
poet's limitations. Wordsworth had little sense 
of the poetic charm of movement or passion; he 
had no voice for love or war, and no great delight 
in beauty for its own sake, apart from its moral 
suggestion; he had a dull ear for the music of 
verse; he lacked utterly any sense of humor. But 
granting all this, and not expecting from Words- 
worth things he cannot give, no other poet finds 
so much of the highest kind of joy in the world. 
No on can drink deeply of his spirit without being 
kindled to a reverent delight that behind all the 
shows of earth and sky is a solemn Power and 
Presence to which our souls are akin. So, while 
Wordsworth's poetry will never speak to the busy 
crowd, it can render a better service than that, 
- it can take us away from "the dreary inter- 
course of daily life," and set us in the solitude of 
nature as in a sanctuary; it can infuse a healthy 
sympathy for the essential virtues of men, how- 
ever homely; it can dilate the soul with thoughts 
as lofty and as pure as the naked open sky. To 
help toward a keener appreciation and a more 
immediate recognition of the real Wordsworthian 
mission is the purpose of Dr. Winchester's book, 
and the author has succeeded admirably both in his 
sympathetic criticism and in his wisely chosen 
citations. 



The mystery of "Patience Worth" has risen to sud- 
" Patience den popularity as a subject of 

Worth." discussion at dinner parties and 

afternoon teas. She is the heroine of a book by 
Mr. Casper S. Yost of St. Louis, where the afore- 
said "Patience Worth" resides in the person of 
Mrs. John H. Curran. "Patience" is the plan- 
chette personality of Mrs. Curran, and in that 
capacity is the author of witty conversation, prose 
tales with a moral, and poetic revelations of more 
than common merit. These writings are for the 
most part in a quaint archaic style suggestive of 
the Elizabethan period of our literature. They 
reflect a strange acquaintance with the customs 
and ways of thinking of a by-gone age, and with 
the manner of expression then current, or a clever 
imitation thereof. And all this wealth of literary 
effusion comes in the form of painful letter-by- 
letter spelling of a ouija board under the manipu- 
lation of Mrs. Curran's sensitive mind. Such 
phrases as the following, taken at random, illus- 
trate the language and the wisdom : " Thee'lt bump 
thy nose to look within the hopper"; "Should 
thee let thy fire to ember I would fain cast fresh 
faggots." Mrs. Curran in everyday life is a cul- 
tivated woman, not professionally literary ; she has 
never been to Europe, makes no pretence to his- 
torical knowledge, and preserves a discreet silence 
as to the source of her inspiration. However one

may view the value of the literary expressions, 
one cannot but be impressed with the wealth and 
readiness of the output. The phenomenon is pre- 
sented rather neutrally, but with the strong impli- 
cation that it is viewed as "a psychic mystery." 
It is certainly a remarkable human document that 
is here put together; and yet it is presumably but 
an unusually rich example of subconscious devel- j 
opment. The data are meagre, and there is a 
curious avoidance of dates, places, and incidents ' 
that might be of evidential value. Much of the 
language is in the nature of studied mannerisms j 
with no claim to authentic correctness. Its devel- j 
opment is slow and gradual, suggestive of pro- 
tracted periods of incubation. The ideas and 
reflections are well within the capacity of a sen- 
sitive and absorbent mind. It is natural, under 
the volume of the evidence, to resort to hypotheses | 
that science knows not of; but the story is just j 
as remarkable if viewed as the manifestation of I 
a rejected aspect of a complex personality that j 
has somehow yielded to or chosen this secretive 
form of expression. There may be a considerable 
number of persons who harbor mute and inglo- 
rious Miltonic aspects of their nature, which await 
only the invitation of a ouija board or other tap- 
ping of the subconsciously repressed storehouse 
to come to the light of day. It would be interesting 
to have a more explicit autobiographic confession 
of the wide-awake personality of Mrs. Curran. 



insect lures ^ r - Louis Rhead's "American Trout- 
for trout and Stream Insects" (Stokes) presents 
trout-angUr*. ^ j^g^ o f studies by an artist- 
angler-entomologist, the difficulty of which can be 
appreciated only by those who have made some 
slight attempts in the same direction. It may be 
regretted that the author's frequent reference to 
''my line of lures" and the mention in connection 
with each plate of "choice flies tied from the 
author's patterns and sold by his agents" make the 
book more suggestive of the sporting goods empor- 
ium than of the stream-side. No one will grudge 
the author any financial returns that may come as 
a result of his labors ; but he might well have made 
this attractive book a pure delight to the sports- 
man, and reserved matters of a commercial savor 
for a catalogue. There is also something of "effici- 
ency" theorizing in the remark that "by the sys- 
tematized method of fishing, success is sure." May 
the system of trout-fishing never be devised of 
which this can truthfully be said! Mr. Rhead's 
contention is that artificial flies should be perfect 
imitations of the natural insects on which trout 
are feeding at the time of the cast. The angler 
who has had the occasional good fortune to- land 
a series of rises on an old fly battered and mutil- 
ated out of all semblance to anything living or 
dead may question whether trout are always such 
expert entomologists as Mr. Jthead believes. Still, 
the theory has at least a show of plausibility; and 
the fascination of trying to copy the natural insect 
will not be greatly lessened by the frank recogni- 
tion that, after all, lures are made for the fisher- 
man as well as for the fish. The studies in colors 
of the prevailing insects for each month are well- 



executed, and the descriptions are clear and 
sensible. Mr. Rhead's observations were appar- 
ently made on eastern streams, but it is probable 
that most of the species will be found over the 
waters of the middle west. The chapter on ama- 
teur fly-dressing contains some useful hints, though 
the list of materials and accessories that the author 
deems necessary is appalling to a man who has 
had much pleasure and some apparent success in 
tying flies from an outfit kept in a single cigar- 
box. The last fifty of the 177 pages of the book 
describe a series of artificial frogs, minnows, etc., 
designed by the author and light enough to be 
handled on a fly-rod. 



victoria Take a baker's dozen blatant ills 
vievfoj woman? f the sweated trades, add to them 
the vagaries of extremists among 
feminists, throw in greed and commercialism, 
infant mortality, prostitution, graft at the polls, 
and the passing of the home for full measure, call 
it feminism, then wonder why your cake is dough: 
and withal you have the mental process revealed 
by Mr. and Mrs. John Martin in their volume on 
"Feminism" (Dodd). First we are given the man's 
point of view. Mr. Martin uses his space- largely 
to show that woman in industry must sacrifice her- 
self, since business will not yield. In Europe, the 
woman of to-day, in factory and field, is giving the 
lie to this argument that she lacks strength to cope 
with industrial conditions; in America humaner 
labor laws prevail because of woman, and if these 
can be extended to protect the laboring man as 
well, her sacrifice, though tremendous, will not be 
vain. Mrs. Martin attempts a strong plea for a full 
expression of woman's womanliness. She plans to 
establish a Utopian domestic guild to remove the 
"stigma attaching to the servant's calling"; for 
the unmarried mother, society should provide the 
"offer of secrecy that the shame of exposure might 
not be made the price for human care"; woman, 
she warns, must never forget that her true place 
is "the HOME" (sic). How smug it all is! No true 
feminist will deny that woman's place is the home. 
What they aver is that no amount of capital let- 
ters will dignify that home so long as she makes it 
a place to sit in judgment on those less fortunate 
than she. Other things being equal, one may find 
the finest type of womanhood among those who 
obey the call of domesticity or motherhood, though 
placed by circumstances outside their own home or 
the pale of matrimony. To refer, in lump, to the 
stigma of the one or the shame of the other is 
crassly ante-diluvian, or pre- Victorian at least. 
Both authors, in taking feminism far too seriously, 
ignore two things: just now woman is bent on 
adventure, and she is demanding liberty. She 
wants suffrage and political freedom as a recog- 
nized inherent right, not as something man may 
grudgingly give. She has a huge wonder, a legit- 
imate curiosity, about the world man's world, for 
which she is expected to train her children to be- 
come useful citizens. As a sex, she is in the awk- 
ward age, but there is not half the danger the 
Martins anticipate that her pranks are going to 
capsize the boat.

Belgian 
tributes to 
Britain. 



The great majority of the books 
written about the war prove how the 
belligerents can hate, but there is 
at least one which shows how they can love. "A 
Book of Belgium's Gratitude" (Lane) is at once 
the record of the great-hearted generosity of the 
British Empire toward its martyred guests, and of 
the gratitude of the sufferers. The volume, beauti- 
fully illustrated with English scenes viewed through 
the eyes of Belgian artists, contains (in French 
and in English) contributions from prominent 
Belgians in all spheres of activity. After the 
reproduction of autograph letters from the royal 
family, contributions by ministers of state and 
other personages high in authority describe the 
different phases of the relief movement in which 
every part of the Empire has eagerly shared. 
Artists, musicians, professors, and men of letters, 
including Maeterlinck, Verhaeren, and Cammaerts, 
offer striking tributes to the welcome extended to 
them. The gratitude of the humble is shown in 
the numerous anecdotes sometimes humorous, 
more often pathetic which add much to the vivid- 
ness and sincerity of the book. Then there are 
occasional letters, straight from the trenches. In 
one a soldier on the Yser, who lays no claim to 
book-learning, addresses his benefactress as "tu" 
and "vous" in the same sentence. Doubtless he was 
constantly interrupted by speaking to comrades. 
There is but one poem, that entitled "To 
England," written by Fernand Severin. The first 
stanza gives the spirit of the whole collection : 
Nous etions sans appui: tu nous as secourus, 
Nous 6tions las, meurtris, saignants, bien qu 'invaineus : 
Tes soins ont adouci notre fiere detresse. 
Tu nous as fait benir, a force de tendresse, 
Ce que 1'heure presente avait pour nous d'amer. 



. Few men in American science have 

An American ,. , ~ __ 

anthropologist, deserved greater credit than Dr. W 
J McGee. Without the advantage 
or prestige of a college training, he entered the 
field of professional science as an original investi- 
gator, and gained an enviable place and name. His 
earlier work upon the geology of northeastern 
Iowa, where he was born and reared, was of such 
quality as to bring him into relations with the 
United States Geological Survey. He won the 
respect and strong personal affection of the Director 
of the Survey, Major John W. Powell, who came to 
depend greatly upon him. Dr. McGee's most 
important scientific work was done in connection 
with the Survey. Major Powell's last years were 
largely given to the Bureau of American Ethnology, 
and here too he associated Dr. McGee with himself 
and at his death left Dr. McGee the Acting-Chief 
of the organization. Not the least important scien- 
tific service of Dr. McGee was in connection with 
the department of Anthropology at the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition, where he had opportunity for 
the presentation of some of his most original ideas. 
Later, he became associated with the Deep 
Waterways Commission, to which his full energy 
was being given when death took him. A man of 
force, originality, and ideas, Dr. McGee deserves 
a monumental biography. The "Life" by his sister, 



Emma R. McGee, now privately printed, cannot 
claim to be such, and is far from giving a satis- 
factory presentation of Dr. McGee's career; it 
gives little detail concerning his actual work. 
Two-thirds of the book is taken up with extracts 
from his writings. While these are interesting in 
themselves and in the glimpse they give us of the 
author, they occupy space that might have been 
better used for a fuller life story. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Without condensation of the text, a new edition 
of Professor John Spencer Bassett's "Life of 
Andrew Jackson" has been issued in one volume 
by the Macmillan Co. Distinctive features of the 
work were commented upon in these columns 
(June 16, 1912) when the biography first ap- 
peared, and it now gains in value by the general 
revision to which it has been subjected. 

Unlike most publications of the sort, Miss 
Virginia Robie's "Historic Styles in Furniture" 
(Houghton), a volume which first appeared ten 
years ago and is now reissued in less expensive 
form, deals with the subject in its broader aspects, 
in its relation to background and setting. 
Delightful glimpses of social life of the periods 
dealt with make the account informal, without the 
sacrifice of sufficient technical details to meet the 
needs of the general reader. 

"The Haitian Revolution, 1791 to 1804," by Mr. 
T. G. Steward, is now reissued in a second edition 
(Crowell). Enthusiasm for his subject and a per- 
sonal knowledge of present-day life on the island 
help the author in his endeavor, as he suggests in 
the Introduction, to present "touches of genius in 
character, and here and there glimpses of moral 
grandeur in action." A list of authorities consulted, 
a chart of the presidents of Haiti with their terms 
of office, a classified list of Haitian authors with 
names of their works, and an appendix containing 
Thiers's Exposition of the Revolution are useful 
features of the volume. 

Despite the melancholy interest that must at- 
tach at this time to a reprint of The Hague con- 
ventions and declarations of 1899 and 1907, it is 
well to be reminded that modern civilization was 
at least capable of formulating such a code, even 
though it could not maintain it. The large volume 
which Dr. James Brown Scott has edited for the 
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and 
which the Oxford University Press publishes, con- 
tains the complete text of these two declarations, 
with tables of signatures, ratifications and adhe- 
sions of the various powers, and texts of reserva- 
tions. An exhaustive "Index-Digest" to all of this 
material is a feature of great value. 

A service of no little importance to American 
students of economics has been performed by 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. in publishing a new 
translation of Gide and Rist's "History of Eco- 
nomic Doctrines," made from the second revised 
and augmented edition of 1913 under the direc- 
tion of the late William Smart by Dr. R. Richards.

The work has long been known as probably the 
best foreign contribution on the subject, indeed, 
no English writer has yet covered the same ground 
with equal thoroughness and success. Its unique 
value lies in the fact that it gives us "something 
like a true perspective of certain modern theories 
by connecting them with their, historical antece- 
dents." The translator's work is of excellent qual- 
ity, and the wealth of detail in the volume is made 
completely available for reference purposes by a 
full index. 

The beauty and variety of our spring wild flow- 
ers fully entitle them to the distinctive treatment 
which Miss Harriet L. Keeler has accorded them 
in her pocket volume, "Our Early Wild Flowers" 
(Scribner). Something like one hundred and 
thirty plants are described, including all that are 
habitually in bloom during March, April, and May 
in the northern states. In addition to careful 
descriptions and general comments, practically 
every plant dealt with is illustrated, eight in 
exceptionally good water-color plates by Miss 
Eloise P. Luquer, twelve in full-page reproduc- 
tions from photographs, and the rest in pen-and- 
ink text drawings. The little book should prove 
an indispensable companion for the nature-lover 
in his spring rambles. 

On the theory that a little learning is a danger- 
ous thing, the " A-B-C books" projected by Messrs. 
Harper should be set down as among the most 
iconoclastic ventures of the publishing season. An 
examination, however, of those at hand belies the 
supposition, and we recommend each in its field, 
both for the simple manner in which facts are 
presented and for the definite way in which it lures 
the interested reader to make a practical test of 
its principles. The following volumes have been 
published: "A-B-C of Correct Speech," by Mrs. 
Florence Howe Hall; "A-B-C of Vegetable Gar- 
dening," by Mr. Eben E. Rexford; "A-B-C of 
Golf," by Mr. John Duncan Dunn; "A-B-C of 
Automobile Driving," by Mr. A. Hyatt Verrill; 
"A-B-C of Motion Pictures," by Mr. Robert E. 
Walsh; and "A-B-C of Cooking," by Mrs. Chris- 
tine Terhune Herrick. 

To the already innumerable illustrated editions 
of Omar Khayyam must now be added a quarto 
volume privately printed and published by Messrs. 
Galloway & Porter, of Cambridge, England, the 
particular distinction of which is that it is the 
work of a Persian artist, Mera Ben Kavas Sett. 
"It is original," says the artist, "as much as a 
thorough acquaintance of Persian literature and 
thoughts can render it." No one is likely to dis- 
pute this claim of originality, whatever else may 
be thought of the book. Indeed, so exotic and 
weirdly unconventional is the artist's work that 
one is almost at a loss to judge of its artistic qual- 
ity. The treatment is largely symbolic, and there- 
fore is a welcome relief from the customary 
pictorial style of Omar illustrators. Then, too, the 
artist has not been afraid to express the spirit of 
frank sensuousness that is inherent in the quat- 
rains. On these accounts the edition is to be 
welcomed, and collectors of Omar literature should 
add it to their shelves. The edition is, we believe, 
limited to 250 copies. 



NOTES AXD 



A volume of short stories by Mr. William J. 
Locke will soon be issued under the title, "Fara-

the title "Nearing Jordan," will be published 
before the end of the present month. 

"The Sins of the Children," Mr. Cosmo Hamil- 
ton's forthcoming novel of American family life 
and of temptation as it is met to-day, is announced 
for issue early in the autumn by Messrs. Little, 
Brown & Co. 

Two little books dealing with the broader 
aspects of the immigration problem, which the

volumes, containing three plays and sixty odd 
sonnets; and "Ephemera," Greek prose poems by

Mr. Hutton Webster's "Rest Days" is announced 
for immediate issue by the Macmillan Co. It out- 
lines the origin and development of the Hebrew

ing to rest days in all parts of the world and inter- 
preted from an anthropological standpoint. 

Mr. H. G. Wells has just completed a novel 
entitled "Mr. Britling Sees It Through," wkich 
will appear as a serial in the London "Nation" 
prior to book publication. The story describes 
Great Britain before the war, and shows how the

[June 8 



conflict has affected the spirit and character of the 
nation. 

Among other volumes which Messrs. Harper 
announce for publication in the autumn are the 
following: "The World for Sale," by Sir Gilbert 
Parker; "The Rising Tide," by Mrs. Margaret 
Deland; "Rainbow's End," by Mr. Rex Beach, 
and "The Thirteenth Commandment," by Mr. 
Rupert Hughes. 

Lord Cromer has a third series of "Political and 
Literary Essays" in preparation with Messrs. 
Macmillan, dealing for the greater part with mat- 
ters connected directly or indirectly with the war. 
The literary essays include a review of Sir Sidney 
Lee's "Life of Shakespeare," and a paper on Lord 
Curzon's "War Poems." 

Some time ago it was announced that the pub- 
lication of the second volume of Maxim Gorky's 
autobiography would be indefinitely postponed, 
owing to the fact that the English translation and 
printed sheets of the book were interned in Berlin 
for the duration of the war. But word has now 
been received that the work is running serially in 
a Russian magazine, and a fresh translation may 
be undertaken immediately. It will be called "In 
the World," and, like the first instalment, "My 
Childhood," will be published by the Century Co.

The f Why"and 



''Wherefore 99 of 




YOUR doctor wiD tell you that 
the vital food for the building 
of tissue for body growth and 
repair is protein, or albumen. And 
he'll also tell you that since organic 
phosphorus is a prime food-necessity 
of the nervous system it is logical 
that a good nerve-tonic contain this 
element. 

By carrying just these elements to 
the places where they are vitally es- 
sential Sanatogen exerts an immedi- 
ate effect both in rebuilding and rein- 
vigorating. For Sanatogen is albu- 
men and organicphosphorus,"so com- 
bined," as Prof. T. B. Stillman, the 
famous analytical chemist, writes, 
''that digestion and assimilation is 
rendered complete with the greatest 



How successful it has been in this 
work one can judge from the thou- 
sands of letters that have come from 
those whom Sanatogen has helped. 
More than 21,000 physicians have 
written of these results as actually 
observed. Whether the effect was 
to enrich the blood, to tone up a 
run-down nervous system, to better 
digestion or to increase weight, the 
keynote was ever the same : Sanato- 
gen strengthens the fundamental 
sources of body strength and vigor. 

And thus you can feel confident 
that Sanatogen can help you, 

CoL Henry Watterson writes : 

"I could not have recovered my -vitality, 
as I have done, without Sanatogen oper- 
ating equally on the digestive organs and 
nerve centers.**

ADDRESSES ON 

International Subjects 

By ELIHU ROOT 

8vo. Cloth. 500 pages. $2.00 

A collection of addresses and papers dealing with 
foreign affairs. The volume is the first of a series 
of books presenting Mr. Root's lectures, his 
speeches, formal and informal, and the state papers 
written in the performance of his duties as an 
executive officer of the United States. These latter 
include his reports as Secretary of War, his instruc- 
tions as Secretary of State to the American dele- 
gates to the Second Hague Peace Conference, and 
certain of his more important diplomatic notes. 

The various addresses which have been selected 
for publication have been classified in such a way 
that each volume will include as nearly as possible 
those related by a common purpose and illustrative 
of each phase of Mr. Root's activity, thus enabling 
the reader to form a clear-cut and accurate opinion 
as to his achievements in each field. 

The titles of the other volumes now in press are 
as follows: 

Government, Citizenship, and Legal Procedure. 

Central and South America and the United States. 

The Military and Colonial Policy of the United 
States. 

The North Atlantic Fisheries Arbitration. 

Political, Historical, and Commemorative Ad- 
dresses.
