D. APPLETON & Co:s NEW BOOKS. 



Climbing in the Himalayas. 

By WILLIAM MARTIN CONWAY, M.A.-, F.R.G.S., Vice- 
President of the Alpine Club; formerly Professor of 
Art in University College, Liverpool. With 300 Illus- 
trations, by A. D. McCoRMiCK, and a Map. 8vo, 
cloth, $10.00. 

This work contains a minute record of one of the most im- 
portant and thrilling 1 geographical enterprises of the century 
an expedition made in 18!)2, under the auspices of the Royal 
Geographical Society, the Royal Society, the British Associa- 
tion, and the Government of India. It included an explora- 
tion of the glaciers at the head of the Bagrot Valley and the 
great peaks in the neighborhood of Rakipushi (25,500 feet) ; 
an expedition to Hispar, at the foot of the longest glacier in 
the world outside the polar regions ; the first definitely re- 
corded passage of the Hispar Pass, the longest known pass in 
the world ; and the ascent of Pioneer Peak (about 23,000 feet), 
the highest ascent yet authentically made. No better man 
coulfl have been chosen for this important expedition than 
Mr. Conway, who has spent over twenty years in mountain- 
eering work in the Alps. Already the author of nine pub- 
lished books, he has recorded his discoveries in this volume 
in the clear, incisive, and thrilling language of an expert. 

General Washington. 

By General BRADLEY T. JOHNSON. A new volume in 

the " Great Commanders " Series, edited by Gen. 

JAMES GRANT WILSON. With Portrait and Maps. 

12mo, cloth, gilt top, 81.50. 

A Virginian, appreciating the history and spirit of his State, 
the author has approached the career of the greatest of Vir- 
ginians with a comprehension of his hero's personality which 
has been denied to some who have been unfamiliar with the 
latter's environments. He deals with Washington as a soldier, 
but his sympathetic attitude renders it easier to understand 
Washington the man. On the military side General Johnson 
will be found a most competent biographer and well-equipped 
critic, and his presentation of this phase of Washington's ca- 
reer will be fresh in some respects, and of constant value. 

The Claims of Christianity. 

By WILLIAM SAMUEL LILLY, Honorary Fellow of 
Peterhouse, Cambridge; author of "The Great Enig- 
ma," etc. 8vo, cloth, $3.50. 

The author takes what might be termed the publicist's 
point of view, and deals with Christianity as a fact in the 
world's history. He discusses the claims of Buddhism and 
Islam, and after a masterly analysis of the development of 
Christianity and the Church, he maintains the necessity of 
organized spiritual power to vindicate the rights of conscience, 
especially in our age, when the tendency is to strengthen the 
state against the individual. Mr. Lilly's historical analysis 
and incisive discussion of the vital questions of the day form 
a most timely and suggestive volume. 

Acting and Actors; 

Elocution and Elocutionists. A Book about Theatre 
Folk and Theatre Art. By ALFRED AYRES, author 
of The Orthoepist," " The Verbalist," etc. With 
Preface by HARRISON GREY FISKE; Introduction by 
EDGAR S. WERNER; Prologue by JAMES A. WAL- 
DRON. 16mo, cloth, $1.25. 

" A book which has exceeding interest. The author talks in a very 
agreeable and instructive way about the art of acting, and while his 
book has a peculiar charm for those who sit in the orchestra chairs, it 
has a special value for the ladies and gentlemen on the stage." New 
York Herald. 



Classical Dictionary 

Of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology, and Geog- 
raphy. Based on the Larger Dictionaries, by the 
late Sir WILLIAM SMITH, D.C.L., LL.D. Revised 
throughout, and in part rewritten, by G. E. MARINDIN, 
M.A., formerly Fellow of Kings College, Cambridge. 
With numerous Maps and Illustrations. 1019 pages. 
8vo, half morocco, $G.OO. 

The design of this revised edition is much the same as 
that of the older work. Since the publication of the latter, 
so much additional knowledge has been acquired in most 
branches of classical study that it has been found necessary 
to practically rewrite many of the articles. Sir William Smith 
constantly directed the revision up to the time of his death, 
his supervision extending over all but the last part of the book. 

Man's Place in Nature. 

By THOMAS H. HUXLEY. The seventh volume of the 
author's Collected Essays. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

CONTENTS : On the Natural History of the Manlike Apes. 
On the Relations of Man to the Lower Animals. On some 
Fossil Remains of Man. On the Methods and Results of 
Ethnology. On some Fixed Points in British Ethnology. On 
the Aryan Question.

ENGLISH IN THE LOWER SCHOOLS. 

The recent agitation in behalf of better in- 
struction in elementary English, now so prom- 
inent a feature of educational discussion, may 
almost be said to date from the publication, a 
year or two ago, of the famous Harvard Re- 
port on Composition and Rhetoric. That Re- 
port, at least, gave to the reform movement its 
strongest impulse, and made a burning " ques- 
tion of the day " out of a matter previously little 
more than academic in its interest. The sub- 
ject reached a larger public than it had ever 



addressed before, and this new and wider pub- 
lic was fairly startled out of its self-complacency 
by the exhibit made of the sort of English writ- 
ten by young men and women supposed to 
have enjoyed the best preparatory educational 
advantages, and to be fitted for entrance into 
the oldest and most dignified of our colleges. 
The Report was more than a discussion of the 
evils of bad training ; it was an object-lesson 
of the most effective sort, for it printed many 
specimen papers literatim et verbatim, and was 
even cruel enough to facsimile some of them 
by photographic process. 

The seed of discontent having thus been 
sown broadcast, the field was in a measure pre- 
pared for the labors of the English Conference 
named by the Committee of Ten ; and the re- 
port of that Conference, made public at the 
beginning of the present year, has kept the 
question of English teaching as burning as 
ever, if, indeed, it has not fanned the flame 
into greater heat. Not only the educational 
periodicals, but also many published in the in- 
terests of general culture, and even some of 
the newspapers in their blundering way 
have kept the subject before the public. Edu- 
cational gatherings have devoted to it much of 
their attention, and it has been taken up by 
the pamphleteers, notably by Professors Gay- 
ley and Bradley of the University of Califor- 
nia, whose "English in the Secondary Schools " 
we take pleasure in commending as both prac- 
tical and sane. 

The English Conference of which mention 
has been made, although appointed to investi- 
gate secondary education only, soon found that 
the subject of English is a unity, and felt 
obliged to make its recommendations apply to 
the whole course of training below the college 
to the work of twelve years instead of four. 
The recommendations made for the first eight 
years we.re substantially as follows : For the 
first two years, elementary story-telling and 
the description of objects ; for the next four, 
the use of reading-books, the beginnings of 
written composition, and a certain amount of 
informal grammar ; for the last two years, for- 
mal grammar and reading of a distinctly liter- 
ary sort. The " speller " is to be discarded 
altogether, and the " reader " after the sixth 
year. We wish, indeed, that the Conference 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



had gone still farther in the latter case and re- 
jected the " reader " altogether. The impor- 
tant principle seems to be that nothing but lit- 
erature should be read at all, and the "readers " 
in current use certainly contain much matter 
that cannot by any courtesy be called litera- 
ture. This criticism is altogether apart from 
the other defect of scrappiness, inherent in 
the plan of the typical reading-book. Even 
" Mother Goose," as Mr. Horace Scudder has 
convincingly argued, is a sort of literature, and 
there is no lack of other substitutes for the 
thin and innutritions pabulum of the graded 
(we were on the point of saying degraded) 
books called " readers " which enterprising pub- 
lishers have forced upon several generations of 
over-complacent school authorities. The sug- 
gestion that, as far as possible, complete works 
should be studied, is of fundamental impor- 
tance, and should have been given greater em- 
phasis. The following recommendation is ad- 
mirable : 

" Due attention should be paid to what are sometimes 
thoughtlessly regarded as points of pedantic detail, such 
as the elucidation of involved sentences, the expansion 
of metaphors into similes and the compression of similes 
into metaphors, the tracing of historical and other ref- 
erences, and a study of the denotation and connotation 
of single words. Such details are necessary if the pu- 
pil is to be brought to anything but the vaguest under- 
standing of what he reads, and there is no danger that 
an intelligent teacher will allow himself to be dominated 
by them. It should not be forgotten that in these early 
years of his training the pupil is forming habits of read- 
ing and of thought which will either aid him for the 
rest of his life, or of which he will by-and-by have to 
cure himself with painful effort." 

Upon the proportion of time to be allotted 
English in the first eight years, no definite pro- 
nouncement is made ; but it should be greater 
rather than less than the share of attention given 
to the subject during the high-school years. This 
share, in the opinion of the Conference, should 
be a full fourth of the time throughout the four 
years of work, and of this share literature 
proper should get rather more than half, the 
rest being given to composition, rhetoric, and 
grammar of the historical or systematic sort. 
The demand for a full fourth of the secondary 
school period does not seem to us excessive, and 
other reforms may well wait until the justice 
of this claim becomes generally admitted. 
Given such a recognition of the importance of 
secondary English, the accomplishment of its 
educational purpose must follow from insist- 
ence upon a few simple and well-understood 
principles rather than from any new devices or 
startling innovations of method. The Confer- 



ence rightly emphasized the fundamental im- 
portance of requiring good English in all 
school work, whether written or oral. As long 
as slovenly composition is allowed to pass un- 
censured in mathematical or natural science ex- 
ercises, as long as slovenly speech is tolerated 
in class translations from foreign languages, the 
case remains hopeless. This is the root of the 
matter, and other reforms are of minor import- 
ance. Theme-writing in the English classes 
is useful, but written exercises in all the classes 
must be treated as themes, and bad English in 
a mathematical paper must count against it no 
less than bad logic. Teachers should also avail 
themselves to the utmost of the invaluable com- 
parative advantages offered by the study of 
whatever ancient or modern languages are be- 
ing pursued at the same time by the English 
student. The Conference was wholly right in 
asserting that " the best results in the teaching 
of English in high schools cannot be secured 
without the aid given by the study of some 
other language." 

As for the study of English literature in sec- 
ondary schools, we are firmly convinced that a 
historical text-book of the subject should be in 
the hands of every student, and that he should 
frequently recur to it for the proper correla- 
tion of groups and the chronological develop- 
ment of schools and forms. Such a book should 
be used sparingly, and for certain purposes 
only ; not, for example, as a storehouse of cut- 
and-dried critical estimates. There has been 
of late a marked tendency to get along with the 
study of typical works of the great periods, just 
as in biology there has been a tendency to con- 
fine the work to study of a few typical forms. 
But the average student, left to his own devices, 
will not master the classification, in the one case, 
or the chronology, in the other ; and without 
the indispensable framework of bare fact, his 
special studies will fail to come into proper re- 
lation with each other, and will lose much of 
their significance. 

The greater part of the work done in English 
literature must of course consist in reading as 
many whole pieces of literature as it is possible 
to crowd into the time allotted. Since no two 
classes can be alike, and no two teachers ought 
to be alike, there is no greater mistake than 
the arrangement of a Procrustean course, to be 
followed by all, and repeated year after year. 
Whether the annual divisions of the high-school 
work be based upon literary periods or literary 
forms, or graded according to difficulty of sub- 
ject-matter, there should be within each year's

THE DIAL 



work an almost unbounded latitude for the dis- 
play of the teacher's individuality. He should 
be free to read as much as he chooses, and what 
he chooses, and in whatever way he chooses. 
To impose rigid methods upon the secondary 
teacher, or to select for him the texts which 
he shall study with his classes, is an act of sheer 
and utterly unjustifiable arrogance. 

To sum up, we are inclined to think that the 
problem of secondary education in English re- 
duces itself to getting teachers who know good 
literature and care for it, and minimizing to the 
utmost the restrictions placed upon their work. 
Duplication of work in different years must be 
avoided, but beyond the limits set with this ob- 
ject in view there should be no effort made to 
secure uniformity, both because every attempt 
to secure it costs something in vitality, and be- 
cause there is no good reason for uniformity 
anyway. Our suggestions doubtless seem tame 
in comparison with the brilliant new departures 
here and there noisily heralded, but radical re- 
constructions appear to us no less suspicious in 
the body educational than in the body politic. 
It will be time to seek for the "new thing" when 
we have done all that is possible with the old. 



ENGLISH AT INDIANA UNIVERSITY* 

A year ago the English department of the Uni- 
versity of Indiana was completely reorganized, and 
four men a professor, an associate professor, and 
two instructors were appointed to carry on the 
work. The present course is our attempt to meet 
existing conditions. Each department must offer 
a full course of study leading to the bachelor's de- 
gree. Our students graduate in Greek, in Mathe- 
matics, in Sociology, in English, or in any one of 
the dozen other departments, with the uniform de- 
gree of A.B. About a third of the student's time 
is given to required studies, a third to the special 
work of the chosen department, and a third to elect- 
ive studies. The department of English, then, is 
required to offer a four years' course of five hours a

week ; as a matter of fact, it offers considerably more. 

The English courses fall into three distinct nat- 
ural groups language, composition, and literature, 
in each of which work may be pursued for four 
or more years. One year of this work is required 
of all students ; the rest is elective. With two ex- 
ceptions, all our courses run throughout the year. 

The linguistic work is under the charge of Asso- 
ciate Professor Davidson. The elementary courses 
are a beginning class in Old English prose, and one 
in the history of the language. Then follow a course 
in Chaucer, the Mystery Plays, and Middle English 
romances and lyrics ; an advanced course in Old 
English poetry, including a seminary study of Bgo- 
wulf ; the history of Old and Middle English liter- 
ature ; and a course in historical English grammar, 
which makes a special examination of forms and 
constructions in modern prose. In these classes the 
intention is to lead the student into independent in- 
vestigation as soon as he is prepared for it. 

In composition, the work is as completely prac- 
tical as we can make it. Writing is learned by 
writing papers, each one of which is corrected and 
rewritten. There are no recitations in " rhetoric." 
The bugbear known generally in our colleges as 
Freshman English is now a part of our entrance re- 
quirement, and university instruction in composition 
begins with those fortunate students who have some 
little control of their native language when a pen is 
between their fingers. We are still obliged, how- 
ever, to supply instruction to students conditioned 
in entrance English, and the conditioned classes 
make the heaviest drain upon the instructors' time. 
The first regular class receives students who write 
clearly and can compose good paragraphs. The sub- 
jects of the year's work are narration, description, 
exposition. In the next year's class, an attempt is 
made to stimulate original production in prose and 
verse. A certain amount of criticism upon contem- 
porary writing enters into this course, the object 
being to point out what is good in (for example) 
current magazines and reviews, and thus to hold 
before the student an ideal not altogether impos- 
sible of attainment. A young writer confronted 
with the virtues and defects of Macaulay and De 
Quincey is likelier to be discouraged or made indif- 
ferent, than inspired, as far as his own style is con- 
cerned. If he is shown wherein a " Brief " in THE 
DIAL is better than his own review of the book, he 
is in a fair way to improve. And so with sketches, 
stories, and even poems. Of course current maga- 
zine writing is not held up as ideal literature ; nor, on 
the other hand, is the production of literature deemed 
a possible part of college study. The work in this 
branch of English is rounded off by a class for stu- 
dents who intend to teach composition. The theory 
of rhetoric is studied, and something of its history ; 
school texts in rhetoric are examined ; and finally the ' 
class learns the first steps in teaching by taking 
charge of elementary classes. 

In the literary courses the required work comes 
first. Many students take no more English than these

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



prescribed three terms of five hours a week ; many 
others continue the study ; and the problem has 
been to arrange the course so as to create in the 
former class the habit of careful and sympathetic 
reading, and at the same time to give the latter 
class a safe foundation for future work. The plan 
is to read in the class, with the greatest attention 
to detail, one or more characteristic works of the 
authors chosen (Scott, Shakespeare, Thackeray, 
George Eliot), and to require as outside work a 
good deal of rapid collateral reading. This class 
and most of the composition classes are conducted 
by Mr. Sembower and Mr. Harris, who will be as- 
sisted during the coming year by one or two addi- 
tional instructors. 

The course in English prose style begins in the 
second year, and follows the method of the late 
Professor Minto. Macaulay, De Quincey, Carlyle, 
Ruskin, and Arnold are the writers taken up. 
A course in American authors finds here a place. 
Then comes a course in poetry : Coleridge, Words- 
worth, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, Browning. 
Complete editions of all the poets, except the last, 
are used, and the year's work is meant to serve as 
an introduction to the critical reading of poetry. A 
separate course of one term in metrics accompanies 
the poetry course. In the drama there is a full 
course in Shakespeare and other Elizabethans (which 
presupposes the first year's work in Shakespeare), 
and also a course in classical drama, Greek and 
French, studied in translation. The dramatic courses 
begin with a discussion of Professor Moulton's 
books on Shakespeare, and on the Greek drama, 
and then take up independent study of as many 
plays as possible. The last regular course is the 
literary seminary, which during the coming year 
will investigate, as far as the library will allow, the 
rise of romantic poetry in England. Special re- 
search courses are arranged for students who wish 
to pursue their English studies. It may be added 
that in order to graduate in English, work must be 
taken in each of the three groups of the department. 

It has been my effort, naturally, to arrange the 
courses in a logical order, advancing from the 
simple to the more difficult, and covering as wide 
a range as is consistent with thoroughness ; this lat- 
ter quality being an ideal kept always in view 
would we might say as confidently, in reach. And 
as to the method of conducting classes, each in- 
structor teaches as he pleases ; any man's best 
method is the one that appeals to him at the time. 

And now, as to that vexed question : How shall 
literature be taught ? Class-room methods vary in 
the department, but our ultimate object is the same. 
The aim, then, in teaching literature is, I think, to 
give the student a thorough understanding of what 
he reads, and the ability to read sympathetically 
and understandingly in the future. If we use the 
phrase " to read intelligently," we name the object 
of every instructor's teaching. But in the defini- 
tion of this ideal we come upon so many differences 
of opinion that in reality it means not one thing 



but a thousand. To touch upon a few obsolescent 
notions, to one teacher it meant to fill the student 
full of biography and literary history; to another 
it meant to put the student in possession of what 
the best critics, or the worst ones, had said about 
the artist and his work ; to another it meant mak- 
ing a pother over numberless petty details of the 
text (a species of literary parsing) ; to another it 
meant harping on the moral purposes of the poet 
or novelist ; anything, in short, except placing the 
student face to face with the work itself and acting 
as his spectacles when his eyesight was blurred. 

The negations of all these theories have become 
the commonplaces of -day, truisms among a cer- 
tain class of teachers. To repeat those principles 
that have thus become truisms of theory (not yet 
of practice the difference is profound), we have 
first the truth that the study of literature means the 
study of literature, not of biography nor of literary 
history (incidentally of vast importance), not of 
grammar, not of etymology, not of anything except 
the works themselves, viewed as their creators wrote 
them, viewed as art, as transcripts of humanity, 
not as logic, not as psychology, not as ethics. 

The second point is that we are concerned with 
the study of literature. And here is the parting of 
the ways. Granting we concern ourselves with pure 
literature only, just how shall we concern ourselves 
with it ? There are many methods, but these methods 
are of two kinds only : the method of the professor 
who preaches the beauty of the poet's utterance, 
and the method of him who makes his student sys- 
tematically approach the work as a work of art, 
find out the laws of its existence as such, the mode 
of its manifestation, the meaning it has, and the sig- 
nificance of that meaning, in brief, to have his 
students interpret the work of art and ascertain 
what makes it just that and not something else. 
Literature, as every reader profoundly feels, is an 
appeal to all sides of our nature ; but I venture to 
insist that as a study and this is the point at issue 
it must be approached intellectually. And here 
the purpose of literature, and the purpose of study- 
ing literature, must be sharply discriminated. The 
question is not, Apprehending literature, how shall 
I let it influence me ? The question most definitely 
is, How shall I learn to apprehend literature, that 
thereby it may influence me? 

As far as class study is concerned, the instructors 
must draw the line once for all between the liking 
for reading and the understanding of literature. 
To all who assert that the study of literature must 
take into account the emotions, that it must remem- 
ber questions of taste, I can only answer impatiently, 
Yes, I agree ; but between taking them into account, 
and making them the prime object of the study, 
there is the difference between day and night. It 
is only by recognizing this difference that we pro- 
fessors of English cease to make ourselves ridicu- 
lous in the eyes of those who see into the heart of 
things, that we can at all successfully disprove 
Freeman's remark caustic and four-fifths true 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



" English Literature is only chatter about Shelley." 
As a friend of mine puts it : To understand litera- 
ture is a matter of study, and may be taught in the 
class-room ; to love literature is a matter of char- 
acter, and can never be taught in a class-room. The 
professor who tries chiefly to make his students love 
literature wastes his energy for the sake of a few 
students who would love poetry anyway, and sacri- 
fices the majority of his class, who are not yet ripe 
enough to love it. The professor who tries chiefly 
to make his students understand literature will give 
them something to incorporate into their characters. 
For it is the peculiar grace of literature that whoso 
understands it loves it. It becomes to him a per- 
manent possession, not a passing thrill. 

To revert to our University work in English, we 
have been confronted with a peculiar local condi- 
tion. Sometime ago, Professor Hale wrote to THE 
DIAL that the students of Iowa University had lit- 
tle feeling for style. That is true of the Indiana 
students I have met. But the lowans, it was my 
experience, were willing to study style and develop 
their latent feeling. Widespread in Indiana, how- 
ever, I find the firm conviction that style is un- 
worthy serious consideration. A poem is simply so 
much thought; its "form-side," to use a favorite 
student expression, ought to be ignored. And of 
the thought, only the ethical bearing of it is signifi- 
cant. Poetry is merely a question of morals, and 
beauty has no excuse for being. The plan of pro- 
cedure is : believe unyieldingly in a certain philos- 
ophy of life ; take a poem and read that philosophy 
into it. This is the "thought-side" of literature. 
Our first year has been largely an attempt to set 
up other aims than these.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



CONTEMPORAKY ITALIAN NOVELISTS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I was surprised to read in the leading article of your 
issue for June 16 the following sentence: " It is a little 
curious that Italy, from whom we have reason to ex- 
pect much, should have no contemporary writer of fic- 
tion deserving mention here." 

I fear that the writer is acquainted only with such 
Italian novels as have been translated into English. If 
he were a student of contemporary Italian literature he 
could hardly have made such a statement. In point of 
fact, Italy now has a school of novelists that is not sur- 
passed by that of any other country. While their state 
of society is very similar to the French and their plots 
are necessarily of the same somewhat objectionable 
character, and while they are fully as realistic, yet some- 
thing of the spirit of Dante and Petrarch, something of 
the idealization of love even in its guiltiest forms, still 
clings to their souls, and saves them from the cynicism 
of the French; so that they may well be placed above 
the contemporary French school. 

Every dog has its day. A few years ago it was the 



Russian dog; now it is the Spanish; and when people 
get tired of that, the Italian will doubtless have its turn, 
and everybody will be raving about Italian books which 
are now passed over unnoticed. 

To mention the able Italian novels of to-day would 
take too long. I may say, though, that I know of no 
contemporary French novel equal to Fogazzaro's " Dan- 
iele Cortis," the story of the struggle of two noble souls 
against a guilty love, a struggle in which they came out 
victors. It is said that Fogazzaro has been the recipient 
of very many letters from men and women thanking him 
for saving them in the hour of temptation, and that one 
famous Italian beauty who died rather than yield to a 
guilty passion had the book placed in her coffin. 

Then, to go to the other extreme, I know of no French 
novel equal in its way to that marvellous, perverse, and 
perverting book, " L' Innocente," by Gabriele d'Annun- 
zio. It is probably impossible to find in any language 
a study of morbid psychology that will compare with it. 
Those sentimentalists who think that the infidelity of 
the husband is as blamable as that of the wife should 
read this awful book. The writer, a very young man, 
is perhaps the most highly gifted of living authors. 

It is probably safe to say that the writer of your ar- 
ticle has never read Rovetta's " Mater Dolorosa," Mem- 
ini's "Marchesa d'Arcello," Roberti's "L* Illusione," 
Gentile's "II Peccato,"or Sperani's "Numeri e Sogni," 
or he would have written differently. n. jj ROSE 
Little Rock, Ark., June 20, 1894. 

[The editorial article to which our correspondent 
refers dealt with its subject in the most summary 
fashion, and attempted to name only a very few of 
the living writers of fiction. Probably many of its 
readers felt aggrieved at the omission of favorite 
names, and we are glad to afford a lover of the new 
Italian literature this opportunity of expressing his 
particular grievance. But we still think that no one 
of the writers mentioned by him yet occupies a suf- 
ficient space in the field of literature to deserve 
being classed with the few whom we singled out. 
Even the work of the young poet Sig. d'Annunzio, 
remarkable as it is, has the fatal defect of being 
morbid, and we did not mention it for the same 
reason that would have prevented us from mention- 
ing the work of Guy de Maupassant, had he still 
been among the living. To call the former " the 
most highly gifted of living authors " seems to us 
a very wild bit of criticism. EDR. DIAL.]

LETTERS OF Two MUSICIANS.* 



To the musical world the publication of 
Liszt's Letters is an event of first-rate import- 
ance ; and they will be found, in the main, to 
fulfil anticipation. Their critical value is of 
a high order, and criticism is their dominant 
note. They tell us something of Liszt the man 
and much of Liszt the artist, and are fairly 
rich in those personal allusions and judgments 
which are the spice of productions of their 
class. " Spice," however, is hardly the right 
word here, for Liszt, when speaking of others, 
is too amiable to be pungent. Though a true 
son of Pho3bus Apollo, there were no poisoned 
shafts in his quiver; and his words have scarcely 
a sting even for Shelley's " stupid and malig- 
nant race," from whom, as a frequent con- 
temner of beaten paths, he had some provoca- 
tion. " Whether one worries a bit more or a 
bit less," he writes to Kbhler, "it is pretty 
much the same. Let us only spread our wings 
' with our faces firmly set,' and all the cackle 
of goose-quills will not trouble us at all." 

As Schlegel divided men into two main 
classes of Platonists and Aristotelians, so Liszt 
seems to have divided them into the fools and 
the non-fools ; and against the rock-ribbed 
Ehrenbreitstein of folly he resolved to waste 
no sparrow-shot in the shape of argument or 
appeal. The unvexed composer wrote to Dr. 
Franz Brendel, an active polemic in the lists his 
friend declined to enter : 

" People may think about it what they please, but 
the truth is that I do not bother myself about fools of 
any species, whether German, French, English, Russian 
or Italian, but am peacefully industrious in my seclu- 
sion here (Rome). 'Let me rest, let me dream,' not 
indeed beneath blossoming almond trees, as Hoffman 
sings, but comforted and at peace under the protection 
of the Madonna del Rosario who has provided me with 
this cell." 

In point of literary charm, Liszt's letters 
generally fall short of Mendelssohn's ; and the 
un-musical reader will find them over-full of 
the caviare of musical lore and technicality. 
Music was the god of Liszt's idolatry, and his 
devotions left him little time or concern for 
what he may have thought profaner interests. 
His letters are mostly addressed to people whose

pursuits and interests were kindred to his own 
fellow-artists, composers, publishers, critics, 
and amateurs of music, etc.; and one notes lit- 
tle to indicate that his sympathies ever left for 
long their wonted channel. Sparing in his cen- 
sures, he bestowed his commendation with a 
free hand. In 1832 he wrote of his early idol 
Pagan ini : 

" ' And I too am a painter ! ' cried Michael Angelo 
the first time he beheld a chef d'auvre. . . . Though 
insignificant and poor, your friend cannot leave off re- 
peating those words of the great man ever since Paga- 
nini's last performance. Rene", what a man, what a vio- 
lin, what an artist ! Heavens ! what sufferings, what 
misery, what tortures in those four strings ! " 

Of Wagner he wrote to Belloni in 1849 : 
" Richard Wagner, a Dresden conductor, has been 
here (Weimar) since yesterday. That is a man of won- 
derful genius, such a brain-splitting genius indeed as 
beseems this country, a new and brilliant appearance 
in art." 

In a letter to Kohler, in 1853, he tells of 
the " several Walhalla-dajs " recently spent 
with Wagner, and adds, " I praise God for hav- 
ing created such a man." Writing to Wilhelra 
von Lenz in regard to the latter's book on 
" Beethoven and his Three Styles," Liszt finely 
says : 

" For us musicians Beethoven's work is like the pil- 
lar of cloud and fire which guided the Israelites through 
the desert a pillar of cloud to guide us by day, a pil- 
lar of fire to guide us by night, ' so that we may pro- 
gress both day and night.' His obscurity and his light 
trace for us equally the path we have to follow; they 
are each of them a perpetual commandment, an infallible 
revelation." 

Proceeding to discuss the ground idea of Lenz's 
book, Liszt continues : 

" Were it my place to categorize the different peri- 
ods of the great master's thoughts, as manifested in his 
Sonatas, Symphonies, and Quartets, I should certainly 
not fix the division into three styles, which is now pretty 
generally adopted and which you have followed; but 
simply recording the questions which have been raised 
hitherto, I should frankly weigh the great question which 
is the axis of criticism and of musical sestheticism at 
the point to which Beethoven has led us namely, in 
how far is traditional or recognized form a necessary 
determinant for the organism of thought ? The solu- 
tion of this question, evolved from the works of Beet- 
hoven himself, would lead me to divide this work, not 
into three styles or periods, the words style and period 
being here only corollary subordinate terms, of a vague 
and equivocal meaning, but quite logically into two 
categories: the first, that in which traditional and rec- 
ognized form contains and governs the thought of the 
master; and the second, that in which the thought 
stretches, breaks, recreates, and fashions the form and 
style according to its needs and inspirations. Doubtless 
in proceeding thus we arrive in a direct line at those 
incessant problems of authority and liberty. But why 
should they alarm us ? In the region of liberal arts 
they do not, happily, bring in any of the dangers and 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



disasters which their oscillations occasion in the polit- 
ical and social world; for, in the domain of the Beau- 
tiful, Genius alone is the authority, and hence, Dualism 
disappearing, the notions of liberty and authority are 
brought back to their original identity. Manzoni, in de- 
fining genius as ' a stronger imprint of Divinity,' has elo- 
quently expressed this very truth." 

It is well known that Liszt virtually defrayed 
the expenses (about 60,000 francs) of the Bonn 
monument to Beethoven out of his own purse. 
The contributions had flowed in very meagerly, 
and Liszt impatiently wrote to Berlioz, " such 
a niggardly almsgiving, got together with such 
trouble and sending round the hat, must not 
be allowed to help towards building our Beet- 
hoven's monument." There is perhaps a shade 
of sarcasm in his letter to the Bonn committee : 

" As the subscription for Beethoven's monument is 
only getting on slowly, and as the carrying out of this 
undertaking seems to be rather far distant, I venture 
to make a proposal to you, the acceptance of which would 
make me very happy. I offer myself to make up, from 
my own means, the sum still wanting for the erection 
of the monument, and ask no other privilege than that 
of naming the artist who shall execute the work. . . ." 

Writing to Brendel (1854), he styles Ru- 
binstein " the pseudo-Musician of the Future." 
He continues : 

" He is a clever fellow, possessed of talent and char- 
acter in an exceptional degree, and therefore no one can 
be more just to him than I have been for years. Still 
I do not want to preach to him he may sow his wild 
oats and fish deeper in the Mendelssohn waters, and 
even swim away if he likes." 

Of Hans von Biilow he writes to Lessman : 
" His knowledge, ability, experience are astounding, 
and border on the fabulous. Especially has he, by long 
years of study, so thoroughly steeped himself in the un- 
derstanding of Beethoven, that it seems scarcely pos- 
sible for any one else to approach nearer to him in that 
respect." 

A brief note to Edvard Grieg indicates 
Liszt's esteem for this clever leader of the 
Young Northern School : 

" I am very glad to tell you what pleasure it has 
given me to read your Sonata. It bears testimony to 
a talent of vigorous, reflective, and inventive composition 
of excellent quality, which has only to follow its natural 
bent in order to rise to a high rank. . . ." 

Chopin's genius is finely characterized in a 
letter to Lenz (1872) : 

" Let us reascend to Chopin, the enchanting aristocrat, 
the most refined in his magic. Pascal's epigraph, ' One 
must not get one's nourishment from it, but use it as 
one would an essence,' is only appropriate to a certain 
extent. Let us inhale the essence and leave it to the 
druggists to make use of it. You also, I think, exag- 
gerate the influence which the Parisian salons exercised 
on Chopin. His soul was not in the least affected by 
them, and his work as an artist remains transparent, 
marvellous, ethereal, and of an incomparable genius 
quite outside the errors of a school and the silly trifling 



of a salon. He is akin to the angel and the fairy ; more 
than this, he sets in motion the heroic string which has 
nowhere else vibrated with so much grandeur, passion, 
and fresh energy as in his Polonaises, which you bril- 
liantly designate as ' Pindaric Hymns of Victory.' " 

In a note to Schumann (1839) there is a 
playful touch worthy of Heine, which shows 
the master in a warmer light than usual. He 
says: J, 

" As to the Kinderscenen, I owe to them one of the 
greatest pleasures of my life. You know, or you don't 
know, that I have a little gir.1 of three years old, whom 
everybody agrees in considering angelic (did you ever 
hear such a commonplace ?). Her name is Blandine- 
Rachel, and her surname Moucheron. It goes without 
saying that she has a complexion of roses and milk, and 
that her fair golden hair reaches to her feet just like 
a savage. She is, however, tie most silent child, the 
most sweetly grave, the most philosophically gay in the 
world. I have every reason to hope also that she will 
not be a musician, from which may Heaven preserve 
her!" 

There is a fine ring of patriotic pride and 
wounded dignity in a letter (1840) to Buloz, 
editor of the " Revue des Deux Mondes." That 
the national honor paid him in his native Hun- 
gary should be confounded with the plaudits 
bestowed on an artist whose art lay (as Carlyle 
once put it) in " making a Manx penny of her- 
self," was too much even for Liszt's serenity ; 
and he wrote to the offending editor : 

" In your Revue Musicale for October last my name 
was mixed iip with the outrageous pretensions and ex- 
aggerated success of some executant artists ; I take the 
liberty to address a few remarks to you on this subject. 
The wreaths thrown at the feet of Mesdemoiselles Elssler 
and Pixis by the amateurs of New York and Palermo 
are striking manifestations of the enthusiasm of a pub- 
lic ; the sabre which was given to me at Pest is a re- 
ward given by a nation in an entirely national form. 
In Hungary, sir, in that country of antique and chiv- 
alrous manners, the sabre has a patriotic signification. 
It is the special token of manhood; it is the weapon of 
every man who has a right to carry a weapon. When 
six of the chief men of note in my country presented 
me with it amidst the acclamations of my compatriots, 
whilst at the same moment the towns of Pest and Oeden- 
burg conferred upon me the freedom of the city, and 
the civic authorities of Pest asked His Majesty for let- 
ters of nobility for me, it was an act to acknowledge 
me afresh as a Hungarian, after an absence of fifteen 
years; it was a reward of some slight services rendered 
to Art in my country; it was especially, and so I felt it, 
to unite me gloriously to her by imposing on me serious 
duties, and obligations for life as man and as artist. I 
agree with you, sir, that it was, without doubt, going 
far beyond my deserts up to the present time. There- 
fore I saw in that solemnity the expression of a hope 
far more than of a satisfaction. Hungary hailed in me 
the man from whom she expects artistic illustriousness, 
after all the illustrious soldiers and politicians she has 
so plentifully produced. As a child I received from my 
country precious tokens of interest, and the means of 
going abroad to develop my artistic vocation. When

grown up, and after long years, the young man returns 
to bring her the fruits of his work and the future of 
his will, the enthusiasm of the hearts which open to re- 
ceive him must not be confounded with the frantic dem- 
onstrations of an audience of amateurs. In placing 
these two things side by side it seems to me there is 
something which must wflund a just national pride and 
sympathies by which I am honored." 

While somewhat lacking, perhaps, on the 
personal side, the Letters of Liszt make an ar- 
tistic biography, of rare inner truth and, form 
considered, fulness. The editing is helpful and 
thorough, and the translation acceptable. At 
one point the translator " misses it " rather 
oddly. Writing of the bringing out of the 
" Faust Symphony for 2 Pianofortes," Liszt 
went on to say, punning (like Homer, he sins 
once), "None the less . . . bully him [Schu- 
berth the publisher] into action with ' Faust- 
Recht ' " meaning, of course, with club-law, 
law of might. Miss Bache gravely renders it, 
in parenthesis, " Faust rights or Faust justice " 
a small matter, but worth mending. There 
is a fine portrait of Liszt, and the work resem- 
bles in size and typography the Wagner-Liszt 
Letters. 

In preparing a volume of Mendelssohn's let- 
ters, the editor, Mr. W. F. Alexander, has 
made a fair selection and an excellent transla- 
tion, and Sir George Grove has added an In- 
troduction which, like the annals of the poor, 
is " short and simple." Sir George tells us, 
first, that he was asked to write which we 
should have taken for granted ; and, second, 
that he approves of both author and editor 
which will be gratifying to the latter. There 
are thirty-three letters in all, sixteen of them 
addressed to the writer's relatives, and the rest 
to Zelter, Moscheles, Pastor Schubring, von 
Falkenstein, Julius Rietz, and other friends 
and acquaintances. In the earlier ones there 
are some suggestive glimpses of Goethe, nota- 
bly in an account of a family dinner at the 
poet's. Mendelssohn says : 

" I found him outwardly unchanged, but at first some- 
what silent and reserved; I fancy he must have wanted 
to observe me, but at the moment I felt disappointed, 
and thought to myself, ' Now he is always like that.' " 

Presently, however, the talk turning on the 
Weimar "Women's Association " and the Wei- 
mar women's newspaper matters in them- 
selves provocative of Teutonic wit, 

" The old man all at once became jovial, and began 
to quiz the ladies about their philanthropy and their in- 
tellect, also about their subscriptions and their visita- 
tions of the sick, which seemed particularly to move his 
wrath. He appealed to me to join him in a revolt 
against these things, and, when I would not, he re- 



turned to his former indifference, but at last he became 
more friendly and intimate than I had ever known him 
before. It was beyond everything ! . . . After din- 
ner, he all at once began to hum, Gute Kinder hiib- 
sche Kinder miissen immer lustig sein tolles Volk,' and 
his eyes grew like those of an old lion just falling asleep. 
So presently I had to play to him, and he said it was 
very strange to him to think how long it was since he 
had heard my music, and meanwhile great advances 
had been made and he knew nothing of them." 

Goethe seems to have made unsparing drafts 
upon his young friend's abilities both of ex- 
position and execution. Says Mendelssohn : 

" In the morning I have to play the piano to him for 
an hour, pieces from all the great composers arranged 
in the order of dates, and then explain to him how mu- 
sic has progressed in their hands; meanwhile he sits in 
a dark corner, like a Jupiter Tonans, and his old eyes 
flash fire. About Beethoven he was indifferent. But 
I said he must endure some, and played him the first 
movement of the symphony in C minor. It affected him 
very strangely. First he said, < That does not touch one 
at all, it only astonishes one.' Then he murmured to 
himself, and said presently, ' It is very great, it is wild ; 
it seems as though the house were falling; what must 
it be with the whole orchestra ! ' ' 

Mendelssohn was in Italy in 1830-31 ; and 
his letters from thence, especially the Roman 
ones, show how fully he was in harmony with 
his new surroundings. Like Goethe, he drank 
deep of the cup that Italia proffers to those who 
understand and love her, his descriptions re- 
calling the poet's paradox that " one finds in 
Rome only what one brings there." But every- 
one, the poorest, finds something ; and the bar- 
renest /Sjnessburger^who grunts his disapproval 
of the Pantheon and the tomb of the Scipios, 
relents before the wicker-bound Orvieto and 
the purple figs of Spoleto. Felix Mendelssohn 
brought to Rome a mind open and receptive 
to the best she had to offer. The traditions of 
her two-fold past, the memorials of the Em- 
perors and the Pontiffs, alike filled him with a 
" measureless delight." " I proceeded with 
these free gifts of hers," he says, " very leis- 
urely." One day it was a ramble in the Forum 
or on the Aventine, the next a visit to the Bor- 
ghese Gallery, the Capitol, or the Vatican ; 
" so each day is one never to be forgotten, and 
this sort of dallying leaves each impression 
firmer and stronger." Reading now for the first 
time the " Italian Journey," it pleases Mendels- 
sohn to find that he and Goethe reached Rome 
on the same day, and that Goethe, too, went first 
to the Quirinal and heard a requiem there. 

" He says also that at Florence and Bologna a sort of 
impatience took possession of him, and on arrival here 
he felt calm again, and, as he calls it, well-knit in mind ; 
so I have experienced all he describes, a reflection 
which pleases me."

His reverence, however, for his " old hero " 
of Weimar results in no mean subservience of 
opinion. He can doubt his oracle where most 
men, or most Germans, would incline to accept 
the judgment as final. So when Goethe finds 
a certain Titian " meaningless " a mere set 
scene or elegantly-arranged tableau, in the style 
of Veronese Mendelssohn says : 

" I flatter myself, however, that I have found a deep 
significance in this picture, and maintain that he is right 
who sees most in a Titian, for the man was simply di- 
vine. He, indeed, found no opportunity to display the 
whole breadth of his inspiration, as Raphael did here 
in the Vatican; yet one can never forget his three pic- 
tures at Venice, and this of the Vatican, which I first 
saw this morning, stands in a line with them." 

Mendelssohn waxes wroth over the Philis- 
tinism of the artists he saw in Rome a poor 
lot mostly, it seems, distinguished as a class 
chiefly by eccentricities of dress and manners. 
The chronic delusion that fustian coats, long 
hair and loose habits make the painter, was rife 
with these degenerate pittori, and their chief 
professional concern was to find, not the color- 
secret of Titian, but where the most brandy 
was to be had for the least money. Mendels- 
sohn says : 

" It is terrible to see them at their Cafd Greco. I 
seldom go there, for I am rather afraid of them and 
the place they haunt. It is a small dark room about 
eight paces wide; on one side it is permitted to smoke 
tobacco, on the other not. They sit round on the benches 
with their brigand- hats and their big bloodhounds; their 
throats, chins, and faces are entirely covered with hair, 
and they pout- out dense volumes of smoke and exchange 
incivilities with one another while the dogs are ex- 
changing their insects. A necktie or a frock-coat 
would be a modern weakness; all the face that's left 
by the beard is concealed by their spectacles; they 
swill their coffee and discourse of Titian and Porde- 
none as though these persons were sitting there with 
beards and brigand-hats like themselves. Their busi- 
ness is to paint sickly madonnas, ricketty saints, and 
effeminate knights, things one longs to dash one's fist 
through. As for Titian's picture in the Vatican, which 
you ask about, these infernal critics have no respect for 
it. According to them it has neither subject nor con- 
ception, and it never occurs to one of them that a mas- 
ter who gave laborious days of love and reverence to a 
picture, may still have seen as far as they can through 
their glistening spectacles, and if all my life I never 
contrive to do anything else, I am resolved, at least, to 
be as rude as I can to people who have no respect for 
the great masters; that will be one good work accom- 
plished." 

The many who know Mendelssohn only through 
his music will find in this little book a fair test 
of his quality as a letter- writer a character 
in which he is unusually attractive. The vol- 
ume has a good portrait.

SIGNS OF LIFE IN LITERATURE.* 



There are in Paris during the Spring of the 
year a good many exhibitions of pictures which 
trouble the soul of the conscientious lover of 
the arts. Not only at the two great Salons are 
there generally certain alarming manifestations, 
but there are also smaller collections gathered 
together by Independents, Rosicrucians, or other 
such persons, in which the wildest gymnastics 
in the name of art are not only allowed but en- 
couraged. Dazed and antagonized by these 
indulgences, the feeling of many an ordinary 
and honest art-lover must be, " Almost thou 
persuadest me to be a Philistine." Fortunately, 
however, Paris herself furnishes an antidote to 
any such despair, in the annual exhibition of 
the pictures and sculptures entered in compe- 
tition for the Prix de Rome. One goes to these 
shameless revelations of academic horror, and 
becomes in a great degree reconciled to the ex- 
istence of new notions in art, however extrava- 
gant. They really do but little harm (except 
to their ingenious sponsors), and they are ex- 
tremely useful in keeping up a healthy circula- 
tion of ideas. 

Now I am not familiar with any evil things 
in literature analogous to these Prix de Rome 
exhibitions, unless perhaps we might count col- 
lege oratorical contests and commencements. 
But the feeling that there might be something 
worse should make us look with benignity, if 
not pleasure, on such books as Mr. Hamlin 
Garland's " Crumbling Idols " and Mr. Oscar 
Wilde's " Salome." Different as they are in 
all other points, both books are of that foam 
and froth of literature which is indicative of 
true life and action somewhere, which is itself 
shortly blown away and lost to sight and re- 
membrance. 

Mr. Garland's book, we are informed by an 
unknown sponsor, is " a vigorous plea for the 
recognition of youth and a protest against the 
despotism of tradition." It might have been 
added that it is an assertion of the necessity of 
Americanism in American Literature. Surely 
these things are very good things, looked at in 
their ordinary light. But when we look at them 
in Mr. Garland's light, it must be confessed 
that the feeling is not one of approbation but 
of irritation. One is led to inquire, What

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



earthly use can there be in Mr. Garland's say- 
ing all this ? For the main points in Mr. Gar- 
land's discourse are by no means new. He 
takes Walt Whitman's thesis as to a native 
literature, looks at it in the light of the expe- 
rience of the last twenty-five years, and puts 
forth the whole thing as his own prophecy for 
the future. 

As one reads " Crumbling Idols " it comes 
more and more strongly to mind that the book 
is a sort of apology for existence on the part 
of its author. Now Mr. Garland of course need 
make no such apology. "Main Travelled Roads" 
and " Prairie Songs " are reasons enough for 
anyone's existing, temporarily. They are their 
own excuse for being : no one doubted the fact, 
until Mr. Garland set himself to force us into 
admitting it. For, unfortunately, Mr. Gar- 
land is not persuasive : he is bellicose, obstrep- 
erous, blatant. Nobody could possibly agree 
with him, whatever he said. 

The real difficulty seems to be that Mr. Gar- 
land, being himself able to write excellent things 
of a certain sort, cannot conceive that there 
can be anything else excellent of a kind totally 
different. Feeling himself very virtuous, he 
becomes enraged that anyone else should ven- 
ture to be still attached to cakes and ale. Now 
this is all wrong. Literature in America may 
never come to anything without plenty of local 
color and provincialism (to use Mr. Garland's 
expressions), but it will never be a great liter- 
ature so long as it has nothing besides. Mr. 
Garland would do us but poor service if he 
could persuade people to write nothing but 
" local novels." 

But of course one need not take the book 
very seriously. Mr. Garland's engrossing fear 
seems to be that Americans will turn their en- 
tire attention to writing " blank- verse tragedies 
on Columbus or Washington," or that they will 
" copy the last epics of feudalism." Such an 
apprehension seems to have very slight basis. 
It is probable that during the last year there 
have been thousands of what Mr. Garland would 
call " local " stories written by young America 
for every single blank-verse tragedy or epic of 
feudalism that has seen the light this side the 
Atlantic. Everybody writes " local " stories 
nowadays ; it is as natural as whooping-cough. 
There is no need of encouragement : to tell 
the truth, a little restraint would do no harm. 
For, even with the best of intentions, one may 
write a " local " story so badly that it will be 
worse than a blank-verse tragedy on Washing- 
ton or anybody else, 



But to turn from such serious foolishness to 
a more sprightly trifler. Mr. Oscar Wilde 
never troubles one with taking himself too se- 
riously, and the history of " Salome " is Oscar 
Wilde all over. It was written in French and 
produced in Paris. Desirous then of favoring 
his own countrymen, Mr. Wilde made prepara- 
tion to present it in London. In this worthy 
attempt, however, he was hindered so the 
papers told us by some official folly which 
enraged him so much that he was even strongly 
tempted to stop being an Englishman, in favor 
of that less imbecile people across the Chan- 
nel. But not wishing to keep his anger for- 
ever, Mr. Wilde finally allowed his noble friend 
Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas to do the play into 
English. It was then " pictured," as the phrase 
is, by Mr. Aubrey Beardsley, and is now ready 
for the delight of a somewhat indifferent world. 

Such an extraordinary conjunction of affecta- 
tions is ominous. But, strangely enough, there 
are some things in " Salome " that are good. 
It is impossible to read it without feeling cu- 
riously moved and stirred. The careless talk 
of the loungers on the terrace, the soldiers and 
the Cappadocian, is good ; the squabbling of 
the Jews, the Pharisee, the Sadducee, the Naz- 
arene, is good. So, also, is Herod, indeed 
the character of Herod is quite the best con- 
ceived thing in the play, as his description of 
his treasure is the best written. The play may 
well have been very effective on the stage, for 
there is a constant feeling of movement, of life, 
and it is certainly worth reading now that it is 
published. 

With all this, however, the play is wholly 
ephemeral. Its action is trivial and its dia- 
logue affected. Its ideas, and its language too, 
are extravagances, without much more founda- 
tion than the extravagances of Mr. Hamlin 
Garland. But while in Mr. Garland we have 
the prophet of Literature as Life, we have in 
Mr. Wilde the follower of Literature as Art. 
Mr. Garland is a " veritist," and prefers the 
fresh novelties of nature. But Mr. Wilde 
seeks beauty, in art and art's most latent sub- 
tleties. He contrives expressions and concep- 
tions of the most curious and self-conscious 
refinement, of the strangest and most ultra- 
precious distinction. As ever, he scorns the 
ordinary, the every-day, the generally pleasing, 
and is unremitting to attain the romantic 
beauty, the strange, the wonderful, the remote, 
the reward of no art but the most devoted, the 
delight of no taste but the most distinguished. 

As suchj his work lends itself eminently to

the illustration of Mr. Aubrey Beardsley. * 
Mr. Aubrey" Beardsley receives a good many 
hard words nowadays, and certainly his pic- 
tures are strange things, more affected than 
Oscar Wilde himself, and more remote from 
obvious apprehension. What one is first in- 
clined to criticise in Mr. Beardsley is his lack 
of originality. His pictures remind us of al- 
most every phase of art that has ever existed ; 
or, at any rate, of every phase which had ever 
a tinge of the grotesque or the trivial in its 
character. From the bald priestly pictures 
mingled among Egyptian hieroglyphics, down 
to the graceful frivolities of Willette of the 
Red Windmill, Mr. Beardsley seems to have 
laid everything under contribution. His work 
seems by turns one thing and then another 
Japanese, Gothic, Preraphaelite, what you will. 
So it seems at first. But the great excellence 
is that, however Protean, Mr. Aubrey Beards- 
ley, like Satan in " Paradise Lost," is always 
himself, even in the midst of his disguises. 
Just what is his own quality, is hard to say ; 
but there can be little doubt that it exists, and 
it would be worth somebody's while to de- 
termine it in the shifting dazzle of his influ- 
ences, to fix it for an instant for us, to get 
its true character and flavor unadulterated. 
But whatever be his quality, it is eminently in 
keeping with the work of Mr. Oscar Wilde. 

Of our two literary eccentrics, some will pre- 
fer Mr. Wilde and some Mr. Garland. If they 
could be seized each with an admiration for the 
other, it would have an excellent effect on the 
work of both. But even as they are, they are 
good evidence of life in literature, and an as- 
surance that it will not yet awhile harden down 
into utter conventionalism. 

EDWARD E. HALE, JR. 

* Characteristic of author and artist is the tribute of ad- 
miration which we see in the portrait of the former, opposite

world with the sensual lips, sodden eyes, and double chin, 
that are here so conscientiously pictured, is a somewhat re- 
markable thing. 



RAMBLES AND REFLECTIONS OF A LOVEII 
OF NATUIIE. * 



William Allingham, during his life, was 
known almost exclusively as a poet ; but a three- 
volume edition of " Varieties in Prose," just 
published by his wife, proves him to have been 
a delightful prose writer as well. " Patricius 
Walker " he calls himself in the first two vol- 

* VAHIKTI us IN PKOSE. By William Allingham. In three 
volumes. New York ; Longmans, Green, $ Co, 



umes, which consist of " Rambles " through 
England, Scotland, and Wales, and furnish the 
opportunity for much charming description of 
natural scenery, flavored with literary and ar- 
tistic comment and generalizations. Few ex- 
periences in life are more enjoyable than long 
and leisurely out-door strolls through a pleas- 
ing country, with a chatty companion who has 
an eye for the picturesque, a well-stored mind, 
and a ready fancy. Something of the same 
satisfaction we feel in these books ; for the time 
being, we are fellow-ramblers with Patricius, 
and share in his quiet but responsive moods. 
He calls attention to much that would have 
escaped our own more prosaic eyes and minds : 
while the physical aspects of the country might 
have been apparent, its sentiment and associa- 
tions would probably have continued un re- 
vealed. For example, Winchester is perhaps 
not specially interesting to the average man, 
but our companion recalls that it was here, one 
Sunday evening, " a certain young poet now 
forever young," felt and sung the rich sadness 
of Autumn. 

" Young Keats 's gaze that Sunday evening was upon 
the Winchester stubble-fields like a spiritual setting-sun, 
and left them lying enchanted in its fadeless light. . . . 
After all, it is permissible to believe, the poet draws the 
best lot from Fortune's urn. Whom could he envy ? 
Not alone is his delight in life the keenest, but his in- 
sight the most veracious. Yet, ah me ! how thin-skinned 
he is how open to suffering how sure to suffer, in a 
world such as this ! Is it partly the world's fault for 
being such a world ? Was Keats, pensive among the 
sheaves, a happier man than Hodge, who reaped them, 
and quaffed his ale-cup at the harvest-home ? ' Hap- 
pier ' what is happiness 1 Would any man deliberately 
give up a grain of his intellect or sensibility to win a 
lower kind of happiness than he was born capable of ? 
escape suffering by stupidity ? Here truly is a cat- 
echism of questions, and food for meditation." 

We get very close to our companion's idio- 
syncrasies, know his likes and dislikes, and 
though not always agreeing, learn to expect 
something spontaneous and entertaining at each 
step of the way. A cathedral service on a Brit- 
ish Sunday he finds a great resource, and " the 
sermon keeps it from appearing too pleasant 
a set-off against the music and the architec- 
ture." As an easy and most valuable reform 
in the Church of England, he suggests the to- 
tal abolition of sermons in connection with the 
ordinary service. Modern life, whether pub- 
lic or private, does not interest him ; it is 
neither romantic nor picturesque, and nothing 
arouses his indignation more than to see an old 
building " restored " (that is, defaced) by mod- 
ern hands. Words cannot express his disgust 
at what he calls the uglifiers of the world. He 



14

admits that such an evil may be sometimes ab- 
solutely unavoidable, like shaving a sick man's 
head, or cutting off his leg ; but ithe necessity 
ought to be clear and real, not, as is so often 
the case, a pretended need, generated in a com- 
post of stupidity, weak desire of novelty, and 
some kind of low self-interest. On this point 
he says : 

" The world is not ours absol utely, or any part of it ; 
but only ours in trust. We have ' a user' as the lawyers 
say, and that without prejudice to all others, born or to 
be born. Pray, how can mortal do, in a common way, 
worse turn to mankind than by permanently lessening 
the world's beauty, in landscape, in architecture, in dress, 
in (what is sure to go with the rest) manners, tastes, 
sympathies ? An evil governor, or the writer of a 
clever vile book, perhaps does worse, but that is not in 
a common way." 

But we prefer to quote our friend when he 
is in his usual more serene mood. The true 
poet's power of seeing the beautiful in the com- 
mon is quickly stirred in him. This is what 
he finds in an idle hour at the little railway- 
station of Wimbourne Minster : 

" Narrow streets hem in the Minster. I first reached 
the market-place, an irregular open; and then, through 
bye-lanes, a pretty field-path on the west side of the 
town, where, amidst broad meadows, guarded north and 
south by heavily wooded slopes, winds the tranquil 
Stour, with deep pools, where, looking into the trans- 
parent water, I could see some of the inhabitants, little 
pike at feed, who know nothing of Wimbourne, or Dor- 
set, or the South Western Railways, but have their own 
towns and districts and lines of travelling. Two young 
ladies came along the path from the town, sat down on 
the grassy margin close to an island or promontory 
shaded with tall green withes, and began to read un- 
known mysterious books; it was poetry, I felt sure, and 
finer than any I have yet seen in print. Yet could I have 
looked over their shoulder it would doubtless have 
changed into . The damsels themselves seemed, in 
that sunny spring meadow by the clear river, more 
than semi-celestial; yet already their features have 
mingled irrevocably with the cloudy past." 

Patricius believes firmly in the educating 
power of fair and noble landscape. Even the 
peasant, who does not consciously notice it, is 
better for the beauty, as he is better for the 
pure air he unconsciously breathes, and he 
would soon miss both. Yet our enthusiastic 
Nature-lover is forced to admit that even the 
most responsive do not at all times feel Nature's 
charms. Like other pleasures, it is apt to evade 
too eager pursuit. One may find the mountain 
or the cataract, but cannot always command 
the mood for enjoying them. Often, in the 
fairest scenes, we may repeat Coleridge's line, 

" I see, not feel, that it is fair," 

and unawares, in some happy hour or moment, 
" reap the harvest of a quiet eye." 



Inspired by a stroll through Devonshire lanes, 
and the sight of Dean Prior where Robert Iler- 
rick was vicar two centuries ago, he treats 
us to a disquisition 011 Herrick's poetry, com- 
paring him to Martial, and calling him by 
names less harsh than are sometimes used. 
Robert Herrick is a name that echoes pleas- 
antly, after all, and he can drink a health to 
the " half-disreputable shade " who was so un- 
like his contemporary brother-poet and brother- 
clergyman whose memories are also revived 
the " almost too respectable vicar of Fugglc- 
ston, near Salisbury George Herbert ! " 

The " Rambles " come to an end with the 
second volume. In the third are seven Irish 
Sketches, and about as many essays on various 
literary themes, all agreeable though not re- 
markable. Like most poets, Mr. Allingham 
seems to have had some ambition towards 
drama, and the work concludes with a serio- 
comic play in one act, " Hopgood & Go." Be- 
ing far inferior to the rest of the collection, 
it might better have been omitted. The pub- 
lishers have given the book a beautiful dress, 
and a pleasing photograph of the author, from 
a drawing by his wife, serves as frontispiece.

FOLK-TALES OF NOVA SCOTIAN INDIANS.* 



The Algonkin family of Indian tribes was 
one of the most widely spread in America. To 
it belonged tribes so different as the Blackfeet 
of the far West, the Sacs and Foxes and the 
Ojibways of the interior, the Delawares of 
Pennsylvania, and the New England Indians. 
To it, too, the Micmacs of Nova Scotia and 
Prince Edward's Island belong. The Rev. Silas 
Tertius Rand in many ways a remarkable man 
was for forty years or more a missionary to 
this tribe. Scholarly in his tastes and pro- 
foundly interested in the people among whom 
he labored, he gathered a great mass of mate- 
rial, both linguistic and mythological, of much 
value. Part of this material is in the volume 
before us. It contains eighty-seven stories, of 
varying interest and importance, simply told. 

There is already considerable Algonkin folk- 
lore in print. Ojibway legends have been often 
studied and told with more or less of accuracy. 
Mr. George Bird Grinnell has beautifully 
put the Blackfeet Lodge-Tales into English.

Others have busied themselves with other tribes; 
and Mr. Charles G. Leland has given us in his 
*' Algonkin Legends of New England " a 
wonderful book stories from the Indians of 
Maine and Nova Scotia. In fact, Mr. Leland's 
book contains many of these very Micmac 
legends, for he was permitted by Mr. Rand to 
make liberal use of the manuscript of these in 
preparing his book. Thus, much of the choic- 
est part of Mr. Rand's book was already in 
print. It is, however, very desirable to have 
as here the whole collection in the very form 
in which it was gathered. 

The reader is at once impressed with the 
profound difference between the best of these 
Micmac tales and those of the more Western 
tribes of the Algonkin group such as the 
Blackfeet. They are more massive in struct- 
ure, bolder in conception, more wild in spirit. 
This is true only of those which are plainly un- 
touched by modern European influence. There 
are some stories in the collection which are 
plainly modifications of European fairy-tales 
of recent introduction. Most of this latter 
class betray themselves, but are interesting as 
illustrations of myth-changes due to new con- 
ditions. 

Curious heroes figure in the better of these 
stories : giants, magicians, chenoo. The Al- 
gonkins have sorcerers, and medicine and magic 
were realities in their old life ; they figure in 
these stories. The great hero is Glooskap. 
He is a mighty magician, kind usually, ready 
to help the poor and punish the bad, a joker 
withal whose jokes are sometimes rather grim. 
He knows the language of beast and bird, he 
can control nature's powers (though with cu- 
rious limitations), he can change the size and 
form of himself or others. Cheated and robbed, 
he can yet overtake his spoilers and put them 
to confusion. As he can grant fulfilment of 
wishes, he is much sought by men ; but often, 
in granting their desires, he shows them their 
folly and weakness. Very common, too, in 
Micmac stories is it to hear of the remarkable 
adventures of the Rabbit. He is cunning and 
has great " medicine " power, but he is hasty 
and thoughtless, often putting himself into 
strange predicaments, although he usually 
comes forth the victor. But most curious of 
all the curious beings in Micmac stories are 
the Chenoo dreadful, wild, cannibalistic, 
with heart of ice, endowed with more than hu- 
man powers for both good and ill, but seldom 
exercising the power. Scarcely anywhere will 
we find a more beautiful bit in folk-lore than 



the story of the Chenoo converted by kindness. 
His savage nature is tamed by love, but with 
the change comes, necessarily, death. Some 
of the legends are, or appear to be, simple nar- 
ratives of real events battles, incidents of 
tribal history : in some of these there is no im- 
probability in the narrative, in others an ele- 
ment of magic enters in which weakens our 
faith. From these to pure hero myths is not 
a long step. The modified fairy-stories of Eu- 
rope, but recently introduced, are interesting. 
They are plainly exotic, but they often have 
acquired some new flavor and undergone some 
curious modification. A fair example is the 
story of " The Magical Food, Belt, and Flute." 
The widow's stupid son Jack goes to sell a cow 
to get money for the rent ; he is inveigled into 
parting with it for an apparent trifle a tiny 
dish with a bit of food upon it. A second cow 
goes for a belt, and a third one for a flute. 
All are magical, but will not pay the rent, and 
the mother is in despair. Of course the stu- 
pid boy with his magical treasures gets the rent 
remitted, seeks his fortune and marries a king's 
daughter. 

The most interesting fact in these Micmac 
stories remains to be stated. In many points 
they show unquestionable and startling resem- 
blance to old Scandinavian sagas. This re- 
semblance has been well stated and ably dis- 
cussed by Mr. Leland, to whose book we must 
refer for the argument. Sometime, somehow, 
somewhere, a Scandinavian influence deep and 
profound has come into the life and thought of 
the olden Micmacs ; the resemblance is too 
great and too minute to be of no significance. 
And here, curiously, is a vital matter, so far as 
the book before us is concerned. The late Pro- 
fessor Horsford's interest in Norse settlement 
of New England is well known. Everyone has 
heard of " Norumbega " and Professor Hors- 
ford's belief that he had discovered the very 
site of that " city of the past." There is no 
doubt that it was the Norse strain in these Mic- 
mac legends which led him to purchase Dr. 
Rand's manuscripts and present them to Welles- 
ley College. It was his belief that " traces 
of the Northmen might be found in these 
Indian tales, and that the language of the 
Micmacs might, upon closer study, reveal the 
impress of the early Norse invaders. In this 
belief he helped toward the publication of the 
material. " The Legends of the Micmacs " is 
the first of the " Wellesley Philological Pub- 
lications." It is edited by Miss Helen L. Web- 
ster, and is, we hope, only the forerunner of a

valuable series of volumes. The Library of 
American Linguistics of Wellesley College is 
rich both in manuscripts and printed material. 
Of Mr. Rand's manuscripts it possesses nearly 
all, amounting to more than a score of volumes 
upon Micmac and Maliseet. Of his printed 
works it has a fine series of about fifty num- 
bers ; of the Bible in various Indian languages 
it has a notable collection ; and Major Powell's 
private collection of over a thousand linguistic 
papers and books is in its keeping* From such 
a wealth of matter we shall expert to receive 
important results. A second volume is already 
in preparation ; it will consist of grammatical 
material from the Micmac language. Besides 
gathering this library and publishing these vol- 
umes, the college is moving toward instruction 
in American Linguistics and Ethnology. A 
beginning has been made, with a small class, 
under Miss Webster. Workers in anthropol- 
ogy everywhere will watch the growth and de- 
velopment of this promising work with great 
interest. FREDERICK STARR. 



More of the 
Letters of 
FitzGerald. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

If there are in the English language 
any more delightful letters than those 
of Edward FitzGerald, we would not 
at this moment venture to name them. Cowper's, 
much belauded ; Shelley's, with their sweetness and 
dignity ; Thackeray's, with their boyish exuberance 
even these seem less attractive when one is per- 
mitted to enjoy the intimacy of Omar's translator. 
Lamb's ? but " comparisons are odorous." Those 
who already have the " Letters and Literary Re- 
mains " will none the less welcome the new edition 
of the " Letters " (Macmillan), and will find a place 
for them upon the shelf, for divers reasons. First 
of all, they are prettily published in two " Eversley " 
volumes ; second, there are some forty hitherto un- 
published letters ; third, there is a good index to the 
whole. If these be not sufficient reasons, we know 
nought of logic. The happy reader will of course 
begin by picking out all the plums (being the new 
letters) if we may apply the metaphor to a pud- 
ding which is all plums ; he will then read the old 
letters over again. Last of all, he will rejoice (while 
impatient of delay) at the announcement of Mr. 
William Aldis Wright, the editor, who promises a 
wholly new volume to be devoted to the letters 
written by FitzGerald to Fanny Kemble. The new 
letters contained in the present edition are ad- 
dressed to a number of people. Fully half of them 
are added to those of which Professor E. B. Cowell 
was the fortunate original recipient, and from these 
are the following selections. Writing in 1857, Fitz- 



Gerald says : " In truth I take old Omar rather 
more as my property than yours : he and I are more 
akin, are we not ? You see all [his] Beauty, but 
you don't feel with him in some respects as I do. 
I think you would almost feel obliged to leave out 
the part of Hamlet in representing him to your Au- 
dience, for fear of Mischief. Now I do not wish to 
show Hamlet at bis maddest : but mad he must be 
shown, or he is no Hamlet at all. G. de Tassy eluded 
all that was dangerous, and all that was character- 
istic. I think these free opinions are less danger- 
ous in an old Mahometan, or an old Roman (like 
Lucretius), than when they are returned to by those 
who have lived on happier Food." Two years later, 
after telling his friend of a great bereavement, he 
writes : " Well, this is so : and there is no more to 
be said about it. It is one of the things that rec- 
oncile me to my own stupid Decline of Life to the 
crazy state of the world Well no more about it. 
I sent you poor old Omar, who has his kind of Con- 
solation for all these Things. I doubt you will re- 
gret you ever introduced him to me. ... I hardly 
know why I print any of these things, which no- 
body buys ; and I scarce now see the few I give 
them to. But when one has done one's best, and 
is sure that that best is better than so many will 
take pains to do, though far from the best that 
might be done, one likes to make an end of the 
matter by Print. I suppose very few People have 
taken such Pains in Translation as I have : though 
certainly not to be literal. But at all Cost, a Thing 
must live : with a transfusion of one's own worse 
Life if one can 't retain the Original's better. Bet- 
ter a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle." The fol- 
lowing characteristic bit is dated 1863 : " Oh dear, 
when I do look into Homer, Dante, and Virgil, 
^Eschylus, Shakespeare, etc., those Orientals look 
silly ! Do n't resent my saying so. Do n't they ? 
I am now a good [deal] about in a new Boat I have 
built, and thought (as Johnson took Cocker's Arith- 
metic with him on travel, because he shouldn't ex- 
haust it) so I would take Dante and Homer with 
me, instead of Mudie's Books which I read through 
directly. I took Dante by way of slow Digestion : 
not having looked at him for some years : but I am 
glad to find I relish him as much as ever : he atones 
with the Sea ; as you know does the ' Odyssey ' 
these are the Men." We note that Mr. Wright has 
omitted from this edition (as was proper) the ref- 
erence to Mrs. Browning which gave such offence 
to her husband, and impelled him to an outburst of 
temper, which, however great the provocation, must 
always be regarded as deplorable. The only refer- 
ence to Browning in the present edition is a new 
one, dated 1882, and with it we end our extracts : 
" Browning told Mrs. Kemble he knew there was 
' a grotesque side ' to his society, etc., but he could 
not refuse the kind solicitations of his Friends, Fur- 
nival and Co. Mrs. K. had been asked to join : but 
declined, because of her somewhat admiring him ; 
nay, much admiring what he might have done."

Language and ^ more valuable contribution to the 
Linguistic Method pedagogy of a special branch of edu- 
in the School. cation has been made in recent years 
than the series of " Lectures on Language and Lin- 
guistic Method in the School," delivered in the Uni- 
versity of Cambridge, by Prof. S. S. Laurie, of 
the University of Edinburgh, which first appeared 
in 1890, and a new edition of which has lately 
been published (James Thin, Edinburgh). The 
new edition is improved in several respects. The 
quantity of matter has been increased from 147 
pages to 197 pages; all the lectures have been re- 
written in part, the matter has been rearranged 
with a view to make the volume more suitable as 
a text -book ; and a lecture on the teaching of 
French has been added, as well as a supplement. 
In no other way can the scope of the book so well 
be given as to present the heads of lectures. " Lan- 
guage the Supreme Instrument in Education " ; 
" The Real and Formal in Language" ; " Language 
as a Real Study Conveying Substance of Thought" 
(three lectures) ; " Language as a Formal Study " ; 
" Grammar of the Vernacular Tongue " ; " Lan- 
guage as Literature " ; " Foreign Tongues, Latin as 
Type " ; " Method ot Teaching Latin " ; " Method 
of Teaching Foreign Languages"; "Language vs. 
Science in the School." These lectures are all marked 
by that clearness of thought and expression, and that 
completeness and balance of view, which are so char- 
acteristic of their author. The volume opens with 
this suggestive paragraph : " Every human being is 
educated by the experiences of life. The experiences 
begin very early. The babe at its mother's breast 
is receiving impressions for good or for evil as cer- 
tainly as a seed, which has just begun to sprout, is 
already absorbing from the soil what is to make it 
or mar it as a vigorous plant of its kind. There- 
after, as the child walks non cequis possibles at his 
mother's side, the whole world of nature is seeking 
to form him. Earth and sky, the events of his lit- 
tle life, the words and acts, nay, even the gestures, 
of those about him, are all busy in the work of his 
education. Unconsciously at first, and thereafter con- 
sciously, he is organising into himself the vast and 
infinite material of outer impression and inner feel- 
ing. Every human being undergoes this process of 
education ; and it is not at all a question whether 
he is to be educated or not, but simply how and to 
what end he is to be educated." A passage on the 
meaning and influence of the mother-tongue is also 
well worth quoting : " Mind grows only in so far as 
it finds expression for itself ; it cannot find it through 
a foreign tongue. It is round the language learned 
at the mother's knee that the whole life of feeling, 
emotion, thought, gathers. If it were possible for a 
child or boy to live in two languages at once equally 
well, so much the worse for him. His intellectual 
and spiritual growth would not thereby be doubled, 
but halved. Unity of mind and of character would 
have great difficulty in asserting itself in such cir- 
cumstances. Language, remember, is at best only 
symbolic of a world of consciousness, and almost 



Contemporary 
Thought and 
Thinkers. 



every word is rich in unexpressed associations of 
experience which give it its full value for the life 
of mind. Subtleties, and delicacies, and refinements 
of feeling and perception are, at best, only suggested 
by the words we use. The major part lies deep in 
our conscious or half-conscious life, and is the source 
of the tone and colour of language, and of its wide- 
reaching unexpressed relations. Words, accordingly, 
must be steeped in life to be living ; and as we have 
not two lives, tut only one, so we can have only one 

language." 

Two volumes of leaders and reviews 
written for the London " Spectator " 
by Mr. Richard Holt Hutton have 
been collected under the title, " Criticisms on Con- 
temporary Thought and Thinkers" (Macmillan). 
They range over the past twenty years, and include 
articles upon such men as Carlyle, Emerson, Long- 
fellow, Dickens, Mill, Arnold, Renan, Maurice, 
Bagehot, Darwin, Stanley, Church, and Newman. 
They also include reviews of many remarkable 
works, such as Carlyle's " Reminiscences," Mr. Les- 
lie Stephen's Essays, Mill's "Autobiography," Mori- 
son's "The Service of Man," Dr. Martineau's "Types 
of Ethical Theory," and some of Tennyson's later 
poems. The papers are all brief, but several are 
often devoted to the same subject. There are groups 
of four each upon Carlyle and Dr. Martineau, of . 
three each upon Mill and Mr. Stephen, and a group 
of no less than eight upon Sir John Lubbock's studies 
of insect life. These groups produce something of 
the effect of extensive essays, and serve to make the 
book less fragmentary than at first appears. It will 
be seen from the above incomplete enumeration of 
topics that the papers touch upon a wide range 
of subjects ; it might almost be said that no move- 
ment or tendency of the last twenty years, having 
to do with religious philosophy or the spiritual life, 
escapes the author's attention. Mr. Hutton's stand- 
point and the solidity of his culture are well known 
to thoughtful readers, and to such only do these vol- 
umes appeal. He is a journalist, but his journalism 
is so dignified as to make the name almost a mis- 
nomer. His position upon philosophical and relig- 
ious questions and with him the two are almost 
one is ultra-conservative ; he is entrenched behind 
a barricade of prejudices, and from their shelter con- 
ducts a skilfully defensive campaign. One must 
not expect from him anything like sympathetic treat- 
ment of such men as Arnold and Renan, for ex- 
ample ; the spirit of such men seems almost wholly 
to escape him. But he is always urbane, or nearly 
always. In the case of Clifford, indeed, his tem- 
per nearly deserts him, but then Clifford was exas- 
perating at times. And the author pays for his 
lapse into something like invective by allowing him- 
self to be detected in such puerile reasoning as the 
following: "If Professor Clifford's theory were 
worth anything, consciousness would develope pari 
passu with the organic development of all forms 
of matter, and we ought to have as much con- 
sciousness behind the action of the motor nerves as

behind the action of the sensitive neives, as much 
consciousness of the growth of our hair, as of the 
flush on our cheeks or the music in ofir ears." We 
might extract equally childish passages from what 
is said upon that dangerous subject or free will and 
moral responsibility. We are almost jiempted to say 
that Mr. Hutton is too good a writer to be an exact 
thinker. His rhetoric is doubtless of a high char- 
acter, but his fate is nevertheless that bf far cheaper 
rhetoricians : he is entangled in the Network of his 
own verbiage. Still, he has a point of view, and 
those who wish to know what can be isaid from that 
point of view upon the most serious aspects of mod- 
ern thought cannot do better than read these vol- 
umes. 

Mr. Joseph Landon, the author of 
" Principles and Practice of Teach- 
ing" (Macmillan), tells us in his pre- 
face that his work is "the outcome of nearly a quar- 
ter of a century's experience as lecturer on school 
management in a training college, and of a still larger 
experience as a teacher, as well as of a considerable 
amount of reading, and of numerous observations 
and experiments in teaching carried out at various 
times and in various ways " ; and the work itself 
amply confirms this testimony. He has produced, 
not an original or a brilliant book, but a useful one, 
well thought out, solid, and methodical from cover 
to cover. He adheres to the tradition in including 
" principles " as well as " practice " ; but, as he 
frankly tells us, the book treats the subject " on the 
art side rather than on the scientific side," so that 
it may be of as thoroughly practical and useful a 
character as possible. Still, the underlying science 
he has carefully kept in mind. The art of the ex- 
perienced teacher and of the experienced teacher 
of teachers is apparent in the minuteness of the 
discussion, and in the detail with which the analysis 
is carried out. While this minutiae and detail may 
commend the book to many private readers, it will 
not conduce to its popularity as a text-book, at least 
in the United States. Like all the new books of 
like character, this one emphasizes the study and 
teaching of English. Mr. Landon pronounces the 
neglect of the study of the subject in England " aston- 
ishing" ; and he fortifies his general argument with 
this neat quotation : " That a language should be, as 
English is, so apt and clear in expression as to com- 
mend itself to almost universal use, so wide and full 
in its capacity to voice high thought and deep feeling 
as to win universal acclaim, and yet should be com- 
paratively worthless for the training of Us own chil- 
dren, is a paradox that falls below the dignity of 
a tolerable joke."

ica," a quarterly magazine of bibliography in its

plan of publication is certainly novel. The first 
number made its appearance early in April, and the

tions are only received for the complete set of twelve 
parts, payable yearly in advance. Only as many 
sets will be issued as are subscribed for in advance, 
and subscribers are thus guaranteed against broken 
sets and depreciation in value. The publishers be- 
lieve that an opportunity has now presented itself 
to give to those interested a series of papers by 
writers of authority on various points of book-lore 
which require special treatment, without being of 
sufficient importance to be made the subject of sep- 
arate works. A special feature in the magazine 
will be the admission of articles in French as well 
as English. In Part I., Mr. W. Y. Fletcher writes 
on " A Copy of Celsus from the Library of Gro- 
lier"; Mr. Charles I. Elton on "Christina of Swe- 
den and her Books "; M. Octave Uzanne on " La 
Bibliophile Moderne "; Mr. E. Gordon Duff on 
" The Stationers at the Sign of the Trinity "; Mr. 
Alfred W. Pollard on "The Books of Hours of 
Geoffroy Tory "; while Mr. Andrew Lang writes 
felicitously about " Names and Notes in Books." 
Names are to be preferred to book-plates, Mr. Lang 
thinks, and he finds appropriate and inoffensive 
such pointed notes as that written by Sir Walter 
Scott on a fly-leaf of Maule's " History of the Picts ": 
" Very rare, therefore worth a guinea ; very sense- 
less, therefore not worth a shilling." A word must 
be added in commendation of the decorative ini- 
tials and tail-pieces specially designed by Mr. Lau- 
rence Housman. To the individual collector, the 
librarian, the professional bibliographer, and the 
book-lover, if not to the general reader, "Biblio- 
graphica " will not make its appeal in vain. 

"My Paris Note -Book" (Lippin- 
cott), an aftermath of memories by 
that amusing quidnunc who set us 
all guessing some months ago with his " An En- 
glishman in Paris," should find favor with lovers 
of light literature. Like its predecessor, the book 
is a racy medley of stories and pen-pictures of nota- 
ble people Louis Napoleon, Renan, Thiers, Victor 
Emmanuel, GreVy, Simon, de Kock, MM. Erckmann- 
Chatrian, de Musset, etc. From the mass of quo- 
table matter we select one extract a caustic news- 
paper hit at Thiers : "The Minister of the Interior 
is no doubt the man who in a given time can ' spout ' 
the greatest number of words and ' squirt ' the 
largest number of verbal blue-bottles upon the air. 
He is, moreover, the man who can talk for the 
longest period without taking ti'ouble to think. As 
a rule, one idea is all-sufficient for him ; one idea, 
and a tumbler of water with a lump of sugar in it. 
With these, M. Thiers will go on prating for twenty- 
four hours at a stretch, like the skilful wire-drawer 
who from an ounce of metal will produce twenty- 
four leagues of wire." The book is a capital one 
for dog-day reading, and contains a good many odds 
and ends of curious information withal.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. Mark Samuel, of Columbia College, publishes 
"The Amateur Aquarist" (Baker & Taylor Co.), a lit- 
tle book of instructions on the subject of aquaria. The 
preface, commendably brief, is as follows: "A collec- 
tion of simply-expressed suggestions to amateur aquar- 
ists is all this book claims to be. Its descriptions are 
terse, tried, and true." The book gives full and exact 
information about the collection of fresh-water fishes 
and plants, and tells how they are to be kept alive and 
in good health. It is simply written and well illustrated. 

What is described as a " first series " of " Fairy Tales 
from the Arabian Nights " comes to us with the imprints 
of Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. and Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons. The text is selected from Galland, and edited 
virginibus puerisque by Miss E. Dixon, of Girton College. 
There are fifteen tales in this volume, among them be- 
ing the seven voyages of Sindbad, whose name is un- 
accountably printed " Sinbad." The illustrations of the 
book, by Mr. J. D. Batten, are its most striking feature, 
and are very artistic, particularly the five full-page 
plates. We hope that there will be as many more se- 
ries of this work as there are " Nights " to fill them. 
Among books for the young not one in a hundred de- 
serves such hearty commendation as this. 

We quote the preface of Mr. T. M. Clark's " Build- 
ing Superintendence " (Macmillan) as the best descrip- 
tion of a work of value so approved that it has now 
reached its twelfth edition. " This is not a treatise on 
the architectural art, or the science of construction, but 
a simple exposition of the ordinary practice of building 
in this country, with suggestions for supervising such 
work efficiently. Architects of experience probably know 
already nearly everything that the book contains, but 
their younger brethren, as well as those persons not of 
the profession who are occasionally called upon to di- 
rect building operations, will perhaps be glad of its 
help." 

Mr. Frederick Jones Bliss, in " A Mound of Many 
Cities " (Macmillan), describes the excavations carried 
on from 1890 to 1893 by officers of the Palestine Ex- 
ploration Fund at Tell el Hesy, a mound situated in 
Judsea, between Hebron and Gaza. The Tell in ques- 
tion was about sixty feet high, and was found to con- 
tain the ruins of no less than eight cities, in superim- 
posed strata. The conjectural chronology of these 
cities, fairly well supported by the evidence, ranges 
from about 1700 B.C. to 400 B.C. The book is extra- 
ordinarily interesting; hardly less so to the general 
reader than to the archaeologist and historian. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, June 25, 1894. 

The death of Howard Seely by his own hand at the 
home of his parents in Brooklyn last Friday night was 
a severe shock to his many friends among the younger 
men of letters in this city. Only a few of them knew 
that he was subject to recurrent attacks of insanity, 
especially in the early summer of each year. At other 
times he preserved a cheerful interested manner which 
endeared him to all who knew him. Edward Howard 
Seely, Jr., to give his full name, was a member of the 
Class of 1878 at Yale, where he distinguished himself 
in literary work, becoming one of the editors of the 



"Yale Literary Magazine." Two years later he grad- 
uated at the Columbia law school, but overstudy brought 
on attacks of nervous prostration and he was obliged to 
abandon his profession. He then travelled in Texas 
and through the Southwest, and thus gained the mate- 
rial which he made use of in his stories, which some- 
what resemble in scope and character those of Mr. 
Owen Wister. Mr. Seely's first volume, " A Lone Star 
Bo-peep, and Other Tales of Texan Ranch Life," was 
published in 1885, and has been followed by " A Ranch- 
man's Stories,"" A Nymph of the West," "The Jonah of 
Lucky Valley,' 1 and one or two others. He was a mem- 
ber of the Authors Club, and for sometime held an as- 
sistant-editorship on the newly-revived " Peterson's Mag- 
azine," for which he wrote quite freely. 

"The Publisher's Weekly" prints a report of the 
proceedings in the German Reichstag in relation to the 
Copyright treaty with this country, referred to in my 
letter of May 1. In reply to the petition to annul the 
treaty on account of the unfairness of the Copyright 
Act to Germans, the Royal Commissioner, Dr. Leh- 
mann, " advised strongly against annulling the treaty, as 
by so doing the branches now fully protected (music, 
art works, maps, etc.) would again fall into the hands 
of ruthless plunderers without anything being gained 
for authors or publishers of books. He hoped that lit- 
tle by little the terms of contract could be modified, 
and felt sure that Americans themselves would realize 
more and more the weaknesses of the Copyright Act, 
for which so many had made so brave a struggle, sub- 
mitting to the restriction of the unsatisfactory clause 
only because without it the whole Copyright question 
would again have dropped for years. After a short de- 
bate, in which all the speakers showed a remarkably 
full knowledge of the situation, it was decided to refer 
the proceedings and further action to the Reichskanzler." 
This would indicate a conciliatory attitude on the part 
of the German government, and that little is to be feared 
from the recent aggressiveness of German publishers. 

The " Overheard in Arcady " of Mr. Robert Bridges, 
so warmly praised by your reviewer, has reached a sec- 
ond edition, of which the Messrs. Dent & Co. of Lon- 
don will be the English publishers. The American pub- 
lishers of this book, Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, 
are to bring out in book form the lectures recently de- 
livered at Oxford by Mr. James A. Froude on the Life 
and Writings of Erasmus. This firm will also publish 
in America Mr. Gladstone's translations of the odes of 
Horace. 

It is interesting to learn that Mr. Theodore Stanton, 
who was the resident commissioner in France of the 
Columbian Exposition, has been invited to prepare the 
European chapter for the official history of the Fair to 
be published by the Federal government. Among the 
contributors to this chapter will be the Hon. Andrew D. 
White, American minister to Russia, and Col. Freder- 
ick D. Grant, ex-minister to Austria. Mr. Stanton is 
also busily engaged on a series of lectures on the third 
French republic, which are to be delivered at Cornell 
University and later at the University of Wisconsin. 

Some of the friends and admirers of Walt Whitman 
who have for some time met annually at Philadelphia 
on the occasion of his birthday, inaugurated at their 
last meeting, May 31, a Walt Whitman Fellowship, 
which is intended to be international in character. The 
purpose of the association is not entirely literary, but 
for human advancement according to Whitman's ideas. 
Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, of Philadelphia, has been chosen

The removal of the firm of Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 
from 1, 3, and 5 Bond street to 72 Fiftlj avenue, where 
they will occupy the new building at the( northwest cor- 
ner of Fifth avenue and Thirteenth street, is in har- 
mony with the uptown movement of Ifew York pub- 
lishers. When the founder of the house Daniel Ap- 
pleton came to New York from Boston) in 1825, he be- 
gan the importation of English books in connection with 
other business in Exchange Place. The book business 
was in charge of his oldest son, Willianj Henry Apple- 
ton, the present head of the firm, who has well earned 
his title as the Nestor of American publishers, occupy- 
ing as he does in this country a place! similar to that 
held by the late John Murray in England. After a 
short stay in Exchange Place, Daniel Appleton removed 
to Clinton Hall, Beekman street, and devoted himself 
entirely to the importation and sale of books. In 1835 
William H. Appleton was sent to Loidon, where he 
founded an agency. The first publishing venture of the 
firm was a little 32mo book called " Daily Crumbs from 
the Master's Table," issued in 1831. In January, 1838, 
William H. Appleton was taken into partnership, and 
the firm removed to 200 Broadway. In 1848 Daniel 
Appleton retired, and W. H. Appleton formed a part- 
nership with his brother, John Adams Appleton. Three 
other sons subsequently became partners Daniel Sid- 
ney, George Swett, and Samuel Francis. The business 
was removed from 200 Broadway to the old Society 
Library building at Broadway and Leonard street. The 
next removal of the firm was to 443-5 Broadway. 
Later a building was erected at 94 Grand street, corner 
of Green, and occupied for some years until a change 
was made to 549-51 Broadway. About 1880 Messrs. 
Appleton removed to 1, 3, and 5 Bond street. Each 
one of these periods has witnessed some increase and 
development. There are now five members of the firm 
Messrs. William H. Appleton, William W. Appleton, 
Daniel Appleton, Edward Dale Appleton, and D. Sid- 
ney Appleton. ARTHUR STEDMAN.

The^Rev. Stopford A. Brooke will give a course of 
lectures at the Lowell Institute in the autumn. Apro- 
pos of this subject, the " London Literary World " sup- 
plies an anxious correspondent with the following extra- 
ordinary information: "The Lowell Lectures are anew 
foundation, in commemoration of the late James Rus- 
sell Lowell, and in connection with the new University 
at Chicago. Professor Drummond was the lecturer last 
year, and his course formed the basis of ' The Lowell 
Lectures on the Ascent of Man,' which has just been 
published." 

A writer in the " Revue de Paris " tells the following 
anecdote of Baudelaire: "Passing the shop of a coal- 
dealer one evening, he saw the proprietor, in a back 
room, seated at the table with his family. He seemed 
happy ; the cloth was white ; the wine smiled in the fla- 
gons. Baudelaire entered. The dealer came towards 
him, obsequious, delighted at a customer, awaiting or- 
ders. ' Is that yours, all that coal ? ' he asked. The 
man nodded in affirmation, not understanding. ' And 
all those piles of wood ? ' The man assented again, 
thinking the purchaser undecided. 'And that, is it 
coke ? is that charcoal ? Is that yours, too ? ' Baud- 
elaire examined carefully all the heaped-up merchand- 
ise ; then, looking the dealer in the face : < What, that 
is all yours ! And you do not asphyxiate yourself ? ' * 

The Western Reserve University has conferred the 
honorary degree of Doctor of Laws upon Professor C. 
A. Young, Professor Thomas D. Seymour, and Mr. John 
Hay. A brief Latin address was given in each case. 
Colonel Hay was described in these terms: " Johannis 
Hay, vir ingeniosus et liberalitate sua de hac universi- 
tate optime meritus, in rebus publicis, potissimum in

PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN TURKEY. 
The Turkish papers are publishing some statistics to 
illustrate the great progress of public instruction in 
Turkey under the present Sultan. Since his accession 
the increase in the number of schools is estimated at 
25,000, said to be attended by a million and a quarter 
scholars of both sexes. It is difficult to ascertain what 
the number formerly was, but there is no doubt the in- 
crease is great. This is largely due to the measures 
taken by the late Sultans, Abd ul Mejid and Abd ul 
Aziz, in laying the foundation of a Ministry of Instruc- 
tion, which of late years have been bearing fruit. The 
progress is also greatly due to the successful working 
of the reform of the administration of pious or eccles- 
iastical foundations. Thus, not only have numerous 
mosques and schools been founded, particularly in con- 
nection with the large immigration of refugees, and re-

ligious fervor aroused, but the revenues of the local

CHARLES HENRY PEARSON. 

Mr. Charles Henry Pearson, the author of " National 
Life and Character," died on the 29th of May. He 
was born in 1830, became a fellow of Oriel College, 
Oxford, in 1854, and held this place until 1872, when 
he married, and emigrated to Australia. In 1892 he 
returned to England. He was the author of numerous 
historical works, and took high rank as an educator. 
One of his friends writes of him in these terms: "He 
was a most indefatigable worker his whole life long. 
He had a most marvellous memory, and a most rapid 
power of generalization from the long array of facts 
and precedents which marshalled themselves spontan- 
eously before his mind when called upon to pronounce 
judgment. He was a profound classical scholar, but 
his knowledge of modern literature, English as well as 
Continental, was equally remarkable. He was acquainted 
with most of the modern European languages, and en- 
joyed Ibsen and Gogol in the original no less than Vic- 
tor Hugo and Goethe. As a newspaper writer he dis- 
tinguished himself by the possession of a most earnest 
and trenchant style, which he was able at will to vary 
with the most racy banter. His conversation was always 
striking and fascinating. His manner seemed at first 
sight somewhat cold, but his unruffled exterior concealed 
the warmest and truest of hearts. He especially de- 
lighted in the society of the young, and he would spare 
no pains to put an earnest student on the right track. 
As a politician, he was feared by his political opponents 
on account of his knowledge and intellectual power; he 
inspired absolute trust and confidence in his own party. 
He was regarded by both sides as absolutely incorrupt- 
ible." 

THE FINAL HONOR SCHOOL OF ENGLISH AT OXFORD. 

We are indebted to the New York " Evening Post " 
for the following paragraph : 

Liberality and progress have made two great strides 
in the University of Oxford. A last attack upon the 
establishment of the eighth final school, the " Final 
Honour School of English Language and Literature," 
was defeated in congregation on May 1, when the form 
of statute establishing the new school was promulgated, 
and its preamble was finally adopted by 120 placets 
against 46 non-placets. The details of this statute are 
now open to amendment, but the establishment of the 
school is assured. The preamble adopted runs as fol- 
lows: " Whereas it is expedient to establish a Final 
Honour School of English Language and Literature, 
the University enacts as follows." This school must 
include authors " belonging to the different periods of 
English literature," and " the history of the English 
language and the history of English literature." Spe- 
cial subjects " falling within or usually studied in con- 
nection with the English language and literature " are 
also provided for. Candidates must have studied their 
authors " (1) with reference to the forms of the lan- 
guage, (2) as examples of literature, and (3) in their 
relation to the history and thought of the period to 
which they belong." The study of Anglo-Saxon, and 
of the relation of English to " the languages with which 



it is etymologically connected," and of the history of 
English literature, is made the centre of the whole school, 
and a board of at least twenty examiners is provided 
for. Their duty shall be " to see that, as far as possi- 
ble, equal weight is given to language and literature " 
in the conduct of the examination, " provided always 
that candidates who offer special subjects shall be at 
liberty to choose subjects connected either with lan- 
guage or with literature or with both."

MY PARIS NOTE BOOK. 

By the Author of " An Englishman in Paris." 12mo, cloth. Price, $1.25. 

Were it possible to surpass in sensational interest the author's earlier volume, we should say that these startling revela- 
tions of the opinions, ambitions, and secrets of the Emperor Louis Napoleon have accomplished it. The book is compact 
throughout of alluring matter, and will win a world-wide audience. 



BARABBAS. 

A Dream of the World's Tragedy. By MARIE CORELLI. 
12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

" A book which aroused in some quarters more violent hostility than 
any book of recent years. By most secular critics the authoress was 
accused of bad taste, bad art, and gross blasphemy ; but in curious con- 
trast, most of the religious papers acknowledged the reverence of treat- 
ment and the dignity of conception which characterized the work." 
London Athenaeum. 

AN INITIAL EXPERIENCE, 

And Other Stories. Edited by Captain CHARLES KING. 
12mo, paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 

"This is an unusual collection of short stories. They are soldier 
stories, nearly all written by officers of the army, and giving pictures 
of army life. Captain King, of course, is the master of them all, but he 
puts in only a little sketch of his own, and in his preface gives abund- 
ant credit to his brother officers." Philadelphia Times.

John Strange Winter, the nom de guerre of Mrs. Arthur 
Stannard, was adopted by the advice of the publishers of her 
first books, and it was only when " Bootle's Baby " appeared 
that it became known who the author really was. Since that 
time a number of excellent novels have issued from her pen ; 
they deal with garrison life, and show an excellent under- 
standing of the surroundings of the British officer and the 
social conditions of the army. 



THE 

MYSTERY OF THE PATRICIAN CLUB. 

12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

" The man who could write 'An Englishman in Paris ' must be enter- 
taining, no matter under what guise he appeared. Albert D. Vandam 
has a rare gift of making himself interesting. In his last work, ' The 
Mystery of the Patrician Club,' he reaches the perfection of his art."

THE GILBERT AND SULLIVAN OPERAS. 

Described by PERCY FITZGERALD, M. A., F. S. A. l'2mo, 

cloth, with 60 Illustrations, $1.25. 

To the Gilbert and Sullivan operas play-goers are indebted 
for many an agreeable hour and innumerable laughter-mov- 
ing quips. It was thought, therefore, that some record of 
them would be welcome, and here is gathered together every- 
thing about the plays, authors, and performers that is likely 
to be interesting. To assure the reliability of the volume, it 
may be said that the author received assistance from the 
ablest source, namely, Mr. W. S. Gilbert and Mr. and Mrs. 
D'Oyly Carte.

By ROBERT K. DOUGLAS, Keeper of the Oriental Books and 
Manuscripts in the British Museum, Professor of Chinese 
at King's College, Oxford. 8vo, Mandarin cloth, Illus- 
trated, $4.50. 

An account of the every-day life of the Chinese people 
social, political, and religious. This volume gives a compre- 
hensive and almost exhaustive account of the Chinese Em- 
pire by one who thoroughly understands it. Beyond the 
knowledge he acquired during a residence of several years, 
Mr. Douglas's materials are drawn from the writings of the 
Chinese themselves, and also from their romances and novels.

ENGLISH IN A FRENCH UNIVERSITY. 

The proceedings of the International Con- 
gress of Education, held in Chicago last sum- 
mer, have just been published in a carefully- 
edited volume of a thousand pages. The work 
is an almost inexhaustible storehouse of inform- 
ation and comment upon most subjects of cur- 
rent educational interest, and ought to prove 
helpful and stimulating in the highest degree 
to the thousands of teachers into whose hands 
it will come. One department in particular, 
that devoted to the subject of Higher Educa- 
tion, is noteworthy for the breadth and schol- 
arly character of the papers and discussions 
included. There are addresses by Presidents 
Gilman, Kellogg, Raymond, Low, Angell, Jor- 
dan, and Keane, by Professors Hale, Shorey, 
West, Wilson, and Sproull. Upon some of 
these addresses we commented at the time of 



the Congress, and are glad to see that perma- 
nent form has now been given them. But our 
special purpose just now is to direct attention 
to the paper on " The Study of English Liter- 
ature in French Universities," prepared for the 
Congress by M. Chevrillon of the Lille Fac- 
ulte des Lettres, but, owing to some misunder- 
standing, not read, and now made public for 
the first time. 

Few who have not made a special investiga- 
tion of the subject have any idea of the im- 
mense achievement of the Third French Repub- 
lic in the reorganization of public instruction. 
To the thinking mind, the work done in this 
direction is greater and more significant than 
the work of political or of military or of social 
reorganization. But it is not of a nature to 
attract public attention, and is practically un- 
known outside of France. M. Chevrillon gives 
us an amusing illustration of the attitude of 
the foreigner in this matter : 

" I remember, a few years ago, reading an article in 
the great English Philistine paper < The Daily Tele- 
graph' in wl ich it was said that the great majority 
of French people thought that Shakespeare was a lieu- 
tenant of Wellington, who had helped him to win the 
battle of Waterloo. Now, this was unfortunate, as not 
less than four plays of Shakespeare had just been per- 
formed in Paris. But the prejudice tinder which the 
writer in ' The Daily Telegraph ' was laboring is per- 
fectly natural, when we notice that a nation never knows 
what its neighbor is, but what it was twenty years ago." 

This closing statement is only too true when 
applied to knowledge of any other than the 
spectacular aspect of life in a neighboring coun- 
try, and it is peculiarly true of so unobtrusive 
a thing as education. A quarter of a century 
ago, when the French nation had sunk to its 
lowest level in the degration of a sham impe- 
rialism, when the frenzied populace was shout- 
ing " a Berlin ! " and thought the Prussian 
capital really lay just across the Rhine, the 
stricture of the English journalist might have 
been taken as approximately true ; to-day, how- 
ever seriously meant, it becomes the merest 
jest. 

Turning now to the specific subject of M. 
Chevrillon's article, we will first reproduce his 
account of the educational position of English 
in the sixties. 

" Twenty or thirty years ago, French boys and stu- 
dents wrote better Latin verse than they do now, but 
of English literature they knew nothing, except the 



28 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



names of Shakespeare, Milton, and Byron. Our great 
arch-critic, M. Sarcey, says that they made fun of Taine 
at the Ecole Normale because he was reading English. 
Foreign literatures were, indeed, supposed to be taught ; 
but any man who had graduated in classics, whether he 
knew English or not, was supposed to be good enough 
for that kind of work. When he left the Ecole Nor- 
male, after a course of studies in Plato and Aristotle, 
he would receive notice that he was appointed professor 
of foreign literatures, and had to begin work at once. 
One of these, I believe, it was who was complaining of 
the difficulties of. his task. ' What a language,' he said, 
' English is to pronounce ! They write Boz and they 
pronounce Dickens.' M. Ernest Lavisse, who has seen 
this generation of professors of English literature, was 
telling me, the other day, the following authentic and 
typical fact: When he was a student at Nancy, at the 
faculty of letters he heard a lecture on the literature of 
England in the sixteenth century. After three-quarters 
of an hour the professor had exhausted his subject, but 
his time was not up. ' Gentlemen,' he said, pulling out 
his watch, ' we have a quarter of an hour yet. We have 
time to do Shakespeare.'" 

Let us contrast the state of affairs thus hinted 
at with the present requirements for a student 
of English. After leaving the lycee, he regis- 
ters with one of the faculties, and begins to 
specialize. The licence and the agregation 
are the two stages of the work now before him. 
The lycee has given him the baccalaureate de- 
gree ; the licence (which means two years' work) 
may be taken as fairly equivalent to the degree 
of master ; and the agregation (which means 
two years or more of further work) as stand- 
ing for the German or American doctorate. 
The work of the licence candidate is thus de- 
scribed : 

" Side by side with the classics, he may take up En- 
glish or German literature, philosophy, history, or clas- 
sical philology. Every candidate for the licence has to 
write a French essay on French literature, a Latin es- 
say on Latin literature. Then, according to the spe- 
cialty he has selected, he writes papers on historical or 
philosophical subjects, or translations from French into 
English or German, or from English or German into 
French. The viva voce examination consists, for all can- 
didates, in questions on French, Latin, and Greek liter- 
ature, and extempore translations from the classics ; and 
for those of the candidates who make English a special 
subject, in questions on English literature, and transla- 
tions into English and French of the French and En- 
glish authors on the programme." 

The first of the two years required for the 
licence, the student works at the university. 

" During this first year, the chief purpose of the En- 
glish professor is not so much to acquaint him with the 
whole field of English literature as to give him an insight 
into the spirit, the genius, of English literature, and to 
make him feel the artistic element in the great writers. 
A French youth, fresh from his Tacitus, his Racine, and 
his Voltaire, cannot, unless he has great natural talent, 
understand, or rather, feel at once Carlyle or Tennyson, 
whis is done through minute translations, the aim of 
Thich is not to acquaint the student with new words or 



new constructions, but to teach him how to find those 
French forms that will best express something of the 
beauty peculiar to the original English text. The ten- 
dency is thus to develop the artistic sense in the stu- 
dent, and to give him a mastery of his own language. 
At the last examination for the licence, at Lille, the En- 
glish translation being Milton's ' II Penseroso,' several 
candidates were dropped who had understood every 
word and the literal meaning of the text, but it was 
clear from their translations that they had not felt the 
spirit of Milton's poem, or had failed to express it." 

The second year of preparation for the li- 
cence is spent in absentia, the students being- 
sent to England for twelve months. 

"They remain correspondents of the university; that 
is to say, they have to send papers to the professors of 
French, Greek, and Latin, thus preparing themselves 
for those general parts of the licence which are demanded 
of all candidates to the degree. With the English pro- 
fessor they of course correspond also, and the main 
thing that he requires them to do is to steep themselves 
in English life to go to the theatres, sermons, public 
meetings, to see English university life, to make English 
friends, to think in English, to assume English forms 
of habit and prejudices in short, for one year to throw 
off the Frenchman, to make themselves Englishmen, and 
to step out of the natural limits of the national mind 
and sensibility. After this experience, when they come 
back to France and settle into the old man again, they 
have become able to look at English writers from the 
English point of view." 

The work of this Wander jahr is perhaps the 
most admirable feature of the French system. 
The force with which such men as Montes- 
quieu and Voltaire brought English ideals to 
bear upon French thought was the consequence 
of the protracted visits of these men to En- 
gland, and much may be expected, in the way 
of a sympathetic comprehension of English 
thought, from this yearly sending of picked 
men from the French faculties to England, for 
the purpose of studying English life and liter- 
ature upon their own soil. 

The work of the agregation is essentially the 
work of preparation for a professorship in a 
government lycee. Since the number of candi- 
dates is much greater than the number of places 
to be filled, competition becomes keen and the 
tests applied are very severe. A new list of 
authors and works is prepared each year, and 
every candidate for the agregation has fitted 
himself for examination on two or more of these 
lists. A specimen programme offered by M. 
Chevrillon begins with " Piers Plowman " and 
ends with " Richard Feverel." It includes works 
of Spenser, Greene, Shakespeare, Sir Thomas 
Browne, Pope, Cowper, Burke, Byron, Lan- 
dor, and Tennyson. 

" By their fruits ye shall know them." The 
fruits of this system are found in such works,

now rapidly multiplying, as M. Angelier's vol- 
ume of twelve hundred pages on the work, life, 
and surroundings of Robert Burns, M. Bel- 
jame's work on English men of letters and their 
public in the eighteenth century, and M. Jus- 
serand's book on English wayfaring life in the 
eighteenth century. M. Chevrillon claims for 
the study of English that it opens for French 
students 

4t a vast field of interesting, often passionating, artistic 
literature, instinct with the loftiest ideals, with the deep- 
est human sympathy ; full of pathos, of feeling, of life ; 
full of the sense of the good, of the righteous, of reli- 
gious earnestness, as ours is full with the sense of the 
true and of the beautiful one of the most powerful 
to instill into a young mind the germs that will develop 
upwards. . . The modern novels of England, the pure, 
idealistic utterances of a Carlyle, of a Tennyson, of an 
Emerson, are among the greatest means of education 
of the present time. Of course, the first thing for a 
Frenchman for every man is to remain in contact 
with his own race; to read those writers of the past 
that have moulded the soul and mind of his own nation, 
and those writers of the present that discuss the pro- 
blems which the people of his own blood have to solve 
in order to live on and to transmit to their posterity 
the national inheritance. But when he has done that, 
let him turn to those foreign books in which he finds 
an ideal, a philosophy, an aesthetics views of life 
widely different from those which prevail in the French 
books of his own time. The national ideal will then 
ease to appear to him as a central one toward which 
the whole universe ought to be moved. On that day 
when he becomes able to enjoy a novel of Eliot as well 
as a novel of Flaubert nay, on that day when he en- 
joys the very difference between the two types of novel 
let him be a business man or a bourgeois, he is a man 
of broader culture, in the true sense of the word, than 
the scholar who devotes his life to the study of the da- 
tive case." 

It is the spirit of M. Chevrillon's paper, even 
more than the matter, that makes it note- 
worthy, and it may not be amiss to wish that a 
little more of this spirit were infused into the 
English instruction given at our own univer- 
sities. 



ENGLISH IN THE UNIVERSITY 
OF CALIFORNIA* 



The teaching force in English in the University of 
California consists of six men: three instructors, Messrs. 
Armes, Syle, and Sanford; an assistant professor, Dr. 
A. F. Lange, in charge of the courses in linguistics; a 
professor of Rhetoric, Mr. C. B. Bradley; and a pro-

fessor of the English Language and Literature, who is 
head of the department. For the year 1894-5 the de- 
partment offers thirty-one courses. Of these, twenty- 
four, covering seventy-five hours of work (slightly more 
than three hours a week each for half the year), are 
designed for undergraduates, and seven (of two hours 
a week each) for graduates. There are in the univer- 
sity 1369 students, of whom 820, attending the Acad- 
emic and Technical Colleges in Berkeley, fall to a 
greater or less extent within the jurisdiction of the 
English department. Last year, including the class 
of 317 Freshmen, there were, during the first term, 
sixty per cent of the students in Berkeley in the En- 
glish classes; during the year there were about seventy 
per cent. The total enrollment of students in English 
courses during the first term was 873, of whom 397, or 
forty-eight per cent of the students in Berkeley, were 
taking more than one course in English. 

In the .consideration of University work in any line, 
four things must be taken into account: the specific pre- 
paration with which students enter, the equipment and 
administration of the department in question, the organ- 
ization of studies, and the methods of instruction and 
investigation. 

In the matter of entrance requirements in English 
the University has adopted an increasingly high stand- 
ard. It calls for a High School course of at least 
three years, at the rate of five hours a week ; and it ad- 
vocates, and from some schools secures, a four years' 
course. These requirements can scarcely be described, 
as in the fourth article of this series, as similar to those 
of the New England Association. The requirements of 
that Association, so far as they go, are similar to those 
of California; but they do not go more than two-thirds 
of the way in extent or in stringency. There is noth- 
ing, to my knowledge, in the English requirements of 
other universities that is equivalent to our course in 
Greek, Norse, and German mythology as illustrated by 
English literature (required of all applicants for admis- 
sion), or to the course in Arguments and Orations 
(hitherto, three of Burke's) or to the course in English 
poetry which covers some twenty-five of the longer mas- 
terpieces. These are additional to the usual requirements 
in essay, drama, and narrative. While this preparatory 
work in literature is generally well done, the work in 
rhetoric and composition is not yet up to the mark. 
Our system of examining and accrediting schools is, 
however, so strict, and the supervision of English teach- 
ing in the schools so minute, that we look for decided 
improvement, within a reasonable period, in the matter 
of composition. The department does not content itself 
with requiring a satisfactory test-composition of stu- 
dents at matriculation; for, although that would be an 
easy way of shifting the burden from the University to 
the schools, it is but a poor substitute for the pedagog- 
ical assistance due to the schools. With the annual ap- 
plication for accrediting in English, each school is re- 
quired to send for inspection samples of compositions and 
other exercises written by pupils of all classes. If these 
samples are satisfactory, the school is visited by one of

the professors of English, who carefully scrutinizes the 
work of teachers and pupils. The department is con- 
servative in accrediting; and English is generally con- 
sidered to be the most difficult study in the curriculum 
of the schools of California. Non-accredited pupils are, 
of course, subjected to the usual entrance examination 
in literature, rhetoric, and composition. In addition to 
this labor. of supervision, the professors of English have 
recently published for the guidance of teachers a pam- 
phlet entitled " English in the Secondary Schools," out- 
lining the preparatory course, indicating the proper se- 
quence of studies, and suggesting methods of instruc- 
tion.* 

With regard to the equipment and administration of 
the department, while the divisions of rhetoric, lin- 
guistics, and literature and criticism are severally rep- 
resented by Professor Bradley, Professor Lange, and 
myself, and while each of the instructors is held re- 
sponsible for a certain subject and certain sections of 
students, it is the policy of the department to observe 
a reasonable Lehrfreiheit. This it accomplishes, first, 
by maintaining a conservative rotation (say, once in 
three years) of the teachers in charge of courses in- 
volving drill and routine; and, secondly, by encourag- 
ing each teacher of preliminary courses, when once he 
has his prescribed work well in hand, to offer at least 
one elective higher course. Accordingly, of our instruc- 
tors, Mr. Armes offers the courses in the History of the 
Drama, and in Nineteenth Century Poets; Mr. Syle in 
Literature of the Eighteenth Century, and Mr. San- 
ford in Spenser, and in the Romantic movement. That 
the same man should teach the elements of style, or of 
literary history, or should correct themes, year in and 
year out, is, even though texts and methods be varied, 
pedagogical suicide. The plan here described does 
much to counteract the insensibility, or disgust, that 
frequently attends prolonged indulgence in the habit 
of theme-correcting. We find also that the occasional 
conduct of preliminary courses acts as a tonic upon 
teachers habituated to higher, and graduate, courses. 
While in all cases the specialty is still pursued, the field 
of information is widened, methods are liberalized, and 
the zest of teaching is enhanced by the adoption of the 
principle of Lehrfreiheit. 

The administration of the department is republican. 
Each instructor is independent within his sphere of ac- 
tivity. When, as in the matter of texts or methods, 
concerted action is necessary, the decision is made by 
the instructors concerned, subject to the approval of the 
head of the department. The advisability of new courses, 
the scope and form of the annual announcement, and 
matters of general departmental policy, are discussed 
at the appropriate monthly meeting of the English fac- 
ulty. Ordinarily, and primarily, however, the depart- 
ment meets as a Critical Thought Club. The purpose 
of the club is to keep abreast of recent contributions to 
comparative literature, philology, aesthetics, and educa- 
tional theory. The field of reading is apportioned among 
the members, and informal reports are had on books and 
articles bearing in any way upon the study of English. 

The organization of studies in a department is per- 
haps a surer index of the purpose of instruction than 
any carefully formulated statement of aims. The En-

methods of secondary instruction is perhaps novel, it may be 
well to say that teachers in the public schools may obtain

glish courses are classified as Preliminary and Higher. 
The Preliminary Courses, whether prescribed or elect- 
ive, are prerequisite to all advanced work. They at- 
tempt to furnish (1) the principles of style and the prac- 
tice of written and oral composition; (2) the common- 
places of literary tradition; and (3) a synoptic view of 
English literature by the study of the principal authors. 
The Higher Courses are subdivided in the usual way, 
as primarily for juniors and seniors, and primarily for 
graduates. 

The Preliminary Courses are announced as Types of 
English Prose Style, Supplementary Reading, Practical 
Rhetoric, English Masterpieces, General History of En- 
glish Literature, and Argumentation. The first is re- 
quired, at the rate of four hours a week through the 
year, of all freshmen in the academic colleges; the sec- 
ond (one hour any two consecutive terms) of non-clas- 
sical students in these colleges. The third and the fourth 
are prescribed in the Colleges of Chemistry and Agri- 
culture. All other English courses are elective; and in 
the Engineering Colleges English is altogether elective. 
Of prescribed preliminary courses, that in English Prose 
Style aims to acquaint the student, at first hand, with 
the features and elements of effective workmanship in 
prose-writing, and to train him to discern the salient 
qualities of any well-marked prose style presented for 
his consideration. The course is based upon the direct 
study of selected groups of authors. The course entitled 
Supplementary Reading extends, as far as time will per- 
mit, the acquaintance of the student with the Hellenic, 
Teutonic, or Romance Epics, or other classics in trans- 
lation. It serves as an introduction to the common and 
traditional store of literary reference, allusion, and im- 
agery, and as a basis for paragraph-writing. This year 
translations of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Beowulf, 
and Morris's Sigurd the Volsung, have been studied. 
These courses, and the course in Practical Rhetoric for 
scientific students, in general serve to stimulate con- 
structive effort and practical skill in writing pari passu 
with analytical effort and the acquisition of information. 
They accordingly include first the weekly exercise in 
paragraph-writing, written in the class-room upon some 
topic not previously announced but involving acquaint- 
ance with the Supplementary Reading assigned for the 
week; and, secondly, a carefully supervised series of com- 
positions. Three themes have been required each term. 
The supervision, which is personal, extends to methods 
of using the Library, of securing material and of taking 
notes in scholarly fashion, to limitation and definition 
of subject; to construction of a scheme of presentation 
in advance of the writing, as well as to careful criticism 
of the finished work. The organization and develop- 
ment of these courses is in large measure due to the 
exertions of Professor Bradley, to whom I am indebted 
for the details of this description. It should be added 
that essays are required in connection with all work in 
the English department. The course in English Mas- 
terpieces for scientific students, given by Mr. Armes, 
involves the careful reading in class of representative 
poems and essays of the foremost writers, and supple- 
mentary reading out of class. Of elective preliminary 
courses, that in the General History of English Litera- 
ture is the sine qua non for all higher work. It presents 
a synoptical view of English literature as the outcome 
of, and the index to, English thought in the course of 
its development. It is accordingly based upon a text- 
book of English history, and the copious reading of au- 
thors illustrative of social and literary movements. It

runs as a three-hour course throughout the Sophomore 
year, and involves the reading by each student, and the 
discussion in class, of some thirty masterpieces. The 
course entitled Argumentation comprises the analysis 
of masterpieces, the preparation of briefs, and the de- 
livery of arguments exemplifying the use of the syllo- 
gism and the exposure of fallacies. It must be preceded 
by a course in formal logic, and is introductory to a 
course in Forensics. 

The Higher Courses for undergraduates are grouped 
as (1) Rhetoric and the Theory of Criticism: four 
courses; (2) Linguistics: four courses, including, be- 
side grammar, history, and criticism, the comparative 
study of the Germanic sources of English culture, and 
Germanic philology; (3) The Historical and Critical 
Study of Literature: eleven courses in chronological 
sequence, by (a) periods, (b) authors, (c) literary move- 
ments, (d) the evolution of types. The first of these 
groups is essential to the other two. It involves the 
differentiation, for advanced work, of rhetoric into its 
species (Exposition, including methods of literary re- 
search and interpretation; Forensics, Narration, etc.), 
and an introduction to the comparative and aesthetic 
methods. A course in Poetics outlines the theory of 
art, the theory and development of literature, the rela- 
tions of poetry and prose, the principles of versification, 
and the canons, inductive and deductive, of dramatic 
criticism. It is usually accompanied by lectures on the 
..Esthetics of Literature. This course is followed by the 
Problems of Literary Criticism: a comparative inquiry 
into the growth, technique, and function of literary types 
other than the drama. The attempt is made to arrive 
by induction at the characteristics common to the na- 
tional varieties of a type, and to formulate these in the 
light of aesthetic theory. The resulting laws are ap- 
plied as canons of criticism to English masterpieces of 
that type. The method has been described by a former 
student in the "Century Magazine," Jan., 1891. The 
reading and discussions are guided by questions, sug- 
gestions, and reference lists part of a manual of Lit- 
erary Theories now in press. For lack of space the 
courses in Linguistics and Literature cannot be enum- 
erated. Students making English their principal study 
must include in their elections Exposition or Linguistics, 
Poetics, Criticism, and the intensive study of at least 
one literary master or one literary type. For the teach- 
er's certificate Linguistics is indispensable. 

The courses primarily for Graduates have a two-fold 
aim: First, to impart information; secondly, and prin- 
cipally, to encourage original research. This differen- 
tiation by purpose is necessarily relative. Under the 
former heading, however, falls one of the philological 
courses, Old Icelandic (Lange). Under the latter falls 
another philological course, First Modern English (an 
investigation into the orthographic, phonetic, and syn- 
tactical changes of Sixteenth Century English (Lange), 
and various literary courses which may be classified as 
aesthetic, comparative, and critical. The course in the 
History of ^Esthetic Theory, which, by the courtesy of 
the professor of philosophy, is at present in my hands, 
is a study at first hand of the principal authorities in 
esthetics, and of the literary art that chiefly influenced 
them. The course may be said to deal with fundamen- 
tal literary forces. It is given both terms and extends 
through three years. This year Plato and Aristotle were 
studied and Plotinus begun. Next year we shall at- 
tempt to come down to Winckelmann. The year after 
we shall begin with Kant. The courses which I have 



called comparative deal with literary movements. They 
are two in number: The Mediaeval Spirit as related to 
Art, its chief exponents in English literature and its 
modern revivals (Bradley) ; and The Influence of Ger- 
many on English literature of the eighteenth and nine- 
teenth centuries (Lange). A purely critical course, deal- 
ing with literary methods, is offered by Professor Brad- 
ley, in the study of the entire production of some author 
of limited scope. 

To graduate courses of information and of research 
might legitimately be added courses having a third pur- 
pose : the encouragement of literary creation. We have 
as yet none such in the University of California, unless 
one denominated Special Study, under which we an- 
nounce ourselves ready to assist and advise compe- 
tent graduates in approved plans of work, may be con- 
strued as sufficient for the emergency. Academic schol- 
arship does not look with favor upon the attempt to 
stimulate or foster creative production. But, if char- 
ily advised, sagaciously circumscribed, and conducted 
under the personal supervision of a competent critic, 
constructive literary effort may surely find a place in 
the curriculum of an exceptional graduate, never, of 
course, unattended by other study with informative or 
disciplinary purpose in view. There is, nowadays, no 
reason why genius should be untutored or its early pro- 
ductions unkempt. 

With regard to methods of instruction no stereotyped 
habit obtains. In our lower classes the text-book is not 
always used. When used it is treated as a guide, not 
as a bible. In both lower and higher classes, recitations, 
reports on reading, discussion of topics, informal or for- 
mal lectures, interpretative reading, and personal con- 
ference prevail, in such combination or with such pref- 
erence as the instructor may deem wise. Students, 
however, are always put to work on the masterpieces 
themselves. 

With regard to methods of investigation, we believe 
that a certain catholicity of attitude not inconsistent 
with alertness should be observed. The present an- 
archy, sometimes tyranny, of method is due generally 
to a deficient organization of studies; and that, in turn, 
to an incomprehensive view of the field. Hence, the 
uncertainty of aim with which instruction in English is. 
frequently reproached. This lack of system is, how- 
ever, indicative only of the fact that literary science is. 
in a transitional stage : no longer static, not yet organic,, 
but dynamic. The study of literature in the sentimen- 
tal, the formally stylistic, or the second-hand-historical 
fashion, is out of date. Scholars in philology narrowed 
to linguistics have set the new pace by making of 
their branch a dynamic study: a study of sources, causes, 
relations, movements, and effects. Professors of liter- 
ature and criticism are now, as rapidly as may be, adapt- 
ing dynamic methods, whether historical or asthetic, to 
their lines of research. But each is naturally liable to 
urge the method that he favors or thinks that he has 
invented. One, therefore, advocates ethical and reli- 
gious exegesis, another sesthetic interpretation, another- 
comparative inquiry, another the historical study of 
style. This is to be expected; and the dynamic, or spo- 
radic, stage of literary science cannot be terminated until, 
by elimination, attrition, and adjustment of results, we 
are ready to substitute something organic. Hospitality 
to ideas and conservative liberality of method will hasten 
the advent of systematic investigation. Even now there 
are those who study the masterpiece, not only in genetic 
relation to author and type, but also in organic relation/ 



32 



THE DIAL

to the social and artistic movements of which author 
and type are integral factors. The sum of the methods 
of any literary inquiry in any college course should be 
exhaustive so far as circumstances permit. The exi- 
gencies of time, training, and material are, however, 
such that due regard, in turn, for Historical Criticism 
(linguistic, textual, genetic), Technical Criticism (dis- 
tinctive of the type: its evolution, characteristic, and 
function), and Literary Criticism (ethical, psychological, 
aesthetic) can rarely be observed in the study of one spec- 
imen with one class. The method, moreover, adapted 
to one author, masterpiece, or type, is not necessarily 
of universal applicability. But the duty of the English 
department in the teaching of literature is fulfilled if 
the student, after mastering the prime courses, with 
their appropriate means and ends, has acquired a syn- 
optic view of literary art and science, an organic method 
of study, and a critical sensitiveness to good literature 

no matter in what intensive spirit it be approached. 

To this end, it is essential that the synthesis of the 
courses and the methods of a department furnish a sys- 
tem. 

With these considerations in mind it is evident that 
the attempt to limit the teaching of English literature 
to " literary history, literary aesthetics, the theory and 
analysis of style, versification, and rhetoric, and the nec- 
essary philological apparatus " would, though attract- 
ive in its apparent simplicity, end in formalism : that is, 
remand the science to its static stage. But the limita- 
tion would be impossible. For form and thought are 
as inseparable in literature as in life: the expression is 
inherent in the idea. To appreciate the art of Dis Ali- 
ter Visum is to understand the ethics of Browning: that 
is, to be a philosopher. Sociological, metaphysical, and 
ethical themes are within the function of the belles- 
lettrist as soon as, emotionalized and clad in aesthetic 
form, they enter the field of letters. Nay, further, the 
methods of the laboratory, chemical or biological, are 
within his function as soon as their adaptation may as- 
sist him to weigh aesthetic values or to trace the devel- 
opment of literary organisms. It is, consequently, un- 
wise to contemn scientific methods, even though in the 
hands of enthusiasts they appear to countervail aesthetic 
interpretation and discipline. Monomaniacs are forces 
in periods of transition. It is for those of far gaze and 
patient temper to compute results and perform the syn- 
thesis. 

One thing is certain: that, for the determination of 
critical principles and methods, organized effort is nec- 
essary. To this end I propose the formation of a So- 
ciety of Comparative Literature, the general scope of 
which will be indicated hereafter.*

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



AN HISTORIAN'S "LITERARY STYLE." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In an article in " The Yale Review " for May, enti- 
tled " Historical Industries," the historian Schouler dis- 
cusses methods of writing history, and, with a glow 
of pride, illustrates from his own experience. Em- 
phasizing his contention that a writer should do his 
work in absolute independence of the help of anyone, 
he says: 

" In fine, every real research, where I have published, and 
every page of composition, has been my own ; and having 
regularly contracted with my publishers to create a book, in- 
stead of hawking about its manuscript when completed, and 
having always been permitted, when ready, to hand my copy 
to the printers, without submitting it to any mortal's inspec- 
tion, I have pursued my own bent, in shaping out the task as 
I had projected it. I have shown my manuscript to no one at 
all for criticism or approval ; nor have I received suggestions, 
even as to literary style and expression, except upon printed 
sheets from the casual proof-reader, as the book went finally 
through the press." 

In view of the above paragraph, one wonders if Mr. 
Schouler has not forgotten his earlier efforts, before he 
could say " my publishers." As one turns back through 
the five volumes of that very useful work, " Schouler's 
History of the United States," he finds such illustra- 
tions of " literary style and expression " as the follow- 
ing : 

" The high horse the ruling party bestrode for the internal 
discipline of the Union at length threatened to cast it. Of 
the approaching catastrophe the first warning came from 
the middle section of the country, where the daring exam- 
ple of Virginia and Kentucky bore ripening fruit." (Vol. 
I., p. 444.) 

"In the fall elections of these New England States, over 
which political excitement ran breakers, Federalism made 
more tangible profit by opposing the new national policy." 
(II., p. 184.) 

" Less submissive was the strain of Boston. The old cradle 
rocked in town meeting with an assemblage of tax-payers 
which adjourned over one night to complete its work. Thomas 
H. Perkins serving as moderator." (II., p. 191.) 

"In 1835 that institution [slavery] was growing and swell- 
ing, though not as yet so large as to rock to and fro and agi- 
tate the chamber of the Constitution, upon whose imprisoning 
walls it finally broke." (IV., p. 203. ) 

"A man whose clear intellect and sense of justice needed 
no swathe of citations to pierce a legal principle to the bot- 
tom." (IV., p. 232.) 

" A second time had the curtailed monster of a National 
Bank suspended payment, crushing by its fall a whole heca- 
tomb of minion institutions which were staggering behind ; 
its drafts dishonored abroad and scandals spreading of its 
ballooning exploits which all at last seriously believed ." ( I V . , 
p. 324.) 

" A man whose name in twenty years was to echo down the 
grooves of time." (V., p. 112.) 

As one reads these and similar passages from the pages 
of this useful historian who may be characterized 
by his own words concerning Jacob Crowninshield as " a 
man of ... vivacity bubbling over with a copiousness 
of expression which irrigated in all directions" he 
is led to regret that the rule of not submitting man- 
uscript to any mortal's inspection has been so rigidly 
maintained.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S COMPLETE WORKS.* 

The editors of Abraham Lincoln's Complete 
Works have prepared them on the same grand 
scale as their Life of Lincoln. They had ap- 
parently sought to collect and publish every- 
thing extant that claims Lincoln for its author, 
at least in the period after he reached man- 
hood ; and if anything has escaped their vigi- 
lant search it must be something minute and 
obscure indeed. No other great American has 
received such faithful attention from an editor, 
neither Washington, nor Franklin, nor Jef- 
ferson. The result is 1414 solid octavo pages 
of the most diverse material, personal letters, 
business notes, orders on shopkeepers, frag- 
mentary memoranda, party resolutions and cir- 
culars, outlines of speeches and law arguments, 
lectures, love letters, remarks, formal addresses, 
telegrams, state papers, etc., thousands in num- 
ber, all presented in the order of their produc- 
tion. Much of this matter has no more im- 
portance or interest in itself than bushels of 
similar material that never see the light ; and 
the only reason for publishing it that can be 
assigned is its authorship. The same may be 
said, however, of the complete works of every 
other great man. And with all reasonable de- 
ductions there remains in Lincoln's Works a 
great mass of matter that, for the illustration 
of American history, is second to none in ex- 
istence. For Lincoln's own life and times, and 
particularly for the years 1860-1865, the vol- 
umes are of course invaluable. On that point, 
words can add no emphasis. It must be said, 
too, that many of the documents which at first 
seem unimportant, at least in such a place, 
have a decided personal interest and value. 
For instance, here are scores of pages filled 
with telegrams of the war period, many of 
them only a line or two in length, that, one 
might at first think, should have been left to 
sleep in the ponderous volumes called " The 
War of the Rebellion." But even these are 
often characteristic, and, as a collection, they 
exemplify the sleepless vigilance with which 
the President and Commander-in-Chief of the 
Army followed the events of the war, both po- 
litical and military. Here are the orders re- 
prieving or pardoning soldiers condemned to

death for breach of military duty, that were 
generally so unwelcome to the officers com- 
manding, but that, as we now see, detracted 
nothing in the long run from the strength of 
the Republic. Three sentences from a brief 
letter written to Secretary Chase, May 13, 
1863, will show that Lincoln knew, not merely 
the operations in General Roseerans's com- 
mand at that time, but also whose was the per- 
sonal initiative of operations. " I return," he 
says, " the letters of General Garfield and Mr. 
Flanders. I am sorry to know that the Gen- 
eral's pet expedition under Colonel Streight 
has already been captured. Whether it had 
paid for itself, as he hoped, I do not know." 
We remember a story that at the time of its 
currency was attributed to Secretary Seward. 
It was to the effect that, at the opening of his 
administration, Lincoln, when presented with 
documents for his signature, would require 
the Secretary to read them to him in full ; as 
time wore on and burdens multiplied, Lincoln 
would say, " Seward, give me the substance of 
this paper "; while at a still later date his only 
request was, " Where do you want my name ? " 
These volumes are hardly in accord with the 
spirit of this story. 

There is no better place than these volumes 
in which to study the slow but steady growth 
of opinion and conviction in the Northern mind 
on the subject of slavery for the period that 
they cover, opinion and conviction, we mean, 
that followed the lines of real politics. The 
first utterance found on the subject is the fol-

time. To remark upon the interval between 
March 3, 1837, and January 1, 1863, only 
twenty-six years, as measured by dates, is 
quite superfluous. 

At the opening of his public career Lincoln 
appears to have been a believer in woman's suf- 
frage. In an "announcement of political views" 
published in a newspaper in 1836, when a can- 
didate for the General Assembly, he said over 
his signature : 

" I go for all sharing the privileges of the Govern- 
ment who assist in bearing its burdens. Consequently, 
I go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage 
who pay taxes or bear arms (by no means excluding fe- 
males)." 

The index does not point to any later expres- 
sion of opinion on the subject. 

The value of these Works does not consist 
alone in their subject-matter. Lincoln has not 
contributed many lessons to the school " read- 
ers," or declamations to the " speakers." Yet 
his style, when at the best, will bear the most 
careful study. His diction lacked the majesty 
of Webster, the learning of Sumner, the finish 
of Seward ; but he excelled them all on occa- 
sions in depth, in ability to find the way to the 
thought and feeling of unconventional human 
nature, and in the insight which fits the word 
to the time and place. In his popular ad- 
dresses his strength lay in the clear and direct 
statement of his thought, in the iteration of his 
main ideas, in the avoidance of all superfluities 
of meaning and expression, in the homely yet 
apt illustration, all vitalized by the depth of 
his convictions. For the peculiar work that he 
was called to do, and particularly in the West, 
it is hard to imagine a happier combination of 
qualities. His good humor and his downright 
moral seriousness sprung from the same root. 
The Cooper Institute address, made in 1860, 
shows him at his very best as a popular ora- 
tor. Taking as a text some words that Judge 
Douglas had uttered at Columbus, Ohio, the 
previous autumn, "Our fathers, when they 
framed the Government under which we live, 
understood this question just as well, and even 
better than we do now," he proceeded to build 
up an argument to show that those fathers had 
occupied the very ground in respect to the 
extension of slavery on which he then stood, 
which it was surely difficult for intelligent sin- 
cerity to resist. A popular orator who desires 
permanently to impress the public mind could 
hardly find a better model to study than this 
masterly address. Perhaps it is not going be- 
yond the proper limits of a review like this to 



suggest that there are scores of politicians prom- 
inent in public life to-day who might profitably 
make that choice. 

Lincoln's best qualities appear also in the 
joint debates with Judge Douglas, held in 1858, 
which debates are here reproduced in full on 
both sides. Douglas was a man of vigorous 
faculties, a practiced stump speaker, popular 
in Illinois, the politics of which State he, more 
than any other, had long controlled ; but in an 
evil hour for his reputation he accepted Lin- 
coln's challenge to discuss the political ques- 
tions of the day before the people of the State. 
We now see Lincoln's great superiority to his 
long-time antagonist even more clearly than 
the hearers of those debates saw it at the time. 
On his nomination for Senator by the Spring- 
field Convention, June 16 of that year, Lin- 
coln had opened his address with the following 
deliberate and weighty declaration : 

"Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention: If 
we could first know where we are, and whither we are 
tending, we could better judge what to do, and how to 
do it. We are now far into the fifth year since a policy 
was initiated with the avowed object and confident prom- 
ise of putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the 
operation of that policy, that agitation has not only not 
ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion, 
it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached 
and passed. ' A house divided against itself cannot 
stand.' I believe this Government cannot endure per- 
manently half slave and half free. I do not expect the 
Union to be dissolved I do not expect the house to 
fall but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It 
will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the 
opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of 
it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the 
belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or 
its advocates will push it forward till it shall become 
alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North 
as well as South." 

This speech was made four full months be- 
fore Mr. Seward delivered his celebrated " irre- 
pressible conflict " speech (Rochester, October 
25, 1858) in which he declared : " It is an 
irrepressible conflict between opposing and en- 
during forces, and it means that the United 
States must and will, sooner or later, become 
either entirely a slaveholding nation or entirely 
a free-labor nation. Either the cotton and rice 
fields of South Carolina and the sugar planta- 
tions of Louisiana will ultimately be tilled by 
free labor, and Charleston and New Orleans 
become marts for legitimate merchandise alone, 
or else the rye fields and wheat fields of Massa- 
chusetts and New York must again be surren- 
dered by their farmers to slave culture and to 
the production of slaves, and Boston and New 
York become once more markets for trade in

the bodies and souls of men." Lincoln's words 
are no less weighty than Seward's, and they 
attracted less attention at the time only because 
Lincoln then occupied an obscure station as 
compared with Seward. 

Naturally, Douglas strove to make the most 
of Lincoln's frank avowal on the slavery ques- 
tion. In the joint debates he demanded to know 
why the country could not continue half free 
and half slave, as in the days of Washington 
and the other fathers. Lincoln repeated what 
he had said, and put to his antagonist a tu 
quoque which he never answered. 

" He has read from my speech in Springfield in which 
I say that ' a house divided against itself cannot stand.' 
Does the Judge say it can stand ? I do n't know whether 
he does or not. The Judge does not seem to be at- 
tending to me just now, but I would like to know if it 
is his opinion that a house divided against itself can 
stand. If he does, then there is a question of veracity, 
not between him and me, but between the Judge and 
an authority of a somewhat higher character." 

At this distance it seems amazing that men 
of perspicacity could fail to see the truth of 
what Lincoln and Seward asserted ; but we 
must remember the dulling effect that the pe- 
culiar institution had on the insight of those 
who were subject to its bondage. In an un- 
fortunate hour, Douglas, to show his inde- 
pendence of the jarring discord about slavery, 
flaunted the declaration on the floor of the Sen- 
ate that he " did not care whether it was voted 
up or voted down "; and he never wearied of 
repeating the utterance. Here, too, we must 
remember the environment of Democratic poli- 
ticians of national reputation and national am- 
bition in the decade 1850-1860. Judge 
Douglas was also fond of making another dec- 
laration that is due to the same causes. This 
one involved a fallacious assumption, not to 
speak of moral obtuseness, that Lincoln ex- 
posed in his speech made at Cincinnati Sep- 
tember 17, 1859. He is addressing for the 
moment a real or imaginary audience of Ken- 
tuckians. 

" At this same meeting at Memphis, he [Douglas] 
declared that in all contests between the negro and the 
white man, he was for the white man; but that in all 
questions between the negro and the crocodile, he was 
for the negro. He did not make that declaration acci- 
dentally at Memphis. He made it a great many times 
in the canvass in Illinois last year (though I do n't know 
that it was reported in any of his speeches there; but 
he frequently made it). I believe he repeated it at 
Columbus, and I should not wonder if he repeated it 
here. It is, then, a deliberate way of expressing him- 
self upon that subject. It is a matter of mature delib- 
eration with him thus to express himself upon that 
point of his case. It therefore requires some deliberate 
attention. 



" The first inference seems to be that if you do not 
enslave the negro you are wronging the white man in 
some way or other ; and that whoever is opposed to the 
negro being enslaved is, in some way or other, against 
the white man. Is not that a falsehood ? If there was 
a necessary conflict between the white man and the ne- 
gro, I should be for the white man as much as Judge 
Douglas; but I say there is no such necessary conflict. 
I say that there is room enough for us all to be free, 
and that it not only does not wrong the white man that 
the negro should be free, but it positively wrongs the 
mass of the white men that the negro should be en- 
slaved; tlint the mass of white men are really injured 
by the effects of slave-labor in the vicinity of the fields 
of their own labor. 

"But I do not desire to dwell upon 'this branch of 
the question, more than to say that this assumption of 
his is false, and I do hope that that fallacy will not long 
prevail in the minds of intelligent white men. At all 
events, you ought to thank Judge Douglas for it. It 
is for your benefit it is made. 

"The other branch of it is, that in a struggle be- 
tween the negro and the crocodile, he is for the negro. 
Well, I do n't know that there is any struggle between 
the negro and the crocodile, either. I suppose that if 
a crocodile (or, as we old Ohio River boatmen used to 
call them, alligators) should come across a white man, 
he would kill him if he could, and so he would a negro. 
But what, at last, is this proposition ? I believe that 
it is a sort of proposition in proportion, which may be 
stated thus : ' As the negro is to the white man, so is 
the crocodile to the negro ; and as the negro may right- 
fully treat the crocodile as a beast or reptile, so the white 
man may rightfully treat the negro as a beast or reptile.' 
That is really the point of all that argument of his. 

" Now, my brother Kentuckians who believe in this, 
you ought to thank Judge Douglas for having put that 
in a much more taking way than any of yourselves have 
done." 

At this distance of time these paragraphs 
may not seem very uplifting to the mind ; but 
considered with reference to their object, it is 
hard to see how they could have been improved. 
However, Lincoln did say many things that 
are uplifting which it is not necessary here for- 
mally to point out. We have sometimes won- 
dered at the extreme frigidity of style that 
marked the Emancipation Proclamations. It 
would be hard to compose documents more 
pragmatical or less marked by felicity of phrase. 
How unlike they are to the pronunciamentos 
that a liberator of a Latin race would have put 
forth under similar circumstances. The only 
words in either document that are impressive 
in themselves form the last paragraph of the 
second Proclamation : " And upon this act, 
sincerely believed to be an act of justice war- 
ranted by the Constitution under military ne- 
cessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of 
mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty 
God." And these words, or at least the more 
impressive of them, were contributed by Sec- 
retary Chase.

These Works will be sure to find their way 
into all libraries, public and private, the own- 
ers or managers of which make any pretension 
to keeping abreast of the political history of 
the country. It remains only to speak of the 
admirable manner in which their publishers 
have brought them out, and of the excellent 
index with which they are furnished.

SAVE- ME FROM MY FRIENDS.* 

If the errors and uncertainty of history are 
proverbial, it is equally certain that few biog- 
raphies, however conscientiously written, pre- 
sent a truthful and complete likeness of the 
man whom they attempt to portray. The reader 
sees the man through the bias, be it admiration 
and love, or indifference and prejudice, of the 
writer. No writer's mind is an entirely trans- 
parent medium, clear and unspecked ; but the 
nearer the biographer's mind comes to this con- 
dition (full information and narrative skill be- 
ing assumed), the better should be the biog- 
raphy. At first we naturally think that the 
subject of the biography will fare best at the 
hands of a friend and admirer ; but we soon 
find that the admirer and friend, unless con- 
trolled by a peculiarly clear judgment, may 
really injure the reputation of his hero more 
than the recognized prejudice of another writer. 
It is a pity to be compelled to say that Colonel 
Donn Piatt's Life of General George H. Thomas 
is an example of the injury that can be done by 
the indiscreet friend and admirer. 

It is certain that up to the time of the ap- 
pearance of this Life no adequate biography 
had been published of this patriot and soldier 
who had achieved so much for his country and 
had impressed himself so strongly upon the 
minds and hearts of thousands who came in 
contact with him. The field was comparatively 
unoccupied, the opportunity a fine one ; and 
many, especially among the soldiers who served 
under General Thomas, will turn eagerly to 
this book, hoping it may at last make known 
the true stature of the hero whom they love, but 
whom their countrymen are still sadly ignorant 
of. They will be disappointed. The book will 
not spread a favorable knowledge of General 
Thomas. To those who knew him it will not 
bring increased respect ; to those who did not

know him it cannot bring a pleasant impres- 
sion. Its main faults can be summed up in a 
sentence. It is too bitterly partisan, too argu- 
mentative, too discursive, too full of vitupera- 
tion of others. It seems as if written quite as 
much to discredit others as to exalt Thomas. 
The plan of knocking down all who stand 
around your hero in order that his stature may 
more fully appear does not attract the sym- 
pathy of the reader, and does not meet his 
sense of justice ; on the contrary, it alienates 
and offends him. A simple and graphic nar- 
rative of General Thomas's career and of his 
great achievements, which shall at the same 
time fitly describe the charm of his personality 
and the loftiness and purity of his character, is 
all that is needed to establish his fame as one 
of the greatest men our country has produced. 
Such a book still remains to be written. 

Were Colonel Piatt's book not utterly ruined 
by its constant and unjustifiable partisanship, 
it still would be far from satisfactory. It is 
weak and faulty in almost every way, and te- 
dious by reason of its interminable digressions 
upon all sorts of subjects not connected with 
its subject. It has a preface of ten pages, and 
an introduction of twenty-three pages, the sub- 
ject or object of either of which it is not easy 
to determine. They seem to have absolutely 
no connection with the life of Thomas, but 
weary the reader with disquisitions, not very 
lucid, upon all sorts of irrelevant subjects. 
Throughout the biography this tendency to 
drop the narrative and indulge in philosophical 
and argumentative digressions appears to an 
exasperating extent. Indeed, the reader very 
soon finds to his regret that the author is not 
a narrator, not fitted to tell the simple straight- 
forward story of a life, but a fighter, a contro- 
versialist, and an acrimonious disputant. He 
goes out of his way to discuss every man, be 
he statesman or soldier, who rose to high dis- 
tinction during the war. Grant, Sherman, and 
Sheridan are all evil, and have no redeeming 
qualities ; indeed, in one place they are summed 
up as " That trinity of incompetents." Lin- 
coln, Stanton, and Chase are sometimes right, 
but more often wrong ; and yet on the whole 
they seem to have the author's approval. 

There may be many bad institutions in the 
country, but the worst of all, in the opinion of 
Colonel Piatt, is " that little school upon the 
Hudson," West Point, which is " popularly 
supposed not only to give instruction in the 
so-called art of war, but to supply through such 
process the lack of brains found in many of its

graduates." He contends that it is impossible 
to teach the art of war, and adds, " The Al- 
mighty has not seen fit to endow its [West 
Point's] graduates with military qualities, to 
say nothing of his refusal to give that little 
school the monopoly of military talent." He 
asserts, " The fact is, President Lincoln knew 
so little how to conduct the war that he feebly 
left the entire business to West Point, when 
he could as well have given it to an orphan 
asylum or a medical college." What a singu- 
lar power of reasoning there must be in a man 
who can write so sneeringly of West Point, 
when every . man, including his hero, whom 
through the book he praises as a soldier on the 
Union or the Confederate side was a graduate 
of West Point ! He is, however, in despair 
about this " little school " to the end, and thinks 
" were war to be declared to-day, our govern- 
ment would again call upon the cotton-breasted, 
full-stomached young men of West Point to 
leave their drill-rooms and be great generals 
by the grace of God and the magic of a com- 
mission." To the angry man, any good round 
epithet is as useful as an argument, or cer- 
tainly Colonel Piatt would not have fallen into 
the absurd error of giving the epithet "full- 
stomached " to the young men of that school, 
where constant and severe physical training 
has eliminated every superfluous pound of flesh, 
and rendered their stomachs as flat as their 
backs. West Point is a constant irritation to 
the gallant Colonel ; and whenever it or its 
graduates appear throughout his book which 
means, of course, nearly everywhere, he must 
go out of the way to have a tilt at it or them. 
And yet, after all, strange to say, he never 
once hints who were the great and heaven- born 
soldiers, uncontaminated by West Point train- 
ing, who could and should have relieved the 
West Pointers of the burden of commanding 
the great armies and ending the war. 

It must seem strange to any reader, and 
almost incredible, that in this ponderous octavo 
volume of 600 pages, excluding the preface and 
introduction, the story of the life of General 
Thomas, after being only fairly started, is at 
page 214 absolutely dropped, and not resumed 
again until page 452. The first fifteen pages 
of this digression are devoted to the ill-doing of 
the army of the Potomac, and the next ninety- 
five to a very severe review of Grant's cam- 
paign against Vicksburg. Here the author 
encounters another officer (strange to say, also 
a West Pointer), for whom he has a great ad- 
miration, in the person of William S. Rose- 



crans ; and although he is writing, or profess- 
ing to write, the life of General Thomas, 126 
successive pages are devoted to the glorification 
of Rosecrans. The whole Chickamauga cam- 
paign, with Rosecrans as the hero, is narrated 
and analyzed with the utmost minuteness, and 
is styled " the most brilliant achievement of 
the war," and to the end it is made to reflect 
only glory upon Rosecrans. This is a curious 
dictum, in view of the final ending, where an- 
other had to step in and by his own unsup- 
ported efforts save Rosecrans 's army, and his 
objective point, Chattanooga. Undoubtedly 
there is much to admire in the planning and 
in the earlier conduct of this campaign ; but 
while our author sees everything that is good 
and brilliant, he has little or no comment to be- 
stow on the later, but no less noticeable, errors 
and mistakes. It would be difficult for Col- 
onel Piatt to explain or defend the sending of 
McCook's corps to Alpine, where he was not 
only many miles away from any supports, but 
was directly exposed to overwhelming masses 
of the enemy, while his back was against an 
almost impassable mountain range. If we grant 
that his appearance there was an effective men- 
ace to the enemy, it cannot be granted that the 
orders to remain there, and even to attack the 
enemy, could have come from anyone but a 
commander who was utterly deceived as to the 
position and movements of the enemy. Had 
not General McCook very promptly disobeyed 
those orders and moved his trains, artillery, 
and troops up the mountain range to the rear, 
a disaster would probably have happened which 
our author would have found it difficult to ex- 
plain. Fortune favored Rosecrans in the ulti- 
mate concentration of his scattered forces ; but 
the mistakes on the field were numerous, and 
what shall we say of a commander who abso- 
lutely becomes panic-stricken, and deserts the 
battle-field early in the morning of the decisive 
day, because one portion of his army has been 
routed by overwhelming numbers and driven 
back while the remainder is stubbornly main- 
taining its position ? Whatever else is expected 
of a commander, it is expected that he shall 
stay by his army while there is a possibility of 
success. There can be little doubt that Rose- 
crans's sudden flight to the rear caused the dis- 
astrous panic which carried the right wing off 
the field. The fact that he was gone and had 
left no orders was speedily known all along the 
line. In the face of this knowledge, who can 
blame his troops and his commanders for fol- 
lowing him ? Had McCook not known that 



38 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



Rosecrans had gone he certainly would not have 
left the field. Deserted by his commander-in- 
chief and the right wing, which he had demor- 
alized, Thomas alone never thought of retreat, 
but, without orders, stemmed the tide of utter 
defeat, controlled his troops, inspired them with 
invincible courage, won the field, and saved 
the point for which the campaign was fought 
Chattanooga. As the faithful biographer 
of General Thomas, Colonel Piatt surely ought 
to have shown all this, and thus have done jus- 
tice to one of his hero's most glorious achieve- 
ments. But at the time he is too much en- 
grossed with the eulogy and defence of his sec- 
ond hero, Rosecrans, and so fails to show in 
bright colors one of the greatest acts of the 
man whose life he has undertaken to write. 
But the great facts of history cannot easily be 
changed, and Thomas is and always will be the 
hero of that field, " the Rock of Chickamauga." 
He alone was the rock which stayed the course 
of the already triumphant enemy, saved the 
Union army, and prevented Braggs's recap- 
ture of Chattanooga. 

Colonel Piatt died before completing the 
book, and from this point on the story is con- 
tinued by General Boynton. He too has a sec- 
ond hero, and devotes sixty-six pages of the 
biography of Thomas to the gallant leader of 
the Western cavalry, General James H. Wil- 
son. This story is an interesting one, and well 
worth telling at even greater length than is 
here given to it ; but it does not properly be- 
long in a biography of General Thomas. This 
story could well justify another volume, and 
should some day be so told, and much more in 
detail. 

We have pointed out only some of the de- 
fects of Colonel Piatt's work ; but there are 
many more. He gives no authorities, but al- 
ways leaves the reader, in a volume in which 
he constantly opposes the statements of other 
writers, to take his word for his statement of 
controverted points. This is not satisfactory 
in either history or biography. Again, one 
cannot too much condemn the absurd lengths 
to which he carries his constant arguments and 
controversies. Narrative and statements of 
facts are well-nigh lost sight of in the innum- 
erable discussions. The proverbial u if's " of 
the many battle-fields and the many command- 
ers are almost interminably dilated upon. Still 
worse, the work is evidently very hastily and 
inconsiderately thrown together, and is filled 
with bad writing. We take to illustrate this 
four sentences from four successive pages : 



" William S. Rosecrans prided himself in deeds that 
will live in history to be a man of eminent military 
genius." [Page 196.] 

" McClellan, having got no word from his gallant 
subordinate, naturally believed, for McClellan, that he 
was being defeated, and idly rested in his tent until late 
in the day, when a portion of Rosecrans's command 
came into camp through Pegram's works." [Page 197.] 

" We have no access to the response that Mr. Stan- 
ton did not make of record other than in a nature that 
was strangely bitter, vindictive, and tenacious in its 
memory of insults." [Page 198.] 

" To those who have been busy in egotistical memoirs, 
letters, and addresses, damning General Thomas in faint 
praise by saying that he was a good officer, but too slow 
for a subordinate and too cautious for an independent 
command, and that he shrunk from all responsibility, 
had better read the letter he addressed General Halleck 
on that occasion." [Page 199.] 

When four such unformed sentences appear on 
four successive pages, the reader can imagine 
what an amount of atrociously bad writing the 
600 pages contain. It is singular that the pub- 
lishers have not had such a manuscript care- 
fully revised for the correction of such faults. 

If our article were not already too long it 
would be easy to point out many misstatements 
in the book, and evident contradictions on suc- 
cessive pages, all of which ought to have been 
eliminated. The book nowhere does justice to 
the splendid personal qualities of General Tho- 
mas. Among the leading generals of the war, 
none was so striking in personal appearance. 
He was tall, broad-shouldered and heroic in 
stature, extremely dignified in bearing, and 
with a countenance unsurpassed in impressive 
manly beauty. The expression of his face was 
at once commanding and kindly; and everyone 
who came in contact with him was filled with 
confidence in him, and with admiration and 
affection as well. No commander in history 
ever impressed his officers and men more uni- 
versally with confidence and esteem ; most am- 
ple evidence of this is to be found in the papers 
on military subjects published since the war by 
the various commanderies of the Loyal Legion 
throughout the country. It was said of him by 
a well-known writer just at the close of the war : 

" General Thomas is the purest man I met in the 
army. He was the Bayard of our army ' sans peur, 
sans reproche,' and I have endeavored in vain to find a 
flaw in his character. His character is free from every 
stain, and he stands forth in the army as above suspi- 
cion. He has gone through the war without apparently 
exciting the jealousy of a single officer. He has so reg- 
ulated his advancement so retarded, in fact, his pro- 
motion, that when, as the climax to two years' hard ser- 
vice, he fought a great battle and saved a great army, 
and was hailed and recognized by the whole country as 
a hero, not one jealous or defeated officer was found to 
utter dissent to this popular verdict."

Just after General Thomas's death, in an 
address delivered in New York, W. C. Bryant 
said of hirn: 

" When I contemplate his character, and compare it 
with that of the generality of public men, it seems to 
me as if I were transported to some other age of the 
world, in which greater and better men were produced 
than are brought forth by the mothers of to-day. Gen- 
eral Thomas was one of that class, of whom Goethe 
speaks somewhere as antique-minded men characters 
cast in that noble mould which those who are fond of 
dwelling upon modern degeneracy place among the 
years that are never more to return." 

No one who reads this querulous book would 
get an idea that the subject of the biography 
was a man who could elicit such eulogiums as

The "Diary of a Journey across Tibet" is, the 
author declares, " the plain unvarnished diary 
kept during a journey across Tibet and China, 
written often with half-frozen fingers in a tent 
on the Chang, or by a flickering light in Chi- 
nese rest-houses." He assures his readers that 
the book lays no claim to literary merit or 
style ; but his readers can reply that it has the 
best of literary merit, and the greatest desid- 
erata of style lucidity, simplicity, and force 
of expression. If the manner of telling is good, 
the matter is still better, being novel and in- 
teresting. Much discrimination and good taste 
are also shown in the information given. Cap- 
tain Bower thus writes of the Tibetans : 

" The Kushok rather astonished me one day by ex- 
pressing admiration of our beards, and asking if we had 
any medicine that would make his grow. As anything 
like a decent beard is almost unknown in Tibet, I should 
have thought a hairless face would have been more 
admired. The Lama was very curious to know if we 
had any English poisons. Poisoning is very prevalent 
in Tibet. If one offers a man tea he generally refuses 
it unless someone first drinks some in his presence; and 
when offering anything to eat or drink, a Tibetan in- 
variably ostentatiously takes some in order to show 
there is nothing to be afraid of. We were asked if 
gold, pearls, and rubies found a place in the European 
pharmacopeia, and much surprise was expressed when 
Dr. Thorold assured them that they had no medicinal

value. The Talai Lama is regularly dosed with medi- 
cines composed of those ingredients, so there is little 
marvel that all Talai Lamas die young." 

The Tibetans are not so very many years be- 
hind the English in medical knowledge. I have 
seen many medical prescriptions in use in En- 
gland and America a century ago, of which 
pearls, coral, and rubies formed a part ; and 
we know that in Chaucer's day " Gold in phis- 
ike was a cordial." It is a curious fact, how- 
ever, that, as our author states, every Talai 
Lama, the head of the Tibetan government, 
dies young. A Talai Lama would come of age 
at eighteen, and until then the power is in the 
hands of a regent. With the universal preva- 
lence of poisoning, and the fact that the power 
remains with the regent while another young 
Lama is growing up, it is not difficult to see 
the reason of their deaths. The priests find 
for a new Lama a child in whom the spirit of 
the old one has of course become incarnate ; 
and to prove this, when he becomes four years 
old he identifies his royal property, and then is 
removed to a monastery where he remains 
till his convenient and timely death. 

The Tibetans are very religious. Every man 
has a praying-wheel in his hand, which he con- 
tinually turns, even when on horseback. Piles 
of stones, manes, flags, and inscriptions, all of 
religious meaning or mystic significance, are 
met with in the loneliest spots. The differ- 
ences in religion form a great drawback to the 
success of the Tibetan traveller's caravan. No 
Oriental will work or travel unless his stomach 
is full, and the follower of one religion will not 
eat meat killed by the believer of another faith. 
And none will eat aught slain, or hallaled, by 
a heretic European. That is, they will not pub- 
licly violate their vows ; but Captain Bower 
adopted the expedient of sending a single Mus- 
sulman out to bring in the game which had 
been shot, when the pious man always returned 
with the animal's throat cut in the orthodox 
manner, swearing he found the game still living. 
A very interesting map shows the traveller's 
profile route, much of it above the level of the 
top of Mont Blanc, and at times reaching 18,- 
760 feet above the sea level. This map gives a 
good notion of the Chang or great Tibetan pla- 
teau, the highest on the face of the earth, com- 
pared with which the Pamirs, called the Roof of 
the World, sink into insignificance. One of 
the most interesting features of the country 
explored was the vast salt lakes which lie on 
elevations much greater than that of the sum- 
mit of Mont Blanc. The observations on so-

ciological questions especially on polyandry, 
which prevails in Tibet, and, the author asserts, 
wisely prevails, the illustrations and descrip- 
tions of the game and fowl of the country, are 
most interesting. 

The journey through Morocco of a group of 
artists and newspaper correspondents and well- 
to-do Englishmen evolved the handsome book 
" Among the Moors." The author, Georges 
Montbard, is both writer and illustrator ; and 
through a phenomenal use of descriptive ad- 
jectives he has managed to endow his narrative 
of this much-travelled region with a certain 
amount of new interest. But the book is es- 
sentially from an artist's standpoint ; and its 
sub-title, " Sketches of Oriental Life," might 
better read " Sketches of Oriental Still Life " 
as action there is little, and dialogue there 
is none. Its chapters consist of a series of vivid 
and often voluptuous descriptions of Moorish 
scenes, such as Constant and Regnault paint, 
and are rich in color-terms. There is not the 
slightest attempt at any sociological or ethno- 
logical research or information. The sense of 
sight is the only one appealed to except that 
of smell ; for the various Oriental scents and 
fumes and stenches especially the latter are 
dwelt upon with much minuteness, plainness of 
speech, and a reeking opulence of adjectives 
which dims that of the color-terms. The sen- 
suousuess, even sensuality, shown in the Pref- 
ace, in the rhapsodic description of the vicious 
traits and alluring persons of the Semitic wo- 
men, finds but rare outlet throughout the book, 
which does, however, in one or two instances, 
sink into repelling coarseness. Still, nothing 
odious or repulsive seems to have escaped the 
author's sight and note-book, and much of the 
cruelty, filth, disease, and degradation are dis- 
closed to us. But many of the descriptions are 
also exceedingly beautiful word-pictures, though 
somewhat cloying in their continued richness, 
and sometimes too smoothly unctuous. The 
presentments in words of the architecture of 
the country far excel its representations by the 
author's pencil. The portraiture of Oriental 
race-types, which form the tail-pieces of all the 
chapters, are the most interesting and pictur- 
esque illustrations ; and in spite of the author's 
violent invectives against the camera, these are 
suspiciously suggestive of dry plates and posing, 
and differ wholly in method from his other 
drawings. The frontispiece is a portrait, from 
a drawing by Godefroy Durand, of the hand- 
some author of whom it may be said that he 
looks precisely as one would expect the author 



of such a book to look. He is a Burgundian, 
and his use of the English language is won- 
derful, showing a large vocabulary, great fit- 
ness of expression, and at times much ingen- 
uity and inventiveness. I quote at random these 
passages : 

" Here is a file of camels, the first we have met as 
yet, slouching along with that intolerable jerking of the 
body, that pitching insipid movement so characteristic 
of them. Their large feet make no sound when touch- 
ing the ground ; they glide on with big strides, stretch- 
ing their long necks, with the undulating motion of rep- 
tiles; their hideous heads, with big flat lips, hover over 
yours before you begin to suspect their presence, and 
they leave behind them strong, acrid, persistent smells." 

Of the women of Fez he writes : 

"Most of the women are handsome, with a proud, 
savage, attractive beauty. Their attitudes are marked 
with a strange suppleness mixed with a surprising abrupt- 
ness, and in the feline movements of their pose, aston- 
ishingly graceful, unconsciously provocating, there is a 
suggestion of voluptuous fatigue. Some of them, their 
foreheads entwined with sequins, their eyes enlarged 
with antimony, their eyelashes and eyebrows darkened, 
their brows tattooed with blue, stand erect, motionless, 
with folded arms, fixed eyes, the look lost in space . . . 
One would think, to see them thus rigid in their straight 
pose, magnificently attired, they were mysterious idols 
who had been exposed out of their venerated temples. 
Slim young girls with big dark eyes, and a simple silk 
kerchief around their heads, move about with adder- 
like flexibility, and their long loosened tresses flow over 
their shoulders. Slaves negresses with hard profiles 
and sombre faces, with heavy metal rings in their ears, 
clad in checked garments of red or blue squares on a 
white ground, their waists encircled by red belts are 
standing by." 

It always seerns ungracious, and sometimes 
unjust and malignant, to say that one book 
constantly suggests another, or seems modelled 
upon a predecessor ; but certainly no one who 
has read Pierre Loti's " Into Morocco " can 
fail to be impressed by the strong reflection 
shown in this book, " Among the Moors," of 
the fascinating pages on Moorish life by the 
new Academician. The topics and descriptions, 
even the expressions and phrases, are astonish- 
ingly similar in both books. Sometimes the 
Burgundian artist excels the Frenchman, but 
more often the former's pages are void of that 
nameless intangible charm that pervades every- 
thing written by Pierre Loti. The recent books 
on Morocco by De Amicis and Stephen Bon- 
sal give us many facts and phases of Mogreb 
life on which both Loti and Montbard are silent ; 
and a new work by a thoughtful American trav- 
eller, Dr. Field" The Barbary Coast "well 
supplies all that Montbard's artist-regard failed 
to see. 

" On the Wallaby " is all that " Among the 
Moors " is not. The story of Australian travel

is told in a rollicking, familiar way, with no at- 
tempt at fine writing. The comfortable methods 
of the Moorish travellers were unknown by the 
two Englishmen who made their journey by 
steerage, or before the mast, with many amus- 
ing adventures and ingenious makeshifts. It 
is to be hoped the general reader is not so ig- 
norant of Australian geography, and also of 
Australian slang, as was one reader who noted 
and crossed patiently with the author the Dar- 
ling, Barren, Newcastle, Flinders, Spear, and 
other Australian rivers, and awaited the advent 
of the Wallaby, only to discover, after finish- 
ing the book, that a small and carefully con- 
cealed note revealed " On the Wallaby "to be 
an Australianism for " on the march " a term 
applied to persons tramping the bush in search 
of work. The book is certainly a most valuable 
addition to our knowledge of Australia of to- 
day, and gives us wonderfully vivid though sim- 
ply expressed pictures of Australian life. Oc- 
casionally such a clear description as this of 
Barron Falls occurs : 

" Imagine yourself standing on a mass of rocks, with 
jungle-covered hills rising, on either hand, a thousand 
feet above your head. Imagine yourself overlooking a 
river, in low water, perhaps a hundred and fifty yards 
in width, rushing headlong, tearing, racing in wildest 
confusion to hurl itself over one of the most gigantic 
precipices the mind of mortal man can conceive, a pre- 
cipice of solid rock a thousand feet or more in height. 
Then fancy that fall of water crashing with the roar of 
a mighty ocean a roar that can be heard many miles 
away deep down into a seething, boiling cauldron of 
whitest foam, lying small as a half-crown in the great 
abyss below, out of which rises continually a dense mist 
holding all the colors of a king opal. Imagine all that, 
and you have grasped but a hundredth part of its beauty. 
Everything resounds with the force and majesty of the 
fall. Its thunder is awful; its grandeur is terrific. It 
is five hundred feet higher than Niagara. It is more 
than that it is surely without its equal on the face of 
the known globe." 

On the Wallaby, these Englishmen saw much 
that was beautiful, much that was pathetic. 
More than once they were in great danger. In 
Windorah " bounded on three sides by de- 
spair and on the fourth by the Day of Judg- 
ment "- they were in very sore straits. But 
in that wild country they found as a fellow- 
traveller a young and comely woman, a widow, 
with her baby strapped to her saddle, camping 
in the lonely bush, and hunting for work as a 
bushman, searching a contract to set poles. 
*' Poor little kinchin," she said of her baby, " it 
aint every kiddie, I reckon, as has to have the 
front of a saddle for a cradle." 

"The Gypsy Road " is the story of a jour- 
ney over a thousand miles, made by two bicy- 



clers on their wheels, from Krakow to Coblenz, 
through part of Gralicia, Hungary, Moravia, 
and Bohemia. Though told in a vivacious and 
intelligent style, and though seen from the un- 
usual standpoint of the roadway instead of the 
railway, and on two wheels instead of four, the 
account contains little that is novel or startling. 
All the world is now close at hand, and Bohe- 
mia and Hungary have recently been much 
written about for instance, in the sparkling 
pages of Menie Muriel Dowie. Pliny says, 
Nullus est liber tarn malus, ut non aliquaparte 
prosit. This book is not at all bad, and would 
certainly prove most useful to intending trav- 
ellers on the wheel in those gypsy lands. The 
illustrations, by Edmund H. New, are suggest- 
ive, though sketchy. His drawings of the ini- 
tial letters of the chapters, of the cover, and 
especially of the title-page, are exceedingly 
clever and ingenious.

early death removed from the educational ranks a 
teacher of literature having no touch of pedantry, 
and singularly endowed with the power of impart- 
ing to students his own intense sympathy with the 
beautiful in literary art. At the time of his death, 
little of his work had been published only a school 
text of " Edward II.," and a volume of selections 
from the English critical writers, and it has been 
left to the pious care of a colleague to prepare for 
publication the first volume of McLaughlin's own 
work. This volume includes half a dozen " Studies 
in Mediaeval Life and Literature" (Putnam), not 
altogether finished in form, yet distinctly deserving 
of preservation. Professor Lounsbury's editorial 
introduction to the volume gives the chief facts of 
interest concerning these papers and concerning the 
brief life of their author. It also includes some 
sensible reflections upon the subject of instruction 
in English. These reflections deal with " the easy 
process " of " turning the study into one of a purely 
linguistic character, in which the discussion of words 
will take the place of the discussion of literature." 
The following is Professor Lounsbury's opinion of 
such methods, and we need hardly say that it has 
our emphatic approval : " This is a cheap though 
convenient method for the teacher to evade the real 
work he is called upon to perform, and while it may 
be followed by some incidental advantages, it is 
almost in the nature of a crime against letters to 
associate in the minds of young men. at the most 
impressionable period of their lives, the writings of

a great author with a drill that is mainly verbal or 
philological." The first of the six studies in this 
volume is devoted to " The Mediaeval Feeling for 
Nature," the author taking the common view that 
such feeling, as far as it existed at all, was rudi- 
mentary and chiefly associated with those aspects 
of nature which directly affect the comfort or well- 
being of the individual. We must confess that we 
have never been quite willing to accept this proposi- 
tion, supported, as it must be, by negative evidence 
only. It takes a great deal of negative evidence to 
prove that human nature undergoes sensible altera- 
tions from age to age. Even the author seems to 
have had his doubts, for he inserted into his essay 
these significant sentences : " The point, however, 
should be observed in any inquiry into the reasons 
for the inadequateness of these ages' feeling for na- 
ture ; that many latent sympathies may never have 
found a voice. Many through the centuries before 
our later ease of publication may have felt the 
modern sensations, without ever thinking of putting 
them into words." The remaining studies in this 
volume are devoted to u Childhood in Mediaeval 
Literature," the story of Abelard and Heloise, the 
poems of Neidhardt von Reuenthal, the " Frauen- 
dienst" of Ulrich von Liechtenstein, and the "Meier 
Helmbrecht " of Wernher the Gardener. They are 
all interesting, and help to an acquaintance with a 
literary period almost absolutely unknown to the 
general reader of our day. 

Literary uses of " Tennyson's Idylls of the King and 
the Arthurian story Arthurian Story from the XVIth 
in four centuries. Century" (Macmillan) is the title of 
a literary study by Professor M. W. Maccallum, of 
the University of Sydney. The title is not exactly 
descriptive, for an introduction of more than a hun- 
dred pages discusses the beginnings and the earlier 
fortunes of the Arthurian tale ; its Celtic proven- 
ance, its treatment by the chroniclers and romancers, 
its transformations when touched by the spirit of 
chivalry, and the forms which it took in the Ger- 
man epics, the English ballads, and the compilation 
of Malory. This preliminary matter is an integral 
part of the work, and in many respects the most 
interesting, since the author has availed himself of 
the results of recent research, such as that under- 
taken by Mr. Nutt and Professor Rhys. Having 
thus cleared the way, Mr. Maccallum proceeds to 
comment upon the literary uses to which the Ar- 
thurian material was put during the sixteenth, seven- 
teenth, and eighteenth centuries. The Elizabethan 
dramatists, Hans Sachs, Spenser, Milton, and Black- 
more, are among the writers discussed in this sec- 
tion of the work. We then come to " The Romantic 
Revival," and consider the impression made by the 
Arthurian legends upon minds so diverse as those 
of Scott, Heber, Peacock, Southey, and Words- 
worth. " Tennyson's Contemporaries Abroad " and 
" Tennyson's Contemporaries at Home " are the sub- 
jects of the following two chapters ; the first of 
them deals with such men as Quinet, Immermann, 



and Wagner, to mention only the most familiar 
names ; the second discusses Matthew Arnold, Mr. 
William Morris, Mr. Swinburne, and many others. 
Finally, there are four chapters upon the Tenny- 
sonian " Idylls." Our enumeration of the books 
and authors discussed has been very incomplete, 
and no one not a specialist in the subject can read 
Mr. Maccallum's work without being impressed to 
the point of surprise at the extent to which the 
Round Table story with its associated legends has 
furnished poetical material for the writers of many 
centuries. It is fortunate that the facts should have 
been thus collected, and the author must be highly 
praised for the attractive and scholarly character of 
his work. In this connection we will make belated 
mention of the new and beautiful edition of Malory 
that came to us some months ago. It has the im- 
print of Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co., and is the most 
ambitious publication yet attempted by that house. 
There are to be two thick volumes, of almost quarto 
dimensions, only the first having yet appeared (Mac- 
millan). The text is that of Caxton, as published 
in 1817 by Southey. Spelling and punctuation alone 
have been modernized. Professor Rhys contributes 
a critical and historical preface, and Mr. Aubrey 
Beardsley a series of fantastic illustrations in which 
his imagination runs riot more unrestrainedly, if pos- 
sible, than usual. 

When Rossetti, in 1845, went up to 
A new biography th Academy schools, he, with the 

of Dante Rossetti. J . , . 

other candidates, was required to give 
his name to the keeper, Mr. Jones. " When it came 
his turn, Rossetti, who was rather proud of his mel- 
lifluous designation, greatly amused his companions 
and impressed the venerable official by slowly roll- 
ing out, in his rich, sonorous tones, ' Gabriel 
Charles Dante Rossetti ! ' ' Dear me, sir,' stam- 
mered Mr. Jones, in confused amazement, ' dear 
me, sir, you have a fine name ! " A fine name 
Rossetti undoubtedly has, and in a sense far beyond 
any implied by the surprised expression of the Acad- 
emy official, a name now and f orevermore associated 
with all that is most ardent in artistic aspiration, all 
that is most beautiful in graphic and poetic achieve- 
ment. The above anecdote is taken from Mrs. J. 
W. Wood's book entitled " Dante Rossetti, and the 
Pre-Raphaelite Movement" (Scribner), one of the 
best books, if not the very best, yet devoted to the 
life and work of the great painter-poet. Until Mr. 
Theodore Watts shall be moved to write the defini- 
tive biography of his friend, Mrs. Wood's book will 
serve admirably, although it is an account of the 
painter rather than of the poet and the man, and 
although it has some slight defects of discursiveness 
and turgidity, and such an occasional inaccuracy as 
the quotation, 

" Night, Night, Night ! art thou not known to me ? " 
instead of 

" O lonely night, art thou not known to me ? " 
The following characterization of Rossetti's work 
with the brush may be taken to illustrate Mrs.

Wood's manner, sympathy, and insight : " Here 
for the first time in English art is colour supreme, 
triumphant, as in Titian ; form ethereal and chas- 
tened, like the visions of a Fra Angelico ; siibjects, 
rather than objects, set forth in so direct and often 
crude an imagery ; not figures merely, but symbols ; 
fragments of human history, actual and urgent, full 
of problems and wonders, weighty with meanings 
and desires." The illustrations of this beautiful 
book are deserving of particular mention, for they 
include the first engravings thus far made of a num- 
ber of subjects. Among them are " The Boat of 
Love " and " Our Lady of Pity," belonging to the 
Corporation of Birmingham ; " The Day-dream " 
and " Pandora," belonging to Mr. Watts ; and the 
study for a " Head of Christ," belonging to Mr. 
Moncure D. Conway. We are sorry to say that the 
chapter on " Rossetti's Poetry," excellent as far as 
it goes, is much too brief to be adequate. 



An illustrated pic- Dr. George M. Gould is the author

Allied Sciences. hand-books that have found popular 
favor. Encouraged by his success in this direction, 
he undertook, some years ago, the preparation of a 
much larger and more ambitious work of reference 
for physicians, and the result of his labor now ap- 
pears in a quarto volume of about the size of Web- 
ster's or Worcester's Dictionary. The work is 
entitled " An Illustrated Dictionary of Medicine, 
Biology, and Allied Sciences" (Blakiston). There 
are over 1600 double -column pages and a great 
many cuts. Dr. Gould and his assistants have gone 
through an enormous mass of recent scientific lit- 
erature for the purpose of collecting new words 
and definitions, and the fact that the work is thus 
brought strictly to date is not the least of its many 
claims to consideration. The term " allied sciences" 
of the title has been construed liberally, and the 
book is almost as much a dictionary of biology, 
chemistry, electricity, or microscopy as it is of sur- 
gery, therapeutics, materia medica, or toxicology. 
Hence we think it particularly important to say that 
Dr. Gould's dictionary belongs with the standard 
reference works that should be found in every well- 
appointed library. It is far more than a manual 
for the specialist in medical science. The work is 
distinctly encyclopaedic in character, a statement 
which may be illustrated in many ways, but by none 
better than calling attention to the many tables that 
have been introduced. A few of the most note- 
worthy of these are Bacteria (30 pages), Eponymic 
Diseases (12 pages), Eponymic Operations (30 
pages), Parasites (40 pages), Stains and Tests (40 
pages each). The pronunciation of terms is indi- 
cated by a simple but adequate phonetic method. 
In the matter of spelling, a fairly conservative 
course has been taken. The typography of the book 
is very attractive, and the binding plain but sub- 
stantial. Altogether, the work is one of which Amer- 
ican scholarship has reason to be proud. 



Mr. Goidwin Smith Mr - Goldwin Smith is nothing if not 
on "Questions at the same time interesting, conser- 
vative, and partisan ; and in all three 
ways his reputation is well maintained by his vol- 
ume of " Essays on Questions of the Day " (Mac- 
millan). It should also be added that even though 
unable to accept many of Mr. Smith's versions of 
history and economics, the reader will almost always 
be stimulated by the author's forcible style. In the 
face of the fall in the value of silver in June, 1893, 
consequent upon the action of the Indian govern- 
ment, it is quite amusing to read his statement that 
" Gold and silver are two commodities, each of which 
has its value settled by qualities and circumstances 
over which legislatures have no control." His liking 
for sweeping and misleading generalizations is illus- 
trated in his claim that all our communistic societies 
" have failed utterly, except in the cases where the 
rule of celibacy has been enforced." Yet in an- 
other essay he quotes from Noyes several cases 
where this is not true. He might add the famous 
and prosperous Amana communities of Iowa, where 
complete family life prevails. In the first essay 
Mr. Smith pays his respects to socialists, single 
taxers, greenbackers, strikers, and cooperators. In 
his second essay he favors disestablishment in Great 
Britain. In his third, he makes a wry face over 
the increasing democracy of England, and longs for 
our constitutional restrictions on the power of the 
fffc^ple. In other essays he opposes prohibitory legis- 
latioii, woman suffrage, imperial federation, and 
Bo'me rule, and accounts for Russian opposition to 
the Jews. The rich historical reviews which intro- 
duce each essay seem often one-sided, yet they ably 
correct certain tendencies to an opposite bias that 
sometimes appears in the popular thought of the 
day. The book undoubtedly expresses the conserva- 
tive thoughts and fears of a very influential portion 
of every community. 



Anthropological The seventh volume of Professor 
Essays of Huxley's collected essays is entitled 

Prof. Hu^ey. u Man > s p lace in Nature, and Other

include the three essays on " Man's Place in Nature," 
first published in 1863, two ethnological papers of 
later date, and the discussion of " The Aryan Ques- 
tion " that was published in 1890 in " The Nine- 
teenth Century." The preface to this volume is 
brief but interesting. The author admits that the 
first three essays have little more than a historical 
interest, since their main conclusions have now be- 
come almost the commonplaces of accepted scien- 
tific truth. Referring to the reception given them 
thirty years ago, he says : " The Boreas of criticism 
blew his hardest blasts of misrepresentation and rid- 
icule for some years ; and I was even as one of the 
wicked. Indeed, it surprises me, at times, to think 
how anyone who had sunk so low could have since 
emerged into, at any rate, relative respectability."

an iiberwundener Standpunkt, they are still valuable 
as masterly examples of scientific exposition, and 
the moral to be drawn from their history will always 
be useful. Professor Huxley draws this moral in 
the following eloquent terms : " To my observation, 
human nature has not sensibly changed during the 
last thirty years. I doubt not that there are truths 
as plainly obvious and as generally denied as those 
contained in ' Man's Place in Nature ' now awaiting 
enunciation. If there is a young man of the present 
generation who has taken as much trouble as I did 
to assure himself that they are truths, let him come 
out with them, without troubling his head about the 
barking of the dogs of St. Ernulphus. Veritas prce- 
valebit some day ; and, even if she does not pre- 
vail in his time, he himself will be all the better 
and the wiser for having tried to help her. And 
let him recollect that such great reward is full pay- 
ment for all his labor and pains."

events during the periods of study, the value olJ^e 
three syllabuses is greatly increased by adding reprint)} 
of original documents referred to in the lecture notes. 
These are used as the basis of further study ana re- 
search and are specially appreciated by home students 
or in small villages where historic papers are difficult 
or impossible to find. As in all the syllabuses issued 
by this department, a carefully selected bibliography 
is given at the end, with publishers' names and prices 
of books. 

Some years ago, Mr. Brander Matthews, we think 
it was, published a very clever and amusing story en- 
titled "The Documents in the Case." The story was 
told by printing, without comment, a series of letters, 
telegrams, advertisements, bills, etc. Mr. Henry M. 
Blossom, Jr. has taken up the idea and carried it a step 
farther, for the story told by " The Documents in Evi- 
dence " (St Louis : Buxton & Skinner) must be read 
from photographic facsimiles of the letters exchanged 
by the principal characters. We cannot say that it is 
much of a story, but the form of publication is calcu- 
lated to attract attention, being both neat and novel. 

Mr. Langdon S. Thompson is the author of an " Ed- 
ucational and Industrial System of Drawing " (Heath) 
embodied in no less than thirty drawing-books and man- 
uals, and accompanied by models, colored tablets, and 
other apparatus. The books and manuals are thus div- 
ided: manual training, two; free hand (primary and ad- 
vanced), ten; model and object, four; aesthetic and me- 
chanical series, seven each. The entire system provides 
for a very complete course of instruction. " An Ideal 
Course in Elementary Art Education " is the title of an 
explanatory pamphlet accompanying the books. In this 
pamphlet Mr. Thompson discusses not only his own sys- 
tem, but also the philosophical relations of art to the gen- 
eral scheme of education. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, July 10, 1894. 

The committee in charge of the commemoration ex- 
ercises iu honor of the hundredth anniversary of Will- 
iam Cullen Bryant's birth have announced that they will 
take place on August 16, instead of the actual date of 
his birth, November 3, for the better convenience of 
those who are to be present. The house at Cumming- 
ton, Mass., near which the celebration is to take place, 
is known as the Bryant Homestead. It is not, however, 
the house in which Bryant was born, but was the resi- 
dence of his maternal grandfather, to whose home the 
Bryant family removed when the poet was a small 
child. Bryant's father settled in Cummington in 1789, 
ten years after the town's incorporation, and the birth- 
place of the poet was the log cabin built by the first 
settler in the place. It was composed of square-hewn 
logs, and it disappeared many years before Bryant's 
death. The latter purchased the present Bryant home- 
stead and farm in 1866, and built the house now occu- 
pied by his son-in-law, Mr. Parke Godwin, at that time. 
The homestead itself is the property of his daughter, 
Miss Bryant. Mr. Godwin is now as venerable and 
striking in appearance as was Bryant himself, and will 
make an ideal presiding officer for this important occa- 
sion. His noteworthy discourses at the commemorative 
meetings in honor of the deaths of George William 
Curtis and Edwin Booth, held by the Century and Play- 
ers Clubs, are fresh in the memory of all New Yorkers. 
He is perhaps the last of the orators of the old school 
left in this city. Mr. John Howard Bryant, the younger 
brother of Mr. Bryant, and himself a poet of some note, 
now residing at Princeton, 111., will attend and partici- 
pate in the Bryant centennial. 

" A London Rose, and Other Rhymes," by Mr. Ernest 
Rhys, already mentioned in this correspondence, will 
shortly be published by Messrs. Matthews & Lane, of 
London, and by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., of New 
York. Mr. Rhys's experiments with Kymric measures 
in English verse seem to be quite successful. Among 
these poems and ballads of Wales is an old favorite, 
" The Wedding of Pale Bronwen," which first appeared 
in the New York " Independent." The volume also in- 
cludes Mr. Rhys's fine poem, " Chatterton in Holborn," 
which makes one of a section of " London Rhymes." 

" Pembroke," by Miss Wilkins, continues to receive 
most flattering notices in the English reviews, some of 
which declare this novel to be the author's most impor- 
tant effort thus far. It is curious to observe that in a 
list of the seventeen most popular books, according to 
June sales in England, given by the London " Book- 
man," only two are by American authors " Pembroke," 
and " Tom Sawyer Abroad," by Mark Twain. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers announce two new novels 
by authors comparatively unknown to this country, 
"Music Hath Charms," by V. Munro Ferguson, and 
" The Maiden's Progress " by Violet Hunt. The first 
of these deals with some interesting points in the rela- 
tions of the young men and women of to-day; the sec- 
ond is evidently reactionary in character, as it is in- 
tended to show the dangers which may be encountered 
through ignoring the conventions and conformities of 
society. Both will be suitable for summer reading. 

The new building of the " Cosmopolitan Magazine " 
at Irvington-on-the-Hudson is progressing rapidly, Mr. 
John Brisben Walker devoting much personal attention 
to its construction. It will be a handsome affair, de- 



1894.]

signed in the popular Italian Renaissance style. It 
will be nearly 300 feet long and 75 feet wide, occupy- 
ing a conspicuous site on the shore of the Hudson. The 
central dome of three will be surmounted by a repro- 
duction of one of the World's Fair groups. A special 
siding has been laid down from the railroad which runs 
below the building, and a chute or tunnel has been 
constructed from the basement of the building to this 
siding for the receipt of paper and ink and the delivery 
of magazines, some ten carloads of which go out each 
month. The saving in carting and transfers made in 
this way will be enormous. The building is situated on 
the old Barney estate, Mr. Walker himself having taken 
up his residence in the Barney house. He now expects 
to remove the publishing plant from New York to Irv- 
ington before September 15. Prof. Arthur Sherburne 
Hardy will remain in charge of the New York editorial 
office. I notice, by the way, that four Smith College 
girls have dramatized Professor Hardy's " Passe Rose," 
and that a performance was given last month by some 
of the students. The dramatization of this novel for 
the professional theatre has often been talked of here, 
and may yet be attempted. ARTHUR STEDMAN. 



TjITEKARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 



The historian Gibbon, who died in 1794, will be the 
subject of a celebration in the autumn, under the care 
of the Royal Historical Society. 

Mr. J. G. Cupples, the Boston publisher, has associ- 
ated with himself as partner Mr. H. W. Patterson, the 
style of the new firm being Cupples and Patterson. 

The Walt Whitman Fellowship has elected Mr. Dan- 
iel G. Brinton president, Mr. Horace L. Traubel secre- 
tary and treasurer, Messrs. R. G. Ingersoll, John Bur- 
roughs and others vice-presidents. 

" Le Monde Moderne," an illustrated monthly of the 
American type, will begin publication next November. 
Each number will have 160 pages, and circa 100 illus- 
trations, and will be sold for thirty sous. 

The "Letters of Franz Liszt," reviewed in our last 
issue, was credited by mistake to Messrs. Longmans, 
Green & Co. The work is published in this country by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, to whom we make our 
apologies. 

The unpublished letters of Lowell written to Edgar 
Poe during the years 1842-4, to appear in " Scribner's 
Magazine " for August, will prove more interesting than 
most of such correspondence, not only on account of the 
information they give concerning the early literary in- 
terests and ambitions of the two authors, but especially 
for their perfect frankness and revelation of the cordial 
personal relations that marked Lowell's young admira- 
tion for Poe, before the days of " The Fable for Critics." 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. are about to publish by 
subscription a two-volume work on " The United States 
of America," edited by Professor N. S. Shaler. We 
quote the titles of a few specimen chapters. " What 
Nature Has Done for the West," by Professor Shaler ; 
" The North American Indians," by Major J. W. Pow- 
ell; "The Pacific Coast," by Mr. H. H. Bancroft; "Our 
Military Resources," by Colonel T. A. Dodge ; " Pro- 
ductive Industry," by Mr. Edward Atkinson ; " Educa- 
tion in the United States," by Dr. W. T. Harris ; " Sci- 
ence in America," by President D. C. Gilman ; and 
" American Literature," by Mr. C. D. Warner. 



The Columbian Exposition has given rise, first and 
last, to a good amount of poetry. Just a year ago THE 
DIAL published (July 16, '93) Mr. Gilder's lines entitled 
" The Tower of Flame," written on the occasion of the 
burning of the Cold Storage Warehouse, with its tragic 
accompaniment of the loss of the lives of nearly two- 
score firemen. Another poet, Miss Florence Wilkinson, 
now commemorates the recent more spectacular though 
happily less tragic event by which all the great build- 
ings bordering the Court of Honor were obliterated 
almost in an hour, leaving alone the colossal gilded fig- 
ure of Columbia standing unscathed amid the ruins. 

TRANSFIGURATION. 

(Jackson Park, July 5, 1894.) 

I. 

In glimmering solitude she lay, a melancholy dream ; 
The golden Goddess gazed no more 
On curious crowds, the surge and roar 
Of human stream. 

About her vacant palaces the lazy lake-gull flew ; 
Her carven eagles high upraised, 
An empty vaunt, where no one gazed, 
Against the blue. 

Untrodden, sloped her marble steps down to the dim lagoon ; 
Where myriad brilliances had quavered, 
Now in its quiet waters wavered 
The sickle moon. 

A buried bourg she might have been, forgotten long ago, 
Where, 'neath deep strata of the soil, 
Still, fluted columns wreathe and coil, 
Still, statues glow. 

II. 

But one midsummer's night she woke from marble dreams of 

Greece, 

And saw the ruin men had done, 
Spoiling her temples, one by one. . . . 
Better to cease ! 

Once more to draw the slavish crowd ! One last illumination ! 
To let the elements defend her, 
And snatch her palaces, in splendor, 
From degradation ! 

A Bacchanalian reveller she, with death intoxicated ! 
Red-flushed with triumph over shame, 
She wreathed her sculptured halls in flame. . . . 
The people waited. 

They watched the wild transfiguration, standing in awe, aloof ; 
They saw her lurid towers crumble, 
They heard the doom, the din, the rumble 
Of ruining roof. 

Her soul exhaled in fire and smoke, fled as a comet flashes. . . . 
But still the golden Goddess stands, 
Outstretching calm Olympian hands 
O'er heaps of ashes. 

FLORENCE WILKINSON. 



THE PAPERS AND MAGAZINES OF BULGARIA. 

A correspondent of " Book News," writing from Ber- 
lin, has the following upon the recent intellectual devel- 
opment of Bulgaria: " Within this little territory, until 
recently almost as Oriental in character as any of the 
provinces of Asia Minor, are now published seventy- 
three newspapers and magazines, not including two in 
Constantinople, and one in Salonica, devoted to Bulga- 
rian interests. Of these, twenty-one are political, and 
eight are official organs, either of the central or provin- 
cial government. Among the rest, twelve are literary or 
scientific reviews, three are judicial, three military, one 
is a < Home Journal,' and one is a ' Journal of Fash- 



46 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



ion,' published, strange to say, not in Sofia, the capital, 
but in the little town of Sevljevo, deep in the innermost 
fastnesses of the Balkan Mountains. Of the political 
papers, four are socialistic. The chief organ of the gov- 
ernment is the ' Swoboda ' (Freedom) ; its most active 
opponent is the ' Swobodno Slovo ' (Free Speech), both 
published in Sofia. The Bulgarians are a branch of the 
great Slavic race, to which we are apt to attribute a 
degree of intellectual inactivity amounting almost to 
torpor; there can be no better evidence to the contrary 
than this sudden awakening of popular interest in af- 
fairs, under the happy influence of a few years of com- 
parative freedom."

Memoirs Illustrating the History of Napoleon I. 

From 1802 to 1815. By Baron CLAUDE-FRANCOIS DE MENEVAL, Private Secretary to Napoleon. 
Edited by his Grandson, Baron NAPOLEON JOSEPH DE MENEVAL. With Portraits and Autograph 
Letters. In three volumes. 8vo. Cloth, $2.00 per volume. Vols. I. and II. now ready. 

These memoirs, by the private secretary of Napoleon, are a valuable and important contribution to the history of the 
Napoleonic period, and necessarily they throw new and interesting light on the personality and real sentiments of the Emperor. 
If Napoleon anywhere took off the mask, it was in the seclusion of his private cabinet. The memoirs have been republished 
almost as they were written, by Baron de Me*neval's grandson, with the addition of some supplementary documents." Lon- 
don Times. 

" The Baron de Me*neval knew Napoleon as few knew him. He was his confidential secretary and intimate friend. . . . 
Students and historians who wish to form a trustworthy estimate of Napoleon cannot afford to neglect this testimony by one 
of his most intimate associates." London Daily News. 

" The work will take rank with the most important of memoirs relating to the period. Its great value arises largely from 
its author's transparent veracity. Me'neval was one of those men who could not consciously tell anything but the truth. He 
was constitutionally unfitted for lying. . . . The book is extremely interesting, and it is as important as it is interesting." 
New York Times. 



Climbing the Himalayas. 

By WILLIAM MARTIN CONWAY, M.A., F.R.G.S., Vice- 
President of the Alpine Club; formerly Professor of 
Art in University College, Liverpool. With 300 Il- 
lustrations, by A. D. McCoRMiCK, and a map. 8vo. 
Cloth, $10.00. 

" It would be hard to say too much in praise of this superb 
work. As a record of mountaineering it is almost, if not 
quite, unique. Among records of Himalayan exploration it 
certainly stands alone. . . . The farther Himalayas . . . 
have never been so faithfully in other words, so poetically 
presented as in the masterly sketches with which Mr. Mc- 
Cormick has adorned this book." London Daily News. 



The Claims of Christianity. 

By WILLIAM SAMUEL LILLY, Honorary Fellow of Peter- 
house, Cambridge; author of " The Great Enigma," 
etc. 8vo. Cloth, $3.50. 

The author takes what might be termed the public- 
ist's point of view, and deals with Christianity as a fact 
in the world's history. He discusses the claims of 
Buddhism and Islam, and after a masterly analysis of 
the development of Christianity and the Church, he 
maintains the necessity of organized spiritual power to 
vindicate the rights of conscience, especially in our age, 
when the tendency is to strengthen the state against the 
individual. Mr. Lilly's historical analysis and incisive 
discussion of the vital questions of the day form a most 
timely and suggestive volume. 



The Purple Light of Love.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE. 



In " The Athenaeum " for July 7 is published 
the annual summary of literary production upon 
the Continent that has of late years been so 
important a feature of that valuable journal. 
There are twelve articles altogether, devoted 
respectively to Belgium, Bohemia, Denmark, 
France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hungary, 
Italy, Poland, Russia, and Spain. For some 
unexplained reason, Norway, Sweden, and Por- 



tugal are unrepresented in this survey, an 
unfortunate omission, since the literary import- 
ance of those countries is considerable, and since 
their inclusion would have made the review 
practically complete. Following the precedent 
of last year, we have thought it desirable to 
summarize these summaries for the readers of 
THE DIAL, reproducing the most salient of 
their comments, and enumerating the more im- 
portant of the works discussed. 

M. Joseph Reinach, who makes the French 
contribution to this symposium, opens the dis- 
cussion by presenting a classified abstract of a 
year's output, representing a total of more than 
eleven thousand publications of one or more 
volumes each. Medical science is credited with 
over a thousand titles, and Catholic theology 
with nearly that number. Education, law, his- 
tory, biography, and fiction are responsible for 
something like half a thousand each. Russian 
grammar foots the list with three works. It is 
obviously no easy task to single out from this 
enormous number of publications the few that 
may be mentioned in a brief article. M. Rein- 
ach gives first place to " the altogether excep- 
tional abundance of books dealing with Na- 
poleon and his times." Among these he men- 
tions M. Levy's " Napoleon Intime," M. F. 
Masson's " Napoleon et les Femmes " and "Na- 
poleon chez Lui," and the memoirs of General 
Thiebault and Chancellor Pasquier. Among 
other historical works, the highest rank must 
of course be given to the two posthumous vol- 
umes that complete Renan's " Histoire du Peu- 
ple d'Israel." 

" They exhibit the same decisive handling, the same 
lucid historical instinct, as ever; more than ever do they 
display the same wonderfully luminous style, with the 
brilliant parallels and unexpected collocations which 
were so characteristic of Renan's imaginative and fas- 
tidious literary sense." 

Mention is also made of M. Lavisse's " Le 
Grand Frederic avant 1'Avenement," M. Hano- 
teaux's " Histoire du Cardinal de Richelieu," 
and M. de Mazade's " L'Europe et les Neu- 
tralites." Among literary studies there are 
volumes on Hugo by MM. Bire and Mabilleau, 
a biography of Alfred de Musset by Arvedfe 
Barine, and a collection of posthumous essays 
on English literature and philosophy by M. J. 
Milsand. In fiction, M. Zola leads off with 
" Le Docteur Pascal," the very last of the 



52

[Aug. 1, 



seemingly interminable Rougon-Macquart se- 
ries, ending a task entered upon a quarter-cen- 
tury ago, and pursued with unflagging energy 
ever since. M. Reinach finds nothing else that 
is particularly noteworthy in the year's fiction, 
although he gives a long list of novels, and com- 
ments briefly upon a number of them. In 
poetry, the two most important publications 
have been Hugo's " Toute la Lyre " and M. de 
Heredia's " Les Trophees." Of the former 
work we read : 

" This collection of separate poems, which is the fit- 
ting sequel to the former series issued under the same 
title, exhibits every side of Victor Hugo's genius. He 
is now the visionary who, in spite of perpetual struggle, 
believes in a better time to come and in the ultimate 
triumph of justice; now the poet whose exquisite sen- 
sibility comprehends the voice of nature and interprets 
it unerringly, singing of love in idyls which have an old- 
world grace; now the ironical cynic who turns all to 
ridicule ; now the sympathetic painter of scenes of every- 
day life ; now ' the mouthpiece of the people's conscience,' 
as he called himself, the singer whose stirring and ter- 
rible tones pursue with fiery impetuosity all who had to 
do with the Coup d'Etat, represented in this volume by 
several poems whose vengeful spirit might well have 
fitted them for a place in the magnificent pages of Les 
Chatiments.' It is surprising that these verses were not 
collected by the poet in his lifetime, for in vigor of in- 
spiration and beauty of form they are equal to any he 
published; but what is far more amazing is the wealth 
of genius that could hold such poems in reserve, the 
gigantic and almost appalling productive power which 
has made it possible for us, even after we had grown 
familiar with so many immortal masterpieces, to hear 
anew the splendid sounds of the poet's lyre." 

The German article, by Hof rath Robert Zim- 
mermann, tells at relatively great length a story 
of no great importance. " The combat between 
' ancients ' and ' moderns,' ' idealists ' and ' real- 
ists.' still continues," he tells us. One-fourth 
of his article is given up to an account of Herr 
Hauptmann's new play, " Hannele Mattern's 
Himmelfahrt," which we should judge to be an 
exceptionally dreary composition. It " describes 
the death-struggle of an ill-treated child of the 
proletariate," and, we are further informed, 
" has no action whatever." Herr Halbe's " Ju- 
gend " and Herr David's " Hagar's Sohn " are 
two other plays discussed at some length. Poetry 
in Germany seems to be mostly submerged be- 
neath floods of verse. The figure is the au- 
thor's, who connects poetry with fiction by an- 
other figure equally suggestive. 

" If lyric poetry resembles a flooded plain, from which 
rise but a few peaks on which perch real singing-birds, 
we might not inaptly compare prose literature of an 
imaginative sort to a sandy plain of moderate elevation, 
on the almost endless surface of which, overspread with 
vegetation, are scattered here and there a few erratic 
blocks of the ancient formation." 



The " Kleopatra " of Dr. Ebers appears to have 
been the most striking novel of the year. 

" It deals with the romantic life of the last queen of 
the Ptolemies, so full of changing fate and advent- 
ures of love; but it is not the rosy morning and bright 
noonday that he depicts, but instead its blood-red sun- 
set and tragic end in the gloom of a mausoleum built 
by the heroine herself. It is strange that the author 
should have refrained from the world-famous duet be- 
tween Antony and the Armida of antiquity, in order to 
begin with the gloomy concluding scene of the fifth act 
of the tragedy." 

Other works of fiction are Herr Hopfen's 
" Glanzendes Elend," Herr Sudermann's " Es 
War," and Herr Heyse's short story, " Melu- 
sine." The most noteworthy feature of the 
year's production seems to be found in the 
numerous memoirs of men of letters that have 
appeared. The period of literature which be- 
gan with the foundation of the Empire is near- 
ing its close, and many of its authors are tell- 
ing the story of their lives. Among these nar- 
ratives are those of Dr. Ebers and Herr Felix 
Dahn, Herr Hanslick's " Erinnerungen aus 
Meinem Leben," and Herr Fontane's " Meine 
Knabenjahre." A few other books of interest 
are Herr Baechthold's life of Gottfried Keller, 
a volume of five lectures by the late Bernhard 
ten Brink, two additional volumes of Prince 
Bismarck's speeches, and a work upon Dr. Ib- 
sen's plays, by Herr Emil Reich. 

Dr. Alfred Ipsen, writing of Danish litera- 
ture, is " strictly careful not to mingle it with 
the Norwegian," which is something of a pity, 
since Norwegian literature, as well as Swedish, 
does not appear in the " Athenaeum " series of 
articles. The number of books produced dur- 
ing the year in Denmark, Dr. Ipsen writes, 
" Has been very great much too great, indeed, for so 
small a nation, as, although I do not doubt that we are 
one of the nations of Europe which read most, still 
there is a limit to what even we can consume. And be- 
sides what our own authors can produce, we import and 
translate numbers of foreign works from all parts of 
Europe, from France, Kussia, Germany, and England 
even some from Italy and Spain. I am inclined to be- 
lieve that with our small market we introduce more 
from foreign languages than the English people." 

A movement is on foot to check this general 
onslaught upon foreign preserves by bringing 
Denmark into the Convention of Berne. This 
movement has not yet been successful, but the 
Danish literary guild has organized an authors' 
union, similar to those established last year in 
Sweden and Norway. The writer of this ar- 
ticle gives most of his attention to historical 
works, including Librarian Jorgensen's book 
on Chancellor Griffenfeld and Librarian Frid- 
ericia's book on the revolution of 1660, which 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



53 



largely transferred the Danish power from the 
nobility to the king. Another work of great 
value is that of Herr Troels Lund, who has 
told the history of sixteenth century daily life 
in Denmark at great length. 

" In vivid, picturesque language he depicts the cus- 
toms and manners of the nation. He follows the citizen 
of that half-civilized century through all the changes of 
his life from the cradle and nursery to the school, from 
the school to the shop or the battle-field, through all 
the civil and ecclesiastical ceremonies through which he 
had to pass, to the grave. It is only natural that such 
a work, which fills the empty frames of political history 
with lifelike pictures of people as they were, has found 
warm admirers not merely in Denmark, but also in Ger- 
many, where it seems to have caused a revolution in the 
conventional treatment of history as Staatsgeschichte." 

There has been nothing very noticeable in Dan- 
ish belles-lettres, unless we except " Solblom- 
ster," a volume of poems by Herr Michaelis. But 
it is interesting to be told that " dry, descript- 
ive realism is passing out of favor," and that 
" there is a search for ideals of a higher order." 
The Belgian literature of the year, in both 
French and Flemish, is described by Professor 
Fredericq. " La Jeune Belgique " is to the fore, 
represented by M. Georges Rodenbach, whose 
" Le Voile" has been performed at the Theatre 
Francais, and M. Georges Eekhoud, whose "La 
Nouvelle Carthage," a study of modern Ant- 
werpian life, has been awarded the quinquen- 
nial prize of five thousand francs for French 
literature in Belgium. M. Rodenbach has 
also published " Le Musee de Beguines," a 
vivid account of the life led by the inmates of 
the famous institution of Bruges. Three "mari- 
onette plays," by M. Maeterlinck, are entitled 
" Alladine et Palomides," " Interieur," and 
" La Mort de Tintagiles." As becomes a 
country that has done so much for the produc- 
tion of the Wagnerian music- dramas, Belgium 
offers us " L'Esthetique de Richard Wagner," 
in two volumes, by M. J. G. Freson, and a 
further instalment of M. Kufferath's analytical 
studies. A few other works are the conclud- 
ing volume of " Belgique Illustree," an anony- 
mous book about Emile de Laveleye, a volume 
of essays by that writer, and Librarian van der 
Haeghen's bibliography, preliminary to his 
forthcoming essay upon the works, of the great 
Erasmus. In Flemish Belgium, the greatest 
sensation of the year has been M. Cyriel 
Buysse's " Het Recht van der Sterkste," which 
" furnishes a painful and repulsive picture of 
the conditions under which the lives of beggars, 
thieves, and poachers are passed on the Flem- 
ish countryside." The most important poet- 
ical publications of the year have been " Clar- 



ibella," by M. Pol de Mont, and " Verzen," by 
Mile. Helene Swarth. A succession of mono- 
graphs upon the towns and villages of Flem- 
ish Belgium have also appeared. 

The event of the year in Holland, according 
to M. Taco de Beer, has been the publication 
of " Majesteit," by Heer Couperus. The book 
seems to be " modern " in the morbid sense, as 
was to be expected, but " the decorative scen- 
ery is done in so good a style, and there is so 
much aristocracy introduced, that the tale is 
making a deep impression." Other notable 
novels are Heer Lapidoth's " Goetia," a nihil- 
ist story, Heer Adema's " Thea," a tale of oc- 
cultism, Heer Slothouwer's " In een Groote 
Stad," " a picture of pessimism and melan- 
choly," and Heer Kops's "Op Leven en Dood," 
a story of the French Revolution. In poetry, 
the writer claims for Holland the two volumes 
already named under Flemish Belgium, and 
Dr. Roster's " Niobe," said to be finished in 
the Tennysonian manner. Five plays are chron- 
icled, all of which " tend to glorify the nervous 
youngster who claims the right to leave labor 
to others, and do any mischief he likes." Sev- 
eral works of serious aim are enumerated, such 
as Professor Pierson's " Geestelijke Vooroud- 
ers," or studies in the history of civilization. 
" Literary criticism and the study of the his- 
tory of literature are extinct " in Holland, ac- 
cording to the present writer, and this pessim- 
istic observation is in keeping with the tone of 
his entire article. We reserve for our next 
issue a summary of the year's literature in 
Southern and Eastern Europe. 



DEA THS OF A MONTH. 

August Dillmann, the great Semitic scholar, died at 
Berlin on the fourth of July, at the age of seventy-one. 
Professor Cheyne writes of him in " The Academy " as 
follows: " Dillmann and Schrader were both pupils of 
Ewald, and carried on that tradition of a philological 
treatment of theological documents which Ewald him- 
self joined with Gesenius to initiate. But if it was at Gb't- 
tingen that Dillmann caught his enthusiasm for the study 
of languages and of the Bible, to Tubingen and Berlin 
he owed a full scope for learned labor. Like Schrader, 
he was induced by Ewald to take up Ethiopic; his Ethi- 
opic Grammar and Dictionary, and his edition of part 
of the Ethiopic Old Testament, and of the Book of 
Enoch, have won for him the abiding gratitude of stu- 
dents of that interesting language. Quite lately Dill- 
mann expressed his hope of revising his text and trans- 
lation of Enoch. Dillmann's Old Testament commen- 
taries are well known. His restless energy in bringing 
out new editions of them, in some respects thoroughly 
up to date, was a perpetual surprise to younger scholars. 
The study of Hexateuch-criticism owes much to him; 



54

and if it was provoking to some of his opponents that 
one so clear-sighted could not join them in their revo- 
lutionary theories, it surprised and touched them when 
they saw him, from sheer love of truth, making con- 
cessions which seemed to them next door to complete 
surrender. As a theologian, he held the cautiously pro- 
gressive views which might be expected from a disciple 
of Ewald. His dissertation on prophecy may still be 
read with instruction. But it is as an historical scholar 
and a philologist that he will be remembered." 

From " The Academy " we also take these remarks 
upon Sir Austen Henry Layard, who died on the fifth 
of July, at the age of seventy-seven : " He was born in 
Paris, and educated in Italy, which country he always 
regarded as a second home. When little more than 
twenty years of age he set off on his travels to the East, 
the account of which is contained in his latest book 
' Early Adventures in Persia, Susiaua, and Babylonia,' 
including a residence among the Bakhtiyari and other 
wild tribes before the discovery of Nineveh (1887). It 
was from Lord Stratford de Redcliffe that he received 
both encouragement and pecuniary means to excavate 
the site of Birs Nimrud, near Mosul, in 1845. His dis- 
covery of the famous Winged Bulls arrested public at- 
tention to an extent that has been granted to no subse- 
quent archaeologist. A second expedition, under the 
auspices of the Trustees of the British Museum, re- 
vealed the library of Sardanapalus. The results were 
published in two portfolios of 171 plates (1848-53), 
under the title of ' Monuments of Nineveh,' and also 
in a succession of popular volumes. Oxford was the 
first to recognize his services to learning by conferring 
upon him the degree of D.C.L. at the Commemoration 
of 1848; and seven years later he was elected Lord 
Rector of the University of Aberdeen. Layard now en- 
tered upon a fresh career as Radical politician and Tur- 
cophile diplomatist, which it is not necessary to follow 
here. But we must not pass over his devotion to Italian 
art, which occupied the later years of his life. Since 
1868 he has been one of the most active trustees of the 
National Gallery; and he had formed, in his palazzo at 
Venice, a choice collection of pictures of the schools of 
Northern Italy, under the guidance of his friend, the 
late Signor Morelli. In 1868, he wrote, for the Arun- 
del Society, an account of the Brancacci Chapel at Flor- 
ence, and of the painters Masolino, Masaccio, and Filip- 
pino Lippi. In 1887, when he was already seventy 
years of age, he undertook single-handed a revision of 
Kugler's ' Handbook of Painting,' in the light of the 
most recent discoveries ; and yet more recently he wrote 
a preface to the English translation of Morelli's ' Ital- 
ian Painters.'" 

Charles-Marie Leconte de Lisle, the leader of the 
Parnassiens from the death of Gautier, was born on the 
Island of Reunion October 23, 1818, and died at Paris 
on the seventeenth of July, at the age of seventy-five. 
After much travel in his early years, in 1846 he took up 
permanent residence in Paris. His " Poemes Antiques," 
published in 1852, was the first of many volumes of 
verse. He also made numerous translations from the 
Greek, including Theocritus, Anacreon, the "Iliad," 
Hesiod, ^Eschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. In 1886 
he succeeded to Hugo's chair in the Academy. His 
original verse is characterized by perfection of form 
and rich coloring, and reflects a pantheistic mode of 
thought. He was at the time of his death the greatest 
of the remaining French poets, with the possible excep- 
tion of M. Sully-Prudhomme. 



ENGLISH AT AMHERST COLLEGE* 

No study in our American colleges is so directly 
and practically important as the study of English ; 
yet none is so beset with problems of administra- 
tion and method. To detail all of these would take 
up too much space here ; I will merely indicate 
some of the leading ones, to the solution of which 
the teachers of English at Amherst have been de- 
voting their attention during the last dozen years. 
There is, first of all, the question what to do with 
it as a required study. For the old idea seems a 
sound one, that whatever the predominance of elect- 
ive studies, English, at least English composition, 
should he required of all ; that is, that no possibil- 
ity should be opened for any student to gain his de- 
gree without some training in the practical use of 
his mother-tongue. Yet as a required study in the 
midst of electives, English is at a disadvantage ; 
the very fact that it is compulsory weights it with 
an odium which in many colleges makes it the bug- 
bear of the course. This ill repute was increased 
in the old-fashioned college course by the makeshift 
way in which time was grudged out to it in the cur- 
riculum. Under the name of " rhetoricals," En- 
glish declamations, orations, and essays used to be 
sandwiched in where some little crevice opened be- 
tween other studies, once a week perhaps, or at some 
irregular hour supposably unavailable for anything 
else. Now every teacher knows that a once-a-week 
study cannot be carried on with much profit or in- 
terest ; it cannot but be a weariness to student and 
instructor alike. It finds its way into the hands of 
incompetent and inexperienced teachers ; it has to 
rank as the Ishmael among the studies. 

It was the conviction of the teachers of English 
at Amherst that such ill repute was by no means a 
necessary accompaniment of their department. They 
believe that English, if granted a fair chance, could 
trust to its own intrinsic value and interest for sur- 
vival, as confidently as could any other study. I 
need not here recount the history of their quiet and 
steady work, first to gain a fair meed of time for 
the various branches of their department, then to 
obtain recognition for it as an elective study by the 
side of other electives, finally to retain the proper

relation and balance of elective and required study. 
All this came about so naturally as to seem a spon- 
taneous evolution rather than what it actually was, 
a strenuous and determined working out of a plan. 

The best name by which to characterize the work 
in English as now conducted at Amherst is labora- 
tory work. Whatever the diversities of aim and 
method between the teachers, in this respect they 
are at one : each of their courses is a veritable work- 
shop, wherein, by systematized daily drill, details are 
mastered one by one, and that unity of result is ob- 
tained which is more for practical use than for show. 
The required work in English, which is all under 
the charge of Professor Henry A. Frink, has to do 
with the English of oral expression. It consists of 
two terms of elocutionary drill, or declamation, in 
Freshman year, and one in Sophomore year ; two 
terms of rhetoric, carried on by means of essays, 
exercises, and lectures, in Freshman year ; and 
three terms of debates, both extemporaneous and 
prepared, in Senior year. This comprises in itself 
a body of work fully as large as obtained in the old 
days of " rhetoricals "; and when we consider the 
careful emphasis given to individual drill and crit- 
icism, in which work the services of five assistants 
are employed, we may well regard it as far beyond 
the average of the old courses in efficiency. 

In the elective study of English, each college year 
has its course characteristic of the year. These 
courses, in the way in which they supplement each 
other, form a natural sequence ; yet they are inde- 
pendent of each other, each professor being supreme 
in his sphere, to plan, carry out, and complete, ac- 
cording to his own ideas. A trio in which the mem- 
bers work side by side, in cooperation rather than 
in subordination. 

The elective English of the Sophomore year, un- 
der the charge of the writer, centres in written ex- 
pression, the study and practice of rhetoric. The 
rhetoric thus pursued as the many users of the 
writer's text-books throughout the country need not 
be reminded is not the mere broadened study of 
grammar ; it is a study of the organizing of dis- 
course, from the choice of words up, as a real au- 
thor must seek to effect it : a determinate study, in 
however humble way, of literature in the making. 
Two terms of work, based on the text-book and on 
the " Handbook of Rhetorical Analysis," are carried 
on by daily recitations and written exercises ; these 
latter, invented to illustrate in succession the rhe- 
torical principles under consideration, being progres- 
sive in character and requiring as they advance 
more originative work on the part of the student. 
The course has too many interesting and novel fea- 
tures to detail here ; one of these, which has proved 
very profitable and interesting, is the setting up in 
type of many of the students' written productions 
and the reading and criticism of them in proof. 

The third term is devoted to the writing of essays 
and careful individual criticism of each one in per- 
sonal interviews. Each man in the class presents 
an essay about once a fortnight. By the side of 



this work there is carried on, as time and numbers 
permit, a course of reading and discussion of the lead- 
ing prose writers ; also a voluntary English semin- 
ary, after the manner of the German universities. 

In the Junior year begin the elective classes of 
Professor Frink. Two hours a week in the first term 
are devoted to the study of logic, and two hours to 
a progressive and systematic course of Public Speak- 
ing. The work of this foundation term takes the 
form of debates, study and analysis of American 
and British orations, and Shakespearean readings. 
In a similar manner, public speaking is continued 
through the second term; the debates, discussions, 
and speeches of various kinds having to do with 
the rhetoric of oral expression. Much stimulus to 
these studies under Professor Frink is supplied by 
the numerous prizes offered for proficiency in the 
work of each term. Nor, though the number of 
men concerned and the extent and variety of the 
work would seem to necessitate much that is merely 
perfunctory, is this work anything like a mere rou- 
tine. The industry and genius of Professor Frink 
in adapting his labors and interests to the personal 
peculiarities of each individual precludes that ; and 
in the sunshine of such friendly relations many a 
man finds powers awakened that he had not sus- 
pected in himself, or powers that were running wild 
ordered and steadied. 

With the third term of the Junior year begins, 
under Professor H. Humphrey Neill, the study of 
English literature. Here the aim is to do with a 
good degree of thoroughness whatever is done ; 
hence familiarity with a limited number of the great 
writers is sought, rather than a smattering inform- 
ation about many. The method of work, as in the 
other English studies, is eminently the laboratory 
method; and this, while based in just proportion 
on facts and details, is so aimed as to get at the 
spirit of the literature. The opening term of the 
course is devoted, in part through text-books and 
in part through lectures and discussion of the prin- 
ciples of literary criticism, to the course of the litera- 
ture down to the end of the sixteenth century ; spe- 
cial attention being given to Chaucer, Spenser, Bacon, 
Milton, and Dryden. Shakespeare is reserved for 
a special term. In the study of these, dependence 
is placed not so much on reading about the author 
as on familiarity with the author himself. 

With the beginning of the Senior year the stu- 
dents work more independently. The first term is 
devoted to the prose writers of the eighteenth and 
the early part of the nineteenth century ; the sec- 
ond to the poets of the same period. Two weeks 
are given to the study of each author ; and on each 
author certain members of the class read extended 
and carefully studied essays. These essays, in con- 
nection with the readings and topics prescribed, are 
made the basis of the class discussions and exam- 
inations. In this way the men are taught to form 
and test their own opinions. In the third term of 
Senior year (the fourth of the course) the study is 
Shakespeare. A minute exegesis of one or two of

the greatest plays is given by means of lectures and 
topics for reading. In addition to this, four other 
plays are studied as a collateral course by the class, 
and made the subject of written examinations. This 
Shakespearean course is open to all, whether they 
have elected the three preceding terms or not. 

A special course is also given to a few who in 
every class, having pursued the course of the three 
prescribed terms, wish to carry their literary studies 
further. It consists of special investigation under 
the direction of the professor, but with no stated 
recitations. 

Such, in a very meagre outline, is the course of 
English study at Amherst. To pass judgment on 
it is for others, rather than for us who conduct it.

THE AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL 
ASSOCIATION. 



This well-known body of American scholars has com- 
pleted the twenty-fifth year of its organization; an event 
which in Germany would probably be called a Jubildum, 
and celebrated accordingly. The Association, however, 
remained content with the usual annual meeting, which 
was held at Williamstown, Mass., beginning on July 10. 
An unusually large number of members were in attend- 
ance, and the papers read, to the number of two dozen, 
were well received, and generally worthy of the occa- 
sion. Perhaps as interesting, from their novelty, as 
any, were the paper of Professor Wright, of Harvard 
University, on the votive tablet to Artemis Anaitis and 
Men Tiamou, recently picked up in a Boston curiosity 
shop, and now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts; and 
that of Professor Allen, of Harvard, on the music of 
the hymn to Apollo recently discovered by the French 
savans at Delphi, and transcribed by M. Reinach in 
modern musical notation. The hymn as thus modern- 
ized was sung by Professor Sihler, to piano accompani- 
ment, in the parlor of the hotel next morning, much to 
the entertainment of the assembled scholars. 

The Association was handsomely treated by the Trus- 
tees and Faculty of Williams College. President and 
Mrs. Carter gave a noon reception and luncheon to the 
members on Wednesday ; after which the majestic sum- 
mit of Greylock was reached by an excursion, which ab- 
sorbed the entire afternoon, but well repaid all fatigue 
incurred by affording one of the most superb mountain 
panoramas in New England. 

At one of the sessions a resolution was adopted ex- 
pressive of the Association's sorrow for the death of 
Professor W. D. Whitney, and its sense of the loss thus 
sustained by American scholarship. Professor Whitney 
was one of the founders of the Association, and its first 
President, and has always remained deeply interested 
in its welfare. It was also resolved to hold a joint 
meeting with the American Oriental Society and other 
similar bodies, at Philadelphia, in the Christmas holi- 
days, to unite in memorial exercises in honor of Profes- 
sor Whitney. This, of course, will not supersede the 
next regular annual meeting, which will be held at Cleve- 
land, Ohio, July 9, 1895. As some objection was made 
to coming so far " West," on the ground that the East- 
ern members are the most numerous and active, it seems 



especially incumbent on members, and those who ought 
to be members, living in the Central and Western States, 
to rally in large numbers at Cleveland next summer. 
Readers of THE DIAL will, it is hoped, aid in further- 
ing this desirable end. J R S 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE TEACHING OF LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your correspondent who asks, in THE DIAL of June 1, 
"How Shall English Literature Be Taught?" sug- 
gests difficulties which meet the teacher of any other 
literature, as well as of English. Those difficulties are 
less serious with the classical teacher, for instance, only 
because his pupils are compelled, even to the end of the 
college course, to devote so large a portion of their time 
to purely linguistic study. The college teacher of En- 
glish, however, begins with pupils who can read their 
texts at sight, as far as merely linguistic difficulties are 
concerned. If any material portion of the time be given 
to linguistics, it is from choice, not absolute necessity. 
If the teacher wishes to devote the time to "litera- 
ture," he may do so. But what is " literature " ? " The 
teacher of English who concerns himself with the sub- 
ject-matter of his text soon wanders into forbidden 
fields and lo! the dilettante," says your correspondent. 
Has the subject-matter, then, so little to do with litera- 
ture that it can be ignored, and " literature," not simply 
some one or more aspects of the same, still be taught? 
It would be interesting to see a detailed argument for 
such a position. In fact, some of the single phases of 
literary study cannot be adequately treated apart from 
the subject-matter. Take the rhetorical, for instance, 
what is responsible for the wide rhetorical difference be- 
tween Lowell's " Present Crisis," " Fountain of Youth," 
and " Commemoration Ode " ? between the Twenty-third 
Psalm and Whittier's scathing review of Carlyle's " Oc- 
casional Discourse on the Negro Question " ? Simply 
the subject-matter. Will any teacher attempt to con- 
sider these specimens of literature from the rhetorical 
standpoint, and leave subject-matter out of the account ? 

But the subject-matter leads into " forbidden fields," 
we are told. Why forbidden ? Because they " im- 
pinge more or less " upon the territory of other chairs 
" concerned with the humanities " ? Has specialization 
gone so far, then, that there must be a sort of " Devil's 
lane " between my field and that of each of my col- 
leagues ? Is it not well, on the contrary, that the dif- 
ferent departments should impinge upon one another 
here and there ? Let us not give the pupil an impres- 
sion that he is storing various compartments of his brain 
with materials which are in danger of explosion in case 
of accidental contact. 

Given the point of view which your correspondent 
seems to take, and the question should be, not how 
shall English, or any other, literature be taught, but, 
can it be taught at all ? In the fulness of its meaning, 
ninety-nine in every hundred of those of us who are 
trying must humbly answer No ! But many of us will 
prefer to work toward such an ideal, even at the risk 
of " poaching " on the territory of our colleagues, or sub- 
jecting ourselves to that dread term of reproach, " di- 
lettante." w. H. JOHNSON.

A SOCIETY OF COMPARATIVE LITERATURE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Since trustworthy principles of literary criticism de- 
pend upon the substantiation of aesthetic theory by scien- 
tific inquiry, and since for lack of systematic effort the 
comparative investigation of literary types, species, 
movements, and themes is not yet adequately prosecuted, 
I should like to call the attention of my fellow-workers 
to the need of collaboration. No individual can, unaided, 
gather from various literatures the materials necessary 
for an induction to the characteristic of even one literary 
type. The time has come for organization of effort. An 
association should be formed, as proposed by me in the 
last issue of THE DIAL, for the comparative investiga- 
tion of literary growths. In this Society of Compara- 
tive Literature (or of Literary Evolution) each mem- 
ber should devote himself to the study of a given type 
or movement in a literature with which he is specially, 
and at first hand, familiar. Thus, gradually, wherever 
the type or movement has existed its evolution and 
characteristics may be observed and registered. In 
time, by systematization of results, an induction to the 
common and therefore essential characteristics of the 
phenomenon, to the laws governing its origin, growth, 
and differentiation, may be made. The history of na- 
tional criticism, and the aesthetics of sporadic critical 
theory, are, of course, interesting subjects of study; but 
to adopt canons of criticism from Boileau, or Vida, or 
Puttenham, or Sidney, or Corneille, or even Lessing and 
Aristotle, and apply them to types or varieties of type 
with which these critics were unacquainted, is to sit in 
the well in your backyard and study the stars through 
a smoked glass. To come at the laws which govern 
the drama, for instance, it is not sufficient that we mod- 
ify by generally accepted aesthetic principles the canons 
of a school of dramatic critics, and then revise the re- 
sults in the light of our inductions from the drama of 
the charmed Grasco - Roman - Celto - Teutonic circle in 
which we contentedly expatiate. The specific principles 
of technical (or typical) criticism must be based upon 
the characteristics of the type not only in well-known 
but in less-known literatures, among aboriginal as well 
as civilized peoples, and in all stages of its evolution. 
Arrangements should be made for the preparation and 
publication of scientific monographs on national de- 
velopments of the drama. The comparative formula- 
tion of results would assist us to corroborate or to reno- 
vate current aesthetic canons of dramatic criticism. So, 

also, with other types lyric, epic, etc and with the 

evolution of literary movements and themes. Of course 
the labor is arduous, and the limit undefined. But the 
work is not yet undertaken by any English or American 
organization, or by any periodical or series of publica- 
tions in the English language. The members of this So- 
ciety of Comparative Literature must be hewers of wood 
and drawers of water. Even though they cannot hope 
to see the completion of a temple of criticism, they may 
have the joy of construction: the reward of the phil- 
ologist. For several years I have hoped that some 
one else would set this ball a-rolling. If the idea be re- 
ceived with favor, I intend to issue a detailed statement 
of the purposes and plans of such an organization. As- 
sistance and criticism from those whom the suggestion 
may interest are respectfully solicited.

THE SHAKESPEARE SOCIETY 6F NEW YORK 

AND ITS "BANKSIDE" SHAKESPEARE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

My attention is called to a letter addressed to Dr. 
W. J. Rolfe, which, though personal and not literary 
in character, is printed in the department of " Shakes- 
peariana " in " The Critic " of this date. 

This letter is signed by four persons, who attach to 
their names the titles of offices which they suppose them- 
selves to hold in The Shakespeare Society of New York. 
Neither of these four persons is at present a Trustee of 
that Society. Only one of them has even a colorable 
claim to membership in good standing therein, and one 
of them is not a member at all. Not one of them has 
been present at a meeting or council of that Society for 
two years last past ; and not one of them has ever con- 
tributed one cent to, nor has an interest to the amount 
of one cent in, the twenty-nine volumes which that So- 
ciety has published, nor in the eighteen which are now 
leaving its press. There is no such officer as " Chair- 
man of the Executive Committee " of that Society. Its 
charter provides for a Recording, and for an Assistant- 
Recording, Secretary, and for a Corresponding Secre- 
tary (whose duties are literary only). But there is no 
officer entitled to describe himself as "Secretary of the 
New York Shakespeare Society." 

No attention need, therefore, be paid to the perform- 
ances of these persons, nor to any statements which they 
may see fit to make concerning the Shakespeare Society 
of New York, especially to their statement that that 
Society has not " authorized " the Supplementary Vol- 
umes to " The Bankside Shakespeare," or that L. L. 
Lawrence, Clerk of the Publication Committee of that 
Society, is taking subscriptions for those volumes with- 
out authority. APPLETON MORGAN,

TO THE MEMORY OF TENNYSON. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As I believe there are among THE DIAL'S readers 
men and women willing to contribute to the proposed 
Tennyson memorial, I trust you will kindly print the 
following: 

Funds are being received for the erection of a lofty 
granite monolith, in the form of an lona cross, to the 
memory of Alfred Tennyson. It has been decided to 
erect the memorial on the highest point of the famous 
down which overlooks the western end of the Isle of 
Wight, and the spot chosen is the " edge of the noble 
down," which Tennyson loved so well, and where he al- 
most daily walked. The permission of the masters of 
Trinity House has been granted for the removal of the 
present wooden pile known to mariners as the Nodes 
Beacon, and the erection in its place of the Tennyson 
Beacon. As a land and sea mark visible from every 
point for many miles, the beacon cross should form a 
conspicuous and fitting memorial to the poet. 

The amounts contributed by subscribers to the fund 
will not be published, but as a tribute to the great poet 
it is hoped to send to England the names of every man 
and woman " whose life has been touched ' to finer is- 
sues ' by the poetry of Tennyson." Subscriptions may 
be sent to Miss Fay Davis, Secretary, in care of the un- 
dersigned. AKNIE FlELD8

THE KARAKORAM HIMALAYAS.* 



Mr. William Martin Conway's " Climbing 
in the Himalayas " is decidedly a notable book, 
and at all points a worthy shelf-companion to 
Mr. Whymper's fine work on the Andes issued 
two years ago. Apart from its scientific in- 
terest as the record of an important geograph- 
ical enterprise, it presents a vivid picture of 
the perils and, to the Anglo-Saxon apprehen- 
sion, the pleasures of mountaineering a form 
of " sport " not yet seriously affected by ath- 
letic faddists on this side the water. In point 
of illustration the volume rather surpasses, to 
our thinking, even the best of the many beau- 
tiful books of travel heretofore issued. The 
artist is Mr. A. D. McCormick, and he has 
throughout treated the motives furnished him 
by the magnificent scenery of the Himalayas 
with a breadth and feeling that lift his work 
far above the average level of book illustra- 
tion. As these plates are an important factor 
in the work, forming as they do a pictorial 
narrative ancillary to the text, we may quote 
Mr. Conway's testimony in the " Alpine Jour- 
nal " as to their descriptive value : 

" I was careful to impress on McCormick at the start 
that I wanted no topographical accuracy in his sketches 
only the rendering of the impression a scene made 
upon him in light and color, a transfer of his vision of 
it to paper, so that, if possible, I might learn better how 
to see the hills by finding out how he saw them. As a 
matter of fact, his eye was so true to form that truth- 
fulness of form was a part of his normal vision, and 
whoever looks at his works may be assured that they 
are accurate in outline and mass to a remarkable de- 
gree. His excellence and rapidity as a draughtsman 
are points that it is only fair that I should emphasize, 
for I reaped from them the most valuable fruit." 

The expedition of which the volume is the 
record was made in 1892, under the auspices 
of the Eoyal Geographical Society, the Royal 
Society, the British Association, and the In- 
dian Government. The party consisted of Mr. 
Con way, Lieutenant Bruce (5th Gurkhas), Mr. 
McCormick, Lieut.-Col. Dickin, Mr. Roude- 
bush, Mr. Eckenstein, and the Swiss guide, M. 
Zurbriggen. Starting from Abbottabad, they 
went to Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, and 
thence crossed the main Himalaya chain by the 
Burzil Pass to Astor and Bunji to the Indus 
Valley. They followed the road to Gilgit, an

important British frontier station. A month 
was spent in exploring the glaciers at the head 
of the Bagrot Valley and the great peaks near 
Rakipushi (25,500 feet). Returning to Gil- 
git, they went up the recently-annexed Hunza- 
Nagyr Valley and visited the towns of Hunza 
and Nagyr. From Nagyr two long expeditions 
were made into the snowy region to the south 
and southeast, before advancing to Hispar, at 
the foot of the longest glacier in the world out- 
side the polar regions. Here dividing into two 
parties, they made the first passage by Euro- 
peans of the Mushik Pass, and the first defin- 
itely-recorded passage of the Hispar Pass, the 
longest known pass in the world. Uniting again 
at Askole, in Baltistan, they marched eastward 
up the Braldo Valley to the foot of the great 
Baltoro Glacier, which drains what is probably 
the greatest mountain group in the world. From 
this glacier valley tower K. 2 (28,250 feet), 
Gusherbrum (26,378), the Hidden Peak (26,- 
480), the Golden Throne (23,600), the Bride 
(25,119), and Masherbrum (25,676). Forcing 
their way to the glacier head, where they camped 
for two nights at an altitude of 20,000 feet, they 
climbed Pioneer Peak (about 23,000 feet), the 
highest ascent yet authentically made. Return- 
ing to Askole, they crossed the Skoro Pass to 
Shigar and Skardo, whence they rode up the 
Indus Valley to Leh, the capital of Ladak. 
They went thence over the Zoji Pass to Kash- 
mir and returned home from Srinagar to En- 
gland, after an absence of about a year, 84 days 
of which were spent on snow or glacier. 

It is impossible to give here anything like a 
fair epitome of the story of this tremendous 
journey, and we must content ourselves with 
a few extracts serving to indicate its general 
drift and style. Mr. Conway reached Srin- 
agar on April 3, duly prepared to enjoy and to 
celebrate in his turn the oft-sung beauties of 
this "Venice of Kashmir." These beauties 
seem to have been considerably overpainted. 
Mr. Conway says, unfeelingly : 

" It is the shabbiest and filthiest Venice imaginable, 
picturesque no doubt, but with the picturesqueness of a 
dirty Alpine village a mere Zermath extended for 
miles along the banks of a big sewer. There is no ar- 
chitecture visible from the water highway, if one ex- 
cepts the fine mosque of Shah Hamadan, a second-rate 
Hindu temple or two, and a ruined tomb-mosque. The 
rest is a mere patchwork of crazy wooden houses and 
ugly palaces. There is plenteous interest about the life 
on the river, the boats and barges, the cries of the 
rowers, the people washing by the dirty shore, the 
glimpses up foul alleys and what not; but there is no 
art in all this, only materials from which the artist can 
rend forth beauty by educated skill."

Describing the New Bazar, one of the stock 
sights of Srinagar, Mr. Conway continues : 

" Craftsmen were working in the open rooms on the 
ground floor; most of the shops were upstairs. We were 
at once surrounded by a crowd, crying, ' I sell you this ! ' 
' I make you this ! ' ' Come and see my worrk ! ' ' You 
not buy from me; you buy from other man; see my 
things; I do good worrk; this is my shop ! ' and so on. 
We climbed crazy stairs and entered a small room 
wherein were tables covered with silver, copper, and 
brass inlaid with gay enamel. The dealer and his friends 
stood or squatted round; no one in particular seemed 
to own the shop. . . . We visited the papier-machie 
man, and noticed that English purchasers were steadily 
ruining his art by preferring his worst designs. He 
thought to capture us with one in particular. ' Last 
year I sold great many of these, every gentleman one 
pair, two pairs, mostly devil pattern I sold great many 
devil pattern devil pattern very much admired.' Thus 
do the English befoul the world's art." 

As the writer was formerly Professor of Art 
at Liverpool University, his testimony as to the 
art phase of the spreading " Anglo-Saxon con- 
tagion " carries some weight. John Bull, in 
fact, holding the power of the purse, would 
seem to have stimulated the once slow and 
scrupulous artificers of the Orient into a " pot- 
boiling " or Birmingham celerity, with not the 
happiest results as in Japan, where art is 
largely sinking into a trade regulated by the 
demand of the western market. 

Leaving Gilgit on May 10, the party reached 
the Hun/a river on the day following, and 
crossed it by means of ajhula a sort of prim- 
itive suspension bridge, cleverly enough con- 
structed and curiously analogous in the main to 
the complex structures at Niagara and Brook- 
lyn. As the natives let these bridges get into 
a rotten state before they mend them, it will 
be seen that, as the author feelingly testifies, 
Sijhula out of repair is " about as nasty a thing 
for a landsman to cross as may well be imag- 
ined." Mr. McCormick gives a view of the 
one at Dainyor, a giddy affair spun like a cob- 
web over a gorge that might shake the nerves 
of a Blondin. Says Mr. Conway : 

" Jhulas are formed of cables of twisted birch or other 
suitable twigs, each cable having a diameter of from 
two to three inches. Three of these cables, hanging in 
close contact side by side, and here and there tied to- 
gether, formed the floor of the bridge. There 'is a 
hand-rope at a suitable level on each side, hanging in a 
similar curve to that of the floor cable. Each of the 
hand-ropes is formed of a couple of cables twisted 
round one another. They are uncomfortable things to 
hold, being too thick to grasp, and spiked all along with 
the sharp projecting ends of the birch-twigs, whose 
points keep catching the sleeve at awkward moments. 
The gaping void between the hand-ropes and the floor- 
rope is interrupted every couple of yards by a weak tie, 
or V, of twisted withe, fastened to the hand-ropes, and 



passing under and partly supporting the floor-rope. At 
intervals of twelve yards or so there is a horizontal 
cross-piece of wood, firmly tied to the two hand-ropes, 
to keep them apart and to prevent them from spread- 
ing too wide. The cross-pieces are about at the level 
of the waist of a man standing on the bridge. These 
have to be climbed over as they occur. . . . One bridge, 
however, was new and strong, and the novelty of the 
thing was exciting; so that I crossed without discom- 
fort, and in a merely inquisitive frame of mind, such as 
one might have on a first occasion of dying. To be 
quite truthful it should be added that, when I reached 
the swiftest part of the current, the situation was none 
of the pleasantest; for the deceived eye deluded the 
imagination, and made believe that the water was stand- 
ing still, and the bridge itself swinging furiously up- 
stream." 

Mr. Conway has duly brightened his pages 
with descriptions of the people of the remote 
regions visited. Very interesting were the vil- 
lagers about Hopar in northern Kashmir, a 
race carrying on a primitive and fairly pros- 
perous agriculture, though still living in a state 
of chronic inter-tribal or inter-communal war- 
fare. At Hopar, he says, 

" We wandered leisurely by a winding path, through 
fields of green corn and blossoming beans, amongst which 
there was a quantity of mint in flower. Here, or else- 
where, whenever we approached women or children, 
they bolted away from us or tried to hide themselves. 
If their houses were near at hand, they ran for them like 
rabbits into their holes. If a familiar shelter was too 
far away, they hurried into the cornfields and cast them- 
selves down amongst the corn, by which they were com- 
pletely concealed. These people have the habit of war 
deeply ingrained. A stranger in their fields, who is not 
a prisoner, is a conqueror. Their attitude towards one 
who travels freely amongst them is thus an attitude of 
fear, which, however, is easily dispelled, and then they 
become the friendliest folk in the world, and will do 
anything for you." 

During his stay Mr. Conway witnessed an 
overt act of tribal hostility which, offering a fair 
casus belli, nearly led to a general conflict. 

" As we were returning through the fields to camp, a 
man rushed frantically amongst the growing corn and 
seized two kids. He broke their backs, one after an- 
other, and cast the carcasses on to the path. His act 
was seen by the owner of the kids, a peasant belonging 
to the next village, who cried aloud and summoned his 
friends. In a few minutes the population of both vil- 
lages came together and drew up opposite each other, 
gesticulating and shouting in great anger. A peasant 
war seemed on the point of breaking out. We thus 
had experience of the moods to which the villagers of 
these parts owe their strongly battlemented walls." 

Before leaving Hopar accounts had to be set- 
tled with the natives ; and the author gives an 
amusing description of his dealings with the 
Raja's Munshi a sort of local expert account- 
ant, the ex qfficio representative of the villagers 
in the arithmetical battle which ensued. As 
the Munshi a transparent humbug in point

of his supposed attainments did his addition 
on his fingers and was totally incapable of mul- 
tiplication and division, there was much " hig- 
gling of the market " as Adam Smith says. 
" Well, what have I to pay for ? " began Mr. 
Conway. 

" ' There is dud, atar, gJii yes, and there is wood too.' 
' How much atar ? ' The Munshi, looking hopeless 
Oh ! you have had atar; let us say for ten rupees.' 
Nonsense ! How much ? How many seers ? ' Why, 
hazor, these are poor people, and have little atar ; let 
us say eight rupees ! ' Habiba and the Gurkhas are 
called, and inform me of the exact number of seers 
each has had. ' Yes, that is quite right,' says the Mun- 
shi. ' But that is not worth eight rupees.' Well, how 
much does it come to, hazor? Tell me, for I do not 
know.' And so on. ' Now how many seers of milk ? ' 
' Well, the Khansama knows ; how much would you 
say ? ' Fifteen.' < All right; fifteen is right.' " 

In point of understanding the Hunshi's clients 
seem to have been worthy of their deputy, lo- 
cal information having to be screwed out of 
them piecemeal. " What do you call that val- 
ley ? " Mr. Conway would ask. 

" ' I have no tongue.' That valley is it Bualtar ? ' 
Ah ! Bualtar.' And that hill is it Shaltar ? ' ' Ah ! 
Shaltar Shaltar i Chish.' ' Good ! now that village 
what 's its name ? ' Ah ! village.' No. Begin again. 
The name of that is Bualtar ? ' ' Ah ! Bualtar.' And 
that is Shaltar ? ' Ah ! Shaltar.' < And that village 
what is it ? ' Ah ! village.' " 

Of the record of the party's mountaineering 
experiences, which takes up most of the vol- 
ume, the following extracts from the chapter 
on the " Ascent of Pioneer Peak " may serve 
as a sample. The ascent of the Peak proper 
was begun on August 25 from " Upper Pla- 
teau Camp," a point at which an altitude of 
20,000 feet had already been gained. The 
preceding night, says Mr. Conway, was bit- 
terly cold, and by five o'clock Zurbriggen, the 
Alpine guide, was stirring, and began prepara- 
tions for the journey. 

" His was the laborious duty of preparing a warm 
drink of chocolate, with indifferent spirit to burn, and 
no space to manoauvre the apparatus in. The Russian 
lamp began to roar like a falling avalanche ; and, while 
the chocolate was cooking, we struggled out of our sleep- 
ing bags and into our boots, and wound the pattis round 
our legs, first greasing our feet with marmot fat, for 
protection against the cold. Every movement was a 
toil. After lacing a boot, one had to lie down and take 
breath before one could lace the next." 

Shortly before six all was ready, and the trav- 
ellers faced the long snow slope stretching be- 
tween them and the ridge along which the rest 
of the way was to lie. 

" For an hour we plodded steadily upwards in the bit- 
ter cold. The risen sun left us still in the shadow, and 
moment by moment our limbs grew colder and our 



strength seemed to be evaporating. Gradually the se- 
vere exercise warmed our bodies, but our feet lost all 
sensation. We crunched our toes inside our boots with 
every step, and stamped our feet upon the ground ; but 
nothing gave the smallest relief. At last it became 
necessary to halt and pull off our boots, to bring life 
back to our feet by rubbing. We were all on the point 
of being frost-bitten, and only saved ourselves by the 
most vigorous measures. During our halt the sun came 
upon us; and though our feet were numbed for the rest 
of the day, our bodies were soon far too hot to be com- 
fortable. These variations between biting cold and 
grilling heat are one of the great impediments to moun- 
taineering at high altitudes in these parts." 

After a quarter of an hour's walk along the 
ridge, the first peak (20,700 feet) was reached, 
and the second peak (21,350 feet) after a rough 
scramble through rocks and over hard ice in 
which " every step taken " had to be cut with 
the axe in an hour and ten minutes. This 
labor of step-cutting Zurbriggen found infin- 
itely more fatiguing than at the ordinary Swiss 
levels. The rest of the ascent was altogether 
monotonous a dogged struggle of nearly three 
hours, with axe, rope, and alpenstock, up an 
arete heavily corniced on the left, so that the 
view on that side was completely shut out. 

" Our advance was necessarily slow, and the terrible 
heat which the burning rays of the sun poured upon our 
heads did not add to its rapidity. There was plenty of 
air upon the actual ridge, and now and again a puff 
would come down upon us and quicken us into a little 
life; but for the most part we were in the midst of utter 
aerial stagnation which made life intolerable. I heard 
the click ! click ! of Zurbriggen's axe, making the long 
striding steps, and I mechanically struggled from one 
to another. I was dimly conscious of a vast depth down 
below on the right, filled with tortured glacier and gap- 
ing crevasses of monstrous size. Sometimes I would 
picture the frail ice-steps giving way, and the whole 
party falling down the precipitous slope. I asked my- 
self upon which of the rocks projecting below should 
we meet with our final smash; and I inspected the 
schrunds for the one that might be our last not unwel- 
come resting-place. Then there would come a reaction, 
and for a moment the grandeur of the scenery would 
make itself felt. ... At length the slope we were 
climbing became less steep. To avoid a larger mass of 
cornice than usual we kept away horizontally to the 
right, and presently discovered that the cornice was the 
actual summit of the third peak on the ridge. We held 
the rope tight with all imaginable precautions whilst 
Zurbriggen climbed to the top. He found a firm place 
where all could cut out seats for themselves, and there 
at 2.45 P. M. we entered upon well-earned repose." 

The victory was won, for the halting-place was 
the top of Pioneer Peak, the highest point yet 
authentically reached by man. 

" The moment we looked round we saw that the peak 
we were on was the highest point of our ridge. Beyond 
it was a deep depression, on the other side of which a 
long face of snow led up to the south ridge of the Golden 
Throne. From the Throne, therefore, we were utterly 
cut off. Ours was a separate mountain, a satellite of

its greater neighbor, whose summit still looked down 
upon us from a height of 1,000 feet, and whose broad 
extended arms shut out the view to the north-east which 
I so ardently desired to behold. Framed in the passes 
I have mentioned there were glorious mountain pictures ; 
that to the south, looking straight down the great Kon- 
dus valley and away over the bewildering intricacy of 
the lower Ladak ranges being especially fine, and ren- 
dered all the more solemn by the still roof of cloud 
poised over it at a height of 25,000 feet. When one 
beholds a small portion of Nature near at hand, the ac- 
tion of avalanches, rivers, and winds seems tremendous, 
but in a deep-extending view over range after range of 
mountains, and valley beyond valley, Nature's forces 
are reduced to a mere trembling insignificance, and the 
effect of the whole is majestic repose. The clouds 
seemed stationary above the mountain kingdom; not a 
sound broke the utter stillness of the air. We ceased 
to pant for breath the moment the need for exertion was 
withdrawn, and a delicious lassitude and forgetfulness 
of past labor supervened upon our over-wrought frames." 

The barometer, standing at 13.30 inches, gave 
an altitude of 22,600 feet. The summit of the 
Golden Throne, towering high above the Peak, 
was about 800 yards away horizontally, and 
elevated at an angle of 25. " We were there- 
fore," says Mr. Con way, "approximately, 1,100 
feet below it. ... If the G. T. S. value for 
the height of K.2 is correct, the Golden Throne 
must be 24,100 feet high, and the height of 
Pioneer Peak is over 23,000 feet." Tracings 
taken with the sphygmograph of the author's 
and M. Zurbriggen's pulse showed the damag- 
ing effect of the altitude. " Our breathing ap- 
paratus," says Mr. Con way, " was working well 
enough, but our hearts were being sorely tried, 
and mine was in a parlous state." Further climb- 
ing was out of the question even for the hardy 
Swiss, who owned that " another step he could 
not cut. All recognized that the greatest we 
were going to accomplish was done, and that 
thenceforward nothing remained for us but 
downwards and homewards." 

The total result of the expedition can be es- 
timated from the present volume, and from the 
reports and scientific memoranda to be pub- 
lished separately, with maps, in the coming 
autumn. It is hardly necessary to say of Mr. 
Con way that no better man could have been 
chosen either as leader or chronicler of the ex- 
pedition. A copious author, a Fellow of the 
Society of Arts and of the Royal Geographical 
Society, the Vice-President of the Alpine Club 
and editor of "The Alpine Journal," his name is 
familiar to the scientist and the general reader. 
We can point to no more readable, solidly in- 
forming, and outwardly attractive book of trav- 
els than " Climbing in the Himalayas."

DUTCH INFLUENCE UPON AMERICA.* 



The making of history is a gradual process. 
There are occasional wars, or political or social 
commotions ; but the every-day life of the peo- 
ple occupies by far the greater part of the years 
of a nation's life. Little things are apt to pass 
unnoticed ; local customs change ; the charac- 
ter of a community is altered ; old landmarks 
are swept away, and in the busy rush of our 
American life a new generation forgets the 
old, and the familiar customs of the fathers 
become strange to the children. 

The writers of our history have too often 
been content with a recital of the leading events 
of military and political life, or have confined 
their attention to constitutional discussions, 
neglecting to note the fact that the develop- 
ment of the people, in their social, economic, 
and industrial conditions, gives the substantial 
basis to the nation's strength, and that much 
of history is made in quiet ways, without the 
scenic effects of the thunder-and-lightning of 
warfare. 

But when once the writers turned their 
thought to the people, manifest differences ap- 
peared, strange and surprising difficulties ; and 
various methods were adopted to harmonize 
these with the old theory that the American peo- 
ple are but transplanted Englishmen. Douglas 
Campbell stirred up a great deal of interest 
when he published his " Puritan in England, 
Holland, and America," two years ago. It led 
to the examination of the origin of certain 
features of American institutions, by a gentle- 
man who has but recently published the results 
of his study in " Sources of the Constitution 
of the United States "; and it no doubt stim- 
ulated Dr. Griffis to reexamine the facts of 
Dutch history, which had already appealed to 
him, and which he had collected into readable 
form in a pamphlet of his own. His volume 
on " Brave Little Holland, and What She 
Taught Us " is valuable for two reasons, cer- 
tainly : it puts in a very attractive form the 
story of the growth of Holland, and, more espe- 
cially, it presents many new and important con- 
siderations affecting the question, Just what 
influence did New Netherlands have upon 
American life, and how large an increment of 
population was thus added to the cosmopolitan 
colonies ? 

The claim is set forth that the foundations 
of the Empire State were laid by the Dutch,

and that, notwithstanding the short life of the 
colony before the occupation by the English 
in 1664, impressions had been made which 
were lasting, so that when New York, as a 
State of the American Union, formed its con- 
stitution and developed its institutions, the pre- 
cedents from the monarchical form of govern- 
ment of England were disregarded for the 
principles of the republic across the sea. De- 
tails are given in illustration, and the array of 
claims is quite imposing. The list is somewhat 
familiar to students, but it goes without saying 
that there is a vast deal of importance in the 
sentence : 

" From the Dutch system they [our fathers] borrowed 
the idea of a written constitution, a Senate, or States- 
General, the Hague, or District of Columbia, the Su- 
preme Court (with vast improvements), the land laws, 
registration of deeds and mortgages, local self-govern- 
ment from the town and county to the government of 
governments at Washington, the common-school sys- 
tem, freedom of religion and of the press, and many of 
the details of the Dutch state and national systems." 

But the interest of the volume does not come 
from this grouping of claims for Dutch influ- 
ence, so much as from the many chance sug- 
gestions and references found all through the 
chapters, accounting for names and symbols, 
and throwing light upon peculiar customs or 
characteristics, noticed by others, but not so 
fully explained. No one can read the little 
book without feeling the truth of what is said 
about the relations existing between the Dutch 
Eepublic and that of the United States of 
America. Following the story of the one, the 
impression grows that when Benjamin Frank- 
lin declared, " In love of liberty and bravery 
in the defense of it, she has been our great ex- 
ample," he told but part of the truth. There 
must have been the influence of the example 
of a republic struggling for the improvement 
of constitutional government, and there must 
have been untold and hardly described influ- 
ences which permeated the society of the mid- 
dle colonies, where the seven thousand Dutch 
made their homes, weaving into the life of the 
people the web of Dutch character and Dutch 
ideas. 

Even if the reader be one of those who con- 
tend that there was no influence but the En- 
glish affecting American life and character be- 
fore the great tides of immigration began to 
set in, there will be positive enjoyment in read- 
ing again the accounts of the various ways in 
which the people of Holland showed their sym- 
pathy for the American cause during the Rev- 
olution. Friends were scarce enough in those 



times, and " Brave Little Holland " should 
have a warm place in our hearts for her ex- 
pressions of friendship then. 

There is a lack of footnotes and references 
to support the statements of the text, but the 
book was not written for students and histo- 
rians. The story is put in simple language for 
the young folks of America, and the author 
expresses his trust that by the book a deeper 
interest may be awakened in the little country 
of which John Adams wrote : " The originals 
of the two Republicks are so much alike, that 
the History of One seems but a Transcript 
from that of the other."

UNCONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION.* 



Mr. Coxe's work on "Judicial Power and 
Unconstitutional Legislation " is incomplete. 
He planned two volumes, the first to contain a 
history of the relation of judicial power to a 
superior binding rule of right, the second to 
be a commentary on the text of our Constitu- 
tion and devoted to establishing the thesis that 
the power to declare acts unconstitutional and 
void is expressly granted. The author died 
leaving the second volume so incomplete that 
his executors did not feel warranted in sending 
it to the press. The first volume, therefore, is 
the one before us. It is a very elaborate dis- 
cussion of cases in Roman Law, Canon Law, 
English Law, and Modern Law, on the conti- 
nent of Europe, as well as in the American 
colonies before the Revolution and in the 
United States under the Articles of Confeder- 
ation. Cases are found in each division in 
which a court held a specific legislative enact- 
ment void because repugnant to what was held 
to be a superior rule. 

These scattered cases, however, would hardly 
have sufficed to set up a distinct legal prece- 
dent. What doubtless weighed most with the 
Constitutional Convention of 1787 was not 
precedent at all, but the absolute necessity of 
the situation and the impracticability of any 
other plan. Under the Articles of Confedera- 
tion the Congress was impotent because there 
was no means of bringing its will to bear on any 
individual citizen. The legislation of the sep- 
arate States might, and not infrequently did, 
directly nullify acts of Congress or treaties of

the United States. This must be remedied or 
the Union was doomed. Two ways were sug- 
gested. One was for a Federal veto on State 
legislation ; the other relegated the matter to 
the courts, and merely provided that the or- 
ganic law of the nation should be the supreme 
law of the land. The first was preventive ; the 
second was remedial. The latter was adopted, 
doubtless as being less objectionable in the view 
of those who would be opposed to great cen- 
tralization. And no other way of dealing with 
the difficulty than these two can easily be im- 
agined. So the action of the Convention is 
easily accounted for. 

The power in question is by no means inher- 
ent in a written constitution. Switzerland has 
such a constitution, in large part formed after 
the pattern of our own. But by that instru- 
ment the Swiss judiciary is expressly forbid- 
den to pass on the constitutionality of statutes. 
Nearly every nation on the European continent 
has now a written constitution. But in none 
is the judicial power allowed to extend to con- 
stitutional questions. The reasons for this jeal- 
ousy of the courts are partly historical ; the 
judges have always been in a more or less de- 
pendent position. At the same time the Eu- 
ropean conception of the nature of government 
is radically different from that which prevails 
here. We regard court, executive, and legis- 
lature, as alike merely the agents of sover- 
eignty, and each as strictly limited by specific- 
ally delegated powers. The European view is 
substantially that of England and that is, the 
omnipotence of the legislature. Such varia- 
tions in detail as exist may tend to the inde- 
pendence of the executive, as is the case in the 
German Empire. But the historic causes which 
have left the monarch strong have not acted to 
add power to the courts. They still hold a 
subordinate place. 

The whole question has a new interest to the 
American student of political science in the 
light of the extraordinary position of the Su- 
preme Court in the memorable case of Juil- 
liard vs. Greenman. That ground is substan- 
tially this : that Congress has all the powers 
which the national legislatures of foreign sov- 
ereign and civilized governments have and use, 
as incidental to powers identical with the ex- 
press powers given to our Congress provided 
only that such powers are not prohibited to 
Congress by the constitution. 

It is difficult to see how this doctrine does 
not come very near to confounding the radical 
difference between the European and American 



views of government. It certainly stops little 
short of vesting in Congress the English par- 
liamentary omnipotence. And if, as Mr. Coxe 
suggests, Congress were to enact that the Su- 
preme Court should under no circumstances 
declare a Federal statute unconstitutional, so 
long as the decision in Juilliard vs. Greenman 
remains law the court would certainly be bound 
to accept such supposed enactment as valid. 
And that at one blow would destroy the coor- 
dinate independence of the judiciary. Is not 
the decision in Juilliard vs. Greenman, then, 
in effect a grave menace to the very power of 
the court which we have come to regard as one 
of the strongest bulwarks of constitutional free- 
dom? 

In the light of these considerations, the ques- 
tion of judicial power as related to unconstitu- 
tional laws is worthy of careful and renewed 
attention. It lies at the very heart of the vital 
distinction which we have been accustomed to 
make between the State and the government of 

the State.

RECENT POETRY.* 



Mr. Lang's recent " rally of fugitive rhymes " 
consists mostly of trifles, but trifles of the exquisite 
sort that he almost alone knows how to throw off. 
Of the small number of wholly serious poems in- 
cluded, the place of honor must be given as in- 
deed it is in the volume to "A Scot to Jeanne 
d'Arc." Happily, it is not too long to quote. 

" Dark Lily without blame, 

Not upon us the shame, 
Whose sires were to the Auld Alliance true, 
They, by the Maiden's side, 
Victorious fought and died, 
One stood by thee that fiery torment through, 
Till the White Dove from thy pure lips had passed, 
And thou wert with thine own St. Catherine at the last.

" Born of a lowly line, 

Noteless as once was thine, 
One of that name I would were kin to me, 
Who, in the Scottish Guard, 
Won this for his reward, 
To fight for France, and memory of thee 
Not upon us, dark Lily, without blame, 
Not on the North may fall the shadow of that shame. 

" On France and England both 

The shame of broken troth, 
Of coward hate and treason black must be ; 
If England slew thee, France 
Sent not one word, one lance, 
One coin to rescue or to ransom thee. 
And still thy Church unto the Maid denies 
The halo and the palms, the Beatific prize. 

" But yet thy people calls 
Within the rescued walls 
Of Orleans ; and makes its prayer to thee ; 
What though the Church have chidden 
These orisons forbidden. 

Yet art thou with this earth's immortal Three, 
With him in Athens that of hemlock died, 
And with thy Master dear whom the world crucified." 

It seems, according to Mr. Lang's notes, that Jeanne 
d'Arc led a Scottish force at Lagny, that she her- 
self declared her portrait to have been made by a 
Scottish archer, and that two Langs (or Lains) were 
in the French service about 1507. All of which 
afford excellent reasons, if any were needed, why 
a fin de dix-neuvieme siecle Scot should have paid 
this beautiful tribute to the Maid of Orleans. Be- 
fore turning to Mr. Lang's lighter verse, we must 
find room for this characteristic erratum concern- 
ing the sonnet "Britannia": 

" Reader, a blot hath escaped the watchfulness of the set- 
ter-f orth : if thou wilt thou mayst amend it. The sonnet on 
the forty-fourth page, against all right Italianate laws, hath 
but thirteen lines withal : add another to thy liking, if thou 
art a Maker ; or, if thou art none, even be content with what 
is set before thee. If it be scant measure, be sure it is choicely 
good." 

But how could a man who is a Maker let such a 
thing escape him ? The sonnet called " Gallia," at 
least, is correct in scheme, and is worth reproducing 
because of the abbreviated verse so rarely employed 
by English sonneteers. 

" Lady, lady neat 

Of the roguish eye, 

Wherefore dost thou hie, 
Stealthy, down the street, 
On well-booted feet ? 

From French novels I 

Gather that you fly 
Guy or Jules to meet. 

"Furtive dost thou range 
Oft thy cab to change ; 

So ; at least, 't is said : 
Oh, the sad old tale 
Passionately stale, 

We 've so often read ! " 



This is something of a tour de force, although less 
so than the Frenchman's sonnet-epitaph for a young 

S M: "Fort 

Belle, 
Elle 
Dort. 
Sort 
Frele, 
Quelle 
Mort! 

" Rose 
Close, 
La 
Brise 
L'a 
Prise." 

In " The Restoration of Romance" and "The Tour- 
ney of the Heroes " we have two poems in celebra- 
tion of the Haggard - Stevenson - Doyle - Weyman 
school of fiction. Mr. Lang, as he has often let us 
know before, does not like novels that lead to soul- 
searching, and Mrs. Humphry Ward is his bete 
noire. The second of these poems is a spirited bal- 
lad in which Ivanhoe, Hereward, Gotz, Porthos, and 
others, do battle with a motley crowd of such mod- 
erns as Felix Holt and Silas Lapham and David 
Grieve. The fight is soon narrowed down, until, 

" At length but two are left on ground, and David Grieve is 

one. 

Mafoy, what deeds of derring-do that bookseller hath done ! 
The other, mark the giant frame, the great portentous fist ! 
'Tis Porthos ! David Grieve may call on Kuenen an he list." 

But why should David call on Kuenen ? That might 
have been Robert Elsmere's refuge, but Friar Tuck 
settled him before he had time to call upon any sort 
of patron saint. It is needless to say that Porthos 
remains in possession of the field. There are a 
number of personal tributes in Mr. Lang's volume, 
and from that written "For Mark Twain's Jubilee " 
we make one inimitable extract. 

" How many and many a weary day, 
When sad enough were we, ' Mark's way ' 

(Unlike the Laureate's Mark's) 
Has made us laugh until we cried, 
And, sinking back exhausted, sighed, 

Like Gargery, Wot larx ! " 

One looks askance at a group of poems described as 
" written under the influence of Wordsworth," but 
the following example will show that it is only Mr. 
Lang's f-f-fun : 

" Mist, though I love thee not, who puttest down 

Trout in the Lochs (they feed not, as a rule, 

At least on fly, in mere or river-pool 
When fogs have fallen, and the air is lown, 
And on each Ben, a pillow not a crown, 

The fat folds rest), thou, Mist, hast power to cool 

The blatant declamations of the fool 
Who raves reciting through the heather brown. 

" Much do I bar the matron, man, or lass 

Who cries ' How lovely ! ' and who does not spare, 

When light and shadow on the mountain pass, 
Shadow and light, and gleams exceeding fair, 

O'er rock, and glade, and glen, to shout, the Ass, 
To me, to me the Poet, ' Oh, look there ! ' " 

But we must leave something for readers of the 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



book itself, and will close with a few lines inscribed 

"The Unknown Correspondent, who, 

With nndefatigable pen, 
And nothing in the world to do, 
Perplexes literary men," 

and to whom is addressed this solemn adjuration : 
' ' friends with time upon your hands, 

O friends with postage stamps in plenty, 
poets out of many lands, 

youths and maidens under twenty, 
Seek out some other wretch to bore, 

Or wreak yourselves upon your neighbours, 
And leave me to my dusty lore, 
And my unprofitable labours ! " 

Mr. Richard LeGallienne's volume of " English 
Poems " opens with some lines " to the reader," from 
which we make this quotation : 

" O shall we hear an English song again ! 
Still English larks mount in the merry morn, 
And English May still brings an English thorn, 
Still English daisies up and down the grass, 
Still English love for English lad and lass 
Yet youngsters blush to sing an English song ! " 

We should not call attention to these verses if they 
were not obviously intended to provide the collec- 
tion with a keynote, and if the poems that follow 
seemed to bear out the suggested claim. But the 
quality of Mr. LeGallienne's work seems to us any- 
thing but distinctively English. If it reminds us of 
one poet more than of another, Rossetti is the man ; 
and we can never think of Rossetti as other than 
an exotic in the English garden of song. The fol- 
lowing lines on " The House of Venus " will illus- 
trate our meaning: 

" Not that Queen Venus of adulterous fame, 
Whose love was lust's insatiable flame 
Not hers the house I would be singer in 
Whose loose-lipped servants seek a weary sin : 
But mine the Venus of that morning flood 
With all the dawn's young passion in her blood, 
With great blue eyes and unpressed bosom sweet. 
Her would I sing and of the shy retreat 
Where Love first kissed her wondering maidenhood, 
And He and She first stood, with eyes afraid, 
In the most golden house that God has made." 

This is charming verse, but its inspiration is not ex- 
actly English. The first half of Mr. LeGallienne's 
book is given up to " Paolo and Francesca," a poem 
in Spenserian stanza ; " Love Platonic," a group of 
poems having the common motive suggested by their 
title ; and " Cor Cordium," another group similarly 
linked together. These three divisions of the book 
are apparently intended (we quote from a recent 
English critic) " to contrast three phases of sexual 
affection : passion overleaping social law, passion re- 
strained by social law, and passion sanctioned by 
social law." The idea is a good one, and the parts 
of the trilogy are well contrasted. Our own selec- 
tion shall be taken, not from these groups, but from 
the miscellaneous portion of the book, and is enti- 
tled " Sunset in the City." 

" Above the town a monstrous wheel is turning, 

With glowing spokes of red, 
Low in the west its fiery axle burning ; 
And, lost amid the spaces overhead, 
A vague white moth, the moon, is fluttering. 



"Above the town an azure sea is flowing, 

'Mid long peninsulas of shining sand, 
From opal unto pearl the moon is growing, 
Dropped like a shell upon the changing strand. 

" Within the town the streets grow strange and haunted, 

And, dark against the western lakes of green, 
The buildings change to temples, and unwonted 
Shadows and sounds creep in where day has been. 

" Within the town, the lamps of sin are flaring, 

Poor foolish men that know not what ye are ! 
Tired traffic still upon his feet is faring 
Two lovers meet and kiss and watch a star." 

Mr. LeGallienne's work is very uneven, but is prom- 
ising at its best. He is still a minor poet, but is pos- 
sibly in the chrysalis stage of development into some- 
thing better. 

Mrs. Hinkson's " Cuckoo Songs" are mostly sim- 
ple lyrics and ballads, versified Irish legends, and 
mediaeval aspects of religious emotion. 
" A small monotonous song I sing, 

My notes are faint and few, 
Like his whose coming wakes the Spring, 
Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! " 

" The Resurrection : a Miracle Play," is the most 
pretentious and perhaps the best of these pieces. 
" God's Bird " is a pretty conceit, and may be taken 
for our illustration. 

"Nay, not Thine eagle, Lord, 

No golden eagle I, 

That creep half-fainting on the sward, 
And have not wings to fly. 

" Nor yet Thy swallow dear, 

That, faring home to Thee, 
Looks on the storm and hath no fear, 
And broods above the sea. 

" Nor yet Thy tender dove, 

Meek as Thyself, Thou Lamb ! 
I would I were the dove, Thy love, 
And not that thing I am ! 

" But take me in Thy hand, 

To be Thy sparrow, then ; 
Were two sparrows in Holy Land, 
One farthing bought the twain. 

" Make me Thy sparrow, then, 
That trembles in Thy hold ; 
And who shall pluck me out again, 
And cast me in the cold ? 

" But if I fall at last, 

A thing of little price, 
If Thou one thought on me hast cast, 
Lo, then my Paradise ! " 

A defective sense of rhythm is manifest in most of 
these " Cuckoo Songs," marring what would often 
otherwise have been an effective bit of lyric. 

In the season which is, at least theoretically, one 
of rest, relaxation, and recuperation, one might do 
worse than heed the voice of the summer philoso- 
pher who persuades us to join him in his rustic re- 
treat with such arguments as these : 

" Here the sleek shorthorns in the shade 

Crop clover by the gate, 
Without (thank heav'n) a dairymaid 

Who, tossed by savage Fate, 
Comes our weak intellect to vex, 

Like D'Urbervilian Tess, 
With sombre riddles of the sex, 

Far too abstruse to guess.

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



" When the spruce chaffinch twitters clear, 

Amid the apple bloom, 
No social problems bore my ear, 

No prophecies of gloom ; 
And when the sparrows in the eaves 

Salute the morning haze, 
I catch among the ivy leaves 

No word of Ibsen's plays." 

These stanzas are extracted from " The Kestrel's 
Nest, and Other Verses," by Mr. Alfred Cochrane, 
a volume of vers de societS which we do not hesitate 
to place among the best of its class with the work 
of Mr. Dobson, Mr. Locker, and Mr. Lang. Which 
position we proceed to defend by these lines from 
" Omnia Vincit ": 

" Love, I said in my wisdom, Love is dead, 
For all his fabled triumphs and instead 
We find a calm affectionate respect 
Doled forth by Intellect to Intellect. 

" Yet when Love, taking vengeance, smote me sore, 
My Siren called me from no classic shore ; 
It was no Girton trumpet that laid low 
The walls of this Platonic Jericho. 

" For when my peace of mind at length was stole, 
I thought no whit of Intellect or Soul ; 
Nay ! I was cast in pitiful distress 
By brown eyes wide with truth and tenderness." 

Another example may be taken from the stanzas 
" To Anthea," which illustrate a form of self-abase- 
ment not uncommon among lovers. 

" My taste in Art she hailed with groans, 
And I, once charmed with bolder tones, 
Now love the yellows of Bume- Jones : 

But then, She likes them. 
My tuneful soul no longer hoards 
Stray jewels from the Empire boards ; 
I revel now in Dvorak's chords : 

But then, She strikes them. 

Our age distinctly cramps a knight ; 
Yet, though debarred from tilt and fight, 
I can admit that black is white, 

If she asserts it. 
Heroes of old were luckier men 
Than I I venture now and then 
To hint retracting meekly when 

She controverts it." 

What could be more delicious in its humor than 
"The Ballade of Classical Music" 

" What time the string quintette is long, 

And concert chairs grow hard, may be, 
While strange-named fiddlers, going strong, 
Have ntt yet finished ' Movement 3,' 

" Think not our saddened air ennui, 
Others have this dejection had ; 
We do but with the poet agree, 
And still sweet music makes us sad " 

with its " Envoy " 

" Be merciful, fair devotee, 

The Lett motiv, which makes you glad, 
Sometimes the novice fails to see, 

And still sweet music makes us sad." 

One complete poem " Upon Lesbia, Arguing " 
must end our extracts. 

" My Lesbia, I will not deny, 

Bewitches me completely ; 
She has the usual beaming eye, 



And smiles upon me sweetly : 
But she has an unseemly way 
Of contradicting what I say. 

" And, though I am her closest friend, 

And find her fascinating, 
I cannot cordially commend 

Her method of debating : 
Her logic, though she is divine, 
Is singularly feminine. 

" Her reasoning is full of tricks, 

And butterfly suggestions ; 
I know no point to which she sticks, 

She begs the simplest questions ; 
And, when her premises are strong, 
She always draws her inference wrong. 

" Broad, liberal views on men and things 

She will not hear a word of ; 
To prove herself correct she brings 

Some instance she has heard of ; 
The argument ad hominem 
Appears her favorite stratagem. 

' ' Old Socrates, with sage replies 
To questions put to suit him, 
Would not, I think, have looked so wise 

With Lesbia to confute him ; 
He would more probably have bade 
Xantippe hasten to his aid. 

" Ah ! well, my fair philosopher, 

With clear brown eyes that glisten 
So sweetly, that I much prefer 
To look at them than listen, 
Preach me your sermon : have your way, 
The voice is yours, whate'er you say." 

We commend this masterly study to those inter- 
ested in the comparative psychology of the sexes. 

The " Poems " of Mr. Langdon Elwyn Mitchell 
are grave, thoughtful, and refined. While never 
rising to great altitudes, they exhibit mastery of 
material, and the restraint of one who recognizes 
his limitations. They have, for the most part, a 
healthy objectivity that removes them as far as pos- 
sible from the mere Hirngespinnst of most amateur 
writers of verse. Mr. Mitchell can paint a quiet 
picture or give expression to a passing mood with 
much command of subtle verbal effect. For a pic- 
ture, let us take these lines : 

" There is an old town by the sea, 
That lies alone and quietly. 
Behind, the sand-dunes bleak and gray 
Stretch to the low hills away ; 
Before, the ripple laps and calls, 
Running along the weedy walls ; 
Like crescents pale, on either side 
The silver sands receive the tide ; 
And from the winding streets you see 
The great green waters of the sea." 

And for a mood, these verses, that follow upon the 
highly poetical description of an autumn day : 

" And my deep heart within, 
Like a calm lake, reflects the golden scene, 
Distinct in all its glory, e'en to where 
The distant hills loom up in the warm air, 
Melting in silvery haze. 

" How sweet, how good 
It is to be reborn into this mood 
Of natural ending : to be satisfied 
With the world's age, and ebb of its great tide. 
Too often do we fall from such content ; 



1894.]

Estranged from our own nature, wryed and bent, 

As saplings in the forest by the snow, 

Heavily fallen, and which never grow 

Erect again ; Life falls on us e'en so ! 

And, wrenched at heart too rudely, we become 

Like those whose spirits, fading on the gloom 

And bitterness of things, see naught to please 

Where others find a blessedness or ease ; 

Whom nothing satisfies : nor love, nor mirth ; 

Not clouds, and not the sun's bright looking forth ; 

Not Life ! forever sliding into change ; 

Not Death ! for death 's unnatural and strange. 

Not with the stillness, and not with the stream, 

Are such content : they feed upon a Dream, 

And waking from it hunger ceaselessly ; 

Their heaven a desire, eternity 

Of vain desire." 

The list of poets that, by virtue of birth or long 
residence, may be claimed by Chicago is not a 
lengthy one, but it at least claims respectful consid- 
eration. It includes the names of B. F. Taylor and 
H. N. Powers, of Mr. Block, Mr. Horton, Mr. 
Field, and Mr. McGaffey, of Miss Harriet Monroe, 
Miss Amanda Jones, and Miss Blanche Fearing. 
To this list the name of Mr. Harry B. Smith must 
now be added, and his privately-printed collection 
of " Lyrics and Sonnets " takes a high place among 
the works of his fellow-singers. The first impres- 
sion made by this volume is of unusual range. The 
serious tone is dominant so much so that it would 
seem to preclude exercises in lighter vein yet when 
we near the end of the collection we come upon 
some vers de societe and a group of semi-humorous 
songs of a bibliophile. Perhaps the best of these 
" bookish ballads " is the " Editio Princeps," of 
which one stanza may be given. 

" The contents of this work are found 

In new editions lately dated, 
Uncut, gilt tops, good type, well bound, 

And admirably illustrated. 
But connoisseurs give these no heed ; 

To own such things they 've no ambition ; 
For though they 're good enough to read, 

They are not like a first edition." 

We must find room, also, before turning to Mr. 
Smith's more thoughtful verse, for one of the stanzas 
addressed " To My Old Pipe (if I had one)." 

" Old pipe, 't is true thou hast seen better days, 

Thou 'rt shabby and much worn ; 
Thou art malodorous. My lady says 

Thou art not to be borne. 
And yet 't is true that thou hast served me well 

Despite thy gruesome mien. 
No one, save I, thy master, e'er can tell 

How faithful thou hast been. 
(One little thing this sentiment debars 

I only smoke cigars.) " 

The author, when serious, is very serious indeed, 
often falling into a vein of religious sentiment that 
recalls the accent of Clough. That poet might easily 
have penned the following quatrain : 

" 'Twas Doubt that solved the riddles of the past, 
Slew Error's faiths, red-handed and uncouth. 
This will perfect the souls of men at last : 
Men must be doubters ere they see the truth." 

The note is still graver in such a poem as " The 
Fortunate Ones " : 



" Are not the dead God's favorites after all ? 

Is death the goal ? At least they are at rest 

Whom the great mother lulls upon her breast 
To sleep in silence. Not for them the brawl 

And tumult that are life's when life is best ; 

For where is living one, however blest, 
Into whose chalice bitter drops ne'er fall ? 
If the sad echo of an anguished cry 

That ever haunts the minds that darkly grope 

Speaks truth, if man clings to a shadowy hope, 
His Maker's likeness only born to die, 

Still are the dead God's favorites, mocked no more 

By a poor faith we cling to and adore 
Like helpless slaves of chance. At rest they lie." 

Among Mr. Smith's sonnets, the most noteworthy are 
the group upon Egyptian themes and the "Shake- 
speare." The latter has already done duty as a pre- 
face to the author's comedy of the player-poet, and 
we reproduce it here as an example of his best work. 

" soul of mine, thou farest in strange ways 
On thy mind- journey ; meadows sunlit bright 
Thou traversest where variant flowers delight 

And lure aside ; in grey mysterious haze 

Thou wand'rest phantom-led thro' many a maze ; 
Thou bravest rivers rolling with swift might, 
Lingerest on little hills of graceful height ; 

In stately woods thou dreamest happy days, 

Until a lonely mountain-top is won, 
Font of the streams and mother of the vales, 

Whose verdant slope all Elfland plays upon, 
On whose fair brow Truth's star faints not nor pales, 

Whence in the noontide eagles seek the sun, 
Where in the moonlight sob the nightingales." 

The sestet of this sonnet, while not absolutely fault- 
less, is deserving of very high praise. 

" A Lover's Diary " is a sequence of over a hun- 
dred sonnets, recording the various modulations of 
the lover's mood. Such a work naturally challenges 
comparison with " The House of Life " and " Son- 
nets from the Portuguese," and these works have 
but to be named to make it clear how far Mr. 
Parker has fallen short from such achievement as 
they denote. In spite of the true and tender sen- 
timent that runs like a golden thread through the 
fabric of his weaving, and in spite of the happy 
phrases and exquisite single verses that occasionally 
reward the reader, the general level of this series 
of poems is bardly above the commonplace. In this 
case, as in so many others, facility seems to have 
been the successful foe of that concentration of feel- 
ing demanded by the sonnet form. We quote one 
of the best of the pieces : 

" It is enough that in this burdened time 

The soul sees all its purposes aright. 

The rest what does it matter ? Soon the night 
Will come to whelm us, then the morning chime. 
What does it matter, if but in the way 

One hand clasps ours, one heart believes us true ; 

One understands the work we try to do, 
And strives through Love to teach us what to say ? 
Between me and the chilly outer air 

Which blows in from the world, there standeth one 

Who draws Love's curtains closely everywhere, 
As God folds down the banners of the sun. 

Warm is the place about me, and above 

Where was the raven, I behold the dove." 

We have called these poems sonnets, although they 
depart (as the above example shows) from the or-

thodox form. But as long as Shakespeare's sonnets 
go by that name, there will be warrant for the lib- 
erty we have taken. 

Mr. McCulloch's " The Quest of Heracles, and 
Other Poems," includes classical idyls, sonnets, and 
a few miscellaneous pieces. The rhymed couplet 
and the terza rima are the forms chiefly favored in 
the longer poems, and are used with graceful pre- 
cision, although hardly with display of poetic en- 
ergy. The following sonnet is a fair sample of this 
writer's work : 

" Fain would I journey from these barren lands 
Where I was born, unto the magic isles 
Of tropic seas, where Winter kindlier smiles 
Than doth the Summer of our northern strands. 
And I would wander on the golden sands 
Of tropic rivers, reaching miles on miles 
Thro' orchid-bowers, where the sun beguiles 
Our hearts with scattered gifts from lavish hands. 
Then Homer to the Old World carries me 
In hollow ships across the crested main ; 
And Chaucer shows each April-haunted lane 
Of England. Spenser gives enchanted sea, 
His summer woods, and purple pageantry, 
While Dante guides me through the world of pain." 

" When Hearts Are Trumps " is a collection of 
trifles, by turn sentimental and jocose. They are 
lamentably lacking in finish, and not always in good 

taste. 

" Why was it always my fate to endure ? " 

will not do for the closing verse of a sonnet, and 
" She 's accustomed to sitting on rocks in the glen ; 
She is also accustomed to sitting on men," 

will not do for the closing couplet of any kind of 
a jingle that is expected to be taken seriously. We 
are not sure that " When You Are Rejected " will 
do, either ; but we leave that question for our read- 
ers to decide. 

"Don't say, 
' Good day,' 

Then grab the door and slam it. 
Be quite 
Polite : 
Go out, and then say, ' it ! ' " 

The neatest thing we have found in the volume is 
" A Drop Too Much ": 

" I praised her hair, I praised her lips, 

She looked up with surprise ; 
I bowed to kiss her finger-tips, 
And then she dropped her eyes. 

" I said love ruled the world, that 1 
Adored her ; called her ' Nan.' 
She merely looked a little shy, 
And then she dropped her fan. 

" I took the hint, and at her feet 
I knelt yes, quite absurd ; 
But oh, my fond heart wildly beat 
To hear her drop a word. 

" I told her all : my talents few, 

My direful lack of pelf. 
(We all have erred. ) She said ' Ahem,' 
And then dropped me myself." 

A word of praise should be given to the dainty 
dress given by the publishers to this and the two 
preceding volumes.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Amid the multitude of books about 
A favorite book Venice, Life on the Lagoons," by 

about Venice. ' . ' 

Mr. Horatio r . Brown, well deserves 
the new and fuller edition just given it by Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. It represents minute investiga- 
tion and a well-nigh complete acquaintance with the 
history and customs of that city of many vicissitudes. 
Every fact is verified by painstaking research, in 
museum and library, from architect and gondolier. 
Here is no mere " afterglow " of European travel, 
but all that long residence and daily familiarity 
with picturesque scenes can give to the scholar. 
The author's faults are all on the side of diffuseness 
and breadth. We feel that with a threefold point 
of view the historical, the archaeological, and the 
artistic he is wittingly attempting the work of a 
Lanciani, a Symonds, and a Howells or Hopkinson 
Smith, all in one volume. We are even slightly an- 
noyed to find so able and conscientious a writer go- 
ing so widely afield. While he nobly proves his 
own versatility, he leaves the reader uncertain as to 
his real object. The title, " Life on the Lagoons," 
is itself misleading. One recalls, at so poetic a title, 
the roseate hues and warmth of the " pink " city, 
and scarcely forgives the writer for the matter-of- 
fact and prosaic method of treatment apparent in 
the opening chapters especially. The two points 
open to criticism are alike due to the book's com- 
prehensiveness. It is scarcely to be expected that 
a couple of dozen topics, ranging from banks and 
ferros to villottes, should be woven together into a 
consistent whole. And if such a collection of odd 
sketches is necessarily fragmentary, it is likely also 
to be deficient in that indefinable and peculiarly 
Venetian quality, atmosphere. The first paper 
we will not say chapter, the sketches are so evi- 
dently written with no aim at continuity is a pre- 
cise condensation of all Venetian history, which the 
author " trusts may prove useful " to visitors. The 
papers following, " The Gondola," " The Traghetti," 
" A Gondolier's Bank," " Sails and Sail-making," 
reveal an almost technical accuracy, and from the 
very novelty of their separate treatment are inter- 
esting as well as " useful." Perhaps the nearest 
approach to color is in the pages descriptive of All 
Souls' Day and popular superstitions. Information, 
pressed down and running over, is occasionally en- 
livened by a gleam of quaint humor ; as when the 
author drolly says, " Dreams are so important in 
the conduct of life, and it is so dangerous to lose one, 
that this belief may in part account for the univer- 
sal custom of sleeping with the outer shutters closed." 
The illustrations of the book are either too few or 
too many, according as it is viewed as a descriptive 
sketch-book or a collection of information. In the 
latter case, they do not illustrate as well as the dia- 
grams, though it would doubtless be considered a 
manifest absurdity to print a book about Venice, 
however learned or scholarly, without pictures of a 
gondola, San Giorgio, and the bathers at Lido.

West Irish 
Folk-Tales. 



The two earlier volumes of " The 
Camden Library " (Elliot Stock, Lon- 
don) dealt with the Antiquities and 
Curiosities of the Exchequer, and the Sculptured 
Signs of London. The third number contains a very 
good collection of "West Irish Folk-Tales," by Will- 
iam Larminie. The field of Irish folk-lore is but 
little worked, and a large part of the work already 
done lacks definiteness and scientific value. Mr. 
Larminie's work appears to be accurate and pains- 
taking. His stories at times approach those of Ger- 
many, at other times those of the Highland Scotch. 
He believes that they show influence of two or more 
ethnic streams presenting a curious mixture of 
the domesticity of the Teutonic and the wildness of 
the Gaelic races. This peculiarly wild character 
emotional, variable, explosive, is shown repeatedly 
in the stories. Very conspicuous in the style is that 
remarkable involution where subordinate and sub- 
subordinate matter is introduced into the narrative 
until one is almost in despair of ever again finding 
the "thread of the story." Certain set passages re- 
cur in story after story, and certain stock incidents 
appear again and again. Thus, " she smothered 
him with kisses and drowned him with tears : she 
dried him with the finest cloths and with silk," is 
a favorite passage. These " runs " are frequently 
in mysterious language, incomprehensible now and 
perhaps always meaningless. Besides comparisons 
pointed out by the author, others might be men- 
tioned. Thus, the incident of the hunter who kills 
a raven, whose red blood staining the white snow 
leads him to vow that he will never marry a woman 
" whose head was not as black as the bird's wing, 
and her skin as white as the snow and her cheeks 
as red as the blood," recurs in American Indian 
folk-lore. The decision of the girl-wife as to whether 
a foal belongs to the mare or the horse suggests that 
in Chatelain's Angola Tale of " The Lawsuit of Leop- 
ard and Antelope." Mr. Larminie urges the im- 
portance of writing down folk-lore in the Gaelic 
language, and gives specimens in Gaelic phonetically 
spelt. 

The new volume by Mr. Ruskin, en- 
titled " Verona and Other Lectures," 
is published in this country by Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. In order to secure copyright 
under the American law, the type has been reset ; 
and we mention this fact mainly for the purpose of 
calling attention to the remarkable way in which 
the mechanical features of Mr. Ruskin's own edi- 
tions have been imitated. Typography, paper, and 
binding all follow so closely the books issuing from 
Mr. George Allen's establishment that one has to 
look twice before realizing that he has to do with 
an American imitation. As long as the objection- 
able clause of our copyright law remains, we shall 
have to put up with imitations ; and thanks are due 
to any publisher who will copy so well a good En- 
glish edition. The difference between a good copy 
and a poor one is well illustrated by a comparison 



A new volume 
of Essays by 
Mr, Ruskin. 



of this volume with the volumes in which Professor 
Huxley's " Collected Essays " are now issuing from 
the American press. The contents of this volume 
(which Mr. Collingwood edits) are five lectures 
dating from 1870 to 1885. The first and most gen- 
erally interesting is a talk about " Verona and Its 
Rivers." It touches not only upon the history and 
art of the beautiful city of the Adige, but also upon 
the importance of properly controlling the rivers 
of Italy, in avoidance of the havoc wrought by 
freshets and for increase of the fruitfulness of the 
soil. Of the other lectures, one is a sort of supple- 
ment to " Aratra Pentelici," and two were intended 
for a new volume of "Our Fathers Have Told Us." 
The editor explains just how these latter two were 
to fit into the scheme of the work as originally 
planned. The remaining lecture, " The Story of 
Arachne," is a brief address to students at Wool- 
wich, made in 1870. If we are to have an extract, 
it may as well come from this lecture, and the clos- 
ing passage is now not without a certain timeliness. 
"I have some workmen myself, and have had, for 
many years, under me. Heaven knows I am not 
independent of them ; and I do not think they either 
are, or wish to be, independent of me. We depend 
heartily, and always, they upon my word, and 
upon my desire for their welfare ; I, upon their 
work, and their pride in doing it well, and, I think, 
also, their desire tc do it well for me. Believe me, 
my friends, there is no such thing as independence 
till we die. In the grave we shall be independent 
to purpose, not till then. While we live, the de- 
fence and prosperity of our country depends less 
even on hearts of oak than on hearts of flesh ; on 
the patience which seeks improvement with hope 
but not with haste ; on the science which discerns 
what is lovely in character and honorable in act ; 
and on the Fine Art and tact of happy submission 
to the guidance of good men, and the laws of na- 
ture, and of heaven." 

Lights and Mr - J- B - Yeate's "A Celtic Twi- 

shadows of a light " (Macmillan) is a pretty book 

Celtic Twilight. O f gome two hundred pages, contain- 
ing twenty brief tales and sketches written mostly 
for "The National Observer." Most of the stories 
were told Mr. Yeats by one Paddy Flynn, a " little 
bright-eyed old man who lived in a leaky and one- 
roomed cabin in the village of Ballisadore " the 
most " gentle," that is the most faery, place in 
County Sligo. So full was Paddy's head of the lore 
of dhouls and fairies, water-horses, kelpies, house- 
ghosts, and the like local hobgoblins, that he was 
more than suspected of being a little uncanny him- 
self. It was whispered about that he had " strange 
sights to keep him cheerful or to make him sad "; 
and he owned that he had once seen the banshee 
" down there," as he said, " by the water, batting 
the river with its hands." That Paddy's vision on 
this occasion was artificially quickened seems prob- 
able. Like many of the " finest pisanthry in the 
world," he had a liking for potheen ; and, indeed,

his death was brought about by the gift of a large 
bottle of it. The sight of so much liquor, says the 
author quaintly, " filled him with a great enthusiasm, 
and he lived upon it for some days, and then died." 
Death kindly closed his eyes to the fact when the 
potheen was nearly exhausted. Mr. Yeats filled his 
note-book with Paddy's tales and sayings, and re- 
produces them with good effect in the present vol- 
ume. Besides the folk-lore, there are some amus- 
ing character sketches notably " The Last Glee- 
man," being the account of one Michael Moran, a 
blind beggar and ballad-singer, and the admitted 
rector of his class in Dublin. " He was not much 
to look at, with his coarse frieze coat with its cape 
and scalloped edge, his old corduroy trousers and 
great brogues, and his stout stick made fast to his 
wrist by a thong of leather ; and he would have 
been a woeful shock to the gleeman Maclonglinne 
could that friend of kings have beheld him in pro- 
phetic vision from the pillar stone at Cork." Yet 
Michael was a true gleeman, being poet, jester, and 
newsman of the people. In the morning his wife or 
a neighbor would read the newspaper to him until 
interrupted with, '' That'll do I have me medita- 
tions " ; and he would sally forth duly inspired for 
the day's store of jest and rhyme. We subjoin a 
specimen of his lighter improvisation: 

" In Egypt's land contagious to the Nile, 

King Pharaoh's daughter went to bathe in style. 

She tuk her dip, then walked unto the land ; 

To dry her royal pelt she ran along the strand. 

A bulrush tripped her, whereupon she saw 

A smiling babby in a wad o' straw. 

She tuk it up, and said, with accents mild, 
' Tare-an'-agers, girls, which av yez owns the child ? ' " 

The book is fresh and amusing, and it is beautifully 
made and printed. 



The historian - Alexander Robertson's Life 

of the Council of Fra Paolo Sarpi, the heroic and 
of Trent. learned Venetian friar (1552-1623), 

is interesting and timely. The long-decreed monu- 
ment to Fra Paolo has recently been unveiled in 
Venice, and his body, after two centuries of con- 
cealment, has found an honored resting-place in the 
church of the Campo Santo on the island of San 
Michele. There are many tributes from eminent 
pens to the worth and learning of Fra Paolo. Gib- 
bon calls him " the incomparable historian of the 
Council of Trent," and Galileo owned him " My 
father and my master." As a metaphysician, says 
Macaulay, " he anticipated Locke "; and, he adds, 
"what he did, he did better than anybody." In 
Walton's " Life of Sanderson " we find the Bishop 
quoted as lamenting a lost opportunity of seeing 
" one of the late miracles of general learning, pru- 
dence, and modesty, Sir Henry Wotton's dear friend 
Padre Paolo ... a man whose fame must never 
die till virtue and learning shall become so useless 
as not to be regarded." Dr. Robertson's Life of 
Fra Paola Sarpi (published by Thomas Whittaker ) 
is compact and readable, and it contains portraits 
and a fac-simile of a letter of Fra Paolo's.

also a surprise in the shape of two plates instead of 
the one that has been the rule in this series, Colley

and sentences as were found convenient for use.

British Empire. address delivered last year at the 
Imperial Institute, Mr. W. E. H. Lecky briefly dis- 
cusses the vexed question of the utility to England 
of her dependencies. The issue is clearly presented, 
and the broader reasons pro and con are fairly stated. 
Mr. Lecky is plainly no friend to the plan of gradu- 
ally paring down British domain to the sweet simpli- 
city of two islands ; and he combats the views of 
Cobden and Mill and the Manchester School gener- 
ally with his usual force. The little book may be read 
through at a sitting, and it will repay the reading. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Two recent classical texts are a revised edition (Ginn) 
of Professors Goodwin and White's " Anabasis " (the 
first four books), and Cicero's " Laelius," edited by Mr. 
E. S. Shuckburgh, and revised for American use by Mr. 
Henry Clark Johnson (Macmillan). Among modern lan- 
guage texts we have " A Preparatory German Reader " 
(Ginn), by Mr. C. L. Van Daell; George Sand's "La 
Petite Fadette " (Heath), edited by Mr. F. Aston- 
Binns; and the whole of Schiller's Wallenstein " (Holt) 
in a very attractive volume edited by Professor W. H. 
Carruth. The notes, illustrations, and other apparatus 
of this latter text indicate careful and judicious selec- 
tion from the vast amount of material upon which an 
editor of " Wallenstein " must draw. 

We note the receipt of two excellent grammar-school 
text-books. Mr. G. A. Wentworth's " The First Steps 
in Algebra " (Ginn) is opportune at a time when it really 
looks as though the much-needed educational reform of 
the lower grades were impending. One of the first 
steps of that reform will be to put elementary algebra 
and geometry into the seventh and eighth grades, and 
Mr. Wentworth's book is just the sort of help that is 
needed. Mr. John Fiske's "The War of Independ- 
ence" (Houghton) appears in the "Riverside Litera- 
ture " series, and makes the best kind of supplementary 
reading for boys and girls struggling with United States 
history. 

"From Milton to Tennyson" (Allyn & Bacon), by 
Mr. L. DuPont Syle, is a volume of selected master- 
pieces followed by an almost equal volume of notes. It 
is intended for high-school and possibly for college use. 
The selection of texts is good, and the notes are help- 
ful, although an occasional exhibition of irrational pre-

judice on the part of the writer does not conduce to con- 
fidence in his judgment. Shelley, in particular, is made 
the subject of his spleen, and Mr. Swinburne, for stat- 
ing the perfectly obvious fact that Shelley was the first 
of English lyrists, is promptly classed with humorists 
of the Hosea Bigelow type. Even innuendo is not 
wanting, as in the reference to Shelley's " religious (?) 
philosophy." 

Mr. Lauren E. Crane has edited the speeches and ad- 
dresses of Newton Booth of California (1825-1892), 
and they are now published in a handsome volume, with 
introduction, notes, and a portrait. Their author was 
Governor of California from 1871 to 1873, and after- 
wards represented that State in the United States Sen- 
ate. His political speeches are patriotic in tone, and 
discuss a great variety of local and national questions. 
Two of his lectures are entitled " Charles James Fox," 
and " Morals and Politics." Some newspaper and mag- 
azine articles are also published. The book is issued 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

Baron Nils Posse's " The Swedish System of Educa- 
tional Gymnastics " was first published four years ago, 
and has now i cached a third edition. For its present 
issue the book has been rewritten and otherwise elabor- 
ated, besides being provided with a new and formidable 
title, " The Special Kinesiology of Educational Gym- 
nastics" (Lee & Shepard). The general aim of this 
system is to secure a harmonious and symmetrical de- 
velopment of the entire body. The text is very fully 
illustrated, and the book is thus adapted for the work 
of self-instruction. 

Mr. A. E. Dolbear's book on "Matter, Ether, and 
Motion " (Lee & Shepard) has reached a second edi- 
tion, and the author has taken occasion, not only to re- 
vise the original text, but to add some new chapters. 
As a popular exposition of fundamental physical prin- 
ciples, the work will do well enough, but confidence in 
the author's judgment is a little shaken by the way in 
which he toys with the vagaries of spiritualism and 
telepathy, and suggests that the ingenious speculations 
of the non-Euclidean geometers may be subject to ex- 
perimental confirmation. 

Mr. Samuel Harden Church's "Oliver Cromwell" 
(Putnam) is an octavo of more than five hundred pages. 
The author claims to have taken a middle course be- 
tween Hume's severe treatment of the subject and Car- 
lyle's somewhat extravagant hero-worship. He has de- 
voted six years to the work, and has collected a large 
library of Cromwellian literature. " I have written my 
book not as a biographical sketch," he says, " but as a 
narrative or study which aims to present, with sufficient 
detail, the formation of the commonwealth and its 
strange paradox of the permanent establishment of civil 
and religious liberty through a Dictator who respected 
no law, in working out England's salvation, but the law 
of necessity; and this for a nation whose fortunes are 
happily and inseparably linked with the forms of pop- 
ular monarchy." The work is thoughtful and pains- 
taking, readable rather than brilliant. 

Mr. Isaac Meyer is the author of a monograph on 
"Scarabs" (New York: E. W. Dayton), or to repro- 
duce in full the sub-title of the work, " the history, man- 
ufacture, and religious symbolism of the Scarabseus in 
ancient Egypt, Phoanicia, Sardinia, Etruria, etc.: also, 
remarks on the learning, philosophy, arts, ethics, psy- 
chology, ideas as to the immortality of the soul, etc., of the 
ancient Egyptians, Phcenicians," etc. Mr. Meyer's work 



seems to be a very thorough and scholarly study of the 
subject. His remarks upon the modern forgeries of 
scarabs are particularly interesting, as well as profitable 
to the would-be amateur Egyptologist. 

In " The Sacred City of the Ethiopians " (Longmans), 
Mr. Theodore Bent records the results of an expedition 
into Abyssinia undertaken last year, and extending over 
a period of four months. Mrs. Bent accompanied and 
acted as photographer for the expedition, which proved 
highly fruitful of archaeological results. The objective 
point of the expedition was Aksum, the ancient capital 
of Ethiopia. Mr. Bent predicts that the work of inves- 
tigation thus begun will eventually " place before our 
view a vast, powerful, and commercial empire an em- 
pire which extended its discoveries to parts of the world 
which are only now being rediscovered, and possessing 
a commerce which supplied the ancient world with its 
most valued luxuries." The book is of great interest. 

The booklet on " English in the Secondary Schools," 
mentioned in our last number, is a quasi-official publi- 
cation of the University of California. It is interest- 
ing both for the practical and wholesome character of 
the suggestions made by Professors Gayley and Brad- 
ley, its authors, and because it illustrates a new method 
of bringing the university influence to bear upon the 
lower schools. Other departments of the University 
are about to follow the lead thus taken, and issue simi- 
lar special monographs. The English pamphlet may 
be had from the Recorder of the Faculties at Berkeley. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, July S6, 1894. 

The chief event of the month in the literary world is 
of course the publication in the " Century Magazine " 
of the first instalment of the Poe-Griswold correspond- 
ence. The existence of these papers has been known 
to a number of people for many years, but all efforts to 
persuade the late Dr. George H. Moore, their custodian, 
to allow them to be inspected, failed utterly. It was 
understood that Dr. Moore, who was Griswold's literary 
executor, intended to publish selections from them him- 
self, but if this were his intention, it was never fulfilled. 
Dr. Moore having died, Griswold's son, Mr. William 
M. Griswold, of Cambridge, Mass., was appointed ad- 
ministrator of his father's estate, and in this way was 
able to recover the papers. Nearly everybody who has 
written about Poe since Griswold's death has applied in 
vain to Dr. Moore for their use. The instalment in 
the August number of the " Century " comprises a num- 
ber of Poe's own letters, and letters to him from John 
P. Kennedy, T. W. White, proprietor of the " Southern 
Literary Messenger," Nathaniel Beverly Tucker, au- 
thor of " The Partisan Leader," J. K. Paulding, Charles 
Anthon, and James E. Heath. 

The correspondence chiefly relates to the period of 
Poe's connection with the " Messenger." An interest- 
ing feature is the picture given of publishing conditions 
in New York at that time. A New York firm having 
declined a volume of Poe's " Messenger " tales in 1836, 
Paulding, who acted as his agent, was constrained to 
write him that " it would afford me much pleasure to 
have proposed the publication of your book to some 
one [other] respectable Bookseller of this city. But 
the truth is, there is only one other who publishes any- 
thing but School Books, religious works, and the like,

and with him I am not on terms that would make it 
agreeable to me to make any proposition of this nature, 
either in my own behalf or that of another." I presume 
the other firm referred to was that of Messrs. Wiley & 
Putnam. The Poe correspondence is illustrated with 
selected drawings by Mr. Sterner, made for the forth- 
coming complete edition of Poe's works to be published 
by Messrs. Stone & Kimball. 

Another notable feature of the August " Century " 
is an article on " Conversation in France " by Mme. 
Blanc Bentzon. In the September number there will 
be an interesting study of " School Excursions in Ger- 
many," by Dr. J. M. Rice, author of several important 
studies of schools in American cities, recently published 
in the " Forum." Dr. Rice visited Germany for the 
purpose of taking part in a typical excursion which is 
here described. It consisted of a tour of two weeks, 
on foot or by rail, through the country of the Reforma- 
tion, which had been the particular study of this party 
of school children for the preceding term. Students of 
pedagogy accompany these excursions and observe their 
effect upon the children. The thorough identification 
of localities is indicated by the fact that Luther's hymn 
was sung by them in the room in which it was written. 

A new novel by " Maarteu Maartens " will be printed 
serially in " Harper's Bazar " during the first part of 
1895. The author, Mr. J. M. W. van der Poorten 
Schwarz, has removed his residence from " Kasteel 
Lunenburgh," Neerlangbrock, to the Chateau de Zuy- 
lestein, near Leersum, also in Holland. In a recent let- 
ter to an American friend, he expressed himself as much 
gratified by the tender of honorary membership in the 
Authors Club of New York lately made to him. He 
considered it " a delicate and kindly compliment " which 
gave him much encouragement. Mr. van der Poorten 
Schwarz is just thirty-five years old, and not thirty- 
eight, as stated in various biographical articles. 

Mr. James Ford Rhodes is spending the summer at 
Rye Beach, N. H., busily engaged on the third volume 
of his " History of the United States, from the Com- 
promise of 1850," which the Messrs. Harper now expect 
to publish during the coming season. 

" George Mandeville's Husband," a novel just about 
to be published by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co., is de- 
cidedly reactionary in character in so far as it touches 
upon the woman question, and indeed it touches upon 
little else. Its author apparently has become disgusted 
with advanced views on this subject. The downtrodden 
husband of a " woman of mind " expresses himself in 
advice to their daughter as follows : 

" 'Never breakfast in bed, Rosina, unless you're actually 
ill,' he would often say ; ' it 's the first step on the downward 
path.' 

" ' No, father.' 

" ' Of course your mother is an exceptional woman. She 
may do things that wouldn't look well in an ordinary mor- 
tal.' 

" ' Yes, father.' 

" ' And never wear a dressing-gown out of your own room. 
Put on decent clothes as soon as you step out of your bath.' 

'"Yes, father.'" 

The author is a well-known English writer who has as- 
sumed a pseudonym. 

Preparations for holiday books go on apace. Messrs. 
Lovell, Coryell, & Co. will issue this fall a handsome 
edition of " The Last Days of Pompeii " with views of 
the excavations, landscapes, and reproductions of fa- 
mous paintings. The same firm will also publish an 
edition de luxe of Mrs. Oliphant's " Victorian Age of 



English Literature," with portraits of the principal 
writers considered. Mrs. Oliphant's articles now ap- 
pearing in the " Century Magazine," which deal with 
" The Reign of Queen Anne," will be published as a 
holiday book with this title. The publishers have ex- 
erted themselves to insure a beautiful piece of book- 
making. The work in the wood engravings is not likely 
to be exceeded this year, if at all, as it seems as nearly 
perfect as possible. ARTHUR STEDMAN.

sor Solerti is also preparing a new and critical edition

The Toronto " Week " has the following screed from 
an enraged correspondent : " Sir Can you or any of 
your numerous readers inform me how it is that Amer- 
ican daily and weekly papers are allowed to be carried 
and called in our streets by newsboys ? It is most of- 
fensive to my ideas of the fitness of things to have the 
low-class papers of Detroit, Buffalo, and Chicago flouted 
in the streets of Toronto. It is bad enough to have our 
second-class booksellers' shops slopping over with the 
trash that proceeds from the low American daily and 
weekly press, without having it stuck under our noses 
at every corner of the street." 

The " Athenjeum " furnishes the following note: 
" That ' Hamlet ' has been more variously treated and 
ill treated than any other Shakespearean play we all 
know, but it will be news to our readers that the Ham- 
let-Problem as the Germans call it, is shortly to figure 
in the courts of law. The bone of contention is the pri- 
ority of a certain ingenious analysis of Hamlet's char- 
acter. Herr H. Tiirck, a well-known Shakespearean 
scholar, maintains that he propounded it first, whilst 
Professor Kuno Fischer claims the priority of its excog- 
itation. In consequence of this literary squabble, Herr 
Tiirck has placed the ' Hamlet-Problem ' in the hands 
of a lawyer. It will occupy the law courts at Munich, 
Professor Kuno Fischer's remarks having appeared in a 
Bavarian paper."

'Curtis Lectureship,' or some similar designation, the 
lectures delivered in such course to be annually pub- 
lished for distribution. The details of these two fea- 
tures of the memorial will be determined and announced 
by the committee hereafter. The committee is now 
ready to receive subscriptions to the fund required, 
which subscriptions should be addressed to Mr. William 
L. Trenholm, treasurer, No. 160 Broadway, New York." 

WHY FICTION ALONE AS SERIALS ? 

Mr. Walter Besant, in a recent number of " The Au- 
thor," raises an interesting question as to why matter 
for serial publication in periodicals should be limited to 
fiction, and suggests that " editors do not as yet recog- 
nize the fact that an extremely attractive serial may be 
made of a subject not belonging to fiction at all. For 
instance, many volumes of poetry are run through va- 
rious magazines first. I would run them through one 
magazine only. Mr. Austin Dobson's new volume of 
verse will be commenced in the January number of the 
" New Year " ; it will run through twelve months and will 
be published in volume form in November.' Would not 



such an announcement be attractive ? Or this: 'Pro- 
fessor Dowden's new work on Shakespeare is nearly 
completed. It consists of twelve chapters, and is to run 
through twelve numbers of the " Cheapside " magazine; 
it will then be published in the autumn books of Messrs. 
Bungay.' Does anyone pretend that the comparatively 
wide circulation of the magazine would not assist the 
author in disseminating his teaching and the publisher 
in afterwards distributing the book ? " 

TO A SLEEPER AT ROME. 

(For the unveiling, by Edmund Grosse, of the American memorial bust 
to the poet Keats in Hampstead Parish Church, July 16, 1894.) 

Thy gardens bright with limbs of gods at play 
Those bowers whose flowers are fruits, Hesperian sweets 
That light with heaven the soul of him who eats, 

And lend his veins Olympian blood of day 

Were only lent, and, since thou couldst not stay, 
Better to die than wake in sorrow, Keats, 
Where even the Siren's song no longer cheats 

Where Love's long " Street of Tombs " still lengthens grey. 

Better to nestle there in arms of Flora, 
Ere Youth, the king of Earth and Beauty's heir, 

Drinking such breath in meadows of Aurora 
As bards of morning drank, ./Egean air, 

Woke in Eld's lonely caverns of Ellora, 
Carven with visions dead and sights that were ! 

Theodore Watts, in The Athenceum. 



A BALLADE OF BOOKS WELL BOUND. 

From tattered volumes, old and sere, 

Some friends I have evolve delight ; 
The shabbiest the most prized appear 

By antiquarians erudite. 

These think me a Philistine wight 
For choosing bindings of the best ; 

Yet to my taste I have a right, 
I like to see my friends well drest. 

I love the antique and the queer, 

The curious, quaint, and recondite ; 
I own the spell of Elzevir, 

The charm of pages Aldine bight ; 

Yet why should age and dirt invite ? 
Their beauty is not manifest ; 

Let modern art put them to flight, 
I like to see my friends well drest. 

Eve and Le Gascon are too dear ; 

I cannot have them would I might ! 
But Bedford, Michel, and Riviere 

Have wrought me leathern marvels bright. 

The armor of the bravest knight 
Should shine the brightest on his breast. 

No moth, no rust, my books shall blight, 
I like to see my friends well drest. 

ENVOY. 

Friend, wouldst thou fain in sorry plight 
Behold a loved and honored guest ? 

In goodly garb I 'd have him dight, 
I like to see my friends well drest. 

From " Bookish Ballads" by Harry B. Smith. 



PROTECTION OF AUTHORS FROM GARBLED REPRINTS. 

Judge Dallas, of the United States Circuit Court, sit- 
ting in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, recently 
made a decision of much importance to authors. It was 
occasioned by a garbled and incomplete report of Pro- 
fessor Drummond's lecture on " The Ascent of Man," 
published in Philadelphia. The question involved was 
not copyright, but the right of an English author to pro- 
tection against reprints that misrepresent the character 
of his works. We print the significant parts of Judge 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



Dallas's decision: " It appears that the defendant has 
published, and to a considerable extent has sold, a book 
purporting to contain certain Lectures delivered by the 
plaintiff, which in fact does not present those Lectures 
correctly, but with additions and omissions which essen- 
tially alter the productions of the author. This is sought 
to be justified by the averment that the lectures in ques- 
tion had not been copyrighted, and that their author 
had dedicated them to the public. 

" The subject of copyright is not directly involved. 
The complainant does not base his claim to relief upon 
the statute, but upon his right, quite distinct from any 
conferred by copyright, to protection against having any 
literary matter published as his work which is not ac- 
tually his creation, and, incidentally, to prevent fraud 
upon purchasers. That such right exists is too well set- 
tled, upou reason and authority, to require demonstra- 
tion, and, although it is equally well established that an 
author may, by dedication of any product of his pen to 
the public, irrevocably abandon his title, yet in this case 
the fact relied on by the defendant to support his asser- 
tion of dedication wholly fails to vindicate the publica- 
tion complained of. 

" The defendant's book is founded on the matter which 
has appeared in the ' British Weekly,' and if that mat- 
ter had been literally copied, and so as not to misrep- 
resent its character and extent, the plaintiff would be 
without remedy; but the fatal weakness in the defend- 
ant's position is, that, under color of editing the author's 
work, he has represented a part of it as the whole, and 
even as to the portion published has materially departed 
from the reports which he sets up in justification."

"It is one of those vividly picturesque reproductions of strange, boldly-marked, exceptional aspects of life in the sketching and coloring of

Mr. Gale is best known in America as the author of " Orchard Songs," 
and " A Country Muse." His prose, however, is much thought of in 
England, and the first edition of "A June Romance," although issued 
in 1892, is now very scarce and valuable. In this new form it ought to

A collection of some of Mr. Garland's essays, which attracted so 
much attention on their appearance in magazine form. They are on va- 
rious topics: "New Fields of Art," "The Future of Fiction," "The 
Drift of the Drama," "The Influence of Ibsen," "Impressionism in 
Painting," "Local Color in Fiction," "Literary Centers and Literary 
Masters," and so forth. Taken as a whole, the book is a vigorous plea 
for the recognition of youth, and a protest against the despotism of 
tradition.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE. 

ii. 

Resuming the survey begun in our last is- 
sue of the year's literary production upon the 
European continent, we will first turn to the 
Commendatore Bonghi's report of Italian let- 
ters. The death of Adolfo Bartoli, the liter- 
ary historian, appears to have been the most 
important event of the year. He " was largely 
instrumental in introducing a method of crit- 
icism which, in more respects than one, was 
new to Italy." He found many followers in his 



work, and the way is gradually being prepared, 
in the author's view, " for a full and elaborate 
history of Italian literature conceived upon a 
more comprehensive scale than anything that 
is yet in existence." Signer d'Annunzio's last 
novel, " II Trionfo della Morte," is the most 
important work of fiction mentioned. " The 
triumph of death in this case is due to a lover 
who ends his career by killing his mistress and 
himself." Final judgment upon the work is 
thus rendered : 

" The whole book seems to me false and exaggerated, 
and I must confess that I found the perusal of its five 
hundred pages an irksome task. Nevertheless there 
are fine passages in it, for Signer d'Annunzio possesses 
a real talent for description, and he occasionally strikes 
the note of passion with a ring of sincerity. The mor- 
ality of the book is anything but wholesome; it shows 
the influence of Zola on every page." 

Signora Serao, who is the favorite authoress 
with the novel-reading public, has published 
two volumes of tales and sketches. In poetry, 
Signor Carducci has published nothing, but 
his " evolution " has " been made the subject 
of a discreetly successful book by a young man 
named Panzini." We are further told that 
" bad poets, as usual, abound, although the 
newspapers tell a different tale. But news- 
papers, whether political or literary, as a rule 
merely reproduce in their criticisms the pub- 
lisher's advertisements, which are, of course, 
extravagantly laudatory." None of the poets 
of the year " is quite equal to a journey across 
the Alps, except perhaps Alfredo Baccelli. 
. . . His style is refined, his language well 
chosen, and his subjects interesting. His book 
is called ' Vittime e Rebelli,' and I should be 
inclined to rank it above any other contribution 
to the poetry of the year." In history, the 
writer calls for more art and less matter, com- 
plaining that we get nothing but documents 
and special researches. " In this department of 
literature the book of the year was undoubt- 
edly the collected edition of the letters of Col- 
uccio Salutati, a celebrated philologist and 
statesman of the fourteenth century, brought 
out by the historical Institute." Finally, men- 
tion is made of the newly organized Society of 
French Studies in Italy, which, by encourag- 
ing a wider acquaintance with French litera- 
ture, will make things uncomfortable for the 
too obvious plagiarist and imitator.

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



Don Juan F. Riano gives much interest to 
the story of the literary year in Spain. That 
country is fortunate in the possession of acad- 
emies that are willing " to undertake the pub- 
lication of costly works not likely to have a 
large circulation." The Academy of History, 
for example, has superintended the issue of 
several important works, and the Academia 
Espanola has published " La Filologia Castel- 
lana," by Count de la Vinaza, and the " Teatro 
Complete de Juan de la Encino," besides con- 
tinuing its monumental edition of Lope de 
Vega, and its " Antologia de Poetas Hispano- 
Americanos." Columbus and the Melilla af- 
fair have been the most " actual " subjects of 
historical writing during the year. The most 
important contribution to the former is Senor 
Castelar's " Colon," while the latter has called 
forth many books and pamphlets. A work 
upon " La Toma de Granada," by Senor Da- 
valos y Lerchundi, calls for the following in- 
teresting note : 

" Ever since the capture of Granada on the 2d of 
January, 1492, the Royal Maestranza has celebrated 
that event by meeting in the Bibarambla, and other 
squares in Granada, for the purpose of celebrating a 
mock tournament, jousting and tilting with canas. On 
the 2d of January last, which happened to be the quar- 
ter-centenary of the conquest of that city as well as that 
of the discovery of the New World, the master riders 
of Granada decided that, instead of holding the anti- 
quated tournament, a prize should be offered to the best 
composition in prose or verse recording the taking of 
Granada. This the above-mentioned writer has accom- 
plished in a creditable manner, at the same time giving 
the names and particulars of the titled nobility, prelates, 
and knights who appended their signatures to the ca- 
pitulation." 

Among works of a belletristic character, men- 
tion is made of " Margaritas," a volume of 
poems by Senor Li meres ; " Torquemada en 
la Cruz," a novel by Senor Perez Galdos ; and 
" Origin del Pensamiento " and " El Maes- 
trante," novels by Senor Palacio Valdes. Two 
important dramas, the "Mariana" of Senor 
Echegaray and the " Dolores " of Senor Felin 
y Codina, have been performed during the year, 
and have disputed for the dramatic prize of a 
thousand dollars. 

" At last the Academy by a majority of votes de- 
cided in favour of Echegaray, a decision which the dis- 
appointed party resented, a somewhat fierce polemic in 
the newspapers of Madrid being the consequence." 

The author concludes with these remarks upon 
the general literary situation : 

" The demand for books is great and constant, and 
authors and publishers are making efforts to supply it, 
no matter how: the consequence is that all is in con- 
fusion, and anarchy prevails in every branch of litera- 
ture, some few still holding tenaciously to the old school 



with slight modifications, whilst others (and they are 
unluckily the greater number) follow no school and 
recognize no rule whatever. No wonder then if Zola's 
novels and Count Tolstoy's lucubrations are the fashion 
of the day." 

Professor S. O. Lambros writes of literary 
Greece, and tells as long a story as was to be 
expected of so small a country. He begins 
with a summary of " Mycena3 and the Mycen- 
aean Culture," by Christos Tsuntas, the most 
important publication of the year. The mem- 
oirs of Spyridon Pilikas and Alexander Rhan- 
gabe are of much historical value. Kleon 
Rhangabe, a son of the diplomatist just men- 
tioned, is the author of " Poems of Sorrow," 
the most important verse of the year. Fiction 
is represented by " Our Athens," a social novel 
by Nicolas Spandonis ; " The Prime Minister," 
a political romance by G. Vokos ; and volumes 
of tales by Constantine Passajiannis, Deme- 
trius Hatzopulos, and the late Constantine 
Krystallis. 

" Tobacco Juliet," a novel by Zsigmond 
Justh, is the best Hungarian novel of the year, 
according to Herr Leopold Katscher : 

" In this book Justh, who is at the head of the more 
distinguished Hungarian realists of our day, presents a 
picture, equally ideal and natural, of plain, simple coun- 
try life. Truth is here turned into fiction in a manner 
strongly resembling Tolstoy's, and it is not too much to 
say that the author has, by this latest work of his, 
reached the front rank of Hungarian fiction." 

A long list of other novels is given, but their 
authors are practically unknown outside of 
Hungary. The same remark may be made of 
the poets, of whom Gybzb Dolmady, with his 
patriotic songs, Erno Erodi, with his monody 
on Kossuth, and Jenb Heltai, with his Kipling- 
like lyrics, are singled out for honorable men- 
tion. The following remarks are of general 
interest : 

" Of the many lives of Kossuth which have appeared 
the best is the one written by Lajos Hentaller. Of 
course, Jdkai's jubilee (his seventieth birthday, which, 
by the way, was celebrated in the most enthusiastic 
manner throughout the country) has also called forth 
various biographical publications. The first ten vol- 
umes of the hundred-volume edition of this master's 
novels (about two thousand copies of which at 201. have 
been subscribed for) have just been issued." 

Gebauer's " Historical Grammar of the Bo- 
hemian Language " is described by Mr. V. 
Tille as " the most important [Bohemian] pub- 
lication of the past twelve months." The first 
part only has appeared, but others will soon 
follow. Mr. Tille gives most of his attention 
to belles-lettres, which 

" are from year to year becoming more subject to the 
new ideas which have for some time stirred all European 



1894.]

literature, and are symptoms of a deep intellectual rev- 
olution. Their influence is most conspicuous in the pro- 
ductions of the younger generation." 

In poetry, there are volumes by Vrchlicky, 
Machar, Dvorak, and others ; in fiction, many 
interesting things. Two novels are thus char- 
acterized : 

" V. Mristfk strives to describe in his novel ' Santa 
Lucia ' the struggle for existence and the impressions 
of a poor student in Prague. But the leading ideas 
grow misty, and the want of a skilful hand, which could 
bring order into the multitude of scenes and characters, 
is sorely felt. Much the same thing may be said with 
regard to F. A. Simacek's ' Two Loves.' Life amongst 
the superior and inferior employes on country estates 
and in sugar manufactories is minutely and ably de- 
scribed ; still the leading idea of the whole, the new at- 
tachment of an official who had been engaged for many 
years to another girl, and the conflicts of his conscience, 
is touched upon only in its outward phases, reminding 
the reader of many old similar romantic types, and 
forming merely a frame for details of life well worked 
out." 

The following bit of information is particularly 
welcome : 

" At last a few competent writers are beginning to 
bestow some pains upon literature for children. A for- 
eigner can hardly conceive with what trash Bohemian 
children nsed to be supplied by writers, male and fe- 
male, and how hopeless the search for a good chil- 
dren's book was. Only quite lately an improvement 
has been noticeable, and last year two particularly nice 
books appeared an illustrated Bohemian history by 
Dolensky, under the supervision of Professor Rezek, 
of Prague University, and ' Old Bohemian Historical 
Tales,' by Jirdsek." 

Two or three noteworthy historical works, 
one play, one book of poems, several novels, 
and a considerable quantity of Kosciuszko lit- 
erature, are the leading features of Dr. Adam 
Belcikowski's report of Polish letters. The 
poems are by A. Asnyk, "the most remarka- 
ble Polish poet of the day, at once a finished 
artist and a deep thinker." The play is K. 
Zalewski's " What Mean You by It ? " having 
" for its subject an ethical question, which the 
author answers in somewhat pessimistic fashion, 
viz., whether an honorable deed completed in 
obedience to the dictates of conscience is ap- 
preciated by the world or not." Of the works 
of fiction mentioned, five seem to be of excep- 
tional interest. " Emancipation," by B. Prus, 
deals with the " woman question." " Naphtha," 
by Maciejowski, " describes with uncommon 
energy and much spirit the life of the great 
contractors and the poor workmen in a Gali- 
cian petroleum bed." "The Two Poles," by 
E. Orzeszko, is a psychological romance of two 
young people who love one another, but who 
" separate because they perceive that the dif- 



ference between their ideas and their views of 
the world is so great that they could find no 
happiness in living together." " There Am I," 
by A. Krechowiecki, is upon the theme " that 
an artist cannot attain to intellectual ripeness 
so long as he has not through suffering and 
higher feelings reached a moral equilibrium." 
Finally, the " Mechesy " of Gawalewicz, which 
has made " a great stir," is thus described : 

" The plot turns upon the marriage of a young lady 
belonging to the nobility with the son of a banker of 
Jewish extraction. The bride finds herself so strange 
and uncomfortable in her novel surroundings that she 
separates from her husband, although she sees and ac- 
knowledges his many merits. The dt/serted husband 
seeks in his turn to get rid of the stamp of his origin 
by developing a great activity as a patriot." 

The absence of Sienkiewicz from the list of the 
year's novelists is conspicuous. 

The latest of the nations to enter into the 
literary comity of Europe shall be the subject 
of the last of these summaries. M. Paul Mil- 
youkov writes of Russian literature in the phil- 
osophical spirit, and his account is of much in- 
terest, although few important works are men- 
tioned. The most important, perhaps, is " The 
Turning Point," by Boborikin, a novel not yet 
completed, which reflects the successive phases 
of Russian thought during the past half-cen- 
tury. The great social discussion of the pres- 
ent in Russia is between the " peasantists " and 
the " Marxists." 

" While ' peasant ism ' puts its faith exclusively in the 
character and < spirit ' of the people, ' Marxism ' rests all 
its hopes on ' institutions ' ; while the former is inclined 
to regard the fundamental principles of national life as 
primordial and immutable, the latter believes in the 
necessity of social evolution; and, lastly, while the for- 
mer limits its practical programme to social reforms by 
the people, the latter is ready to join in the bourgeois 
demand for political reforms for the people." 

This discussion is voiced in many current pub- 
lications. Among the many books named by 
the writer, only two others appear of sufficient 
interest to be mentioned here. One is Alex- 
ander Veselovsky's study of Boccaccio, and the 
other is Count Tolstoy's " The Kingdom of 
God is Within You." Veselovsky, we are told, 
" is at once the greatest authority on the liter- 
ature of the Middle Ages and one of the most 
brilliant representatives of the comparative his- 
torical method in literature." Of Count Tol- 
stoy's work, already put into English, a sum- 
mary is given, ending with the following sug- 
gestive statement: 

"It is scarcely necessary on this occasion to add that 
the sphere of influence of Tolstoy's ideas grows nar- 
rower every year."

ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY 
OF MICHIGAN* 



For the collegiate year 1894-95, the University 
of Michigan announces twenty-one courses in En- 
glish and rhetoric. Ten are courses in literature, 
historical or critical ; five are in linguistics ; and 
six are in rhetoric and composition. There is the 
usual division into courses which may and courses 
which must be taken by those who intend to grad- 
uate, but with us the requirements differ for the 
different degrees. Candidates for the engineering 
degrees, and for the degree of Bachelor of Science 
in chemistry or biology, are let off with a single 
course in composition. Candidates for the degree 
of Bachelor of Letters must take two courses in 
composition, besides one in literature and one in 
linguistics. All others are required to elect two 
courses in composition. The work is in charge of 
four men : a professor of English and rhetoric, who 
is head of the department ; a junior professor of 
English, an assistant professor of rhetoric, and an 
instructor in English composition. In addition to 
this, the regular force, there are two graduate stu- 
dents who devote a part of their time to teaching 
composition or reading essays. 

The number of students who elected courses in 
English the past year, not allowing for names counted 
twice, was 1198. To this number should perhaps 
be added 110 applicants for work in composition 
for whom provision could not be made. The dis- 
tribution of the elections was as follows : In mod- 
ern literature, 225 ; in Old and Middle English 
literature, and linguistics, 252 ; in rhetoric and com- 
position, 721. 

In considering the various courses in English, it 
will be convenient to follow the division I have 
used above ; that is, into modern literature, Old and 
Middle English, and linguistics, rhetoric, and com- 
position. The first is the province of Professor 
Demmon, who is head of the department ; Profes- 
sor Hempl is in charge of the second ; and the bur- 
den of the rhetoric and composition work falls upon

the shoulders of the instructor (Mr. Dawson), the 
two assistants, and myself. 

In modern literature, the department offers a be- 
ginning course and three seminary courses, asso- 
ciating with the latter ancillary lectures in criticism 
and the history of the drama. The beginning course, 
in charge of Professor Hempl, is a general intro- 
duction to the subject. It is a three-hour course, 
running through one semester. In this, a text-book 
is used to furnish a historical outline, and very brief 
quizzes are given upon it. Most of the time in 
class is taken up by the presentation of reports by 
some half-dozen members of the class to whom the 
lesson of the day had previously been assigned for 
special study in the University library. The object 
of these reports is to bring the student into direct 
contact with the literature and to familiarize him 
somewhat with critical methods and the leading 
books on the subject. 

The seminary courses are conducted by Professor 
Demmon, and aim to give the student an intimate 
first-hand acquaintance with representative mas- 
terpieces. To secure admission to this advanced 
work is somewhat difficult, since at least five pre- 
scribed courses must precede, and there is some sift- 
ing even of those who are technically qualified. 
Professor Demmon offers a seminary in English 
literature, another in American literature, and a 
Shakespeare seminary. The programme of work 
is as follows : At the beginning of the semester, each 
member of the class is assigned a masterpiece and 
asked to prepare upon it a comprehensive biograph- 
ical and critical essay. He is also expected to present 
at some time during the semester a critique of an essay 
by a fellow-member. As soon as his task is assigned, 
he begins reading upon it in the seminary rooms con- 
nected with the library, with the assistance of refer- 
ences prepared by Professor Demmon. If he is a 
member of the Shakespeare course, he has the oppor- 
tunity of using the McMillan Shakespeare collection 
of 3500 volumes. When the work is under way, each 
section of the seminary (a section containing about 
twelve students) meets every week in a two-hour ses- 
sion. The first hour is spent in listening to the essay 
and the critique, and the second hour in an extempor- 
aneous discussion of the work in hand. Each mem- 
ber is called upon in turn, and says what the spirit 
moves him to say. He makes report upon what he 
has read, or agrees or disagrees with the judgments 
of the essayist or the critic, or advances individual 
appreciations of the work. When all opinions have 
been aired and generally some little fencing takes 
place over nice points of criticism there is usually 
time for a summing-up of the arguments and a dis- 
cussion of a special question or two by the conduc- 
tor of the seminary. Both in the selection of master- 
pieces and the conduct of the classes, the aim is to 
supply the necessities rather than the luxuries of 
literature. For literary fads and vagaries there is 
neither time nor inclination. The student finds in 
the seminary courses the best that English and

American literature have to offer. If he goes no 
further, he has already travelled far ; if he con- 
tinues his studies after leaving the University, he 
will know at least the chief landmarks of the coun- 
try he is to traverse. 

With reference to the work in Old and Middle 
English, Professor Hempl has kindly written out for 
me the following statement : 

" My work may generally be designated as lin- 
guistic ; but some of the undergraduate courses are 
necessarily only linguistic in a simple and practical 
way, and consider also the literary side of what is 
read. This is particularly true of the two courses in 
Middle English each twice a week for half a year, 
the second devoted mostly to Chaucer. There is 
also an elementary course in Old English, which, 
as well as the course in Early Middle English, is 
required of candidates for the degree of B.L. 

" Advanced study of Old English is provided for 
in three courses, each half a year: Old English 
poetry twice a week ; phonology and morphology, 
three times a week ; syntax, twice a week. 

" In historical English Grammar a general sur- 
vey is made of the subject, and the students are 
given some practice in methods of investigation by 
being required to trace in English literature the de- 
velopment of various idioms, especially such as are 
often impugned. 

" In alternate years a course is offered in pres- 
ent-spoken English. The students have been set 
to study their own speech and that of those about 
them, and have gathered numerous facts of interest 
as to American English. But the course has been 
more fruitful in opening their eyes to the real state 
of so-called ' standard English,' and in removing 
prejudice and establishing a more reasonable basis 
of judgment in dealing with matters of speech-usage. 
It also appears that a quicker and clearer insight 
into general linguistic facts and principles may be 
obtained by such a study of one's native speech (pro- 
vided various forms and stages of it be represented 
by members of the class) than can be had from a 
study of foreign languages. Alternating with this 
course from year to year is a course in general 
phonetics." 

Of the six courses which fall under the division 
" Rhetoric and Composition," four, each for one 
semester, have for their main object the cultivation 
of good writing ; though one of the four, known as 
the Science of Rhetoric, combines with a large 
amount of practice a small amount of instruction in 
theory. In addition to these, there are two, one 
for graduates and one for undergraduates, which 
deal with rhetoric in its scientific aspects. For the 
required Freshman work, there is provided this year 
a two-hour course in paragraph-writing under Mr. 
Dawson and an assistant. As in other large uni- 
versities, this part of the work presents peculiar 
difficulties. The big classes are about as hetero- 
geneous as they well can be, most of the students 
writing crudely, some execrably, and only a few as 



well as could be wished. These differences call for 
differences of treatment, yet it is impossible with 
our present teaching force to give adequate atten- 
tion to individuals or to distinguish grades of pro- 
ficiency. The most that can be done is to put in 
a section by themselves the Engineering students, 
whose performances in prose are often at the out- 
set of a quite distressing character. 

The course in paragraph-writing is followed by 
a two-hour elective course in theme-writing under 
Mr. Dawson ; and this by a three-hour course, con- 
ducted by myself. The latter is required of all ex- 
cept the engineers and candidates for the degree 
of B.S. in chemistry and biology. It must be pre- 
ceded by a course in psychology or logic, and hence 
is usually taken in the second semester of the Soph- 
omore year or the first semester of the Junior year. 
An advanced course in composition completes the 
list of practical courses. For those who wish to sup- 
plement practice by theory, there is a course in the 
principles of prose style, and a graduate seminary 
course in which the evolution of rhetoric is traced 
from Aristotle to the present time. 

It will appear, I hope, from this outline, that the 
work in composition is intended, first and foremost, 
to be practical. The aim is not to inspire students 
to produce pure literature, if there be any such 
thing, or even to help them to acquire a beautiful 
style. If we can get them first to think straight- 
forwardly about subjects in which they are genu- 
inely interested, and then, after such fashion as na- 
ture has fitted them for, to express themselves 
clearly and connectedly, we have done about all we 
can hope to do. Perhaps the other things will then 
come of themselves. In trying to accomplish these 
ends, I have been accustomed in my own work to 
aim at three essentials : first, continuity and regu- 
larity of written exercises ; second, much writing, 
much criticism, and much consultation ; third, adapt- 
ation of method to the needs of the individual stu- 
dent. To secure the first, the student is made to 
write frequently and at regularly recurring periods, 
and is encouraged to write at set hours regardless 
of mood or inspiration. The second point I may 
be permitted to illustrate by saying that I have 
read and re-read this year something over 3000 
essays, most of them written by a class of 216 
students. The third essential seems to me the most 
important of the three. That the instructor should 
somehow lay hold of the student as an individual 
is, for successful composition work, simply indis- 
pensable. This was the secret of the older method 
of instruction, such as that of Edward Channing, 
described by the Rev. E. E. Hale in " My College 
Days": 

" You sat down in the recitation-room, and were called 
man by man, or boy by boy, in the order in which you 
came into the room; you therefore heard his criticism 
on each of your predecessors. Why do you write with 
blue ink on blue paper ? When I was young, we wrote 
with black ink on white paper; now you write with blue 
ink on blue paper.' < Hale, you do not mean to say

that you think a Grub Street hack is the superior of 
John Milton ? ' " 

I think all teachers of composition will feel that 
Ned Channing's method was good, and will under- 
stand very well how it happened that Hale and his 
seatmates " came out with at least some mechanical 
knowledge of the mechanical method of handling 
the English language." But it must be borne in 
mind that in the larger universities the day of small 
and cosy classes is long past. Now the hungry gener- 
ations tread us down. We hardly learn the names 
and faces of our hundreds of students before they 
break ranks and go their ways, and then we must 
resume our Sisyphaean labors. Is there no way in 
which we can return to the Arcadian methods of 
those early days ? For my part, I think there is 
a way, and a very simple one : Increase the teach- 
ing force and the equipment to the point where the 
instructor can again meet his students as individ- 
uals, and can again have leisure for deliberate con- 
sultation and personal criticism. As Professor Ge- 
nung has well said, the teaching of composition is 
properly laboratory work. If that is true, why 
should it not be placed on the same footing as other 
laboratory work as regards manning and equip- 
ment ? I confess that I now and then cast envious 
eyes upon our Laboratory of Chemistry, with its 
ten instructors and its annual expenditure of ten 
thousand dollars, and try to imagine what might be 
done in a rhetorical laboratory with an equal force 
and a fraction of the expenditure. Nor is the com- 
parison absurd. The amount of business which 
needs to be done in order to secure dexterity in the 
use of language is not less than that which is needed 
to secure dexterity in the manipulation of chemicals. 
The student in composition needs as much personal 
attention as the student in chemistry. The teacher 
of composition, if he is to do his work without loss 
of time and energy, and if he is to secure the ben- 
efit which comes from constant variation in meth- 
ods of instruction, needs all the mechanical helps 
which he can devise. He needs, for example, con- 
veniences for the collection, the distribution, and the 
preservation of the written work. He needs a set 
of " Poole's Index," not in a far-off library, but at 
his elbow. He needs a card-catalogue, revised daily, 
with thousands of subjects of current interest espe- 
cially adapted to the uses of his class. He needs a 
mimeograph and a typewriter ; possibly he needs a 
compositor and a printing-press. Above all (and I 
do not mean to include these among the mechan- 
ical aids) he needs, not one or two, but a score, of 
bright, active, enthusiastic young assistants to share 
his arduous labors with him.. Under these Utopian 
conditions perhaps not wholly Utopian after all 
the teacher of composition could no longer pose as a 
martyr, and so might miss the sympathy he has 
been so long accustomed to ; but I believe that on 
the whole he would be a happier man, and I am cer- 
tain that in the end he would do a vast deal more 
of good in the world. 



In running over the list of courses offered, it will 
doubtless be noticed that the department does not 
announce many which are exclusively for graduate 
students. This must not be taken to imply, how- 
ever, that provision for such students is not made. 
As a fact, there is always a considerable body who 
are pursuing advanced work in English. Many go 
into undergraduate courses and there find what is 
suited to them. But for a large proportion special 
advanced courses are arranged, as they are needed, 
after consultation with the student. These are ob- 
viously too variable in character to be enumerated

WALTER PA TER. 

English prose could have suffered no heavier loss 
than that of Walter Pater, who died suddenly at 
Oxford on the thirtieth of July. He was born in 
London on the fourth of August, 1839, and was 
thus within a few days of completing his fifty-fifth 
year. His life was that of the typical scholar, out- 
wardly uneventful. Educated at Canterbury and 
Oxford, he took his degree in 1862, and was elected 
to a fellowship at Brasenose. Since then he has 
occupied various offices in that college. His works 
are as follows: "The Renaissance" (1873), "Ma- 
rius the Epicurean " (1885), a Imaginary Portraits " 
(1887), "Appreciations" (1890), and "Plato and 
Platonism " (1893). A series of articles on the 
French cathedrals, in course of publication in one 
of the English reviews, will probably add a sixth 
volume to the definitive edition of his works. "Ma- 
rius the Epicurean " was reviewed by the late H. 
N. Powers in THE DIAL for August, 1885 ; " Im- 
aginary Portraits" in September, 1887 ; "Appre- 
ciations " by the Rev. C. A. L. Richards in June, 
1890 ; and " Plato and Platonism " by Professor 
Paul Shorey in April, 1893. The five volumes of 
Pater's works constitute one of the choicest treasures 
of English prose. Great as is their value considered 
merely as so much criticism of art, literature, and 
life, they have a still greater value as masterpieces 
of literary expression. It would hardly be too much 
to claim that since the deaths of Matthew Arnold 
and Cardinal Newman, at least, Pater has been the 
greatest of English prose-writers, just as Tennyson 
was for so many years the greatest of English poets. 
" Marius the Epicurean " is a classic if there ever 
was one, and, what is more, it bore so manifestly 
the sign and seal of artistic excellence that it won 
instant recognition as a classic from all competent 
critics. The four " Imaginary Portraits " of the 
volume that soon followed are akin to " Marius " 
in their method and aim. In the two volumes of 
essays, art and literature receive attention about 
equally, and both of these great subjects are han- 
dled with equal mastery. The grace, the insight, 
the subtle discrimination, and the delicate art dis-

played in these collections are almost beyond praise. 
As for the " Plato and Platonism," we cannot do 
better than quote from our own pages the dictum 
of the foremost American Platonist, that " it has 
the rare distinction of being right and just through- 
out," that " it is the first true and correctly pro- 
portioned presentation of Platonism that has been 
given to the general reader." 



FRANCIS H. UNDERWOOD. 

Francis H. Underwood, born in Enfield, Mass., 
on the twelfth of January, 1825, died at Leith, 
Scotland, on the seventh of August. He was edu- 
cated at Amherst, taught school for a while, and 
then practised law. He became literary adviser for 
the house of Phillips and Sampson, and was one of 
the founders of " The Atlantic Monthly," being as- 
sociated with Lowell in its editorship. From 1859 
to 1870 he served as Clerk of the Superior Court 
at Boston. He was also a member of the Boston 
school board for thirteen years. He was one of the 
founders of the St. Botolph's and Papyrus Clubs. 
Since 1885 he has lived in Europe, with the ex- 
ception of the year 1892-93. He succeeded Mr. 
Harte at Glasgow as United States Consul, and was 
appointed to a similar post at Edinburgh (Leith) 
only last year. He wrote biographies of Long- 
fellow, Whittier, and Lowell, and expected to com- 
plete this quartette of famous New Englanders by 
a biography of Dr. Holmes. These biographies are 
reminiscential rather than critical, and in this char- 
acter are of great value. His latest writings were 
"The Poet and the Man " (a second and still more 
intimate study of Lowell), and the first volume of 
a projected series on " The Builders of American 
Literature." During the period of his Scottish con- 
sulate, he lectured frequently upon subjects con- 
nected with American literature, and also contrib- 
uted to the English reviews. Other publications 
were a " Handbook of English Literature," a " Hand- 
book of American Literature," a series of musical 
stories called " Cloud Pictures," and a novel called 
" Lord of Himself." His most important book, pub- 
lished in 1892, and reviewed in THE DIAL for Feb- 
ruary 1, 1893, was " Quabbin, the Story of a Small 
Town, with Outlooks upon Puritan Life." It would 
be difficult to set too high the interest (as well as 
the historical value) of this picture of a Massachu- 
setts town early in the century. We said of it upon 
its appearance : " So careful and detailed an ex- 
hibit of a community, of its outer and inner life, 
has seldom been attempted, and never more suc- 
cessfully made. To the descendants of Pilgrims 
and Puritans the work is dedicated, and they, at 
least, cannot read it without being thrilled to the 
inmost fibre by its sympathetic delineation of their 
ancestral past, for New England is Quabbin very 
much as Freiligrath declared Germany to be Ham- 
let." 



C OMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE TEACHING OF LITERATURE, AGAIN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A certain amount taken for granted goes to the un- 
derstanding of any utterance; and in the discussion of 
current topics in public prints a certain point of view, 
once assumed, is usually understood and respected. Mr. 
W. H. Johnson of Denison University, who objects to 
my distinctions and strictures directed to certain phases 
of the current discussion in THE DIAL on the teaching of 
literature, seems to me to disregard these obvious rules. 

The question under discussion is concerned with the 
organization of the teaching of literature in English in 
the higher institutions of learning in America. The dif- 
ficulties suggested by me occur to the mind, I think, 
solely in considering this particular question. In sec- 
ondary institutions, or for the independent and excep- 
tional teacher, they obviously have little weight. Now 
my intention was to state the difficulty somewhat para- 
doxically, and not without a feeling for the lurking irony 
of the logic of the argument. Mr. Johnson writes ad- 
mirably of the essential inseparableness of subject-mat- 
ter and form in matters of art, and we all applaud. But 
this is also elementary, while at the same time the gist 
of the real difficulty resides precisely in this point. How 
far, from the psychological or pedagogical point of view, 
does the teacher of literature need to go in the exposi- 
tion of the subject-matter of his text ? The extreme 
in one way, the extreme of license, is well exemplified 
in the condition of things a few years ago at the Uni- 
versity of Indiana, as revealed by Professor Sampson's 
moving account in a recent number of THE DIAL. The 
reaction from the other extreme is voiced in the modern 
appeal for the teaching of " mere literature " again. It 
is perhaps well to understand the dangers on either side, 
as it is also well to attempt to define, to really define, 
what the teaching of literature in English from estab- 
lished chairs actually comprehends. Is it literary folk- 
lore and rudimentary monuments of speech in gen- 
eral ? is it the theory and history of criticism and the 
various sciences and tentative laws of literary aesthetics ? 
is it the old-fashioned literary history ? is it psychology 
and sociology studied in the documents which record the 
long imagination of the race ? is it a miscellaneous and 
emotional " ethics " ? is it solidly philology in the Ger- 
man sense ? What is it ? After all, perhaps it would 
not be a bad thing frankly to retain in every university 
one professorship at least of Things in General as In- 
terpreted in the Emotional and Imaginative Records of 
the Race. I for one believe it would not be a bad 
thing, if the right occupant for the chair could always 
be found. Only, of course, there are other dangers, and 
the thing should be understood. 

The pupil, as pupil, I take it, has really no concern 
with these distinctions. Mr. Johnson's metaphor from 
explosives is pretty, and one enjoys the sarcasm of it; 
but has it anything to do with the case ? 

If our universities insist on specializing in every direc- 
tion, let it be done orderly and with understanding; and 
if there is to be a department of Omuiana let it be rec- 
ognized as such. But from organizers and theorists, at 
one extreme or the other, let us save the real study of 
literature, namely, the actual and enthusiastic reading, 
after whatever method, of the great masterpieces, by the 
college student. FREDERIC IVES CARPENTER.

A GREAT PUBLIC SERVANT.* 

The editor of these welcome volumes, much 
as he merits our gratitude for opening to us so 
much good literature, is hardly to be ranked 
among those who practice that eternal vigil- 
ance which is the price of accuracy. I have 
prepared a rather formidable list of misprints, 
wrong dates, misquotations, and other editorial 
oversights, and my list is not exhaustive. There 
is no room for these things here ; but my notes 
are at the service of the editor or the publisher. 
These beautiful volumes are uniform with the 
edition of Lowell's Letters recently issued by 
the same publishers, beside which, both as to 
form and as to contents, they are in every way 
worthy to find a place on the bookshelf. 

There is something impressive in the very 
titles of the several papers and addresses here 
collected ; they inspire confidence in the Re- 
public by suggesting the moral foundations 
upon which alone free institutions can rest 
down, and by reminding us of the worth, the 
beauty, the dignity of the American character 
at its best. Curtis is gone, and we are sure 
of him. While he lived we seemed to discern 
in him, through the dust of party conflict and 
the fog of prejudice, the outlines of a singu- 
larly high and symmetrical manhood. Now 
that the fog is lifted and the dust laid, we per- 
ceive him to be of loftier height and more ideal 
proportions than we had thought. Himself the 
eulogist of so many approved American wor- 
thies of Sumner and Phillips, of Sedgwick 
and Garfield, of Bryant and Lowell, and of 
Washington, he can afford to await the fu- 
ture eulogist who shall inscribe his name upon 
the same " eternal bead-roll." His fame as a 
great public character at length is safe, 

" Safe from the wolf's black jaw, and the dull ass's hoof." 

George William Curtis was, in the words 
applied by Edmund Burke to his son, " born 
to be a public creature." His training for public 
affairs was, however, entirely different from that 
of most American politicians. For the first 
thirty-two years of his life his road led him 
through the most flowery and inviting fields of 
literature. He had ample time for study and for

wide and select reading ; he enjoyed opportu- 
nities unequalled, at least in America, for inti- 
macy with literary people ; and he knew how 
to profit by the advantages of leisurely travel. 
He received also a somewhat careful business 
training. He became known as the author of 
some dainty, almost euphuistic, novels, notes 
of travel, and satirical sketches of society. In 
all this there was no prophecy of the future 
politician and reformer. 

In 1853 Mr. Curtis associated himself with 
C. F. Briggs and Parke Godwin in the editor- 
ship of " Putnam's Magazine," the most prom- 
ising literary periodical in America before the 
founding of " The Atlantic Monthly "; and in 
October, 1853, he first took his seat in the 
"Easy Chair" of "Harper's Monthly," the 
original occupant of which was Donald G. 
Mitchell. Curtis was preeminently a man of 
poetic tastes, artistic temperament, and literary 
aptitudes ; and if any man of his times might 
reasonably have devoted himself exclusively to 
a career of letters, he was the man. But those 
were the darkest hours of the conflict against 
the extension of slavery, and Curtis had in him 
something of the strain of Milton and of Roger 
Williams. He could not soar " in the high 
reason of his fancies, with his garland and sing- 
ing-robes about him," so long as that " troubled 
sea of noises and hoarse disputes " resounded 
in his ears. One of the most deeply-felt and 
touching passages in all Curtis's orations is 
that in which he describes the coming of Wen- 
dell Phillip's first and only client, on the mem- 
orable October afternoon in 1835. 

"As the jail-doors closed upon Garrison to save his 
life, Garrison and his cause had won their most power- 
ful and renowned ally. With the setting of that Octo- 
ber sun vanished forever the career of prosperous ease, 
the gratification of ordinary ambition, which the genius 
and the accomplishment of Wendell Phillips had seemed 
to foretell. Yes, the long-awaited client had come at 
last. Scarred, scorned, and forsaken, that cowering and 
friendless client was wronged and degraded humanity. 
The great soul saw and understood" (III., 277). 

Twenty years later the same client interrupted 
Curtis's fine dream of a career like that of Irv- 
ing. He also understood and obeyed. From 
that moment, politics by which I understand 
the application of morality and reason to public 
affairs became the chief business of his life. 
He became a public creature. In the last of 
his memorial addresses, that upon Lowell, he 
applauds the fine insight of his old friend, C. 
F. Briggs, in remarking " that Lowell was nat- 
urally a politician, and a politician like Milton 
a man, that is to say, with an instinctive

grasp of the higher politics, of the duties and 
relations of the citizen to his country, and of 
those moral principles which are as essential 
to the welfare of states as oxygen to the breath 
of human life " (III., 374). It can hardly be 
disputed that Briggs would have shown still 
finer insight in saying this of Curtis. For while 
the remark is eminently true of Lowell as a 
thinker and as a writer, he was of too impa- 
tient a temper to illustrate the duties of the 
citizen in his daily life, as did Curtis. In say- 
ing this I would not be understood as dispar- 
aging Lowell, whose political service was equal 
to his great political sagacity. But Curtis's 
sense of his own political duty prompted him 
to carry the knowledge of the higher politics 
into that lower politics which is called " prac- 
tical." He became a political editor ; he at- 
tended the primary ; he was regularly a dele- 
gate to political conventions, state and national ; 
he was for many years Chairman of the Repub- 
lican Committee of his county ; he accepted 
the labors of the chairmanship of the first 
Civil Service Commission, in which capacity 
he determined the lines along which that re- 
form has since proceeded ; and he was, from 
its inception in 1881 until his death in 1892, 
the laborious President of the National Civil- 
Service Reform League. This may faintly 
suggest the enormous scope of his self-sacrific- 
ing political services. His public spirit led 
him to accept other offices, none of them, I 
think, offices of emolument, all of them offices 
of trust and honor, such as that of Regent of 
the University of the State of New York, which 
he held for many years ; and that of President 
of the Metropolitan Museum. All these mul- 
tifarious duties he performed with pains and 
punctuality. It is scarcely necessary to add 
that he was never in the ordinary sense either 
an office-seeker or an office-holder. 

The contents of these three volumes group 
themselves readily into several great classes, 
which indicate the chief preoccupations of the 
author's mind. The first class consists of those 
addresses delivered before, during, and after 
the war, the object of which was the awaken- 
ing of the conscience of the nation touching the 
monstrous injustice of slavery, and, later, the 
assurance of fair treatment, civilly and educa- 
tionally, to the freedman. The second class is 
made up of the addresses advocating woman 
suffrage, and defending the right of women to 
the same education as men. The third class 
is well characterized by the title of one of the 
addresses : " The Spirit and Influence of the 



Higher Education." The fourth class com- 
prises all the reports and addresses relating to 
the Reform of the Civil Service. The fifth 
class consists of the historical and memorial 
addresses. The first three classes of addresses 
are contained in Volume I., the fourth fills Vol- 
ume II., and the fifth Volume III. The ora- 
tions upon Sumner and Phillips, in the last 
volume, should be read in connection with the 
first six addresses of Volume I. 

The first address in Volume I. is Curtis's 
answer to the appeal which the client of Wen- 
dell Phillips had made in turn to him. It is 
an oration before the literary societies of Wes- 
leyan University, delivered in August, 1856, 
in the heat of the great Presidential campaign 
and of the struggle for the rescue of bleeding 
Kansas, and only ten weeks after the dastardly 
assault upon Sumner. In that hour there could 
be but one subject for Curtis : "The Duty of the 
American Scholar to Politics and the Times." 
How severe the inward struggle had been be- 
tween the promptings of genius and the claims 
of duty, we do not yet know, probably we 
shall never know. But this oration shows de- 
cisively that genius had wheeled into line with 
duty. Speaking as a young man to young men, 
as a scholar to scholars, he throws all the noble 
ardor of his nature into this powerful appeal, 
and compels them to face squarely the grave 
question of the hour, rehearses the shameful 
history of American slavery, points out the 
momentous issues of the present struggle, and 
calls upon generous youth to obey the call of 
duty in the spirit of John Milton and Joseph 
Warren. 

" Gentlemen, the scholar is the representative of 
thought among men, and his duty to society is the ef- 
fort to introduce thought and the sense of justice into 
human affairs. He was not made a scholar to satisfy 
the newspapers or the parish beadles, but to serve God 
and man. While other men pursue what is expedient 
and watch with alarm the flickering of the funds, he is 
to pursue the truth and watch the eternal law of jus- 
tice " (I., 14). 

Reprinted in the " Weekly Tribune," this speech 
went to every farm-house in the Northland, and 
it had further circulation as a pamphlet. Later 
orations of Curtis are chaster in style, more 
classic in form, riper in political wisdom, more 
quotable, more what you will ; but none prob- 
ably was more effective in its time, none more 
historically noteworthy. Mr. Norton does not 
go beyond the mark in saying : " It helped to 
define the political ideals, and to confirm the

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



The next oration, entitled u Patriotism," was 
delivered in the following year at several col- 
leges, and was likewise widely circulated. Dur- 
ing the year which had intervened, Buchanan 
had become President and the Dred Scott de- 
cision had been rendered. Patriotism, he ar- 
gued, is simply fidelity to the American idea 
the sentiment of human liberty. In reply 
to the specious charge that the harborers of 
fugitive slaves were law-breakers, he had no 
difficulty in showing that laws are of two kinds, 
"Those which concern us as citizens, and 
those which affect us as men." The former 
we obey, even when they are unjust, for " in 
themselves they have no moral character or im- 
portance." The latter, when unjust, " God 
and man require of you to disobey." As times 
were, such words as these were deeds. For 
such words Sumner had been struck down ; by 
deeds which were the logical outcome of such 
words, John Brown was soon to become the 
immortal Winkelreid of the anti-slavery cause. 
On the very day on which John Brown was 
taken at Harper's Ferry, Curtis delivered at 
Plymouth Church his address on " The Pres- 
ent Aspect of the Slavery Question." Two 
months later, when John Brown's soul had just 
begun its eternal march, Curtis repeated the 
address in Philadelphia. The whole power of 
the police force of Philadelphia, aided by the 
armed friends of Curtis, was scarcely sufficient 
to prevent him from being mobbed. As it was, 
paving stones and vitriol were hurled through 
the windows. Even in December, 1860, after 
the election of Lincoln, an engagement with 
Curtis to deliver a lecture on Thackeray in 
Philadelphia had to be cancelled, on account 
of fear of mob violence. Such was the temper 
of the people of the City of Brotherly Love at 
the very time of the investment of Fort Sum- 
ter ! Small wonder that the Slave Power was 
arrogantly confident. 

During those years the constant habit of pub- 
lic speaking, conversance with public affairs, 
and no doubt also the stress and excitement of 
those trying times, had rapidly matured the 
mind and strengthened the style of Curtis. His 
logic becomes more cogent, his tone more states- 
manlike, his phrase more trenchant. There are 
terse, curt dicta that remind one of Burke : 
" A wrong does not become a right by being 
vested " (I., 85). There is something of Burke, 
too, in comparisons like the following : "In 
great emergencies men always rise to cardinal 
principles, as, in sailing out of sight of land, 
the mariner looks up and steers by the sun and 



stars" (I., 103). But he takes care to make 
no sacrifice of matter for decorative effect. The 
soft light of his poetic genius, which shines in 
the memorial addresses, is converted, in the 
argumentative ones, into a lantern to light the 
road. No man is happier in showing up the 
specious arts by which the people are made to 
believe a lie. His kindly eye is keen to de- 
tect the weak points in the enemy's armor, and 
his gentle hand is sure at the rapier-thrust. 
With what consummate art he expresses, as 
early as 1862, the judgment of history upon 
Stephen A. Douglas : " The parties were in 
earnest. Yet he could not be in earnest, for 
he was only playing for the presidency. ' " The 
mills of God! " there are no mills of God,' 
he smiled and said ; and instantly he was caught 
up and politically ground to powder between 
the whirring millstones of liberty and slavery " 
(I., 117). There is a shrewd characterization 
thrown off with the quiet elegance native to the 
author of the " Easy Chair." 

It would be easy to multiply indefinitely these 
illustrations, as it would be delightful to follow 
him through all the addresses of that time. 
They are " thoughts that breathe and words 
that burn." But to go into such details would 
be far beyond the scope of this article. I have 
spoken particularly of the earlier addresses, 
because of their double interest in illustrating 
the great choice of Curtis's life and in recall- 
ing a heroic period of our history. Some of 
the later addresses are doubtless intrinsically 
more valuable : they are more moderate in tone, 
chaster in style, solider in substance, fruitier 
in flavor, more weighted with experience, in 
short, they have the qualities that assure per- 
manence. 

Of the Memorial Addresses I will not speak, 
further than to say that they exhibit the sure- 
ness of touch, the intimacy of knowledge, the 
selection of matter, and selectness of phrase, 
which mark the classic. The addresses upon 
Sumner, Phillips, Bryant, and Lowell would 
live, even were their quality less fine, because 
they are sketches of eminent men from the 
hand of an intimate friend. But they will be 
read for themselves and for Curtis. To Gen- 
eral Sedgwick he did not stand so near. There 
is no evidence that they had met ; but the ad- 
dress commemorative of him, though slighter, 
is of fascinating interest. The centennial ora- 
tions upon Concord fight and Burgoyne's defeat 
will continue to have for Americans something 
more than the charm of Macaulay's essays upon 
Clive and Frederick. No writer has given us

THE DIAL 



more vivid and inspiring battle-pictures ; and 
in Curtis the motive and end of it all are always 
present, the human heart-beat is heard above 
the roar of the guns, the human hope shines 
through the battle-smoke. 

There are two addresses which are more 
creditable to his courage in avowing and de- 
fending his convictions and to his chivalry in 
the advocacy of unpopular causes, than to his 
reputation as a statesmanlike leader of opinion. 
I refer to the pleas for woman suffrage. He 
makes very plain, indeed, the justice of admit- 
ting woman to " the same position with men 
so far as property rights and remedies are con- 
cerned," and this necessarily includes the right 
to vote upon local concerns. It is unfortunate 
for this great and inevitable reform that so dis- 
tinguished and eloquent an advocate should 
have mixed it up with a larger question, and 
that he should have defended both with argu- 
ments that seem to be borrowed from the wo 
men. What the cause really needed was a 
man's logic and a statesman's moderation ; and 
here Curtis missed a great opportunity. To 
begin with, he all along assumes, and even 
roundly asserts, that the fact that a thing is a 
novelty is " a presumption in its favor " (I., 
182). That does not remind one of Burke! 
To compel women to do military service would 
be a novelty ; but would Curtis have admitted 
the presumption to be in its favor ? Then he 
constantly speaks of men and women as sep- 
arate social classes ; indeed, this grotesque use 
of the word class will be found, I believe, to 
carry nearly the whole weight of the argument. 
This would be delightfully feminine if it were 
not so misleading. A sense of the danger of 
class legislation prompted men to restore the 
ballot to the late rebel leaders. But the very 
men who performed this act of justice refuse 
the ballot to women. If, then, one class of 
men with the ballot is likely to be unjust to 
another class without it, " how much truer is 
it that one sex as a class will be unjust to the 
other." " Woman " is some far-off object of 
oppression, like the negro or the Hindoo, to 
whom " man " will be more unjust than to his 
political enemies or to an alien race. But when 
we leave off speculating about the class " wo- 
man " and the class " man," and look at men 
and women, we perceive that in actual life men 
and women, outside of Amazonia, are never 
separate classes, but that every social class in- 
cludes both sexes. 

' The woman's cause is man's : they rise or sink 
Together, dwarf'd or godlike, bond or free." 



Had Curtis read his Burke to better purpose 
he would never have beclouded a political and 
social discussion by the introduction of meta- 
physical considerations, concerning which Burke 
cried : " I hate the very sound of them ! " He 
would not have accused men, as he does by 
implication (I., 219), of constant audacity, 
tyranny, and inhumanity toward women, 
i. e., toward their mothers, sisters, sweethearts, 
wives, and daughters. He would hardly have 
imagined that he had conclusively refuted the 
theory of the virtual representation of women, 
by adverting to the illusory nature of that the- 
ory in the case of the British Colonies. Nor 
would he have asserted in the New York Con- 
stitutional Convention that the action of that 
Convention in withholding the ballot from 
women was an injustice as monstrous, an incon- 
sistency as gross, as would be the disfranchise- 
ment of the county of Richmond, from which 
Mr. Curtis was a delegate. Finally, he would 
certainly have been more guarded in assuming, 
as he repeatedly does, that the ballot is one of 
the natural political rights of women, not see- 
ing that by such an assumption he begs the 
whole question. The most ardent follower of 
Rousseau would scarcely deny that a natural 
political right, if such a thing there be, must be 
something good both for the individual and for 
the community. I do not say that the partici- 
pation of shop-girls in the quadrennial scramble 
for office, and the voting of ballet-dancers " in 
blocks of five," would not be a good thing : I 
merely point out that Curtis begs the question. 

In the discussion of this grave question Cur- 
tis loses his usual sense and balance. This is 
very likely not his fault ; there seems to be a 
certain fallacious glamour, a something more 
than natural, in the atmosphere of this agita- 
tion, " airs from heaven or blasts from hell," 
that bereave people of their senses, and impel 
them to indulge in " wild and whirling words." 
Under the platform of the woman-suffrage con- 
vention, as under the platform at Elsinore, 
there lurks a ghost that cries " Swear ! " to him 
who shrinks from complicity with the over- 
strained declarations of the place. 

The contents of the second volume, consist- 
ing entirely of addresses and reports on the re- 
form of the Civil Service, are of a far more 
serious and statesmanlike character. This vol- 
ume is at present most timely. One hazards 
little in asserting that there is no other book 
comparable to it for doctrine and discipline in 
right political action at the present time. In 
the anti-slavery addresses we are dealing with 



90 



[Aug. 16, 



one who is in the formative stage of early man- 
hood. Working under the guidance of great 
and inspiring leaders, Garrison, Phillips, 
Sumner, Lowell, Beecher, he plants himself 
impregnably upon the rock of fundamental 
morality. It was really a simple question, as 
questions of duty always are ; he clearly saw 
the solution ; and he could bring to bear upon 
his hearers all his mental equipment, all his 
spiritual elevation, all the force of ardent con- 
viction. In the woman-suffrage addresses he 
is doing what he believes to be his duty ; he is 
honestly taking his oath in obedience to the 
mandate of the ghost. In the commemorative 
addresses he is more purely reminiscential, de- 
scriptive, and decorative. He is following his 
genius in pronouncing the fitting word upon 
a great public occasion, in recounting the life 
and services of some one of the great men he 
had known, in celebrating the Puritan char- 
acter, or, what is almost equivalent, in recall- 
ing the great words and deeds of the founders 
of American liberty. But after the settlement 
of the issues of the Civil War, Curtis finds 
himself suddenly confronted by a public evil 
scarcely less insidious and gigantic than negro 
slavery. His old masters have fallen away : 
he himself is no longer distinctively a young 
man ; he is surrounded by generous youth, 
awake to the danger, eager for the struggle, 
and needing only a leader. Almost from the 
first the chief advocate of Civil-Service Reform, 
he lived to be its chief agent ; and, in order to 
be both, he had to become the political philos- 
opher of the Reform. It is in the last capac- 
ity that this volume presents him to us. 

The first of these addresses was delivered as 
long ago as 1869 ; the last, entitled " Party and 
Patronage," was read (but not by the author) 
at the meeting of the National Civil-Service 
Reform League in 1892, only four months be- 
fore his death. He had been occupied with 
the subject for a quarter of a century. When 
his name first became identified with the Re- 
form, it had been advocated in Congress by 
one member, Mr. Jenckes, and before the pub- 
lic by two weekly papers, " The Nation," ed- 
ited by Mr. Godkin, and " Harper's Weekly," 
edited by Mr. Curtis. " To the general pub- 
lic it was necessary to explain what the Civil 
Service was, how it was recruited, what the 
abuses were, and why and how they were to 
be remedied" (II., 173). Our politics had 
reached a stage when, in his own vigorous 
phrase, " Servility to party takes the place of 
individual independence of action " (II., 492). 



Curtis was in every way admirably fitted for 
the leadership that fell to him. The breadth 
of his historical reading, and especially his ac- 
curate studies in American history, enabled 
him to see the reform of the enormous evils re- 
sulting from the spoils system, a system grow- 
ing out of the unconstitutional diversion of 
patronage from the President to the members 
of Congress, to be " but another successive 
step in the development of liberty under law " 
(II., 488). The great oratorical and persuasive 
powers of Curtis, his skill in winning the good- 
will of his audience before introducing the moral 
consideration, made him the Wendell Phillips 
of this movement. His patience, his firmness, 
his humor, his urbanity, his knowledge of pol- 
itics, were all brought into play. But what 
gave his advocacy of the cause most weight was 
the well-known loftiness of his character. For 
example, in the address at the unveiling of the 
statue of Washington, Curtis, referring to the 
air of American patriotism about the hallowed 
spot, says : " To breathe it, charged with such 
memories, is to be inspired with the loftiest 
human purpose, to be strengthened for the no- 
blest endeavor" (III., 183). When Curtis 
speaks thus, those acquainted with his life know 
that this is not mere sentiment with him ; but 
that he is himself fired with this inspiration 
and energized with this strength. Like the 
anti-slavery movement, this reform is essen- 
tially a moral one, and it was indispensable 
that it should find a leader without fear and 
without reproach. Curtis's chief effective- 
ness and value as a public teacher are due to 
the high ground he takes, to his magnanim- 
ity to opponents, to the fairness of his argu- 
ments, to the public confidence in his absolute 
truthfulness, and to the fact that he never 
makes appeal to the selfishness of men. Per- 
haps young Americans will owe more, in the 
long run, to his steady opposition to the blind, 
partisanship against which Washington warned 
us, than to any of his specific public services. 
Himself a party man, he was strong enough to 
make himself (to borrow his own words con- 
cerning the true function of the press) preem- 
inently " the voice of the patriotic intelligence 
and public spirit which, even while accepting 
a party name, rejects a party collar " (I., 311). 
From the year 1880 until the year of his 
death, Curtis prepared thirteen addresses upon 
Civil-Service Reform, all but the first two of 
which were given as Presidential addresses at 
the successive annual meetings of the National 
Civil-Service Reform League. These, in their 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



way, are of unequalled interest, embodying as 
they do a history of the progress of the Re- 
form from year to year, sober criticisms of the 
conduct of presidents and public officials, and 
a whole arsenal of arguments and illustrations 
making for the reform. Literary style and 
finish are here, of course, distinctly subordin- 
ated to substance and matter ; and yet there 
are perhaps no more signal illustrations than 
some of these addresses of the strength and 
chastity of Curtis's later style. Among his 
other titles to honorable remembrance is the 
respect he always exhibited for the English 
language. In a time when the relaxation of 
moral standards seemed to mirror itself in the 
vulgarity of newspaper diction, Curtis kept his 
tongue, like his heart and conduct, pure and 
undefiled. The example of taste and high 
breeding he sets in this particular should not 
be without its influence. 

Curtis will have a place in our literature on 
the one hand with the elegant essayists, on the 
other with those orators who have been great 
public characters. Kant is said to have des- 
pised oratory as too rhetorical, too much af- 
fected by feeling, too much the art of making 
the worse appear the better reason. But what 
would he have said of the orator who employed 
his gracious gift always in the service of jus- 
tice and humanity ; who, in a time of bitter 
partisanship, never flattered an unworthy pre- 
judice ; and who never flinched, for clamor 
and calumny, from championing an unpopular 
cause ? Such a man has his function no less 
than the philosopher who coldly analyzes the 
final principles of things. Such a man has his 
place beside the statesman and the hero ; and 
when we enumerate the men who have rendered 
eminent public service, the noble leader in the 
Civil-Service Reform will be named along with 
Alexander Hamilton, with Samuel Adams, with 
Wendell Phillips, and with Charles Sumner.

THE STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF 
SOCIALISM.* 

The distinctive feature of Dr. Ely's new work 
on Socialism lies in bringing together for the 
first time within the same covers both the fair- 
est and most appreciative treatment of the 
strength of socialism and of its weaknesses. In 
the emphasis laid upon practicable and much- 

* SOCIALISM. An Examination of its Nature, its Strength, 
and its Weakness ; with Suggestions for Social Reform. By 
Richard T. Ely. New York : Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. 



needed social reforms, and the discrimination 
between the sphere of state and of private, of 
monopolistic and of competitive business, this 
work is likely to prove the most useful of all 
works on the subject. 

Professor Ely most clearly shows how he and 
other social reformers can stand side by side 
with the socialists in the treatment of monop- 
olies of situation, such as gas, street and steam 
railways, the electric light, telephone and tele- 
graph, and in factory legislation in its widest 
meaning, without holding at all with the social- 
ists as to the desirability or practicability of 
collective management of most manufacturing 
and commercial enterprises. Never before has 
so strong a sympathizer with most of the truly 
noble socialist ideals criticised so keenly the 
methods proposed for their realization or the 
over-confidence in human nature revealed by 
their authors. Recognizing the value of social- 
ism in its arousing of the social conscience and 
the exposure of existing abuses, Professor Ely 
admits that if the present tendency to the forma- 
tion of trusts shall continue until each industry 
is monopolized, then public management may 
have to come ; but he wisely holds that we can- 
not yet be sure that the trust idea will go so far. 
A fuller treatment of this subject, however, 
might well have been given ; and the classifica- 
tion of such industrial types as artificial mon- 
opolies, instead of as monopolies of large capi- 
tal, which, so far as they go, are as natural as 
any other, might be criticised. 

Our author speaks of the " hesitation and 
timidity " which is apt to attend collective ac- 
tion, though elsewhere he holds that this is less 
important in monopolies of situation than the 
advantages in such of public operation. The 
most serious objections to socialism he finds in 

" the tendencies to revolutionary dissatisfaction which 
it would be likely to carry with it; the difficulties in 
the way of the organization of several important fac- 
tors of production under socialism, notably agriculture; 
difficulties in the way of determining any standard of 
distributive justice that would be generally acceptable, 
and at the same time would enlist the whole-hearted 
services of the most gifted and talented members of 
the community; and, finally, the danger that the re- 
quirements of these persons engaged in higher pur- 
suits would be underestimated, and the importance of 
those occupations which contribute most to the advance- 
ment of civilization should fail to secure adequate ap- 
preciation." 

His dissent from the tenets of socialism is also 
shown in his belief that the wastes which he 
fully admits in the true competitive field of in- 
dustry are " counterbalanced by the gains aris- 
ing from competition, such as alertness and the

free exercise of one's powers by active efforts 
to meet wants as they arise." 

Occupying so conservative a position, it is 
noteworthy how vigorously our author cham- 
pions social reforms in the line of factory and 
sanitary legislation, public ownership of what 
I call monopolies of situation, and the recogni- 
tion of our duty to serve the humanity about 
us and our state and city with our wealth and 
talents. He truly holds that the longer we 
delay these moderate and really conservative 
reforms, the farther will we have to go along 
untried and uncertain paths in order to meet 
the fast rising discontent of the masses. 

A few years ago, when the reviewer enjoyed 
the privilege of listening to Professor Ely's first 
courses of lectures in America, many, as now, 
called him a radical and a socialist ; but he 
then said, what this book confirms, that the 
time would come when, if his suggestions for 
social reform in the interest of true conserva- 
tism were not heeded, the mass of men would 
be driven past him into such radical views as 
would make his seem conservative. Such a 
result has already come ; for although the au- 
thor now holds substantially the economic posi- 
tion he did then, many, on reading the second 
and third parts of the present noteworthy book, 
will be surprised to find how conservative Pro- 
fessor Ely now appears, beside the rising tide 
of socialistic thought about us. To those who, 
like the reviewer, are agnostics as to our remote 
social future, but prefer steady and peaceful 
evolution toward a greater equality of oppor- 
tunity for all for the development of individ- 
uality and manhood, rather than a damming of 
the current until destruction must attend its 
ultimate and inevitable sweep onward, the les- 
sons of Professor Ely's chapters on social re- 
form seem well worth heeding.

A BRITISH DIPLOMAT IN THE ORIENT.* 

Sir Harry Parkes was a household name in 
China and Japan, both to foreigners and na- 
tives. To most Europeans the man was best 
and familiarly known as " Sir Harry "; by 
Chinese he was called " Pa Hia-li " and " Pa 
Tajin " names which might well have been 
as awe-inspiring and perhaps even as terrify-

Majesty's Minister to China and Japan. By Stanley Lane- 
Poole, author of " Life of Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe."

ing as was that of Richard Coeur de Leon 
among the Saracens. The story of the life of 
Sir Harry Parkes has been interestingly told 
by Stanley Lane-Poole, who treats of his ca- 
reer in China and Siam, and Frederick V. 
Dickins, who treats of that in Japan and Ko- 
rea. This composite biography reads like a 
novel ; but on disputed points of policy it is 
a work of special pleading, the conclusions of 
which must not be too freely accepted. 

Though the schooling of Harry Parkes, on 
account of the straitened circumstances of the 
family, was limited, "his education really 
opened on the decks of men-of-war, in the 
council-chambers of plenipotentiaries, and on 
the field of battle," where he gained a wide 
knowledge of men and of affairs. His first ap- 
pearance on the stage of action in the Orient 
was in 1842 at Nanking. To this place Im- 
perial Commissioners of China " had at last 
condescended to come," impelled by fear of a 
British army and men-of-war, "with full 
powers from the Son of Heaven to treat for 
peace " with those " outer barbarians." 

" In the midst of this pomp and pageantry of court 
and war, a slim fair-haired boy with eager young face 
and vivid blue eyes was formally presented to the Im- 
perial Commissioners. It was thus that Harry Parkes 
at the age of fourteen took his place in a great histor- 
ical scene. From this day for more than forty years 
there were few events in the history of British rela- 
tions with the Far East in which he did not play a con- 
spicuous part ; till the lad who carried ' chops ' and dis- 
patches for Sir Henry Pottinger at Nanking in 1842 
ended his busy and eventful life in 1885, in the high sta- 
tion of Her Majesty's Minister to the Court of Peking." 

As Interpreter at Amoy, Foochow, Shanghai, 
and Canton, Parkes showed " ability, tact, and 
ready fluency in the language." He early be- 
came convinced that " all mandarins are like 
eels," and that the only way of dealing with 
these delusive officials was by means of " firm 
persistence." In 1855, as Secretary to Sir John 
Bowring, who was sent to Bangkok to nego- 
tiate a treaty with the King of Siam, he was 
entrusted with the duty of carrying home the 
documents for the Queen's ratification. When 
he returned to China, he was made Acting 
Consul at Canton ; and afterwards, when that 
city was captured by the British, he, facile 
princeps of a commission of three, was " prac- 
tically Governor" of the place. In 1860, as 
an interpreter for Lord Elgin, he accompanied 
that commander on the march to Peking. In 
this duty whether in dealing with the Chinese 
coolies, or in capturing "almost single-handed " 
the Peh-tang fort, or in negotiating with the 



1894.]

wily and slippery officials, he displayed his 
characteristic energy, courage, and cleverness. 
But even Harry Parkes was once duped by 
horrible treachery. In a pretended negotiation 
for peace, he and a few companions, though 
under the protection of a flag of truce, were 
seized and conducted in triumph to Peking. 
Cruel treatment in prison for twenty-one days 
seemed only the prelude of certain death. The 
order for their execution was actually issued by 
the Chinese Emperor ; but a friendly manda- 
rin " succeeded in getting the captives out of 
Peking by order of the Prince of Kung [Peace 
Commissioner] barely a quarter of an hour 
before the Emperor's messenger arrived." Six- 
teen days after the release, a British Embassy 
for the first time took up its quarters in the 
city of Peking. 

In 1862 Parkes attained the unique distinc- 
tion of being made a K.C.B. at the early age 
of thirty-four ; and in 1865 he was appointed 
Minister to Japan. His career in Japan ex- 
tended over eighteen years (1865-1883), and 
covered the " Eestoration," or " Eevolution," 
of 1868, with its subsequent marvellous trans- 
formations in social and political affairs. One 
writer has said that " the history of Sir Harry's 
career in Japan was the history of Japan." 
His policy in this country, as well as in China, 
has been the cause of much criticism, both fav- 
orable and unfavorable, which, to a great ex- 
tent, has been tinged by national predilections 
and rivalries. His biographer speaks of the 
Yedo Court as " terrorized by the American 
envoy, Townsend Harris, into compliance with 
his demands," and adds : " It is not too much 
to say that to Harris's ill-advised and selfish 
policy were due many of the troubles that at- 
tended the emergence of Japan from her long 
isolation." Americans, on the other hand, de- 
fending with spirit their own representatives, 
have been unsparing in their denunciations of 
the " British, brutish," domineering policy self- 
ishly employed against Japan, China, and other 
Asiatic nations. An Englishman, Professor 
Basil Hall Chamberlain, writes : 

" Sir Harry was always a stanch supporter of his 
country's commercial interests, and a believer in the 
' gun-boat policy ' of his master, Lord Palmerston. His 
outspoken threats and occasional fits of passion earned 
for him the dread and dislike of the Japanese during 
his sojourn in Japan. But no sooner had he quitted 
Tokyo than they began to acknowledge that his high- 
handed policy had been founded in reason." 

A high Japanese official once remarked : " Sir 
Harry Parkes was the only foreigner in Japan 
whom we could not twist round our little finger." 



And the Rev. William Elliot Griffis, D.D., in 
" The Mikado's Empire," gives this apprecia- 
tive American judgment : 

" It was the English Minister, Sir Harry Parkes, who 
first risked his life to find the truth; stripped the Sho- 
gun of his fictitious title of ' Majesty ' ; asked for at 
home, obtained, and presented credentials to the Mi- 
kado, the Sovereign of Japan; recognized the new Na- 
tional Government, and thus laid the foundation of true 
diplomacy in Japan." 

But it is at least certain that, however much 
Sir Harry may have accomplished in obtaining 
the imperial signature to the treaties, and in 
assisting indirectly and recognizing the unifi- 
cation of the government, he and subsequent 
British Ministers to Japan have doggedly pre- 
vented the revision of those same treaties, 
which still hold Japan, in spite of her forty 
years of wonderful progress, in an unreasona- 
ble thraldom. 

In 1883 "the great British Minister in Ja- 
pan " received promotion to the position of 
Minister to China, and returned to the scene 
of his early achievements. In Peking, into 
which he had once been carried prisoner in a 
cart, and where he had languished in the com- 
mon jail, he was received with honor at the 
Imperial Court. The principal event of his 
term in this office was the negotiation of a 
treaty with Korea, to which country also he 
became Minister. The new positions entailed 
unceasing routine labor, not only for the sub- 
ordinates, but also for the chief, who, though 
he had often accused himself of " indolence " 
and " apathy," was a hard worker, always 
''opera inter talia primus " Early in 1885 a 
fever seized him ; and in April of that year 
death came, less from fever than from over- 
work, to the distinguished diplomat whose en- 
tire service had been in the Orient. He has 
since been honored with a marble bust in St. 
Paul's Cathedral, London, and in Shanghai 
with a marble statue, " the first public statue 
in the metropolis of European China." 

Apart from the biographical interest, the 
great value of these two volumes, and espe- 
cially of that part relating to Japan, is in the 
search-lights thrown upon contemporaneous his- 
tory in the Orient. In fact, the private cor- 
respondence of Sir Harry during his life in 
Japan was so scanty that Mr. Dickins was 
compelled to be less biographical than histor- 
ical, and to give the results of his own obser- 
vations and studies. We may not yet be ready 
to accept all his inferences ; but we are forced, 
by the vigor of his arguments, to give careful

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



consideration to the disputed points. It rather 
startles us, for instance, to read this icono- 
clastic statement : 

" The so-called Restoration of 1868 has been com- 
pletely misunderstood by most recent writers on Japan ; 
it was no Restoration, but a Revolution, that gave the 
Mikado a power he had never previously possessed." 

And, in connection with the ante-Revolution 
outbreaks, or " Revolutionary Preludes," as 
Dr. Murray aptly calls them in " The Story of 
Japan," Mr. Dickins upholds a theory which 
investigation tends more and more to establish : 
that " there never was any intelligent opposi- 
tion to foreign intercourse on the part of the 
Japanese "; and that the joi, or anti-foreign, 
spirit of Satsuma, Choshiu, Tosa, and even 
Mito, was only a popular slogan with which to 
stir up the clans in hostility against the Sho- 
gun. It is a curious coincidence that at the 
present time a similar spirit of hostility to for- 
eigners is revived by the radical opposition to 
the Government. Thus " history repeats it- 
self," even in Japan. And while the present 
seems a critical period in the history of that 
country, and constitutional government and 
representative institutions are there undergoing 
a severe test, there is occasion not merely for 
anxiety, but also for hope. As Mr. Dickins has 
well expressed it, " There is a silent strength 
underlying the sound and fury of Japanese pol- 
itics which will enable the country to weather 
much worse storms than any that threaten it." 
It may be confidently predicted that during 
the coming years Japan will continue in a rapid 
course of progress, and that the twentieth cen- 
tury will see yet more wonderful transforma- 
tions and developments in civilization than 
those watched with great interest by Sir Harry 
Parkes. ERNEST WILSON CLEMENT. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



Town Life in The attempt of a brave woman to 
the fifteenth carry on worthily any great work 

entrusted to her by her husband when 
he lays it down at death's inexorable summons can 
hardly fail to command our respectful sympathy 
and interest. Still more should this be the case 
when the woman is the widow of such a man as 
the late John Richard Green, and the great work 
is a study of life in the English towns of the fif- 
teenth century. When the possibility of such a 
thing as American cities was not so much as dreamt 
of, and while the English royalty and nobility were 
exterminating each other in the Wars of the Roses, 
the commoners of the English towns were learn- 



ing lessons of self-government, and engaging for 
the sake of commercial and municipal liberties in 
obscure and tedious struggles, which, though hith- 
erto overlooked by historians, are far more impor- 
tant factors in the growth of the nation than the 
tragic fate of the houses of York and Lancaster. 
In the first volume of " Town Life in the Fifteenth 
Century" (Macmillan), Mrs. Green treats of the 
industrial and commercial revolutions of the fif- 
teenth century, of the townspeople and their com- 
mon life, and of their struggles with the king, the 
feudal lord, or the church, for enfranchisement and 
for independent government. In her second vol- 
ume, the author treats of subjects more abstruse and 
more open to discussion, such as the relation of in- 
ternal traffic to free trade and protection, the gen- 
eral organization of labor, the position of the guild 
towards the hired worker, the attitude of the mu- 
nicipality to the industrial system, and of the cap- 
italist to the town councillor. Mrs. Green thinks 
she has found an explanation for the position of the 
" communitas " side by side with the " cives," and 
rejects the theory of an early triumph and rapid 
decay of democratic government, while she attrib- 
utes great importance to the growth of the common 
council. Even if one does not agree with the au- 
thor's conclusions, or even accept all of her data as 
unimpeachable, one must acknowledge that her ar- 
duous labors in a comparatively new field have not 
been in vain, and that her book will incite the se- 
rious student of municipal history to new efforts in 
the search for truth. Perhaps there never was a 
time when it was so important for Americans to 
make a thorough study of all the problems of mu- 
nicipal government and of all the various solutions 
that have been proposed. 

Pleasing The perusal of Florence A. Merriam's 

pictures of a " My Summer in a Mormon Village " 

Mormon village. (Houghton) leads to the conclusion 
that the advantages of Utah as a summer resort 
(and not in a matrimonial way only) are yet unap- 
preciated. Miss Merriam assures us that the cli- 
mate, which is that of the dry elevated region be- 
tween the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada known 
as " The Great Basin," is unsurpassed. Utah and 
Arizona, having this basin climate, are, she thinks, 
the natural sanitariums of the continent, far excel- 
ling the Adirondacks, Florida, and California, in 
elevation, dry ness, and recuperative effect. Cer- 
tainly it would be hard to picture anything pleas- 
anter than Miss Merriam's particular " Mormon 
village," a typical one, it seems, belonging to a line 
of closely connected settlements in the valley be- 
tween the Wasatch and the Great Lake. Hilly 
streets bordered with fragrant locusts under which 
run mountain brooks (in lieu of prosaic gutters), 
cool low stone houses set well back in shrubby yards, 
vine-clad piazzas, delightful old overgrown orchards 
with their shady lanes and slow-ripening fruit, form 
an ensemble charming to the fancy these sweltering 
days. One is not surprised to learn that " children

were everywhere," and that each house, the hum- 
blest, had its baby. One local patriarch, an ex- 
bishop boasted no less than sixty-three of these 
little olive branches. The author was gratified one 
day by a sight of this notable anti-Malthusian as he 
stood in the garden, gravely wagging his gray beard 
in the shrubbery, and looking, we should fancy, un- 
commonly like an elderly Satyr. Altogether Miss 
Merriam's picture of the Latter-Day Saints is more 
favorable than that usually drawn ; and she seems to 
have seen nothing of the woe-begone men, listless 
bedraggled women, and squalid children, described 
by most pilgrims to Mormondom. The book is 
brightly written, with plenty of local color and char- 
acter sketching, and with some discussion of the 
doctrine and present practice of the " Saints." 
There is a pretty frontispiece illustration. 



Literary 
and Social 
Silhouettes. 



Mr. H. H. Boyesen's " Literary and 
Social Silhouettes " (Harper) are 
brief essays, which, to the number 
of a dozen or more, fill a most companionable pocket 
volume. The social element of the book is found 
mainly in the studies of German and American 
women, and the capital paper on "Philistinism." Lit- 
erature gets more attention than society, however, 
and is illustrated by such sketches as " The Hero 
in Fiction," "America in European Literature," 
and " Some Stray Notes on Alphonse Daudet." In 
" My Lost Self " we have an account of the im- 
pressions of a long-exiled Norwegian upon a visit to 
his native land. Mr. Boyesen records the curious 
fact that he found himself taken for a foreigner 
by his fellow-countrymen, and that his Norwegian 
had taken upon itself an English accent. We 
are bound to speak well of the essay on "Amer- 
ican Literary Criticism," for does it not describe 
THE DIAL as " distinguished for its broad-minded 
impartiality and scholarship " ? The gentle satirical 
vein that streaks many of these papers gives them 
flavor and zest, even when it verges upon cynicism. 
The author makes mild sport of himself no less than 
of others, as appears in a few sentences devoted 
to his own novels : " I marvel, in retrospect, that 
a humane, kind-hearted man (as I believe I am) 
could have heaped up so much gratuitous misery. 
. . . A fiendish ingenuity assisted me in inventing 
distressing situations, from which there seemed no 
issue possible except death by frost or fire, or a long 
self-imposed martyrdom of sorrow and suffering." 



Jewish influence 
in American 
discovery. 



There seems to be no end of the 
changes to be rung upon the theme 
of Christopher Columbus. We had 
thought that the flood of " Columbian literature " 
had fairly subsided at last ; but it seems not. In a 
compact volume of some 200 pages, entitled " Chris- 
topher Columbus " (Longmans), Dr. M. Kayser- 
ling re-tells the story from a novel and not uninter- 
esting standpoint. The question of Jewish partici- 
pation in Columbus's discoveries has already been 
propounded, but it has never before been fully dis- 



cussed. It is to this question, primarily, that Dr. 
Kayserling devotes the present volume, basing his 
narrative upon recent exploration of Spanish ar- 
chives and libraries. He tells the story of the serv- 
ices rendered to Columbus by wealthy Jews, sketches 
the dramatic history of the Marranos or " secret 
Jews," and makes it pretty clear throughout that 
the race had a good deal to do with things maritime 
in the palmy days of the Spanish and the Portu- 
guese navies. We own that (despite the Phoenicians) 
a Jewish sailor has hitherto appeared to us in the 
light of a roc or a hippogriff the rarest kind of a 
rara avis, in fact, and almost contra naturam. 
Imagination balks at the notion of a son of Abra- 
ham bestriding a yard-arm, or having anything 
whatever to do with a ship except, indeed, in the 
way of a bottomry bond. But now comes Dr. Kay- 
serling and shows that with Columbus's armada there 
were " several men of Jewish stock," including the 
fleet-physician ; and he even offers some evidence 
that the man who first shouted " Land ho ! " (or its 
Spanish equivalent) from the deck of the " Pinta " 
was an " 'Ebrew Jew." The Doctor's narrative is 
readable, and, in its way, informing; and it is 
smoothly translated by Professor Charles Gross of 
Harvard College. The documents embodied in the 
text are printed in extenso in the Appendix, and 
form an element of considerable interest. 

Recollections Mr - J - K - Fowler's " Recollections 

of English of Old Country Life" (Longmans) 

country life. reminds one not a little of that cap- 

ital book "The Memories'of Dean Hole." The laugh 
is not quite so merry or the manner so taking as 
that of the incomparable Dean ; but the book is 
full of good stories and curious odds and ends from 
the memory of a typical English country gentleman 
" one of the olden time," we fancy. Of course 
the " sporting parson " figures pretty largely in Mr. 
Fowler's jottings. There is a good story of one 
notable shoot of this variety a rector in the north, 
whose horsemanship justly made him the dulce de- 
cits of his rough-riding Yorkshire parishioners. " His 
rectory-house," says the author, " was on a hill about 
a mile distant from the church, which was also on 
a hill, with a valley between them. The rector often 
rode to church, sometimes across country, putting 
his horse up at one of the farmers' stables near the 
church, and the parishioners assembled in the church- 
yard, waiting for his advent, would watch his pro- 
gress from the rectory with keen relish, expressing 
themselves enthusiastically as one fence after the 
other was safely negotiated. One of them would 
say, ' He 's safely over the single '; another, ' Now 
he 's at the double '; ' Yes, he 's all right '; ' What '11 
he do at the rails ? " ' He 's well over '; and the 
last thing he jumped was the churchyard wall, sav- 
ing his time by three minutes." Mr. Fowler ranges 
at random over topics social, political, sporting, and 
agricultural, and his book is informing as well as 
amusing. There are several illustrations, including 
a portrait.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



The welcome series of pamphlets issued by the Open 
Court Publishing Co., and known as the " Religion of 
Science " library, appear bi-monthly. The issue for 
July is divided into two " half-numbers," one of which 
is a new edition of M. Alfred Binet's important studies 
" On Double Consciousness," and the other a reprint of 
sundry articles from " The Open Court," upon the gen- 
eral subject of " The Nature of the State," all by Dr. 
Paul Carus, the learned editor of " The Open Court " 
and " The Monist." 

Mr. Andrew Lang touches nothing that he does not 
adorn, and his historical monograph upon " St. Andrews " 
(Longmans) gives an unexpected charm to the dusty an- 
nals of the old Scotch university town. " Very many per- 
sons yearly visit St. Andrews," the author observes, and 
some of these, he adds, " may care to know more of 
that venerable town than can be learned from assiduous 
application to golf." Mr. Lang himself shows unex- 
pected and praiseworthy restraint in putting next to 
nothing about golf into these pages. The town of Wal- 
lace and Bruce and the Black Douglas is certainly not 
devoid of picturesque and romantic interest, and Mr. 
Lang's account, enforced by Mr. T. Hodge's tasteful 
pictures, is likely to make the future annual influx of 
summer visitors larger than ever. 

Mr. Herbert Spencer has just published " A System 
of Lucid Shorthand " (Apple ton), devised fifty years ago 
by his father, William George Spencer, and left in man- 
uscript up to the present time. The present publica- 
tion results, Mr. Spencer tells us, " from the conviction, 
long since formed and still unshaken, that the Lucid 
Shorthand ought to replace ordinary writing." He 
claims for it great brevity, and greater legibility than 
belongs to ordinary longhand. The book is a very thin 
one, and the system correspondingly simple. It ought 
not to take long for anyone to master the system suf- 
ficiently to determine whether he is likely to find it 
practically useful. 

" The Study of the Biology of Ferns by the Collodion 
Method " (Macmillan), by Mr. George F. Atkinson, is 
a text-book for advanced students of biology, beauti- 
fully printed, and illustrated from original drawings. 
Mr. F. O. Bowers's " Practical Botany for Beginners " 
(Macmillan) is also a laboratory manual for students, de- 
scribing a variety of typical plant-forms, and packed with 
practical instructions. The " Introduction to Elementary 
Practical Biology" (Harper) of Mr. Charles Wright 
Dodge is designed for high-school and college students, 
is a larger book than either of the preceding, and in- 
cludes both plant and animal types. We ought also to 
mention in this connection Mr. Charles H. Clark's ad- 
mirable treatise on " Practical Methods in Microscopy " 
(Heath). The multiplication of such text-books as these 
marks a highly significant advance in our methods of 
science teaching. 

Two more volumes ( making seven in all ) of the 
"Temple" Shakespeare have been published (Mac- 
millan). " Love's Labour's Lost " has for its frontispiece 
a pretty etching of Anne Hathaway's cottage, while 
" Much Ado about Nothing " gives us a similar view of 
Trinity Church at Stratford. Mr. Israel Gollancz sup- 
plies the critical apparatus, as usual, and takes good 
heed not to make it in the slightest degree formidable. 
For a play-a- volume edition, this one comes very close 
to perfection. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, August 12, 1894. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. will publish in about three 
weeks " A New and Complete Concordance, or Verbal 
Index, to Words, Phrases, and Passages in the Dra- 
matic Works of Shakespeare, with a Supplementary 
Concordance to the Poems," by John Bartlett, A.M., 
Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
It is difficult to express the imposing character of this 
work in a few words, more especially in view of its hav- 
ing been accomplished by one person. The Concord- 
ance is a large quarto volume, containing almost two 
thousand pages, closely though plainly set in small type. 
As an exhibition of patient industry and scholarship it 
probably has not been exceeded in this country. Mr. 
John Bartlett is of course known the world over by his 
" Familiar Quotations," of which the ninth revised edi- 
tion, representing many thousands of copies sold, was 
published in 1891. There has been no figure more fa- 
miliar than his in Cambridge, Mass., for half a century. 
He was born in Plymouth in 1820, removing to Cam- 
bridge and entering the publishing business about 1836. 
He succeeded to the management of his firm in 1849, 
and held this position for ten years. Mr. Bartlett 
served in the U. S. Navy during the Civil War, and 
afterwards became connected with the firm of Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co., reaching the senior partnership 
in 1878. He took up his work on the Concordance 
shortly after the publication of the " Globe " edition of 
Shakespeare in 1875, the first cheap complete edition 
of the dramatist. He has steadily worked on it during 
most of the daylight hours ever since. The appearance 
of the revised edition of the "Globe" Shakespeare, still 
published by Messrs. Macmillan, in 1891, necessitated 
a certain amount of additional work. This was finished, 
and the Concordance is now ready to be placed upon 
the market. It will be sold regularly through the book- 
sellers, these publishers not being engaged in the sub- 
scription business, and not, I understand, believing in 
that method of sale. Mr. Bartlett says in his Introduc- 
tion: "Apart from the merit of presenting the latest 
and most approved text, now the standard with scholars 
and critics, the plan of this Concordance to the Dra- 
matic Works of Shakespeare is more comprehensive than 
that of any which has preceded it, in that it aims to 
give passages of some length for the most part inde- 
pendent of the context." The work, he adds, is made 
more nearly complete by the inclusion of select exam- 
ples of certain auxiliary verbs, of various adjectives in 
common use, and of pronouns, prepositions, interjections, 
and conjunctions. 

The first volume of Mr. John Codman Ropes's " Story 
of the Civil War " is now passing through the Knicker- 
bocker Press, and will be published at the end of Sep- 
tember by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. This work 
will deal less with accounts of battles and sensational 
episodes generally than has been the case with some of 
its predecessors, and will treat of the conflict in a more 
critical and judicial spirit than has been usual. " The 
Story of the Civil War " has been in preparation for 
Messrs. Putnam's Sons for several years, and the author 
has supplied his publishers with a regularly printed vol- 
ume instead of the usual manuscript, it being his custom 
to put his work in type and have it printed, before hand- 
ing it over for publication, in order that he may see it 
in print and that absolute accuracy may be secured.

the States, during the intermission of his duties at the 
South Place Chapel, London. He is passing a month or 
two on the Massachusetts coast, and after a brief rest 
will complete his editorial labors on " The Writings of 
Thomas Paine," the third and fourth volumes of which 
will be published by Messrs. Putnam's Sons during the 
coming season. Mr. Conway will continue his discourses 
at South Place Chapel next winter, it now being twenty- 
one years since he first became connected with the or- 
ganization which meets there. 

That band of young Arcadians, the Rhymers' Club 
of London, to whom several references have been made 
in this correspondence, has just published through Messrs. 
Elkins & Lane, of London, and Messrs. Dodd, Mead & 
Co. of New York, " The Second Book of the Rhymers' 
Club." I have never seen the first book of the Rhymers' 
Club, if such there be. The present volume is composed 
of poems presumably written for the meetings of the 
Club. They are signed by Messrs. Ernest Dowson, Ed- 
win J. Ellis, G. A. Greene, Arthur Cecil Hillier, Lionel 
Johnson, Richard LeGallienne, Victor Plarr, Ernest 
Radford, Ernest Rhys, T. W. Rolleston, Arthur Sy- 
inons, John Todhunter, and W. B. Yeats, who make up 
this company of troubadors. The names of Richard 
LeGallienne, W. B. Yeats, and Ernest Rhys, " Rhys 
the Rhymer," as his friends playfully call him, are best 
known to American ears, but doubtless we shall know 
more of all of them ere long. 

Mr. Gilbert Parker has been contributing some inter- 
esting comments on life in the United States to the " In- 
dependent," of this city. He will revisit this country 
in the fall, being now hard at work on a new novel at 
his Harpenden home. I remember that we were dis- 
cussing present tendencies of fiction last winter, and 
that I referred to various expeditions to different parts 
of the world on the part of novelists in search of fresh 
material. The question arose as to whether the liter- 
ary results of these tours had been commensurate with 
the expectations of those who made them. Mr. Parker 
replied by saying that if a novelist goes forth for re- 
portorial purposes and writes immediately after he has 
visited a country, it seemed to him that he would write 
pretty largely as a tourist. Mr. Parker believed that 
a man could not write as well of a thing when he was 
very close to it, as when he has obtained distance and 
perspective of memory. He himself had travelled a 
great deal, but he had never kept a diary regularly, and 
he always believed that the things which were really 
worth remembering printed themselves upon the mem- 
ory and upon the eye, and that in due time they would 
come up and fall into their proper places in one's work. 
Mr. Parker did think that the most unfortunate thing 
for any author to undertake is to go " fiction-stalking." 

Now that the " Athenaeum " has declared that the 
last volume of stories by our most promising young 
writer has the " common defects in American stories of 
feebleness in motive and unsatisfactoriuess in the con- 
clusion," it would seem to be a good time to consider a 
few of the reasons for the overshadowing of our home 
novelists by the rising school of British romancers, and 
this I shall try to do in another letter.

Mr. Marion Crawford's " Saracinesca " novels have 
been translated into German under the title of " Eine

Dr. E. E. Hale is reported as saying that he once 
gave throughout the West "a lecture on sleep, with 
illustrations by the audience." 

The first volume of M. Jusserand's " Histoire Litte'r- 
aire du Peuple Anglais " has just appeared in Paris. 
Three volumes will complete the work. 

Professor F. N. Scott, of Ann Arbor, has prepared a 
circular of questions upon disputed points of English 
usage, which he will send to anyone interested in the 
subject who will take the trouble to answer the questions. 

Mr. George Meredith's new novel, "Lord Ormont 
and his Aminto," will be published in America by the 
Scribners about the middle of August. Another new 
story by Mr. Meredith, entitled " The Amazing Mar- 
riage," will be published serially in " Scribner's Maga- 
zine," beginning in an early number. 

Professor Edward Dowden is preparing two volumes 
of selections from Wordsworth for the " Athenaeum 
Press " series. A similar selection from Tennyson will 
be edited by the Rev. Henry Van Dyke. Other vol- 
umes soon to appear in this series are Carlyle's " Sartor 
Resartus," edited by Professor McMechan, and selections 
from Herrick, edited by Professor Edward E. Hale, Jr. 

New editions of standard authors seem likely to be 
a notable feature of the Fall book trade. Messrs. 
Frederick Warne & Co. will have a new edition of 
Scott's novels, the " Edinburgh " Waverley in twelve and 
twenty-five volumes 12mo; of Shakespeare, the "Lans- 
downe Handy Volume " edition, in six pocket volumes ; 
and of Pope's Homer, with Flaxman's outline illustra- 
tions. 

We have received the first two issues, dated May and 
June, of a new sixteen-page monthly entitled " Shake- 
speare," and stated to be " The Journal of the Edwin 
Booth Shakespeare League." The periodical presents 
an interesting Shakespearian miscellany, and these num- 
bers give excellent portraits of Mr. Irving and Dr. Fur- 
ness. It is very attractively printed, and decidedly de- 
serving of success. 

We have received the first fourteen numbers of " Le 
Module," a semi-monthly publication of M. H. Laurens, 
6 Rue de Tournon, Paris. Each issue of this work con- 
sists of four plates of original designs or sketches suit- 
able for working up by artists, professional or amateur. 
There is a great variety of subjects, landscapes, figure- 
pieces, monograms, subjects for china-painting, etc. The 
only text is that printed upon the covers. 

Owners and collectors of book-plates in America will 
be interested in the announcement of an exhibition of 
these plates, to be held at the rooms of the Grolier 
Club, New York, October 4-20, to which they are in- 
vited to contribute specimens. Particulars may be had 
by addressing the Secretary, Mr. Charles Dexter Allen, 
P. O. Box 925, Hartford, Conn. A work on American 
Book-plates, by Mr. Allen, with many illustrations, is 
to be published this fall by Messrs. Macmillan & Co.

acter, and will include brief reports on American, En- 
glish, Russian, Hungarian, and other foreigh literatures. 

LECONTE DE LISLE. 

Mr. Arthur Symons writes of the late Leconte de 
Lisle in these terms: "Never was a poet more actually 
or more fundamentally a scholar; and his poetry both 
gains and loses, but certainly becomes what it is, through 
this scholarship, which was not merely concerned with 
Greece and Rome, but with the East as well a scholar- 
ship not only of texts, but of the very spirit of antiquity. 
That tragic calmness which was his favorite attitude 
towards life and fate ; that haughty dissatisfaction with 
the ugliness and triviality of the present, the pettiness 
and unreason of humanity; that exclusive worship of 
immoral beauty ; that single longing after the annihilat- 
ing repose of Nirvana, was it not the all-embracing 
pessimism (if we like to call it, for convenience, by 
such a name) which is the wisdom of the East, modi- 
fied, certainly, by a temperament which had none of the 
true Eastern serenity ? In spite of his theory of im- 
passibility, Leconte de Lisle has expressed only himself, 
whether through the mouth of Cain or of Hypatia; and 
in the man, as I just knew him, I seemed to see all the 
qualities of his work; in the rigid, impressive head, the 
tenacity of the cold eyes, the ideality of the forehead, 
the singularly unsensuous lips, a certain primness, even, 
in the severity, the sarcasm, of the mouth. Passion in 
Leconte de Lisle is only an intellectual passion; emo- 
tion is never less than epical ; the self which he expresses 
through so many immobile masks is almost never a 
realizable human being, who has lived and loved. Thus 
it is, not merely that all this splendid writing, so fine 
as literature in the abstract, can never touch the multi- 
tude, but that for the critic of literature also there is 
a sense of something lacking. Never was fine work in 
verse so absolutely the negation of Milton's three re- 
quirements, that poetry should be simple, sensuous, and 
passionate." 

A PROPHET OF UNIVERSITY EXTENSION. 

We make the following extract from one of the let- 
ters of Sidney Lanier in the August issue of " The At- 
lantic Monthly." Among the many " prophetic voices " 
concerning University Extension, we know of none quite 
so clear and sure as this. 

"During my studies for the last six or eight months 
a thought which was at first vague has slowly crystal- 
lized into a purpose, of quite decisive aim. The lec- 
tures which I was invited to deliver last winter before 
a private class met with such an enthusiastic reception 
as to set me thinking very seriously of the evident de- 
light with which grown people found themselves receiv- 
ing systematic instruction in a definite study. This 
again put me upon reviewing the whole business of Lec- 
turing, which has risen to such proportions in our country, 
but which, every one must feel, has now reached its 
climax and must soon give way like all things to 
something better. The fault of the lecture system as 
at present conducted a fault which must finally prove 
fatal to it is that it is too fragmentary, and presents 
too fragmentary a mass indigesta moles of facts be- 
fore the hearers. Now if, instead of such a series as that 



of the popular Star Course (for instance) in Philadelphia, 
a scheme of lectures should be arranged which would 
amount to the systematic presentation of a given subject, 
then the audience would receive a substantial benefit, 
and would carry away some genuine possession at the 
end of the course. The subject thus systematically 
presented might be either scientific (as Botany, for ex- 
ample, or Biology popularized, and the like), or domes- 
tic (as detailed in the accompanying printed extract 
under the ' Household ' School), or artistic, or literary. 

" This stage of the investigation put me to thinking 
of schools for grown people. Men and women leave 
college nowadays just at the time when they are really 
prepared to study with effect. There is indeed a vague 
notion of this abroad; but it remains vague. Any in- 
telligent grown man or woman readily admits that it 
would be well indeed, many whom I have met sin- 
cerely desire to pursue some regular course of thought ; 
but there is no guidance, no organized means of any 
sort, by which people engaged in ordinary avocations 
can accomplish such an aim. 

" Here, then, seems to be, first, a universal admission 
of the usefulness of organized intellectual pursuit for 
business people; secondly, an underlying desire for it 
by many of the people themselves ; and thirdly, an ex- 
isting institution (the lecture system) which, if the idea 
were once started, would quickly adapt itself to the new 
conditions. 

" In short, the present miscellaneous lecture courses 
ought to die and be borne again as Schools for Grown 
People."

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



THE MANXMAN. 

By HALL CAINE, author of "The Deemster," "Capt'u Davy's Honeymoon," etc. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50. 

After a comparatively long period of silence the author of " The Deemster " and " The Scapegoat " reappears hefore the 
public with a romance which is pronounced by critics his strongest work. In "The Manxman" Mr..Caine returns to the 
field in which he won his first success. To this novel he has devoted the best powers of his active brain, and it embodies 
the most vivid pictures which his splendid imagination had drawn. It is a romance which seizes upon and enthralls the 
reader by its tremendous power, intense vitality, and succession of dramatic effects. In a time when so much fiction is written 
with the finger-tip in dilettante fashion, it is like a sudden awakening to meet with a romance so deep in its analysis, so intense 
in feeling, and so irresistible in its hold upon the reader's imagination and intellect. Mr. Caine himself is understood to 
regard "The Manxman " as his strongest work, and the great success of his other books promises a remarkable career for this. 

MRS. LIMBER'S RAFFLE; 

OR, A CHURCH FAIR AND ITS VICTIMS. By WILLIAM ALLEN BUTLER. New edition. 12mo. Cloth, 75 cents. 
This brilliant little satire, by the author of "Nothing to Wear," is to appear now under his name, in a revised and 
enlarged form. 

ABANDONING AN ADOPTED FARM. 

By KATE SANBORN, author of " Adopting an Abandoned Farm," " A Truthful Woman in Southern California," etc. 

12mo. Cloth, 75 cents. 

As a promoter of good spirits, a contributor to the gayety of nations, Miss Kate Sanborn has gained a most enviable 
place among the writers of the day. Everybody laughed over her " Adoption " of her farm. Her *' Abandonment " is, if 
possible, more vivacious and entertaining, and in view of the large sales of her former book, the new story of her extraordinary 
visitors, her agricultural misadventures, and the reasons for her flitting, seems certain to prove one of the most popular books 
of the season. 

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF HERBERT SPENCER 

With a Biographical Sketch. By WILLIAM HENRY HUDSON, Associate Professor of English 

Literature in the Stanford University. 12mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

" My object is a very unambitious one. I do not propose to trace over the arguments or summarize the conclusions of the Spencerian phil- 
osophy. Still less do I feel called upon to enter into any discussion of its more debatable aspects. Nor, beyond all things, is it my intention to 
offer a substitute for the Synthetic System itself. Those who would really understand Mr. Spencer's ideas must themselves go to his writings. 
But experience on the platform and in private conversation has shown me that something may be done to smooth the way for untrained feet. . . . 
If the Introduction serves to bring others under the more immediate influence of a teacher to whom my own personal debt is so great, its exist- 
ence will be amply justified." from the Preface. 

ESSAYS, BIOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL. 

By THOMAS H. HUXLEY. The eighth volume of the author's Collected Essays. 12mo. Cloth, $1.25. 

CONTENTS : A Piece of Chalk. The Problems of the Deep Sea. Some Results of the Expedition of H. M. S. " Challenger." 
Yeast. The Formation of Coal. The Border Territory between the Animal and the Vegetable Kingdoms. A Lobster, or 
the Study of Zoology. Biogenesis and Abiogenesis. Geological Contemporaneity and Persistent Types of Life. Geological 
Reform. Palaeontology and the Doctrine of Evolution. 

GENERAL LEE. 

By General FITZHUGH LEE. A new volume in the Great Commanders Series, edited by General JAMES GRANT 

WILSON. With Portrait and Maps. 12mo. Cloth, gilt top, $1.50. 

Here is a popular biography of the great soldier which offers an intimate picture of every side of his life. It is written 
by his nephew and cavalry commander, a member of his family, who therefore knew him as no outsider could, and a soldier 
who served under him, understood his strategical conduct of his army, and aided in executing many of his plans. As a mili- 
tary and personal biography nothing equal to this has been written. These peculiar qualifications and the convenient size of 
the book give it, as the publishers believe, an unexcelled rank among the biographies of this class.

THE FREEDOM OF TEACHING. 

The trial for heresy has become of late years 
so common an incident in theological circles 
that a new case, unless marked by distinctive 
features of a sensational character, would now 
attract little or no attention outside of the 
church organization directly concerned. We 
have also been provided with the amusing spec- 
tacle, particularly in the South, of professors 
in sectarian institutions of learning brought to 
book for their failure to teach an astronomy 
or a geology or a biology in accordance with 
certain theological tenets based upon a strictly 
literal interpretation of the Scriptures. But it 
has been reserved for the University of Wis- 
consin to offer the first example, to our knowl- 
edge, of a trial for heresy in which theology 
has no part. To hale a public teacher of science 
before an investigating committee, for the pur- 
pose of examining his opinions and pronounc- 
ing upon their orthodoxy from a purely scien- 
tific standpoint, is a procedure so novel, and, 
we may add, so startling, that one may well 
pause to consider its significance, and the pos- 
sible consequences of an extension of the prin- 
ciple thus involved. 

Before discussing the subject, it may be well 
to recapitulate the facts. Some weeks ago, the 
Wisconsin State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction, Mr. Wells, published in a New York 
journal a communication upon the subject of 
Professor Ely, Director of the School of Eco- 
nomics at the University of Wisconsin. This 
communication, which was headed " The Col- 
lege Anarchist," charged Professor Ely with 
the justification of strikes and the practice of 
boycotts. He was reported to have entertained 
and consulted with a walking-delegate, abetted 
a strike in a printing-office at Madison, threat- 
ened to withdraw his custom unless it were 
made a union office, and to have said in con- 
versation that union men should be employed 
in preference to non-union men, that only cranks 
had conscientious scruples against joining un- 
ions. His books, assumed to represent his teach- 
ings, were described as containing " utopian, 
impracticable, [and] pernicious doctrines," and 
as furnishing " a seeming moral justification of 
attacks upon life and property."

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



Allowing for the obvious animus of this com- 
munication, the charges made do not seem to 
have been very formidable. To entertain a 
walking-delegate may be questionable as a mat- 
ter of taste, but hardly comes in the category 
of heinous social offences. And we do not 
know that a man is to be condemned outright 
for wishing to have his printing done in a union 
office. As for the other charges, it may be said 
that there are strikes and strikes, that second- 
hand reports of conversation are vague and 
readily colorable, and that the perniciousness 
of Professor Ely's doctrines, which, as Mr. 
Wells himself admits, " only the careful stu- 
dent will discover," is obviously not to be made 
the subject of an off-hand pronouncement. But 
Professor Ely's accuser, by virtue of his posi- 
tion at the head of the State Department of 
Public Instruction, making him ex officio a mem- 
ber of the Board of Eegents of the State Uni- 
versity, could not well be ignored ; and, in 
consequence of his charges, a committee of in- 
vestigation was appointed, before which Pro- 
fessor Ely and his accuser were summoned. 
The " trial " was set for the twentieth of Au- 
gust. As a preliminary, the committee had 
laid down the general principle that the inves- 
tigation should not go outside the personal 
charges made against Professor Ely, and his 
actual teachings as an instructor in the Uni- 
versity. When the committee met for its in- 
vestigation, Superintendent Wells failed to 
appear, but was represented by a lengthy com- 
munication, of which the substance was that 
his opinion of Professor Ely's teachings was 
based mainly upon Professor Ely's books, and 
that to rule those books out of the investiga- 
tion was to deprive the accuser of the only 
available means of substantiating his charges, 
as far as these related to the university teach- 
ing of the Professor of Economics. In the 
meanwhile, Professor Ely had made public de- 
nial of the personal charges, accompanying the 
denial with this stinging comment : " The man 
who makes these charges against me is well 
known to his neighbors as a politician of the 
meaner sort, who, too small to appreciate the 
most important trust ever committed to him, 
betrayed it in his insensate love of notoriety." 
This denial Professor Ely repeated before the 
committee ; and Superintendent Wells, in an- 
other communication, admitted that he was 
unable to produce evidence in support of the 
charges reflecting upon Professor Ely's char- 
acter as a citizen. With this episode, and some 
further elaboration of the controversial amen- 



ities already illustrated, the proceedings prac- 
tically collapsed ; and at last accounts Super- 
intendent Wells was studying Professor Ely's 
books for the purpose of making out his case 
on the score of economic heterodoxy. 

Since trials for heresy are almost the order 
of the day, it was perhaps hardly natural to 
expect that they would remain confined to the 
domain of theology. If they are to seek other 
territories and other victims, there is no doubt 
that political science offers a promising field 
for the heresy-hunter. The irritant quality of 
political discussion is well known, and its ca- 
pacity for inflaming the passions is hardly ex- 
ceeded by that of theological controversy itself. 
Political or economic principles are often at- 
tacked and defended in a spirit of partisan bit- 
terness which might prove instructive to the 
polemics of Catholicism and Protestantism, and 
from which Arians and Athanasians might have 
taken useful hints. Hence we are not surprised 
that a professor of political science should at 
last have been brought to book in the good old 
theological fashion, although it is of course 
deeply to be regretted that any field of science 
should suffer invasion from the spirit of intol- 
erance, that any attempt should be made to im- 
pose opinions upon men whose only aim in life 
is to form rational opinions of their own and 
to help others in the hard struggle for truth. 

We are not particularly concerned to defend 
Professor Ely's economic views. There is not 
a little justice in the charge that his books are 
" innocent of clear-cut thought." He is a fa- 
cile writer, and an exceptionally diffuse one. 
His phraseology is often vague and bewilder- 
ing, if not actually misleading. In reading 
his books, one gets the impression that the most 
permanent facts of political science have some- 
how gone into solution, and that there is little 
prospect of a new crystallization. These char- 
acteristics are shared with many other writers 
of the so-called " new school " of economics, 
but they are unusually prominent in Professor 
Ely's writings. Nor do we doubt that his doc- 
trines have a general socialistic trend, however 
ingeniously he may narrow the definition of 
socialism for the purpose of escaping its stigma, 
or urge that there are far more radical socialists 
than himself. We do not believe that true so- 
cial progress is always to be sought along the 
lines that he suggests, or that the principles 
of " orthodox " economic science are by any 
means as badly discredited as he insinuates. 

But all this is beside the real question at is- 
sue. That question is nothing less than whether

university teaching shall be fettered or free. 
The great principle of Lehrfreiheit is involved 
in this episode of the trial of Professor Ely, 
and no one who has Yi realizing sense of the vast 
importance of defending that principle from 
attack can take long in judging of this partic- 
ular case. We do not hesitate to characterize 
as an outrage the arraignment of Professor 
Ely before a committee charged with investi- 
gating the soundness of his scientific teaching. 
It is an indignity which he is justified in resent- 
ing, and which every teacher in the United 
States should resent with him. He was ap- 
pointed to his present position on account of 
his scholarly reputation. That reputation has 
not sensibly altered in quality during his pres- 
ent incumbency, while it has noticeably grown 
with his widened opportunities. Those respon- 
sible for his appointment presumably had their 
eyes open, and knew what his reputation was. 
The position of a teacher of Professor Ely's 
experience should be practically unassailable, 
and he should be absolutely free to do his own 
work in his own way. The time for examina- 
tion and investigation is before appointments 
are made, or during what may be called the 
years of apprenticeship, the first two or three 
years of work, in which a man and those re- 
sponsible for him find out whether he has hit 
his vocation or missed it. That the beginner 
should be appointed from year to year, and upon 
probation, is both natural and necessary ; that 
the man who has once won his professional 
spurs should be subject to any such chances is 
monstrous. Only for some offence of the gross- 
est sort, only for something far more serious 
than the worst that has ever been alleged 
against Professor Ely, would any board of ed- 
ucational trustees be justified in questioning 
the tenure of a duly appointed teacher of expe- 
rience and reputation. 

For what is the alternative, the fatal ad- 
mission once made that teaching is to be con- 
trolled by boards of regents and superintend- 
ents of education ? There is but one possible 
answer to this question. Official history, offi- 
cial science, and official philosophy will take 
the place of a teaching based upon untram- 
melled research and the unbiased pursuit of 
truth. Such a course can only spell inefficiency, 
hypocrisy, stagnation. " Der Wahrheit ist die 
Atmosphare der Freiheit unentbehrlich," says 
Schopenhauer in his vigorous onslaught upon 
the official philosophy prevalent among the Ger- 
man universities in his time. Peculiarly in our 
own country, with a democracy that has not 



yet learned the natural limitations of all de- 
mocracies, that still childishly assumes the 
voice of the people to be the voice of God even 
in matters only to be judged of by the trained 
intellect, is such a warning needed. The au- 
thorities of the University of Wisconsin, how- 
ever excellent their intentions, and however 
worthy their official zeal, have set, in this trial 
of a public teacher of science, an example of 
the most unfortunate character, an example 
only too likely to be followed elsewhere, and 
which, in assailing the principle of Lehrfrei- 
heit, assails intellectual advancement itself in 
one of its most fundamental conditions. 



ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY 
OF NEBRASKA* 

The study of English as rhetoric and composition, 
and as English literature and philology, is com- 
pletely differentiated in the University of Nebraska. 
Writing is taught on the theory that constant tech- 
nical practice is necessary, but practice in the de- 
velopment and adjustment of meaning in the mind 
as well as in appropriate and effective statement. 
In other words, not facility with the media, of ex- 
pression, not automatism in phrasing merely, but 
organic, completed communication, in both matter 
and manner, is the aim of the study. As contribu- 
tive to this end, work in oral composition or public 
speaking not required, but elected very generally 
by the students at some period in their course is 
arranged for and emphasized by the department 
head. Of thirteen hundred students in attendance 
last year, almost the entire number, excepting spe- 
cials, and including nearly eight hundred young men 
and women in college courses, were under rhetorical 
instruction of some kind. One professor, two instruct- 
ors, and one assistant are exclusively responsible for 
this work. As a division of the general subject and 
of university instruction, this department is known

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



as the Department of English. The Department of 
English Literature, on the other hand, confines itself 
to instruction in literature proper, including both the 
earlier as well as the latest forms of development, 
with recognition of linguistic relations and differ- 
ences between. The work begins in the second year 
of residence, with Anglo-Saxon and Early English. 
In this study there are four exercises a week through- 
out the year. The class is drilled daily from the 
start in writing forms, until, after reading fifteen 
or twenty pages of prose, and practically mastering 
the verb-groups and inflections, it is ready to begin 
poetry. The most imaginative parts of the " Genesis " 
and the " Exodus " are then used as an introduction, 
and by the middle of December " Bedwulf " is begun. 
This poem is studied almost wholly as literature, and 
by the end of March has been read to the extent of 
2000 lines or over. By making the study literary 
and not philologic, there is no difficulty in keeping 
up the enthusiasm of the class, and for three years 
only one student has been dropped from the roll on 
account of inability to carry the work. From April 
to the end of the year the class reads Middle En- 
glish, generally in Morris's " Specimens," with 
such illustration and appropriation of historical prin- 
ciples as can be gained by two months' companion 
study of Lounsbury 's " History." By this year's work 
the student gets a general idea of the development 
of the literature and language to Chaucer, as also 
a clear appreciation of the fundamental forms and 
modes of sentiment in Teutonic poetry. 

The study of Anglo-Saxon and Early English is 
prescribed in but two of the eight groups of under- 
graduate work. It is followed by a general survey 
of English literary development from Chaucer to 
Tennyson, three exercises a week through two sem- 
esters. This subject is taken by nearly all the stu- 
dents at some point in the course, being required in 
six out of the eight groups. Here students from 
the Anglo-Saxon studies of the year preceding, as 
also from the classical and the philosophical courses, 
are put at work along with men from the industrial 
sections, from the scientific, the agricultural, and 
the electrical engineering groups of study. Of the 
hundred and twenty members of a given class thus 
made up, more than two-thirds are without literary 
traditions or taste or training, or interest in pure 
literature of any sort. The theory of the work done 
with this class is simply that students in college 
have generally not yet taste for the best literature, 
or prepared capacity to appropriate its aesthetic 
meaning, but must have both aroused or enabled 
in them at the outset. To do this a month is de- 
voted to inductive exercises in discriminating poetic 
or emotional terms and phrases from prosaic, and 
in interpreting metres, figures, and force. It is 
steadfastly believed that the study of literature as 
literature is impossible to minds insensible to the 
inner differences between prose and poetry, and 
blank to aesthetic challenge or suggestion. More- 
over, experience with the work has not proved the 
existence of minds so blank or insensible as not 



to yield, along with others of better traditions or 
training, to the influence of such first culture, or 
less completely and readily than they. Students 
from the so-called classical or literary groups do 
not prove superior, either in aptness or preparation, 
after the opening and quickening of the sensibili- 
ties, to those from the technical courses of study. 
Last year a University Browning Club, conceived 
and planned wholly from among pupils under in- 
struction, was organized and put in operation upon 
a permanent basis. But the young men and wo- 
men projecting it and having it in charge were from 
the scientific rather than the literary side of the class 
in question. Indeed, the success of all later courses in 
the department is found to be largely dependent upon 
the interest aroused in the first month's study. The 
attention of teachers yet troubled about getting their 
classes interested in literature is invited to the re- 
sults from this manner of opening the year. It must 
not be imagined that the work here done has been 
in any way the result of expert teaching, for the 
tutor in charge is but a recent graduate, not yet 
strong in handling college classes. It is demon- 
strated that, with perfected instruction, out of a 
hundred average students fit to carry work above 
secondary grades, practically and positively a full 
hundred appreciative and even enthusiastic readers 
of best literature may be made. When a class has 
learned to read literature as literature, with true 
aesthetic discernment of its spiritual quality, it will 
go forward of its own momentum. When it is all 
agog, even to the last member, over " Lycidas " or the 
" Adonais," teaching becomes merely guidance, sug- 
gestion, is no longer dogmatic exposition or author- 
ity. It is neither just nor necessary to allow col- 
lege credit for reading vernacular masterpieces, just 
as for Sophocles or Terence, even should consider- 
able attention be given to the notes. The mere 
reading should be taken for granted, as also, 
when enabled and attained, the higher experiences 
from the reading. Credit should not be entered 
upon the books of a college for such higher expe- 
riences, but only for knowledge gained or culture 
won at first hand. But on the strength of interest 
aroused beforehand the college pupil may be led to 
do work that will make him a life-long interpreter 
of aesthetic literature, or at least save him from 
skepticism concerning its pretensions. 

The work of this general survey, when fairly 
begun, consists in class study of Chaucer, Spenser, 
Milton, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Browning. There 
is accompanying study of biographies and general 
literary history, including evolution of new princi- 
ples, with systematic library readings, and prepara- 
tion of notes, in a hundred representative authors. 
No further work in this department is prescribed. 
There are elective courses in advanced Anglo-Saxon 
and philology, Browning, Tennyson, in conjunc- 
tion with systematic criticism, American Litera- 
ture, Old Testament poetry, and theory of literary 
teaching. Shakespeare is made a subject by itself, 
being given in a first-year course on simple princi-

pies of everyday interpretation, in second-year work 
of a more advanced and systematic character, and 
finally in third-year seminary interpretation and re- 
search. There is also seminary work through two 
semesters in the development of literature, given last 
year in the evolution and history of character hints 
in poetry and fiction, and of certain other fundamen- 
tal modes of imagination. In all there are twenty- 
two semester courses offered by the department, 
with an enrollment last year of something over 
three hundred and fifty names. The work is car- 
ried by one professor, one tutor, and an assistant. 
The energy of the department has been largely de- 
voted for some years to the effort of securing the 
same definiteness and sureness of results in litera- 
ture for all minds as have been reached in other 
subjects. Such success as has been attained has 
been emulated among the high schools of our State, 
and to a degree worthy at least of mention here. 
Several of the accredited schools have begun, at 
their own instance, to do the preliminary work of 
the survey class, and so well as to establish their 
ability to fit for college work in literature just as 
in Greek, mathematics, and the sciences. In fact, 
they have demonstrated that the proper place to 
open the mind to the inspiration of literature is in 
the secondary schools, and not the college. Some 
fifteen teachers of English in our fifty-five accredited 
academies and high schools will do the preliminary 
work of our survey course this year, and will do it 
essentially as well as we. It is our intention to recog- 
nize the quality of the work by admitting their pu- 
pils to immediate instruction in literature, by the de- 
vice of an advanced division, upon entrance. Withal, 
the benefit of such training to those students who 
never go up to college is hardly to be estimated.

THE BRYANT CENTENARY. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

"O Master of imperial lays ! 

Crowned in the fulness of thy days ; 

One heart that owned thy gracious spell 

Thy reverend mien remembers well ; 
" For mine it was, ere fell the snow 

Upon this head of long ago, 

My modest wreath to intertwine 

With richer offerings at thy shrine. 
" A guest upon that day of days, 

How leapt my heart to hymn thy praise ! 

Yea, from that hour my spirit wore 

A high content unknown before." 

So read Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, with clear musical 
voice, from the low platform in the Bryant maple grove 
at Cummington, while the many invited guests beside 
her, and the assembled thousands in front, hung breath- 
lessly upon her words. Of all that vast company, per- 
haps five thousand in number, I do not think that more 
than one (Mr. Parke Godwin) was present on the occa- 
sion, thirty years before, to which she made this allu- 
sion in her poem. It was the Bryant Festival at the 



Century Club of New York to which she referred, held 
in honor of the poet's seventieth birthday, and at which 
George Bancroft presided as president of the club, and 
Emerson and Mrs. Howe were the principal invited 
guests. That distinguished company also included Bay- 
ard Taylor, George H. Boker, Oliver Wendell Holmes, 
Thomas Buchanan Read, Christopher P. Cranch, Rich- 
ard H. Dana, Jr., William M. Evarts, and Richard 
Henry Stoddard, all of whom read poems or made 
speeches, besides the brilliant galaxy of artists for which 
the Century Club has always been noted, among them 
Huntington, Durand, La Farge, Bierstadt, Gifford, Ken- 
sett, J. Q. A. Ward, Whittredge, Hennessy, and Brown. 
The volume containing the exercises of that occasion is 
before me as I write, and among the numerous por- 
traits shown is a photograph of Mrs. Howe in 1864. 
Time has indeed whitened her hair and deepened the 
lines of her face, but the firm, thoughtful brow and 
poetic mouth are unchanged. 

Mrs. Howe's first appearance in the morning at Cum- 
mington, and the singing of her " Battle Hymn of the 
Republic " by the company, had been the occasion of a 
spontaneous burst of applause not equalled during the 
day ; but her reading of her poem in the afternoon was 
marked by a quieter, if more intense, demonstration. 

It was somewhat by accident that the writer found 
himself among the invited guests of the Bryant Cen- 
tenary at Cummington, Mass., on August 16, held in 
honor of the one hundredth anniversary of the poet's 
birth at that place. How to describe the many events 
of the journey there and of the day itself, in one short 
letter, is somewhat puzzling. While the programme of 
exercises was carried out with complete success, and 
while the speakers were distinguished and their re- 
marks worthy of the occasion, yet it was what might 
be called the accessories of the celebration which most 
impressed one visitor. 

When I saw an announcement last spring that the 
centenary of Bryant's birth (November 3, 1794) was 
to be celebrated next November at Great Barrington, 
Berkshire county, Mass., I was somewhat surprised, for 
Bryant was born in Cummington, in Hampshire county, 
and only practiced law for a few years at Great Bar- 
rington, soon giving up the profession and leaving the 
place through disgust at being non-suited because of 
some technical neglect of a case on his part. Then last 
month the announcement was made that the day of birth 
would be anticipated for the better convenience of those 
who were to be present, and that the celebration would 
be held at Cummington. I then realized, what was 
probably the fact, that the Cummington people did not 
intend to be robbed of their town's distinction as the 
birthplace of the poet. Their committee, under the 
leadership of Wesley Guruey, Lorenzo H. Tower, and 
Mrs. Henrietta S. Nahmer, the secretary, took active 
steps to ensure a successful affair. Mr. Parke Godwin 
presided. He was introduced by Mr. Tower, who is 
librarian of the library founded by Mr. Bryant at Cum- 
mington, and who made an address to which I shall 
again refer. Mr. Godwin spoke, and was followed by 
Edwin R. Brown, of Elmwood, 111., a native of Cum- 
mington, selected for this reason and because of his per- 
sonal friendship with John Howard Bryant, only sur- 
viving brother of William Cullen, and himself a poet, 
also a resident of Elmwood. Mr. Brown delivered the 
memorial address, a scholarly production, which held 
the close attention of the audience for over an hour. 
Mr. John Howard Bryant, who carries his eighty-seven

years with a nervous yet delicate vigor, read " A Mon- 
ody " on the death of his brother. Then came the sing- 
ing of Mrs. Howe's " Battle Hymn," and an intermis- 
sion for refreshments. 

In the afternoon, besides Mrs. Howe's poem, there 
were addresses by John Bigelow, Charles Dudley War- 
ner, Charles Eliot Norton, Rev. John W. Chadwick, and 
President G. Stanley Hall of Clark University. Con- 
troller James H. Eckels was also called on for a speech, 
and Mr. John Howard Bryant recited another poem, 
" At Eighty-Seven." 

Cummington lies on the crest and at the foot of a hill 
in western Hampshire county, which is itself surrounded 
by an amphitheatre of similar hills. The nearest rail- 
way station on the east is distant some thirteen miles, 
and stations on the west and north are distant twenty 
miles. It is the centre of what are called the " hill 
towns " of Hampshire county, a region quite distinct 
from the Berkshire district made famous by the mem- 
ory of Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Miss Sedg- 
wick. To reach Cummington from any direction, you 
must go over a hill, Goshen hill on the east, from 
Northampton, where Cable lives, or Lightning Bug hill 
on the north, from Ashfield, where Curtis spent his sum- 
mers for so many years, and where Charles Eliot Nor- 
ton now has his summer abode. The Bryant houses are 
near the top of Cummington hill, the old homestead 
where the poet was brought up being two or three hun- 
dred feet below the other house, and it was near the 
homestead that the exercises were held. 

A relative of the Bryant family and myself took an 
early start on the " electric " from Northampton to the 
stage terminus, the afternoon before the celebration, 
and it was well for us that we did so. We established 
ourselves in the stage a full half-hour before the horses 
were attached, and found, to our surprise, that more 
than twice the people it would carry were waiting to 
take it as it was driven out. Most of these people were 
obliged to seek private conveyances or wait over until 
the next morning. Then followed a dreary three hours' 
pull up Goshen hill, two horses having to do the work 
of four. We arrived at Cummington in time to take 
supper and to attend a children's concert at the village 
church. There was a local orchestra of four or five 
pieces, and a chorus, both of which also took part in 
the exercises next day; and there were recitations from 
Bryant's poems and compositions by the children, all 
under the management of a tireless young lady resident. 
Looking at the children, as they were grouped in the 
front pews, I was struck by the preponderance of pure 
New England types, such a collection of which I had 
not seen in twenty years, or before familiar districts in 
New England were invaded by foreign immigration. 
So I was not surprised next day to learn from Mr. 
Tower's admirable address that " the town is still one 
of pure New England stock, and out of two hundred 
voters only three are not of American birth. ... It 
is still a farming community, as it was a hundred years 
ago, and the farmers win a scanty living from rebellious 
soil." To me, this children's concert, with its manifes- 
tation of the pure native stock, was the most interest- 
ing feature of the Bryant Centenary. 

Something of the same showing was evident next day, 
at the exercises. Many driving parties came over from 
the now fashionable towns of Berkshire, but the society 
people were practically lost in the mass of village peo- 
ple, numbers of whom had driven thirty or forty miles 
and camped out over night on the way. And such " old, 



old, old, old ladies," and men, too, as there were among 
them, with deep lines of toil and narrow living cut into 
their faces. There were fashions a great deal older 
than those of the revived 1830 type, and there were 
hats worn by some old men which no words of mine 
could describe. Squalling babies were occasionally in 
evidence, and people on the outskirts of the crowd could 
have heard but little of the speakers' remarks, although 
they stood through the proceedings with eyes glued on 
the more distinguished, and even on the less distin- 
guished, occupants of the platform. Among the former, 
in addition to the speakers, were Miss Julia S. Bryant, 
the daughter of William Cullen Bryant, and many mem- 
bers of the Bryant family, Miss Sarah Orne Jewett, and 
Mrs. Kate Upson Clark. A feature of the celebration 
was the singing of the bard-like John W. Hutchinson, 
the last of the Hutchinson family, who stirred the au- 
dience with his rendering of Mrs. Howe's hymn and 
with some of his old-time songs. 

The residents of Cummington covered themselves 
with credit in all their arrangements for the Centenary. 
The disposition of the platform and seats rising up the 
slope of a small elevation in the grove, the plain but 
bountiful collation for the two hundred guests of the 
committee, and the convenience for stabling probably 
five times the number of horses ever collected in the 
town before, were perfect in every respect. All but the 
special guests of the committee brought their provisions 
with them, and the sight of several thousand people 
picnicking in the grove was something to be remem- 
bered. After the exercises I walked along " the rivu- 
let " (the subject of Bryant's poem of that name) which 
runs by the old homestead, and down the hill to the 
monument which marks the sight of his birthplace. 
Looking about the wide amphitheatre of hills which 
stretch away on every side, in the evening glow of a 
perfect summer's day, it was not difficult to guess the 
inspiration of " Thanatopsis." ARTHUR STEDMAN. 



MRS. CELIA THAXTER. 



Mrs. Celia Thaxter died at her home at Appledore, 
Isles of Shoals, the evening of August 26, at the age 
of fifty-eight. A daughter of Thomas B. Laighton, of 
Portsmouth, she was born June 29, 1836, in that town. 
When an infant, her father became a lighthouse-keeper 
upon White Island, and there the child spent her first 
eleven years. Her family then moved to Appledore, 
where she lived for the remainder of her life. At the 
age of sixteen she married Levi Thaxter, who is de- 
scribed as " a cultivated man who preferred this quiet 
spot to the noisy world." Mrs. Thaxter's first vol- 
ume of poems appeared in 1872. It was followed 
by Driftwood " (1879), " Poems for Children " (1883), 
" The Cruise of the Mystery and Other Poems " (1886), 
and "Idyls and Pastorals " (1887). Mr. Stedman fit- 
tingly says of her verse that it gives us " the dip of the 
sea-bird's wing, the foam and tangle of ocean, varied 
interpretations of clambering sunrise mists and evening's 
fiery cloud above the main." She was peculiarly happy 
as a writer of verse for children. In prose, a pretty 
volume called " Among the Isles of Shoals " was widely 
read ; and her latest work, " An Island Garden " (re- 
viewed in THE DIAL a few months ago), has been re- 
ceived with an exceptional degree of cordiality, bestowed 
upon the text quite as much as upon Mr. Childe Has- 
sam's exquisite illustrations.

THE TRIAL OF PROFESSOR ELY. 
(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

Madison, Wis., August 25, 1894. 

The Wisconsin State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction, Mr. O. E. Wells, has done for Professor R. 
T. Ely, of the State University, a like service to that 
which Professor Patton rendered Professor Swing. 
Whatever Mr. Wells's intention may have been, the 
only result can be to intrench more strongly than ever 
the man he has attacked, while at the same time giving 
him an instant national prominence which could in the 
usual course of things come only as the long result of 
time and labor. Professor Ely has the great advantage 
of being the first sociological heretic to be brought to 
book ; the first of a long line to come if we are to be- 
lieve the charges and insinuations which have been lately 
going the rounds, that the increasing boldness of radi- 
cal socialism, and even of anarchy itself, is in a large 
measure due to encouragement in high places. He will 
have the further satisfaction of not being obliged to 
pose as a sociological martyr also; for to be a religious 
martyr is not half bad in these latter days, while to be 
suspected of favoring strikes and anarchy butters no 
professor's parsnips. 

Professor Ely has very likely felt that his affliction, 
though it endure but for a moment, is more chastening 
than providential; yet he may well congratulate him- 
self that Providence chose such a very feeble rod of 
chastisement as Mr. Wells. No man could teach and 
write so much as Professor Ely without laying himself 
open to skilful attack at some unguarded point; but Mr. 
Wells has succeeded simply in furnishing in his own per- 
son another brilliant illustration of the madness which 
goes before the destruction of the gods. 

In " The Nation " of New York, of July 12, when the 
public excitement over the railroad strike was at its 
height, there appeared a letter signed O. E. Wells, and 
bearing the somewhat startling heading " The College 
Anarchist." The letter was a column in length, but 
the gist of it is as follows: First, "that there is a sort 
of moral justification for the attack on life and prop- 
erty based on a theory which comes from the colleges, 
lecture-rooms, and latterly from the churches, and is 
supported by the teaching and practice of the Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin." Secondly, Professor Ely entertained, 
and was in frequent consultation with, a certain " walk- 
ing-delegate " during a strike which occurred in Madi- 
son in the beginning of the present year. Third, Pro- 
fessor Ely threatened to take his printing from a certain 
firm unless they employed union men. Fourth, Pro- 
fessor Ely declared that " a dirty, dissipated, unmar- 
ried, unreliable, and unskilled tramp, if a union man, 
should be employed in preference to an industrious, skil- 
ful, trustworthy, non-union man who is the head of a 
family." Fifth, " Only a careful student will discover 
the Utopian, impracticable, or pernicious doctrines [of 
Professor Ely's books], but their general acceptance will 
furnish a seeming moral justification for attacks on life 
and property such as the country is already becoming 
so familiar with." 

To the Regents of the Wisconsin State University 
all this was " mighty interesting reading," especially as 
the newspapers all over the country were soon in full 
cry. It was " important if true," and it did not take 
the Honorable Board long to appoint a committee of 
three, which should summon accuser and accused to ap- 
pear in their august presence and elucidate things. After 



two postponements, all parties concerned were finally 
gotten together in the Law Building of the University 
on the evening of August 21, each of the opposing par- 
ties being represented by a lawyer. After considerable 
preliminary sparring between the lawyers, it became 
evident that the policy of the plaintiff was one of delay 
and of readiness to back out on any decent pretext. Mr. 
Wells, having accomplished his object in spreading his 
accusations broadcast, seemed not to be greatly inter- 
ested in the investigation. The defence filed an em- 
phatic denial of each and every charge contained in the 
accusations, in order. Then appeared the weakness of 
the plaintiff's case. Although the letter begins by first 
attacking Professor Ely's teachings, then his personal 
acts, and finally his writings, the lawyer for Mr. Wells 
made every possible effort to ignore all the first part 
and confine the inquiry to the last count only; namely, 
the writings. At last they were forced to confess that 
Mr. Wells could not possibly testify anything about the 
teaching, because he had never heard a single lecture 
by Professor Ely, and had not even read the only one 
of the Professor's books which is prescribed as part of 
the university course. Thus the first and most impor- 
tant part of the attack fell flat. 

Much against the wish of the plaintiff, the charges 
referring to Professor Ely's personal acts was next , 
taken up ; and the reason of the reluctance became man- 
ifest as soon as the testimony of witnesses was taken. 
Every charge under the third and fourth counts was 
flatly contradicted, and showed conclusively that Mr. 
Wells had either carelessly or maliciously taken mere 
street gossip as a basis of his very serious public accusa- 
tions, without taking the trouble to ascertain the truth. 
The proceedings were enlivened by several sharp ver- 
bal scrimmages between the two lawyers and the com- 
mittee, to the great delight of the audience. 

At this point, and at the desire of the plaintiff, an ad- 
journment of three days was interposed to give him time 
to recover breath, and to collect all the damning ex- 
tracts which he could find in Professor Ely's works. 
Thus far the investigation had been a farce; but now 
we were promised something very serious. The second 
hearing was attended by a still larger audience, includ- 
ing many ladies; but Mr. Wells was not in it. He had 
had enough. 

Under such circumstances it would probably have oc- 
curred to a fair-minded man that a great wrong had 
been done Professor Ely, and that the least reparation 
possible was a full retraction and ample apology. But 
Mr. Wells thought otherwise. He regarded it as a fit- 
ting opportunity to send another long letter to the com- 
mittee, in which he refused to be present at the inves- 
tigation any further, on the plea of having been so 
advised by friends because of some applause that had 
occurred at the opening of the trial, and because of 
" restrictions " imposed by the committee. He reiterated 
several of his exploded charges, in the face of the fact 
that they had been disproved, and then proceeded to 
consider the main point, viz., the socialistic character of 
Professor Ely's writings. The latter part of the letter 
was therefore the total residuum of this formidable at- 
tack which had called forth so much comment from the 
press. It was chiefly an exposition of the impression 
produced by their perusal upon the mind of the reader; 
i. e., Mr. Wells's mind. He found this to be very bad. 
He endeavored to support his impressions by a few quo- 
tations, which, isolated from their connection, might 
easily assume to a willing eye the outlines of a cloven

foot. It is hardly necessary to say that almost any- 
thing could be deduced from any author by this ex- 
tremely naive method of exegesis ; but when the quota- 
tions were afterward read by the defence in their proper 
connection, the disingenuousness of the method became 
apparent. 

That was the end of Wells. The defence now had 
the easy and pleasant task of repelling his last feeble 
attacks, by quotations from Professor Ely's works, by 
the oral testimony of his former students now teachers 
in other institutions, and by many written assurances of 
high regard which had been received from prominent 
men. Against the " impressions " which Mr. Wells's 
mind received from a perusal of Professor Ely's works 
were opposed the scholarly criticisms and endorsements 
of President Adams of Wisconsin University, President 
Andrews of Brown, Professor Small of the University 
of Chicago, Dr. Shaw, editor of " Review of Reviews," 
Mr. Carroll D. Wright, Federal Commissioner, and 
others. All this cloud of witnesses, while admitting 
differences of opinion in matters of detail, united in em- 
phatically endorsing Professor Ely, and in repelling all 
insinuations that there was in his teachings, writings, 
or personal influence anything leaning toward or pro- 
vocative of anarchy in the slightest degree. On the con- 
trary, he has always deprecated strikes and boycotts as 
resulting in more harm than good to the cause of Labor. 

Finally, Professor Ely, being sworn, testified that to 
his knowledge he had never even seen the walking-dele- 
gate whom he was accused of entertaining, nor had he 
consulted with any walking-delegate whatsoever. 

The committee is to make its formal report to the 
Board of Regents, whose next meeting comes on the 
eighteenth of September; but there can be little doubt 
what that report will be. Dogberry complained, " O, 
that I had been written down an ass." Poor old Dog-

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE PROPOSED SOCIETY OF COMPARATIVE 

LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I confess I have less confidence than Professor Gay- 
ley seems to have in the study of the literature of sav- 
age tribes as affecting present canons of criticism. 
Literature, as we know it and are interested in it, is es- 
sentially a product of culture. What primarily concerns 
us is the literature of the Aryan peoples, and among 
them the literature which has been tinctured by, if it is 
not a product of, the civilizations of Greece and Rome. 
Among the latter I include the Scandinavian, and of 
course the oldest English. Among non-Aryan peoples, 
the Hebrews have profoundly influenced all modern Oc- 
cidental literature; and among non-European civiliza- 
tions belonging to the Aryan branch, we may fairly in- 
clude the Hindoos, as represented by Sanskrit, and to 
some extent by more modern literature. If to these we 
add the Finnish Kalevala, and a few folk-songs which 
may lie beyond the Aryan pale, we have a corpus which, 
in my opinion, it would be well to master first, before 
prosecuting too far our researches into the drama of 
the Papuans, or the epic of Dahomey. There may well 
be societies of comparative literature, I grant; but I 
conceive that our most pressing need in this country at 



present is to understand the English literature, and 
those most nearly allied to it, and that this object may 
be more directly subserved than by devoting too large 
a portion of our leisure to the literature of the South 
Sea islands. ALBERT S. COOK.

THE NEW YORK "NATION" AND ITS 
"COLLEGE ANARCHIST." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Now that the charge against Professor Ely has been* 
exploded and proved to have come from a breechless 
cannon, hurting most the meddlesome one who foolishly 
or recklessly touched it off, one beholding the vanishing 
smoke-cloud may well ask how it is that so much smudge 
and racket should have come about so needlessly. The 
responsibility for the accusation and trial of Dr. Ely 
must be divided, it seems, between Mr. Wells, the Su- 
perintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin, and 
"The Nation" of New York; the one having written 
the letter containing the charges, and the other having 
printed it with the title of " The College Anarchist " 
and endorsed and followed it up editorially. Surely 
such charges and such an epithet could be justified, 
if at all, only by the most ample and unequivocal evi- 
dence of their truthfulness. The word "anarchist," 
as applied to a college professor, is about the most in- 
jurious that could be chosen; hardly less damaging, at 
the present time, than the term ex-murderer or horse- 
thief. It is worse, really, than to call a lawyer a shys- 
ter, a physician a quack, or a clergyman a mountebank. 
These have the world before them ; if a public stigma 
is placed upon their name in one place, they can go to 
another region and begin anew. But a college profes- 
sor has at best but few openings, and a reproach or 
doubt clinging to him in one quarter is pretty certain 
to follow him elsewhere and effectually check his career. 
These considerations show how serious was the moral,, 
and presumably the legal, responsibility assumed in call- 
ing Professor Ely " The College Anarchist," and will 
cause the public, particularly members of Dr. Ely's 
profession, to look with interest for whatever of repara- 
tion may be accorded him. Even though he may have 
gained rather than lost by the unjust attack upon him, 
the principle involved is the same as in the case of those 
who might be equally innocent yet not so strong or able 
to defend themselves so successfully. Words are dan- 
gerous things, and the injury they may do is often irre- 
parable. The word "anarchist" is coming to be used 
a little too freely in modern economic discussion, re- 
minding one unpleasantly of the religious " heretic " or 
the political " suspect " of not so very long ago. We 
have had, perhaps, almost too much of the " College 
Anarchist," the " Anarchist Governor," the " Anarchist 
Preacher," etc. Sinister epithets are no better argu- 
ments than brickbats are. They ill become a dignified 
and influential journal, least of all one whose mission in 
part is to raise the standard of journalistic ethics. Such 
are not the examples of amenity and justice by which 
the manners and morals of journalism are to be im- 
proved- C. E. S.

MORE XAPOL,EONIC PICTURES.* 



Neither the flight of time nor the growing 
urgency of current questions seems to abate 
public curiosity concerning Napoleon. In view 
of the multiplicity of books on the Emperor 
and of the temptations held out for the last 
half century to write them, it is rather remark- 
able that one of the fullest, freshest, and, in 
point of narrative, most trustworthy accounts, 
the "Memoirs of the Baron de Meneval," should 
appear at this late day. Few readers, certainly, 
are likely to accept the writer's exaggerated 
estimate of his hero ; none, on the other hand, 
will question the exceptional worth of his evi- 
dence as to facts. " An honorable and a truth- 
ful man whose lips were never stained with a 
lie " as M. Thiers testified in the French Par- 
liament Meneval was for years (1802-15) 
Napoleon's private secretary, his close friend, 
and a member of his household. He knew the 
Emperor as few were privileged to know him ; 
and it is a fact to be weighed that although 
custom accorded Meneval the valet's prover- 
bially fatal degree of intimacy, Napoleon re- 
mained in his eyes a hero to the end. " Faith- 
ful to his master till the grave," observes his 
editor, " he sought always and everywhere, with 
a complete conviction and the most absolute 
good faith, to defend the memory of this great 
man." Unhappily for the defender, the changed 
standards of a later day have wrought disas- 
trously with the Emperor's title to greatness. 
The Alexanders and Tamerlanes, men whose 
genius for destruction filled the rude ideal of 
their contemporaries and made the soil they 
touched a Golgotha, no longer engross history ; 
and the glory of the victor of Marengo and 
Austerlitz is happily paling before that of the 
Colberts and Turgots, real patriots whose goal 
was the solid prosperity of their countrymen. 
In view of the actual verdict of time, there is 
a strain of pathos in Meneval's prediction that 
this " common arbitrator " would justify his 
estimate of his master. He says : 

" The revelations which time will bring will show 
Napoleon raised on the summit of greatness by means 
of which morality approves; they will show him free 
from all baseness, straightforward, magnanimous, ex- 



* MEMOIRS ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF NAPOLEON I.

empt from low passions, endowed with every kind of 
courage, constantly occupied with the care of ameliorat- 
ing the condition of humanity, and finally moved by the 
noble ambition to have desired to make of France the- 
most glorious and the most prosperous of nations; am- 
bition too great, perhaps, in a worn-out society, for the 1 
rejuvenation of which time as well as the constancy of 
fortune were lacking to him." 

Meneval might well have given his memoir 
Chancellor Pasquier's sub-title, "A History of 
My Time," the book being really a continuous 
historical narrative, interspersed with pen pic- 
tures and anecdotes of Napoleon and his en- 
tourage. The stories of the Emperor serve 
mostly to illustrate his private character, rather 
than to depict him as the soldier and the ruler ; 
and here nothing is related of which the writer 
was not " an eye-witness or the direct deposi- 
tary." Familiar historical facts are passed 
over or but briefly touched upon, save when the 
writer is able to furnish fresh light, or where 
his version differs materially from the one ac- 
cepted. The tragic story, for instance, of the 
Due d'Enghien is graphically re-told with some 
considerable additions as to Napoleon's per- 
sonal share and degree of culpability in the 
matter. Meneval was a fairly good hand at a 
portrait. His characterizations of leading per- 
sonages Talleyrand, Fouche, Murat, Moreau, 
the members of the Bonaparte family, Mme. 
de Stael, Mme. de Recamier, and many others 
are clear and pithy ; and a propos of these 
portraits we may cite in passing blunt Marshall 
Lannes's summary, approvingly quoted by the 
author, of the wily Bishop of Autun : 

" He used to say of Talleyrand's impassiveness that 
if he were to receive a kick in his seat of honor his face 
would not betray the event, and summed him up in this 
saying, which is perhaps strictly true, if expressed in 

somewhat too military language : ' It 's a lot of mud 

in a silk stocking.' " 

Opening with a brief retrospect of his early 
life, Meneval passes on to the date of his en- 
trance (April, 1802) into Napoleon's Cabinet, 
as the actual, though at first not the titular, suc- 
cessor of Bourrienne, who was already in dis- 
favor. Meneval was present at the latter's final 
dismissal which was certainly abrupt enough : 

"The Consul said to him in a severe tone of voice: 
' Give any papers and keys which you have of mine to 
Me'neval, and withdraw. And never let me see you 
again.' After these few words he went back to the 
council, slamming the door violently behind him." 

Meneval's opinion of his predecessor's cele- 
brated memoirs deserves attention : 

" I do not think that Bourrienne was the author of the 
memoirs published under his name. I met him, in 1825, 
in Paris, and he told me that he had been asked to write 
against the Emperor: ' In spite of all the wrong he did

me,' he added, ' I could never make up my mind to do 
so. My hand would wither rather.' . . . His entire 
cooperation in this book consisted in some stray incom- 
plete notes which were worked out by certain profes- 
sional writers. These writers, whose names are men- 
tioned, had to make up for the insufficiency of these 
notes by their own researches, and with the help of ma- 
terials supplied by the publisher." 

Meneval ascribes Bourrienne's consent to the 
use of his name to the enfeeblement of his fac- 
ulties, and to the financial straits which made 
him at the time accessible to the temptations 
of the publisher. Allowing, however, all pos- 
sible weight to the writer's candor and oppor- 
tunities, his limitation of Bourrienne's collab- 
oration to " some stray incomplete notes " seems 
too patent an understatement to need disproof. 
Meneval's first impressions of Napoleon were 
most favorable : 

" He spoke of my studies and of Palissot [the satir- 
ist and in the writer's youth the doyen of French litter- 
ateurs] with a kindness and a simplicity which put me 
entirely at my ease, and showed me how gentle and 
simple this man, who bore on his forehead and in his 
eyes the mark of such imposing superiority, was in his 
private life." 

The portrait of the First Consul as the writer 
then saw him is thus traced : 

" Napoleon was at that time moderately stout.* He 
was of middle height (about five feet two inches), and 
well built, though the bust was rather long. His head 
was big and the skull largely developed. His neck was 
short and his shoulders broad. The size of his chest 
bespoke a robust constitution, less robust, however, than 
his mind. His legs were well shaped, his foot was small 
and well formed. His hand, and he was rather proud 
of it, was delicate and plump, with tapering fingers. His 
forehead was high and broad, his eyes grey, penetrating, 
and wonderfully mobile; his nose was straight and well 
shaped. His teeth were fairly good, the mouth perfectly 
modelled, the upper lip slightly drawn down toward the 
corner of the mouth, and the chin slightly prominent. His 
skin was smooth and his complexion pale, but of a pal- 
lor which denoted a good circulation of the blood. His 
very fine chestnut hair, which, until the time of the ex- 
pedition to Egypt, he had worn long, cut square and 
covering his ears, was clipped short. The shape of his 
face and the ensemble of his features were remarkably 
regular. In one word, his head and his bust were in no 
way inferior in nobility and dignity to the most beauti- 
ful bust which antiquity has bequeathed to us. ... 
When in a good humor, or when anxious to please, his 
expression was sweet and caressing, and his face was 
lighted up by a most beautiful smile. Amongst famil- 
iars his laugh was loud and mocking. . . . My portrait 
of Napoleon would be incomplete did I not mention the 
hat, without trimming or lace, which was ornamented 
by a little tri-color cockade, fastened with a black silk 
cord, and the grey surtout which covered the simple 
uniform of colonel of his guard. This hat and this 
surtout, which became historical with him, shone in the

thinnest and queerest being I ever met ... so thin that he 
inspired pity." (Stendhal.) 



midst of the coats covered with gold and silver embroid- 
ery which were worn by his generals and the officers of 
his household." 

This simplicity of dress was really a matter of 
choice and not of affectation as is sometimes 
charged. Meneval relates that, pending the 
arrival of Marie Louise in France, the Emperor 
yielded to the entreaties of the princess Pauline, 
an acknowledged authority in matters of taste, 
and ordered a magnificent suit, loaded with lace 
and embroidery, to grace the coming event. 
The finery, however, was worn but once, and 
was then laid aside for the plain habit of or- 
dinary days. 

Readers fond of the minuter espials of biog- 
raphy will not find Meneval's narrative want- 
ing. There are many curious details as to the 
Emperor's domestic life and his personal hab- 
its. Of that virtue which is " next to godli- 
ness " we learn that he had his full share : 

" He took frequent baths. He used to brush his arms 
and his broad chest himself. His valet finished by rub- 
bing him very vigorously on the back and shoulders. He 
formerly used to be shaved, but for a long time, that is 
to say since 1803, he had shaved himself after he had 
changed his valet. A small mirror was held before him, 
and turned as required. He then used to wash himself 
with a great quantity of water in a silver basin, which 
from its size might have been taken for a vat. A sponge 
dipped in eau de cologne was passed over his hair, and 
the rest of the bottle was poured over his shoulders. 
. . . His allowance for dress had at first been fixed at 
60,000 francs; he reduced this amount to 20,000 francs, 
all included. He was fond of saying that with an in- 
come of 12,000 francs, and a horse, he should have all 
he wanted." 

Like M. Levy, Meneval is at some pains to 
show that Napoleon possessed as he probably 
did a fair share of the domestic virtues, be- 
ing an affectionate husband and father, and 
the best of sons and brothers. Among his many 
engaging pictures of the Emperor's home life 
there is one that seems especially attractive 
and characteristic. Ever bent on the game or 
the reality of war, Napoleon had some little 
manoeuvre-pieces made bits of wood of dif- 
ferent lengths and colors, representing regi- 
ments and divisions with which he would try 
new military evolutions and combinations, set- 
ting them up on the floor to gain a larger field 
for the mimic campaign. Sometimes his son, 
the little King of Rome, would surprise him 
occupied with these pieces and working out be- 
forehand one of those brilliant coups which so 
often turned the scale in favor of the French 
arms. 

" The child, lying on the floor at his side, pleased with 
the color and the form of these manoeuvre pieces 
which reminded him of his toys would at each instant

touch them with his hand and disturb the order of bat- 
tle at a decisive moment just when the enemy was about 
to be beaten. But so great was Napoleon's presence of 
mind, and his affection for his son, that he did not allow 
himself to be disturbed by the disorder into which the 
child had thrown his strategical combinations, and con- 
tented himself, without manifesting any impatience, with 
putting the pieces back into their right order. His pa- 
tience and kindness for his child were inexhaustible." 

In this connection Meneval tells a touching 
story of the Empress Josephine. She had 
begged as a favor to have the King of Rome 
taken to her, and Napoleon yielded, despite 
the jealous opposition of Marie Louise, who 
feared the ascendancy which a woman who had 
once been so loved by her husband might still 
retain over him. Describing the meeting, Men- 
eval says : 

" The excellent Princess could not restrain her tears at the 
sight of a child who recalled such painful memories and 
the privation of a happiness which Heaven had refused to 
her. She embraced him with transports. She seemed to 
take pleasure in the illusion produced by the thought that 
she was lavishing her caresses on her own child. She 
never wearied of admiring his strength and beauty, and 
could not detach herself from him." 

For this wronged woman Meneval has nothing 
but kindness, though he faintly approves, on 
political grounds, of Napoleon's resolution to 
put her aside. He was an eye-witness of the 
painful scene immediately following the cere- 
mony that, as he says, " unloosened the bonds 
of a union which, had Josephine been fruitful, 
would have lasted as long as their lives ": 

" The Emperor re-entered his study, sad and silent, 
and let himself fall on the sofa where he usually sat, in 
complete depression. He remained there some mo- 
ments, his head leaning on his hand, and when he rose 
his face was distorted. Orders for the departure to 
Trianon had been given in advance. When it was an- 
nounced that the carriages were ready, Napoleon took 
his hat and said, ' Me"neval, come with me ! ' I followed 
him up the little winding staircase which communicated 
between his study and the Empress's apartment. Jose- 
phine was alone, and seemed wrapped in the most pain- 
ful reflection. The noise we made in entering attracted 
her attention, and springing up she threw herself on the 
Emperor's neck, sobbing and crying. He pressed her 
to his breast, kissing her over and over again, but in the 
excess of her emotion she had fainted. I ran to the 
bell and summoned help. The Emperor, wishing to 
avoid the sight of a grief which he was unable to as- 
suage, placed the Empress in my arms as soon as he saw 
she was coming back to consciousness, ordered me not 
to leave her, and withdrew rapidly by the drawing- 
rooms of the ground floor, at the door of which his car- 
riage was waiting. After the Emperor's disappearance, 
women who entered laid her on a couch and did what 
was necessary for her recovery. In her confusion she 
took my hands and earnestly prayed me to tell the Em- 
peror not to forget her, and to assure him of an affec- 
tion which would survive any and every event. It 
seemed to be difficult for her to allow me to depart, as 



if my departure would break the last tie by which she 
was connected with Napoleon." 

Josephine, says Meneval, "had an irresist- 
ible attraction." 

" She was not a woman of regular beauty (she had 
that grace which is more beautiful than beauty's self, 
as our good La Fontaine used to say); she had the 
soft abandon, the supple and elegant movements, the 
graceful negligence, of Creole women. Her temper was 
always even. Good and kind, she was affable and in- 
dulgent to everybody without exception of persons. She 
was not a woman of superior intellect, but her exquisite 
politeness, her great familiarity with society and court 
life and their innocent artifices, always taught her at a 
moment's notice what to say and do." 

Lacking the subtler charms of the wife she 
supplanted, Marie Louise had in full measure 
the attractions inseparable from youth and 
health. The author sketches her as she ap- 
peared to him on her arrival in France : 

" Marie Louise, then in the splendor of her youth, 
had a bust of perfect regularity. The bodice of her 
dress was longer than used to be worn at the time, 
which added to her natural dignity, and contrasted very 
well with the ugly, short bodices of our ladies. Her 
face was flushed with the journey and by her nervous- 
ness. Pale chestnut hair, silky and- abundant, framed 
a fresh full face, over which eyes, full of sweetness, 
spread a charming expression. Her lips, which were 
rather thick, recalled the type of the Austrian ruling 
family, just as a slight convexity of the nose is the char- 
acteristic of the House of Bourbon." 

Meneval's post was no sinecure. The Em- 
peror's prodigious activity grew with the ob- 
stacles put in his way, and taxed the strength 
of his secretary to the utmost. Night and day 
he was bound to the wheel of that restless, ever- 
scheming, and, in its final conceptions, vaguely- 
defined ambition. Says Meneval : 

" It often happened that I would hand him some doc- 
ument to sign in the evening. ' I will not sign it now,' 
he would say, ' be here to-night at one o'clock, or at four 
in the morning; we will work together.' On these oc- 
casions I would have myself waked some minutes before 
the appointed hour. As, in coming down stairs, I used 
to pass in front of the door of his apartment, I used to 
enter to ask if he had been waked. The invariable 
answer was, 'He has just rung for Constant,' and at the 
same moment he used to make his appearance, dressed 
in his white dressing-gown, with a Madras handkerchief 
round his head. When, by chance, he had got to the 
study before me, I used to find him walking up and 
down with his hands behind his back, or helping him- 
self from his snuff-box, less from taste than from pre- 
occupation, for he only used to smell at his pinches, and 
his handkerchiefs were never soiled with the snuff. 
His ideas developed as he dictated, with an abundance 
and a clearness which showed that his attention was 
firmly riveted to the subject with which he was dealing; 
they sprang from his head as Minerva sprang, fully 
armed, from the head of Jupiter. . . . Napoleon used 
to explain the clearness of his mind, and his faculty of 
being able at will to prolong his work to extreme limits, 
by saying that the various subjects were arranged in

his head, as though in a cupboard. < When I want to 
interrupt one piece of work,' he said, ' I close the drawer 
in which it is, and open another. The two pieces of 
business never get mixed up together, and never trouble 
or tire me. When I want to rest, I close up all the 
drawers, and then I am ready to go off to sleep.' " 

We should be sorry if the foregoing extracts, 
selected chiefly for their graphic quality and 
separableness from the context, should convey 
the impression that the book before us is a 
mosaic of chit-chat and haphazard portraiture. 
We recall no memoir of the Napoleonic period 
which is less open to the charge of " scrappi- 
ness " and triviality. Meneval was a serious, 
retiring,* even a melancholy man many de- 
grees removed from the mere court quidnunc. 
His bias in Napoleon's favor was pronounced ; 
but, allowing for this, his political and personal 
reflections are calm and penetrating, and they 
are the ripened fruit of his later years. We 
have alluded to his version of the d'Enghien 
tragedy one of the darkest stains on Napo- 
leon's career. The pith of the matter, as com- 
monly understood, and the defense offered by 
Meneval, can be briefly stated. In 1803-4, 
Bonaparte, justly alarmed and enraged by the 
royalist plots against his life, resolved to deal 
his enemies a blow that should effectually check 
such enterprises for the future. The blow de- 
cided on was the execution of one of the royal- 
ist princes, and the victim selected was the Due 
d'Enghein, the last of the Condes, a known 
leader of the emigres, and a supposed sharer 
in the murderous attempt of Cadoudal and 
Pichegru. That the arrest of d'Enghien, then 
living at Ettenheim, in Baden, would involve 
a flagrant breach of the law of nations, gave 
no pause to the imperious will of the First Con- 
sul. On the night of March 15, 1804, d'En- 
ghien was seized at Ettenheim by French gen- 
darmes, haled over the frontier to Strasburg 
and thence to the castle of Vincennes, where 
he was tried by court martial, found guilty, 
sentenced, and put to death, all during the 
night of March 20, and the early morning of 
March 21. His request to see the First Con- 
sul might possibly have been granted by his 
judges ; but Savary, a devoted tool of Napo- 
leon, who had been put in charge of the platoon 
detailed for the execution, roughly interposed 
in the debate, and led his prisoner away to the 
castle-moat, where he was shot, with a summary 
barbarity worthy of the days of the Terror. 

* In a note on Fleury de Chaboulon's Memoirs, Napoleon 
says : " Mineral and Fain lived in such a retired way that 
there were chamberlains who, after four years' service in the 
palace, had never seen them." 



Broadly viewed, the murder (or, to use the 
common euphemism, the execution) of d'En- 
ghien seems the only logical outcome of the 
affair from the beginning. The extraordinary 
preliminary step ; the trial before a tribunal 
certain as Meneval admits to convict ; the 
selection of Savary and his obvious conviction 
of his duty ; the swiftness and secrecy of the 
entire proceedings all point to the fact that 
the unfortunate Prince was doomed from the 
first, and that Napoleon was his judge. It is 
admitted that had d'Enghien been taken on 
French soil, or in battle, his sentence, while 
severe, would have been legal. Taken as he 
was on the soil of a country with which France 
was on the friendliest terms, it was murder. 
Meneval's chief defense of his master is that, 
expecting a final request from his prisoner for 
an audience, he meant to exercise clemency. 
He knew that conviction was certain ; but he 
took measures not, as is generally held, to 
prevent but to assure the Prince's request 
for an interview reaching him. These meas- 
ures, according to Meneval, were thwarted by 
the following singular (we are inclined to add, 
suspicious) incident, the facts of which, how- 
ever, whatever our interpretation of them may 
be, the relator's character for veracity does not 
permit us to doubt. Pending d'Enghien's trial, 
Napoleon ordered his Secretary of State, Maret, 
to write in his name to the Councillor of State, 
Real, directing the latter " to go to Vincennes, 
and to personally examine the Due d'Enghien, 
and then to come and report the result of this 
examination to him, Napoleon." The fateful 
letter reached Real's house at ten o'clock on 
the evening of the trial : but Real, suffering 
from unusual fatigue, had gone to bed, after 
having peremptorily " forbidden his valet to 
wake him before five in the morning, no matter 
what message might be sent to him" The next 
morning M. Real received the letter, dressed 
with all speed, and hastened to Vincennes 
too late. " On the way he met Col. Savary, 
who informed him that the Due d'Enghien's 
execution had taken place." 

Meneval, with other panegyrists of Napo- 
leon, failed to see or was loth to admit that his 
hero, like Bacon and Marlborough, strongly ex- 
emplified the truth that great mental gifts by no 
means imply corresponding moral ones. Napo- 
leon's character was strangely inconsistent, and 
even intellectually it presents contradictions. 
His marvellous genius for appreciating and 
shaping special facts and situations was coupled 
with the feeblest incoherence of general policy ;

and his dreams of the future, where we can di- 
vine them, were so vague, fantastic, and gran- 
diose as almost to warrant the doubt sometimes 
cast upon his sanity during his later years. 
What was Napoleon's final goal the consum- 
mation he had in view and toward which he 
strove and planned ? Has anyone yet answered 
the question explicitly ? Could Napoleon him- 
self have answered it? The good Meneval's 
response, touching the " ameliorating the con- 
dition of humanity," and other benign Napo- 
leonic aims, seems, in the light of recorded 
deeds, scarcely satisfactory. Nor can we ad- 
mit that the crimes of a man who sacrificed to 
his own ends, with appalling indifference, the 
lives, liberties, and happiness of scores of thou- 
sands, are in the faintest degree redeemed by 
his half-dozen putative bourgeois virtues. 

It remains to add that the publishers of this 
important work have given it the setting it de- 
serves ; and we venture to say the edition will 
bear comparison with the concurring French 
and English ones. The good work of the trans- 
lator, Mr. Robt. H. Sherard, calls for a word 
of praise.

PROBLEMS OF AMERICAN LAW REFORM.* 



Judge Dillon's entertaining and suggestive 
book on " The Laws and Jurisprudence of En- 
gland and America " has many great excel- 
lences, though it is not without some striking 
defects of style. It is a revision of a series 
of lectures to the law students of Yale Uni- 
versity on " Our Law in its old and in its new 
home England and America." It deals with 
the sources and development of our law, and 
with its qualities and tendencies as now admin- 
istered. Although the form of cursory oral lec- 
tures is preserved, yet Judge Dillon evidently 
kept in his eye several other sorts of men, among 
whom, plainly, were the lawyers, the guild of 
professors and learned men, the court -room 
audience to whom he for many years talked as 
judge, and the greater audience of the plain 
people to whom he was wont to speak on the 
Fourth of July. The book is technical without 
being obscure, learned in a somewhat general 
way, concrete and practical ; and throughout it 
is inflated by a florid eloquence and an ampli- 
tude of quotation and literary allusion in which 
the author delights, and from which he cannot 
always restrain himself. Judge Dillon has evi-

AMERICA. By John F. Dillon. Boston : Little, Brown & Co. 



dently modelled his style after Dr. Johnson ; 
and his learning is of the stucco and decorative 
order, rather than of the solid and structural. 
In the early part of the work he seeks to in- 
terest his students by excursions into the an- 
tiquities of the law, the ancient degrees and 
ceremonies of the English lawyers, descriptions 
of Westminster Hall and of the Inns of Court, 
and the like. He then didactically explains 
the development of the judicial system of the 
United States, the adoption of our written con- 
stitutions, with their rationale, limitations, and 
guarantees. 

In the last five lectures he takes up his real 
theme, the development of our law by the au- 
thority of judicial precedent ; or, in other 
words, the rule that a decision by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, in a question of law 
directly involved in the case before it, is (until 
overruled by the same or a superior court) 
binding, not only in that case, but in all sub- 
sequent cases in which that question is involved. 
To this doctrine we owe the accumulation of 
some eight thousand volumes of the best law 
in the world. And Judge Dillon concedes that 
if these eight thousand volumes (together with 
sundry other thousand volumes of statutes and 
text-books) were only all studied by our lawyers 
and legislators, they would scarcely need to 
take a step in the dark. But our author rec- 
ognizes that the legislatures have never done 
this to any great extent ; that even the judges 
are now beginning to lose something of the stu- 
dious habits which aimed to keep these books 
in mind ; and that as the courts and report-fac- 
tories go on turning out precedents at the rate 
of upwards of a hundred volumes a year, even 
the lawyers most patient of men are likely to 
be overwhelmed, and lose their studious habits 
ere long. Judge Dillon therefore maintains that 
the time has come for a systematic restatement 
of the body of our statutory and case law. 

Judge Dillon is by nature a progressive man 
and a reformer ; he is at the same time a lover 
of learning and a diplomat. Even forty years 
of experience in the legal profession, twenty 
of which have been passed at the bar and 
twenty upon the bench, have not sufficed to 
extinguish his native tendencies. They have, 
however, developed in him to an unusual degree 
the conviction that the reformation of the law is 
best to be accomplished by conserving the fruits 
of our legal development, and by securing, first 
of all, an adequate re-statement of the law as 
it exists to-day, omitting all that has been re- 
pealed or overruled, and all that has become 



116

obsolete. He is therefore among the most prac- 
tical of law reformers. Many years ago Tocque- 
ville pointed out that the effect of a lawyer's 
experience is to render him conservative, and 
that in America the legal profession constitutes 
both the real aristocracy and the bulwark of 
the state. These ideas are strikingly illustrated 
in the conservative and patriotic tone of Judge 
Dillon's addresses, and the moderate and care- 
ful limits within which he advocates legal re- 
forms. In his argument for a re-statement 
of the law, he avoids the breakers upon which 
most schemes of law reform have already gone 
down. He sums up his views in the following 
words : 

" There inevitably comes a stage in the legal history 
of every people when its laws become ' so voluminous 
and vast ' that an authoritative and systematic re-com- 
pilation or re-statement of them is necessary, to the end 
that they may be accessible, and of (to use, in default 
of a better, Bentham's uncouth but expressive word) 
cognoscible bulk, if not to those who are governed by 
them, at least to those whose business it is to advise con- 
cerning them, and to those whose duty it is to administer 
and apply them." (P. 269.) 

This, indeed, is the real lesson of Judge Dil- 
lon's book. At the same time he does not fall 
into the common error of the advocates of a 
code, that of recommending the remodelling of 
our law after the Roman or civil code. He in- 
sists that his purpose is 

" To delineate the characteristics and to exhibit the ex- 
cellences of our legal system as it now exists, with a view 
to show that for the people subject to its rule it is, with 
all its faults, better than any Roman or any other alien 
system. It is an argument, intended to be so earnestly 
and strongly put as to amount to a protest, against the 
Conlinentalization of our law. I have a profound con- 
viction of the superiority of our system of law, at least 
for our people; but I know that this estimate is not so 
fully and firmly held by the body of lawyers and law 
teachers as I think it ought to be. I have therefore 
thought it a fitting, if not needful, aim to inspire on the 
part of the profession a more thorough appreciation 
of it." 

What Judge Dillon favors is the re-statement 
and gradual codification of our law, in a code 
which should be the natural outgrowth and ex- 
pression of our law as it is ; i. e., it should be 
truly an American code, and not an imitation 
of any Continental code. 

The special points of superiority of the com- 
mon law over the civil law, namely, the decis- 
ion and settlement of the law only upon ques- 
tions actually arising and duly argued and de- 
liberated, the jury system, the careful develop- 
ment of the law of evidence, the supreme value 
of the American system of written constitutions 
setting definite limits to the departments of 



Government, and the independence of the ju- 
diciary in maintaining the limits set by the Con- 
stitution, are set forth in a way to re-con- 
vince both the practical man and the student 
of institutions. Students of the latter class 
are apt to find their most abundant materials 
and the most learned and scholarly treatment 
of them in the Continental systems, and are apt 
to overlook the substantial and permanent ad- 
vances made at home. Judge Dillon thinks, 
and shows, that this is simply another case of 
the far-away field which looks green, compared 
with the brown and rusty look of the field at 
our feet. Yet none the less does he perceive 
the defects in our laws, both of system and of 
administration. Indicating some of these de- 
fects, he says : 

" Most of our appellate courts are crowded with causes, 
and the effect upon the judges is that they too often 
feel it to be an ever-pressing, paramount, all-absorbing 
duty to clear the docket. This mistakenly becomes the 
chief object to be attained, the primary instead of a 
quite subordinate consideration. In the accomplishment 
of this end, the judges are as impatient of delay as was 
the wedding-guest in the Rime of the Ancient Mariner. 
Added to this, a majority of the appellate judges gen- 
erally reside elsewhere than at the capital or place 
where the courts are held, and the desire is constantly 
felt to bring a laborious session to an end as speedily as 
possible, in order that they may rejoin their families 
and do their work in the fatigue-dress of their libraries, 
rather than under the necessary restraints of the term. 
They begrudge the time necessary for full argument at 
the bar. They dislike to hear counsel at length. They pre- 
fer to receive briefs. As a result, two practices have 
grown up too generally throughout the country, which 
have, as I think, done more to impair the value of judicial 
judgments and opinions than perhaps all other causes 
combined. The first is that the submission of causes 
upon printed briefs is favored, and oral arguments at the 
bar are discouraged, and the time allowed therefore is 
usually inadequate. On this subject I hold very strong 
opinions ; but also hold that no opinion can be too strong. 
As a means of enabling the court to understand the 
exact case brought thither for its judgment, as a means 
of eliciting the very truth of the matter both of law 
and fact, there is no substitute for oral argument. 
None ! 

" The other practice among some, I fear many, of our 
appellate courts which injuriously affects our case-law 
is the practice of assigning the record of causes submitted 
on printed arguments to one of the judges to look into and 
write an opinion, without a previous examination of the 
record and arguments by the judges in consultation. This 
course ought to be forbidden, peremptorily forbidden, by 
statute. What is the most difficult function of an ap- 
pellate court ? It is, as I think, after the record is fully 
opened and the argument understood, to determine pre- 
cisely upon what point or points the judgment of the 
case ought to rest. This most delicate and important 
of all judicial duties ought always to be performed by 
the judges in full conference before the record is deliv- 
ered to one of their number to write the opinion of the 
court; which, when written, should be confined to the

precise grounds thus pre-determined. In respect to 
oral arguments, the time allowed therefore, the willing- 
ness to hear counsel, and full conferences among the 
judges in the presence of each other prior to decision or 
assigning the record to a judge to write the opinion, the 
Supreme Court of the United States is a model for 
every appellate tribunal in the country." 

A stronger argument for the consolidation of 
our Supreme Court could not be desired. We 
wish that this book might be in the hands of 
all our judges, and especially in the hands and 
hearts of the present Commissioners for the 
Revision of the Illinois Statutes.

THE MENTAL GROWTH OF MANKIND.* 

Mr. John S. Hittell has presented in four 
handsome and impressive volumes his " His- 
tory of the Mental Growth of Mankind in An- 
cient Times." The idea underlying this work 
is excellent. To successfully develop it would 
be the achievement of genius. To say that the 
author fails is not severe criticism, for most 
men would fail. The scope of the work is out- 
lined in a series of introductory questions oc- 
cupying several pages. These questions are 
suggestive, and the final ones are : " Has the 
Celt any natural fitness for free government ? 
Is he superior to the Teuton in delicacy of sen- 
timent ? Are the nations of Southern Europe 
superior to those of the North in artistic genius ? 
Are those of the North superior in mental and 
physical energy ? " Having propounded these 
and many other queries, our author says : " To 
these questions, which have never been an- 
swered satisfactorily, I shall offer replies, which, 
however weak they may be in many points, will 
yet, I hope, contribute a little to the stock of 
historical truth." One naturally feels some 
surprise when he fails to find any of these final 
questions answered. 

The author coins words when he needs them. 
To this we have no objection, but we do wish 
he would not give new meanings to old words. 
He discusses the three culture stages, Savag- 
ism, Barbarism, Civilization ; but he uses the 
terms in his own way. 

The four volumes treat of Savagism, Heathen 
Barbarism, Judea and Greece, Rome and Early 
Christianity. The volume on Savagism is in- 
teresting, but does not Tylor cover the same 
ground as well, or better ? Some chapters are

ANCIENT TIMES. By John S. Hittell. In four volumes.

weak. The discussion regarding the Primi- 
tive Family is particularly unsatisfactory. Has 
Hittell really read Bachofen ? In his appen- 
dix we read : " Bachofen, who was the first to 
call attention to the subject, has but little to 
interest readers who are familiar with later 
writers, such as Lubbock and Lippert." If our 
author has read Bachofen, he deserves notice 
for having performed a feat which few have 
done. But he certainly has not read Starcke. 
Nowhere has he made a citation from the great 
Dane's work, certainly the most important of 
the many discussions in this subject. In this 
connection it is curious to read : " Other works 
worthy of attention are Lubbock's ' Origin of 
Civilization,' which gives a good summary of 
Morgan's ideas, Starcke's ' Primitive Family,* 
and Lippert's ' Kulturgeschichte ' and ' Ges- 
chichte der Familie.' " There is no apparent 
realization on our author's part of the fact that 
Starcke is the exponent of ideas somewhat un- 
like his own or of the authors cited. 

The Aztecs are discussed in Volume II., 
upon "Heathen Barbarism." Morgan's "An- 
cient Society " is quoted, but his other writings 
are apparently unknown, and the romantic views 
of past and unscientific writers are usually pre- 
sented. Bandelier, unquestionably the most 
cautious and critical authority upon the Aztecs, 
is neither cited nor mentioned. The value of 
the discussion is at once evident. 

Were we to spend time in picking out here 
and there the small slips and careless argu- 
ments of the four volumes, we should justly be 
accused of trifling. The author intends to be 
judicial and fair, but is dogmatic both in thought 
and expression. His partiality for the Greeks 
is marked ; his dislike of the Romans is equally 
plain. The very word Christianity is a chal- 
lenge to him. Committed to evolution, filled 
with admiration for Kulturgeschichte, optim- 
istic in all human affairs, Hittell is delightedly 
conscious that the present is better than any 
past, that our race is better than all other races, 
that life is improving, and that the future is a 
time for still higher achievement. 

We have criticised : we might criticise still 
more ; but we admire the earnestness shown r 
the extensive reading displayed, and the sug- 
gestiveness of the work. To find out what con- 
tribution each culture stage and each great 
nation has made to the sum total of human 
progress, is surpassingly important. This work 
is an honest effort, fairly successful, to do this. 
As such we welcome it.

ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES NEWLY STATED.* 



Professor Nicholson's " Principles of Political 
Economy," his preface tells us, has grown up out of 
the class-room use of Mill, and from the need of 
recasting Mill's statements in the light of modern 
conditions and established modifications of the clas- 
sical theory. This fact has determined the order 
and general content, and, in a highly complimentary 
sense, the work is an annotated Mill. Professor 
Nicholson, however, is by no means a mere editor. 
The point of view and the essential positions are 
those of Adam Smith ; and of the economy of Adam 
Smith, Mill is justly taken as the classic expounder. 
But Professor Nicholson is himself a trained and 
vigorous thinker, and his treatment is fresh and dis- 
passionate. Although frankly conservative, he has 
restated the English economy in full view of the 
criticisms of the " younger generation of economists," 
to whom he is inclined to concede not a little. Com- 
pared with Marshall, the book is avowedly reaction- 
ary ; but it is also less original and less vital. 

Professor Nicholson's excellent judgment is shown, 
to cite examples, in his brief exposition of methods 
(pp. 18-20), in his analysis of labor (pp. 75-86, 
the treatment of moral activities excepted), in his 
criticisms of Mill's propositions regarding capital 
(pp. 98 sqq.), and in his exposition of the law of 
population and criticism upon Mill's deductions from 
Malthus (pp. 164, 169, 175 sqq.). His conserva- 
tism on minor points is exemplified by his attitude 
toward the attempt to establish small farms in 
England (146, 149), and by his condemnation of 
judicial rents as applied to Ireland (316, 317). Pro- 
fessor Nicholson's exposition of Value is reserved 
for the second volume ; but the discussion is antici- 
pated by a heated criticism of the notion that util- 
ity can be measured by price. For the Austrian 
nomenclature the author has bare tolerance, although 
he intimates that the "extreme limits of popular 
phraseology and comprehension" have long been 
.passed (7). 

In the matter of definition, Professor Nicholson 
reaffirms, with some asperity, the rigid boundaries 
of the classical school. He acknowledges, indeed, 
the influence of religion, art, morality, and other 
forces, upon the nature and causes of the wealth 
-of nations, concedes that wealth must be considered 
with reference to human wants, and admits that 
there can be no complete isolation of economic phe- 
nomena; but 

" The economist regards man as a being who pro- 
duces, distributes, exchanges, and consumes wealth, and

considers him as a member of society, one of the ob- 
jects of which is to deal with wealth " (13). " The econ- 
omist fixes his attention on wealth, and only considers 
other social factors as far as they appreciably affect 
wealth; as in every other science minor causes are neg- 
lected. . . . Political economy classifies and explains 
certain social facts, and discovers their laws and re- 
lations, just as the natural sciences deal with phenom- 
ena of a different order. Thus, starting with private 
property and freedom of competition as existing facts, 
we may discover certain laws of rent, profit, and wages ; 
but whether this distribution of the nation's wealth is 
morally just or unjust, is relegated, together with the 
question wherein justice consists, to ethics " (14). 

Political economy may consider the influence and 
powers of governments, trades unions, and other 
groups and authorities, in altering this hypothetical 
distribution ; it may point out the objects govern- 
ments have had in mind in this regard and the dif- 
ficulties in the way of attainment ; it may consider 
possible reforms, etc. " Discussions on Socialism 
and similar topics have a didactic value in that they 
make clear by way of contrast the meaning of pres- 
ent institutions and methods." 

So far as mere definition is concerned, there seems 
to be little difference among economists. Even 
the most wayward of the " younger generation " 
recognize the value of isolation and separation for 
purposes of analysis. But Professor Nicholson's 
cautions against passing from the economic to the 
ethical must be taken in view of his definition of 
sociology as an " aspiration," and his evident sat- 
isfaction (ethically speaking) with the existing or- 
der of things. Obviously, if ethics are to be rig- 
orously excluded from economics, there can be no 
pertinence in the question, " What scheme of dis- 
tribution is economically best ? " Yet Professor 
Nicholson would create a sort of economic ethic, 
and answer, as Adam Smith did, That which en- 
forces the greatest possible production of wealth. 
And, in general, if the author will not discuss the 
ought, he contrives to let us know what he thinks 
of other people's oughts. He may not say whether 
the " greatest happiness" theory is ethically correct 
or not, but if he were to doff the economic and put 
on the ethical ermine he would point out that "max- 
imum freedom " is at least as attractive as " great- 
est happiness." 

" For my own part I should not care to regard equal- 
ity of distribution, even if it could be shown to be both 
practical and also productive of maximum happiness, 
as the ultimate goal of human progress. Human ener- 
gies, activities, and ambitions are not to be satisfied with 
a dead level of placid content. . . . Even on the ver- 
bal question, I submit that the distribution which ad- 
mits of the greatest liberty may be more properly de- 
scribed as economic than that which aims at greatest 
utility" (233). 

But political economy is a positive science, and has 
to try to discover the real causes which have been 
and still are at work, as regards the distribution of 
wealth, and deduce the consequences. 

" We have to explain the nature and effects of the

institution of private property, and describe and account 
for various species of income. Rents, wages, and profits 
are as definite facts as any treated of in the physical 
sciences." 

Professor Nicholson's analysis of private property, 
and of freedom of competition and contract, is not 
especially profound or luminous, but it explains 
how, in his view, ethical, biological, and other con- 
siderations, are so foreign to economic discussion. 
The possibility of change in the methods of pro- 
duction, distribution, consumption, the possibility of 
doing away with poverty, for example, is what 
makes economics so fascinating to the " younger 
generation." To Professor Nicholson things are 
practically unalterable, or at least change so slowly 
and imperceptibly as not to interfere with the pos- 
itive nature of the science. He does not merely 
start with private property and free competition. 
The permanence of competition and private prop- 
erty, the persistence of the virtue of selfishness, the 
adequacy of existing methods of distribution these 
are the facts which make an appeal to ethics so fu- 
tile. Mill had held to a sharp distinction between 
the laws of Production and those of Distribution, 
the former partaking of the character of physical 
laws, the latter being a matter of human institution 
only, and subject to radical change even. This dis- 
tinction Professor Nicholson vigorously combats. 
As to the progressive betterment of society through 
the gradual evolution of the altruistic motives, he 
announces his disagreement with Professor Mar- 
shall, and holds with Stuart that " were public 
spirit, instead of private utility, to become the spring 
of action in the individuals of a well-governed state, 
I apprehend it would spoil all" (86). 

" For my own part, in the main, I follow the older 
writers in thinking that the great majority of people 
will do most good to the public by minding their own 
business " (85). 

" Common-sense morality, altogether apart from the 
sanctions of positive law, suffices with the great mass 
of a nation to enforce the fulfilment of what are pro- 
nounced to be the ordinary obligations of social life; 
but from the point of view of common sense, a man who 
does any work for a less price than his services will 
command is considered either an enthusiast, or a fool, and 
if he has others dependent upon him, the condemnation 
is more severe. The minister of religion and the min- 
ister of politics, the teacher, the physician, the lawyer, the 
author, and the artist, one and all if we take the average 
type need the spur of self-interest to surmount the or- 
dinary drudgery of their calling. Being ordinary men 
and not brutes, they are on various occasions moved by 
other impulses, just as a few of their extraordinary fel- 
lows are constantly so moved. When, however, Chris- 
-tianity itself, dispassionately regarded by the economist, 
finds its earthly support in earthly rewards and honors, 
how can it be expected or maintained that a substitute 
for self-interest can be found for the ordinary business 
of life ? The appeal to history is still more decisive, 
as showing that the main-spring of economic progress 
has been economic interest" (81, 82). 

Even the abolition of slavery has been due, not to 
philanthropy and Christian (altruistic) principles, 



but to economic interest : " It was the discovery, 
not that Christ had proclaimed the equality of men, 
but that freedom and rewards were more efficient 
than slavery and punishments in calling forth the 
energies of labor." So profit-sharing and other 
forms of cooperation are justified by the increased 
efficiency of labor. 

In the concluding chapter, on Economic Utopias, 
the aims of modern socialism are condemned, and 
its success heralded as the death-blow to individual 
liberty, self-reliance, independence, and enterprise. 
And this condemnation, in due measure, is visited 
upon all efforts which tend to break down the prin- 
ciple of competition or to substitute the altruistic 
for the economic motive. It is only fair, however, 
to note Professor Nicholson's conservatism : 

" I do not mean to assert that governments and so- 
cieties have no industrial functions, nor did Adam Smith 
nor any of the great economists who have lauded the 
benefits of freedom and exposed the weakness of gov- 
ernments. But it is desirable to emphasize most that 
which is most apt to be forgotten, and in these days no 
one is likely to forget that the state and trades-unions 
and cooperative societies have power for good" (432). 

Professor Commons's treatise on " The Distribu- 
tion of Wealth " is not easy reading. It bristles 
with the new nomenclature, and its analysis is in- 
tricate and exhaustive, and not always helped out 
by the mathematical figures and formulae. Thus, 
the diagram on page 147, where one side of a paral- 
lelogram represents one do.se of capital and labor, 
the opposite side the quantity of product produced 
by the marginal dose, and the base the total num- 
ber of doses, seems to strain geometry quite to the 
breaking point. These, however, are accidental 
features, partly due to the difficulty of the subject 
and partly to the unsettled condition of economic 
terminology. For the work itself is one of the best re- 
sults of the American renaissance in pure economics. 
It is thorough in investigation and modest but straight- 
forward in deduction. It nowhere departs from 
the rigid character of a scientific treatise, yet it has 
none of the painful exclusiveness with which Pro- 
fessor Nicholson finds it necessary to hedge about 
the term economic. Professor Commons does not 
seem to be aware that ethical considerations are 
uneconomic. There is no appeal to sentiment, no 
squinting Utopia-ward, but a profounder analysis 
of the nature of social and legal rights, and a clearer 
interpretation of the tendencies of modern civiliza- 
tion. 

After a preliminary discussion of Value, setting 
forth the Austrian theory, and a brief analysis of 
Cost and Price, the subjects taken up in detail are. 
The Factors in Distribution, Diminishing Returns 
and Rent, and Diminishing Returns and Distribu- 
tion. Land is defined as that which furnishes room 
and situation, the Ricardian conception of the " orig- 
inal and indestructible powers of the soil " being re- 
jected. 

" Not land, but capital, embodies the forces, energies, 
and material of nature " (29). " Soil is capital, and its

returns are governed by the same law as that which 
governs returns from machinery " (137). 

Personal abilities and business privileges are not to 
be classed as capital. 

" Capital, strictly defined, apart from individual abil- 
ities, has become the dominating instrument in the pro- 
duction of wealth. ... It is the ownership of capital 
rather than the possession of abilities that has impor- 
tant bearings on the social problems of wages, interest, 
and profits " (44). 

The law of diminishing returns is shown to be uni- 
versal, applying to manufactures not less than to 
agriculture. The law of rent is extended to in- 
clude the monopoly privileges of patents, copyrights, 
trade-marks, franchises, and good-will, but not cap- 
ital (157, 161). The familiar no-rent agricultural 
land of the " older generation of economists " dis- 
appears, and with Adam Smith we again include 
rent in expenses of production (221). President 
Walker's theory of the laborer as the " residual 
claimant " is effectually disposed of, and monopoly 
privileges fall heir to the coveted position. One of 
the clearest pieces of analysis in the book is that 
of the law of wages, and of the relative influence 
of the standard of living and of the laborer's con- 
trol over the supply of labor in determining wages 
(174-181). 

The most interesting discussion, because most 
closely touching current social problems, is that which 
deals with Law and Rights. The discussion is based 
on the theory of the sovereignty of the government : 
"the all-powerful factor in the distribution ef wealth 
is the sovereignty of the government" a theory 
which Professor Nicholson virtually denies. All 
rights considered by political economy of persons 
and of property are legal rights. " Government 
creates, defines, and enforces these rights." 

" The place of law in political economy is a subject 
which has received from English economists no atten- 
tion at all commensurate with its far-reaching impor- 
tance. . . . The English economists have taken the 
laws of private property for granted, assuming that 
they are fixed and immutable in the nature of things, 
and therefore needed no investigation. But such laws 
are changeable they differ for different peoples and 
places, and they have profound influence upon the pro- 
duction and distribution of wealth" (59). " There are 
in society two lines of economic activity, the voluntary 
activity of individuals and associations, and the com- 
pulsory activity of governments. The first is the field 
of free competition and self interest; the one hitherto 
solely treated by the English economists. The second 
is the field of coercion, of force " (61). 

" Private self-interest is too powerful, or too ignorant, 
or too immoral to promote the common good without 
compulsion. The common wants of society justice, 

roads, military defence, etc can be supplied only by 

compulsory contributions from individuals, and compul- 
sory administration of government" (61). 

Personal rights are life, liberty, employment, and 
marriage. The right to life is primary and funda- 
mental, and this means not merely the right to 
protection against violence but to a share of the so- 



cial product equal to the minimum of subsistence. 
" And this is what the State has done in two ways, 
through slavery and poor relief ; the first for the 
slave and serf, the second for the freeman " (66). 

It is rather startling to have the right to employ- 
ment defined not merely as a legal right, but as one 
in effect already recognized by the State. But it 
is only a more intelligent and higher application of 
the right to live. Professor Commons insists upon 
the personal rights of freedom of movement and 
freedom of industry. And " freedom of contract 
is the essential right of freedom in industry." But 

" The skilled, the intelligent, the educated, the gifted, 
laborers, those in whom intellectual and moral qualities 
predominate, are benefited by the freedom of contract; 
for the unskilled, the unorganized, the redundant labor- 
ers, those whose marginal utility is low, freedom of 
contract offers no help" (75). "Though the slave was 
compelled to work, he never suffered from that terrible 
evil of the modern laborer, lack of work. With the 
coming of freedom, the laborer was divorced from his 
means of livelihood, and now that all available land has 
become private property, and all capital is private prop- 
erty, the propertyless man is a dependent when work 
is plenty, and a vagabond when work is slack" (79). 

" The right to work, for every man that is willing, is 
the next great human right to be defined and enforced 
by law " (80). 

" The right to employment is simply a new applica- 
tion, under modern conditions, of the old right to free- 
dom of industry. Free industry meant essentially the 
right to free access to nature for the production and ac- 
quisition of wealth. . . . But to-day freedom of indus- 
try is no boon except to the wealthy capitalist. . . . 
The great mass of the people must remain wage-and- 
salary-receivers. Consequently, the only way in which 
these people can get access to nature for production is 
through the recognition of the right to employment " 
(80, 81). 

The first recognition of this right is that "wages, 
hours of labor, conditions of work, are to be adju- 
dicated by the courts." But this solves only the 
easier half of the problem. " The most difficult 
part for solution is that involuntary idleness which 
attacks both employer and employee, and closes fac- 
tories as a result of industrial crises and depres- 
sions." Professor Commons does not flinch from 
the legitimate conclusion the right of the unem- 
ployed to have work furnished by the government. 
A thousand hands will be held up in horror, but 
when the heavens have fallen it will be found that 
Professor Commons has advanced the whole ques- 
tion to a higher plane of discussion than it has hith- 
erto occupied. He has no cheap and ready expe- 
dients for working out so difficult a problem ; but 
he has forecast, as Mr. Kidd has so brilliantly done, 
the line of social and economic evolution for the 
coming century. 

Mr. Grover Pease Osborne's book, " Principles 
of Economics," is strictly unacademic. The author 
is widely read, he is an intelligent and acute ob- 
server, and his maxims and deductions are mainly 
sound and wholesome. Yet he professes to be ad- 
dressing an audience nine out of ten of whom re- 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



121 



gard political economy as the " science of free-trade 
or protection " ! Such an audience could not be 
supposed to be familiar with modern economic rea- 
soning, nor capable of much sustained economic anal- 
ysis, and the author has strictly humored his audi- 
ence. He has departed somewhat from the ordin- 
ary terms of political economy, which enables him, 
among other things, to escape from the rigid limit- 
ations of accurate definition. The difficult question 
of Value is reduced to simplicity by making a new 
term of utility, which is straightway confused with 
value-in-use. ''Capital" is the most misleading 
term in political economy, and so we have a discus- 
sion of the " Economical Use of Produced Wealth." 
The necessity of the constant employment of labor 
is enforced, but labor-unions and strikes are classed 
together as causes of idleness, and cooperation is 
mildly recommended. If we can regard Mr. Os- 
borne's book, not as an independent exposition of 
economic principles, but as a commentary on some 
standard treatise, we shall do most justice to the 
wealth of fresh illustration and the suggestiveness 
of many of the positions advanced.

unknown to us, but he is one of those who will clearly 
have to be reckoned with. By the publication of this

seem to be with such writers as Mr. Stanley Wey-

romance of adventure is quite equal to theirs. But 
there is another element, lacking in them, to which 
much of Mr. Dunn's success must be attributed. It 
is the element, if we may so express it, that comes

from humanistic culture, and adds to the universal 
appeal of romantic charm a special appeal to those 
who can appreciate the subtle qualities that elevate 
mere fiction into literature. Mr. Blackmore, at his 
best, illustrates this happy combination of attributes; 
as does also Mr. Stevenson, in a certain degree. 
Even the slight discursive element in Mr. Dunn's 
book adds to its attractiveness, for it derives from 
the best literary tradition. We do not seriously 
object to the irrelevant pages of Fielding or the 
rambling method of Thackeray, because we feel 
ourselves in the presence of a master, and the rich- 
ness of the mind excuses the waywardness of its out- 
pourings. It is something of this feeling that makes 
us unwilling to miss the least significant of Mr. 
Dunn's pages, for, if they do not always contribute 
to advance the story, they always provide something 
good in itself. It must not be imagined from the 
above that our author's digressions are very numer- 
ous, very long, or very far-fetched. They clearly 
do not produce the effect of padding, and that is 
enough to justify them. We quote one of them as 
a good specimen of the author's easy style. 

" In the present refined and philanthropic age pugil- 
istic encounters are justly reprobated, and a minute de- 
scription of one would not be tolerated except in the 
pure pages of a Transatlantic newspaper. And, as a 
former Mayor of Dublin used to put out the gas when 
members of the Council began to exhibit the usual 
symptoms of Home Rule, so a prudent and scrupulous 
author will wrap in obscurity the degrading details of 
such a scene. Nowadays, personal hostilities being out 
of vogue a cheering indication of social progress 
people blacken each others' characters instead of each 
others' eyes, an easy process, involving no bleeding 
except that of the pockets; and we may hopefully look 
forward to the time when parliamentary language, in 
the present revised signification of the term, will de- 
mand neither pistolary nor epistolary amends. The as- 
certained fact that hard names break no bones is one 
of the most brilliant discoveries of this enlightened age." 

The following pretty conceit is one of the many pas- 
sages that remind us of Mr. Blackmore's manner : 
" Bell then accompanied Sibylla to her carriage, and 
the two young ladies exchanged kisses a part of fem- 
inine ritual rarely omitted, however tepid may be the 
affection lodged within feminine bosoms. For a kiss is 
a species of counterpart, ranging over the diapason of 
feeling, from the insipidity of the octave and the coun- 
terfeit harmony of the fourth to the melting sweetness 
of the third, which only the mating of male and female 
lips may compass." 

The scene of " Red Cap and Blue Jacket " is first 
laid (for a brief prologue only) in one of the South 
Sea Islands, and the time is late in the eighteenth 
century. The scene then shifts to a village in Scot- 
land, whence sundry of the characters are trans- 
ported to Paris. They reach the French capital in 
the midst of the Terror, and the Revolutionary 
episodes that follow make the most exciting part 
of the book. The character of Andrew Prosser, 
the Scotch pedagogue, who finds that revolution in 
practice is very different from what it has appeared

in theory, and who discovers that even the tyranny 
of the Hanoverians may have its good points, is one 
of the best things that have been done in fiction for 
many a day. The faults of the book are slight a 
touch of the melodramatic here and there, and a 
reticence in the prologue that seems to have been 
designed for the express purpose of perplexing the 
reader (which is always bad art), and which mis- 
leads him completely until he is well along in the 
story. 

Mr. Forster's "Major Joshua" is essentially a 
study of two types of character that of the su- 
premely selfish man for whom the book is named, 
and that of the woman who has never been taught 
the meaning of love, and whose awakening to its 
power may be likened to the freeing of a spring 
freshet in some mountain valley. Both types are 
considerably exaggerated, and no abnormal condi- 
tions of training or environment would make them 
quite probable ; but the author has made them seem 
as real as possible, and has carried out his design 
consistently and forcibly. Aside from these two 
studies, the interest of the story is slight ; but a far 
duller book would be redeemed by two or three 
such episodes as that, for example, in which the 
Major finds consolation for his rejection in an un- 
usually good dinner, and in which the satisfied gour- 
met comes to think unregretfully of the disappoint- 
ment of the suitor. 

Mrs. Peard is too experienced a writer of novels 
to produce a poor story, and one may take up " The 
Interloper " confident of entertainment and a mod- 
erate degree of excitement. Besides these qualities, 
he will find much nice discrimination of character, 
and a pleasant equable manner of narration. The 
story is French, and a criminal trial furnishes it 
with a climax. The closing chapters, however, are 
the least satisfactory, and the real charm of the 
book is to be sought in its picture of the intimate 
life of a Tourangian chateau. 

Heredity is the main theme of " A Valiant Ig- 
norance," the latest work of the talented grand- 
daughter of Charles Dickens. Although this hobby 
has been ridden nearly to death of late, particularly 
by the women, it cannot be denied that the conse- 
quences of an inherited predisposition to criminal- 
ity are powerfully presented in the book before us. 
Incidentally, we may remark that the grotesquely 
inaccurate attribution of " nastiness " to the writings 
of Dr. Ibsen does not come with the best of grace 
from a writer whose strength is, after all, but a re- 
flection from that master of dramatic analysis. Aside 
from its treatment of the central idea, which is so 
relentlessly worked out as to be rather impressive, 
the book is neither interesting nor exactly whole- 
some. Most of the characters are fairly repulsive, 
and those that are not, with a single exception, must 
be described as unsympathetic. The writer has 
tipped her pen with wormwood, and her work is not 
a fair transcript of life, not even of the artificial 
and empty life of London society. It is pieced out 



to conventional dimensions by the trivial episodes 
and the drawing-room chatter to which too many 
of our novelists have recourse. 

We all remember the thrill of gratitude with 
which Mr. Rudyard Kipling's first stories of India 
were received, and the eagerness with which we 
awaited further transcripts of that mysterious life 
which he alone seemed to have the power to inter- 
pret in terms at once intelligible to the heart and 
the intellect. For it was not merely a sensation 
that they supplied; it was rather the revelation of 
a hitherto dumb civilization. No one before him 
had made us so vividly to realize the almost unfath- 
omable gulf between oriental and occidental modes 
of thought, or the fact that life in the far East is 
in some respects more complex than that which is 
our own inheritance. The facts have been so hope- 
lessly distorted by missionaries and other biased or 
superficial observers that the Hindoo, in our popu- 
lar consciousness, is roughly lumped with idolatrous 
barbarians in general, with bushmen and South Sea 
islanders. Mr. Kipling did not a little to adjust 
our ethnological perspective, and richly deserved 
our thanks for the instruction. We are inclined to 
think that the instruction is bettered by the work 
of a newer writer, the woman who gave us first 
" Miss Stuart's Legacy," then a volume of tales 
"From the Five Rivers," and who now gives us a 
stronger book than either of those. Mrs. Steel has 
an eye for the picturesqueness of Indian life and a 
sense of its psychological differentiations. She knows 
also the Anglo-Indian and his ways, and never for- 
gets that in spite of his imperious grasp and firm 
guidance he remains a purely extraneous element 
in the civilization of British India. " The Potter's 
Thumb " is a very remarkable book. The narra- 
tive is not as lucid or as symmetrically put together 
as it ought to be (although in this respect it offers 
a marked improvement upon " Miss Stuart's Leg- 
acy "), but it displays an insight unsurpassed by the 
best of Mr. Kipling's work, and a rich careful color- 
ing that makes that writer's brilliant impressionism 
seem relatively ineffective. Artistically, the best 
feature of the work is to be found in its use of the 
symbolism suggested by the title. It is one of the 
oldest figures in literature this similitude between 
the shaping of the potter's clay and the making of 
man from the dust of the earth and one of the 
most beautiful. We are constantly reminded, in 
reading the story, of such well-remembered lines as 
the Tentmaker's 

" What I did the Hand then of the Potter shake ? " 
or of Rossetti's 

" Of the same lump (as it is said) 
For honour and dishonour made, 
Two sister vessels," 

and haunted by other suggestions of the sort, more 
vaguely evoked. Yet this symbolism is not ob- 
truded, or made too much of in any literal way. 

In writing " The Ebb-Tide," Mr. Stevenson, with 
the collaboration of Mr. Osbourne, has once more

proved the possibility of getting along without the 
feminine element, of making a story so interesting 
that the reader forgets, until he rubs his eyes in 
amazement after perusal, that love has not appeared 
or even been suggested as a motive. Instead of a 
" hankering after some person of the opposite sex," 
to borrow a phrase of which Mr. Robert Buchanan 
once made unhappy use, "The Ebb-Tide " gives us 
hankerings after gold and revenge. It is a South 
Sea story, like "The Wrecker," and its characters 
are a precious trio of disreputables, driven, as a 
last resort, to piracy and the attempted murder of 
the fourth character, an eccentric fanatic who fishes 
for pearls upon an isolated atoll. This fourth char- 
acter does not seem to us well realized, but the three 
others are admirably delineated with their respect- 
ive and skilfully differentiated weaknesses and in- 
iquities. One does not often find in the pages of a 
book men as thoroughly alive as the vicious and 
vulgar cockney, the passionate and besotted sea- 
captain, and the decayed gentleman whose better 
impulses usually turn out to be nothing more than 
velleities all three united in the vagrant estate of 
the beach-comber, for the purposes of this ingenious 
and highly entertaining fiction. 

Miss Elfrida Bell is a young woman with aspi- 
rations, born to the uncongenial conditions that ob- 
tain in rural Illinois. She breaks her birth's invi- 
dious bar, and goes to Paris, where she becomes an 
art student in a famous atelier, and acquires eman- 
cipated views and a lofty scorn of plodding Philis- 
tine humanity. Art does not smile upon her, and 
so she turns to literature, removing her abode to 
London. She develops an enormous capacity for 
pose, gleefully rejects a number of devoted admirers, 
alienates her best friends, and finally, in a fit of 
pique, puts an end to her useless existence. The 
delineator of her career, Mrs. Everard Cotes, calls 
her "A Daughter of To-day," an ascription not to 
be admitted as truthful in any general or typical 
sense. Such characters are doubtless to be found 
among the by-products of so unsettled and feverish 
a civilization as just now happens to be ours, but 
they are in no sense characteristic of its deeper aims 
and energies. The author does violence, too, in 
more than one instance, to the probabilities of even 
such a study of morbid development. But she has 
told the story with a certain crisp animation, re- 
lieved by humorous touches ; and these qualities 
make it interesting in episodes, if not attractive as 
a whole. 

Miss Murfree is a novelist wise enough to limit 
production in the interests of patient and careful 
workmanship; and she has her reward. While 
there is nothing new in " His Vanished Star," there 
is complete mastery of the old material, and a suffi- 
cient differentiation of incident to nullify any pos- 
sible charge of mere self-repetition. Here, as in 
earlier books, she succeeds in so charging with poetic 
energy the description of natural phenomena as to 
maintain the high position won by her ten or twelve 



years ago. Nothing better of the sort is to be found 
in contemporary American literature. Nor does her 
sympathy with the rough Tennessee mountaineers 
whom she knows so well fail in any respect ; the 
picturesqueness of their primitive society and the 
rude pathos of their sequestered lives appeal to us 
as powerfully as they did when " In the Tennessee 
Mountains " was published. The almost impass- 
able gulf between such people and those produced 
by our bookish and sophisticated civilization is made 
startlingly clear, and at the same time a sort of 
sympathetic bridge is provided by means of which 
we may after a fashion mingle in feeling and thought 
with these untaught dwellers in the mountain fast- 
nesses. We have noticed a few false notes in the 
style of this novel such, for example, as the fre- 
quent use of the word " stellular " where " stellar " 
would have done as well, or better ; or the conceit 
embodied in the description of dynamite as a " co- 
gent compound," and the propriety of the inci- 
dent that gives the book its name may be questioned, 
since no new star or nova brilliant enough to attract 
general attention has been recorded for many years ; 
but these are trifling matters to set against the posi- 
tive achievement of the book in characterization, con- 
struction, and literary form. 

" Claudia Hyde " is a love story of the sweet, 
wholesome, old-fashioned type, refreshing as an 
ozone-laden sea-breeze that purifies the air from 
malarious exhalations. Such a book, welcome at 
any time, is doubly so in an age when the art of fic- 
tion has fallen so largely into the hands of sensa- 
tionalists, when morbid tales of the " Dodo " and 
"Yellow Aster" and " Heavenly Twins " sort "have 
the cry," and when popular success seems to await 
the most slovenly compositions, provided only they 
overstep the modesty of nature, scoff at the conven- 
tionalities, and ignore the fine reticence which is 
the last and best achievement of literary art. " Clau- 
dia Hyde " tells of the wooing of a Virginian gentle- 
woman by an English gentleman, makes of the tale 
a sweetness long drawn out, sustains the interest by 
many a subtle touch, and leaves the reader with a 
sense that somehow love has been once more set upon ; 
her rightful pedestal, after having been temporarily 
cast down by lewd fellows of the baser sort. The 
book has no ambitious aim, it struggles with no 
problem, it has no moral except the everlasting one 
of the purifying and exalting influence of a noble 
passion ; it is simply a piece of satisfactory work- 
manship, embodying a lofty ideal of character, ap- 
pealing to, and calculated to strengthen, the deeper 
and better parts of our nature. 

A group of translations from the Russian claims 
some attention, and will be made the subject of our 
closing remarks. It is with peculiar satisfaction 
that we greet the promise of a new translation of 
Tourgue'nieff, undertaken by Mrs. Constance Gar- 
nett. It is to be made directly from the Russian, 
and will include the six longer novels, with intro- 
ductions by " Stepniak." " Rudin," which has just

appeared, reads well in the new version, and the 
author of the Introduction calls it " as near an ap- 
proach to the elegance and poetry of the original as 
I have ever come across." We have compared it 
with the anonymous English translation that ap- 
peared in " Every Saturday " more than twenty 
years ago, and the comparison is to the advantage 
of the newer version. Still, there are phrases in 
the earlier that do not appear in the later transla- 
tion, which is a suspicious circumstance. The eth- 
ics of translation demand scrupulous accuracy in 
nearly all cases, and certainly in the case of the su- 
preme masterpieces of literary art. It is an offence 
beyond forgiveness to omit a phrase or even a word 
of Tourgue'nieff without some note explanatory of 
the circumstances. The Introduction does not over- 
state the case of Tourgue'nieff in saying that " as an 
artist, as master of the combination of details into 
a harmonious whole, as an architect of imaginative 
work, he surpasses all the prose writers of his coun- 
try, and has but few equals among the great novel- 
ists of other lands." We are sorry to find the ab- 
surd spelling " Turgenev " given new currency by 
this edition. It is also unsatisfactory to learn that 
only translations of the longer novels are contem- 
plated. What we need in English, even more than 
those, is an absolutely complete translation of the 
shorter tales and sketches. At present, those who 
want to read " Assja," " Spring Floods," " Punin 
and Baburin," " First Love," " The Song of Tri- 
umphant Love," " A Lear of the Steppe," and all 
the others, must pick them up here and there. Even 
" Faust," that marvellous example of psychological 
insight, that piece of art absolutely without flaw, is 
only to be found in English in the magazines a 
poor translation appearing in " The Galaxy " many 
years ago, a better one in " The Fortnightly Re- 
view," for last July. 

The work whose performance, in the case of 
Tourgue'nieff, seems so desirable, has just been done 
for Poushkin by Mr. T. Keane, whose translation 
of the " Prose tales " of that writer fills a stout and 
handsomely-printed volume. The longest and most 
important of these tales, " The Captain's Daughter," 
has often been translated ; the others are less fa- 
miliar. Of these others there are eight, some of 
them mere sketches, but one, " Doubrovsky," almost 
equal in length and interest to "The Captain's 
Daughter." One cannot help contrasting the purely 
romantic art of Poushkin with the finished realism 
of Tourgue'nieff, and it is not easy to realize that 
the two men were hardly more than one generation 
apart. 

Dostoieffski is in some respects closely akin to 
Tourgue'nieff, a relation made particularly apparent 
by " Poor Folk," which Miss Lena Milman has now 
for the first time put into English. In this delicate 
piece of work, with its simple story and its poignant 
pathos, we hardly recognize the Dostoieffski of 
" Crime and Punishment." It was the author's first 
tale, written at the age of twenty-three. When the 



critic Bielinski had read the manuscript of this 
story, he is reported to have exclaimed to the trem- 
bling author : " Do you comprehend, young man, 
all the truth that you have described ? No ! at your 
age, that is quite impossible. This is a revelation 
of art, an inspiration, a gift from on high." The 
enthusiasm was fairly justified by the work. Mr. 
George Moore, who writes an introduction for the 
present translation, makes this interesting comment : 
" ' Poor Folk ' challenges comparison with Tour- 
( gue'nieff. I mean that we ask ourselves if it is as 
perfect as Tourgue'nieff ; that it is not goes without 
saying. For is not Tourgue'nieff the greatest artist 
that has existed since antiquity ? The form is not 
so pure, the divination is not so subtle, the touch is 
heavier. When we turn to Balzac we see that it has 
not the eagle flight of his genius. The subject is 
not grasped and torn with such fierce talons. Bal- 
zac is to Tourgue'nieff what Michel Angelo is to a 
great Greek sculptor, more complete and less per- 
fect. Dostoieffski, in this story, may be not in- 
aptly compared to one of the Florentine sculptors, 
Delia Robbia, for instance. A certain coarseness 
of texture alone seems to me to separate it from 
work of the very highest class." The Vicomte de 
Vogue 1 says of " Poor Folk ": " Into this tender pro- 
duction Dostoieffski has poured his own nature, all 
his sensibility, his longing for sympathy and devo- 
tion, his bitter conception of life, his savage, piti- 
able pride." We do not need to further commend 
a work that has elicited, from critics so widely sep- 
arated in time and place, such substantially unani- 
mous tributes of praise.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



After having brought to a successful 

Howells and James market the more kindly flowers of 
as Comedy writers. . . . . J 

his proper imagining, the man-or-let- 
ters of to-day is very apt to turn some little atten- 
tion to the cultivation of blue roses. They grew 
well in England once, these wonders, though 'twas 
a good while ago. In the fifty years from Lilly to 
Shirley the Drama seemed a most natural product. 
But nowadays the case is very different: everyone 
tries his hand, although, unfortunately, no one suc- 
ceeds any too well. Tennyson, Browning, Swin- 
burne, Longfellow, and who not, have produced inter- 
esting specimens ; but while each new plant has gen- 
erally a certain charm, none of them are very hardy. 
There are not a few varieties, the modern classic, 
the strictly closet drama, the historical play, the 
society comedy. Some are pretty for a season ; 
some can be pressed, and so keep a pale beauty for 
a longer time ; but none show signs of any great 
vitality. Among other workers in these flowery 
fields are Mr. Howells and Mr. James. As for the 
former, without attempting any very great things, 
he has certainly made a delightful success in a little

species peculiarly his own. His farces, which have 
been appearing in " Harper's Magazine " during the 
last ten years, are now coming out in the Harper's 
" Black and White Series." " Five O'Clock Tea " 
and " The Mousetrap " are hardly the best of these 
fantasies, but still they are characteristically good, 
and it will doubtless be a pleasure to many to see 
them. Whatever else may be said, it will be allowed 
that the action is usually amusing and ingenious, 
that the characters are remarkably consistent and 
natural, and that the farces read as well as they act 
and vice versa. Somewhat more ambitious than 
these charming miniatures is the recent departure 
of Mr. James. " Theatricals " (Harper) contains 
two of four comedies which, as we learn from a note, 
were written for representation under peculiar cir- 
cumstances which never came to fulfilment. Not 
unnaturally, then, the reader starts at a great dis- 
advantage ; and to begin anything by Mr. James 
with a handicap gives one but a sorry chance. One 
must be content, however, as the author cheerfully 
remarks, to get such comfort as one can, namely, 
in this case, a good deal of amusement from the 
dialogue, joined with a wonder if, supposing the 
comedies had been presented, one could have fol- 
lowed the action and got any idea of the characters. 
It is not hard to give a notion of these plays of Mr. 
James. Imagine any of his stories with everything 
but the conversation cut out, and you will have 
something not unlike. To read them is rather more 
like an exacting game than one relishes at this 
time of the year; indeed, it may almost be won- 
dered if the game will be worth the candle at any 
season. The dialogue has the usual ultra-delicate 
flavor, the action (where one discovers it from the 
enigmatic utterances) is usually preposterous, and 
as to the characters, so far as one ventures to infer, 
they are extraordinarily conventional and colorless. 
In a word, the plays have an interest, of course; 
but Mr. James's other work has so much more that 
one can hardly fancy that they will ever be great 

favorites. 

" An Unhistorical Pastoral ; A Ro- 

mantic Farce ' Bruce > A Chronicle 
Play ; Smith, A Tragic Farce ; and 
Scaramouch in Naxos," this on the title-page, with 
a frontispiece by Aubrey Beardsley, is but an om- 
inous welcome to the reader of Mr. John David- 
son's " Plays " (Stone & Kimball). And yet when 
one turns beyond it is not as bad as one might fear. 
Our author, it is true, would seem to be one of the 
modern band of younger poets, and his work has 
many marks of end o' the century affectation. But 
still, here and there, and in some of the plays not 
infrequently, come snatches of very lovely verse 
notes of that same fresh and pure quality that, it 
often seems, was last heard in England in the plays 
and poems of the Elizabethans. That strange de- 
licious atmosphere that one knows so well, one feels 
again at times in Mr. Davidson's plays ; and it is a 
pleasure to find the strain in work that is done to- 
day. It is a curious minglement, the preciosities 



of our own time and the natural birdlike utterance 
of three hundred years ago. One is tempted to ask 
which is the natural Davidson a decadent who has 
caught the trick of Elizabethan utterance, or an 
Elizabethan who has come too late. Whichever he 
be, he has written some exquisite poetry, which may 
to great advantage be looked to, although in some 
cases the poetry is in hiding, like a bunch of violets 
growing behind a lumber-pile. For, unfortunately, 
this happy figured speech of our older poets degen- 
erates with fearful ease into the most tedious and 
prolix verbiage ; and Mr. Davidson has not always 
been able to distinguish in his own work between 
one and the other. It must be confessed that there 
are many arid tracts in his kingdom. And another 
point worth mentioning is that, as one reader might 
say, our author has a strange sense of humor ; or, 
as another might say, no sense of humor at all. In 
a writer of farces (among other things) this is 
hardly to the advantage of the reader. Some of 
Mr. Davidson's humors are not merely stupid, 
they are simply marvellous, and remind us again, but 
by no means so pleasantly, of the Elizabethans, of 
interpolated comic scenes. One must certainly pick 
and choose with Mr. Davidson : if one pick rightly, 
one has an excellent reward ; if wrongly, one is much 
bored. " An Unhistorical Pastoral " and " Scara- 
mouch in Naxos " contain most frequently passages 
of fine quality, and the reader will do well to take 
them first. The volume is one of those nice speci- 
mens of book-making produced by Elkin Matthews 
and John Lane of London, and in Chicago by Stone 
& Kimball. It is pleasant to see such pretty books, 
and to handle them, even if the inside be not the 
finest thing in the world. 



A commendable While . the author f . " The Jewi h 

discussion of the Question " (Harper) is very much in 
Jewish Question, earnest, his pages are commendably 
free from the acrimony usually imported into the 
discussion. The tone of the book throughout is so- 
ber and liberal, and the author takes up the cudgels 
for the Chosen People with a breadth of view and 
a candor as to the flaws in his own case worthy the 
imitation of those who disagree with him. Oddly 
enough, he opens with a denial that there is a Jew- 
ish Question at all that is, a definite one capable 
of exact statement. Now it seems to us that there 
is and has been from time immemorial a Jewish 
Question, and that the Jew himself, with his extra- 
ordinary fealty to the spirit of archaic tribal law 
and tradition, is primarily responsible for it. The 
observation of Tacitus, who speaks of the Jews as 
hostile to all races but their own (adversus omnes 
olios hostile odium), measurably holds good to-day ; 
as does that of Spinoza, who says that the racial 
solidarity of the Jews, despite their disorganized or 
dispersed condition, " is not to be wondered at when 
we consider how they separate themselves from all 
other nationalities in a way to bring upon them- 
selves the hatred of all." Racial exclusiveness, an 
arrogated racial superiority, lies at the root of the

Jewish Question and keeps it alive. So long as the 
Jew, broadly speaking, maintains in his daily deal- 
ings one code for the Gentile and another for his 
brethren ; so long as he refuses to blend socially 
with the people about him, making it a point of 
duty to remain essentially a stranger within the gates 
that shelter him, so long will there be a Jewish 
Question. It is easily shown that the Question loses 
definiteness precisely in proportion as the Jew, shak- 
ing off the superstition of his fathers, fuses with the 
people around him and becomes something more 
than a quasi-citizen with a quasi-patriotism. In the 
United States there is no Jewish Question or there 
is at most only an inchoate one. To impute anti- 
Semitism to Gentile jealousy is sheer nonsense: It is 
not the finer superiorities of the Jew that rouse the ire 
of the Gentile, nor is it the Spinozas, the Mendels- 
sohns, the Heines, or even the Rothschilds, that are 
responsible for the existence of the Jew-baiter. The 
true glory of Israel, the inspired thoughts and winged 
words of her poets and sages, is a part of the com- 
mon glory of humanity ; and humanity does not 
grudge the splendor of the flame that makes its 
own light the brighter. In the volume before us 
the writer discusses severally the " Mission of the 
Jews," their status during and influence upon the 
Middle Ages, " Hebraic Societies," " Money and the 
Jews," and he closes with a review of M. Leroy- 
Beaulieu's notable work, " Israel chez les Nations." 
The book shows learning and acumen, and should 
not be neglected. 

Mr. Andrew Lang seems to have a 
penchant for strange titles. In a re- 
cent issue of THE DIAL was reviewed 
his " Ban and Arriere Ban," a sheaf of fugitive 
rhymes ; and now comes a volume of prose quaintly 
entitled " Cock Lane and Common Sense " (Long- 
mans). The book is not, what the reader may guess 
it to be, a belated version of Dr. Johnson's ghost- 
hunt though some space is given to that venerable 
tale. It is largely a compilation of the (to some 
minds) fascinating order of narratives known as 
"ghost stories " though to secure a place in Mr. 
Lang's anthology the story must be, not a piece of 
acknowledged fiction, but an attested "occurrence," 
and a matter of actual belief on the part of the wit- 
nesses. Besides the stories proper, spirit rappings, 
hypnotic phenomena, magic, demoniac affections, sec- 
ond sight, and other pleasantly " creepy " matters, 
are discussed, with learning and acumen, and, we 
need scarcely add, with some humor. Humor, how- 
ever, this time by no means supplies the dominant 
note. Mr. Lang is, or seems to be, thoroughly in 
earnest the scientific, slightly skeptical, curious 
investigator. Struck by the constant, wide-spread, 
and well-attested recurrence of the abnormal phe- 
nomena in question, and believing that the explana- 
tions hitherto offered are often absurd, seldom plaus- 
ible, and never scientifically conclusive, he urges 
that here is a subject worthy not of the cheap ridi- 
cule often bestowed on it but of serious and impar- 



tial investigation. While "Common Sense " figures 
in Mr. Lang's title, he freely disclaims in his pre- 
face any bias in favor of that boastful and overrated 
quality. " Common sense," he sharply observes, 
" bullied several generations till they were positively 
afraid to attest their own unusual experiences." 
He might have added that common sense, having 
discredited itself often enough by deriding Coper- 
nicus, spurning Columbus, scouting Watt, Steven- 
son, and Fulton, refuting Berkeley by grinning and 
kicking posts, etc., ought now to be convinced of its 
fallibility in matters out of its range ; in short, that 
it ought by this time to have gained common sense 
enough to confine itself to common speculations. 
As to the objectivity (to risk a contradiction in 
terms) of the phenomena he cites, Mr. Lang re- 
mains a sturdy skeptic up to his closing pages, where 
he faintly admits that while "the undesigned co- 
incidences of testimony represent a great deal of 
smoke," "proverbial wisdom suggests a presump- 
tion in favor of a few sparks of fire." We suspect 
that the " fire " will always, on investigation, turn 
out to be of a subjective and hallucinatory nature, 
and that the spectral noumena will continue, as 
heretofore, to elude the clutches of the keenest 
spook-hunter. The essays, thirteen in number, are 
reprinted from leading English reviews, and they 
contain a great deal of curious and suggestive matter. 

History of the In a neat volume of 180 odd pages, 
South Place Society entitled " The Centenary History of 
of London. the g outh p lace g oc i ety (London : 

Williams & Norgate), Mr. Moncure D. Conway 
sketches the story of a small but distinguished fra- 
ternity honorably known for its zeal in the cause of 
civil, religious, and intellectual liberty. Rooted in 
no fixed theological creed, and adopting as a body 
no set of opinions that could fetter its members, the 
society has endeavored throughout its career " to 
study carefully, and keep abreast of, the growing 
knowledge of the world, at whatever cost to tradi- 
tional opinions or prejudices ; to do this in a spirit 
of tolerance no less than of sincerity." The organi- 
zation was founded in London by an American, El- 
hanan Winchester " a true forerunner," Mr. Con- 
way thinks, " of Channing, Emerson, and Theodore 
Parker." Winchester, who was by a touching in- 
cident led to give up his early Calvinism for Uni- 
tarianism, sailed for England in 1797, where he 
was well received by Priestley, Price, John Wesley, 
and others. His doctrines were still under the En- 
glish penal laws ; but he at once began preaching, 
and his congregations rapidly outgrew their chapels. 
It was a time of spiritual ferment, and the dissent- 
ers and the Anythingarians of all shades and de- 
grees of nonconformity who flocked to the fold of 
the liberal American shepherd soon had to build for 
him the Parliament Court Chapel, in Artillery Lane ; 
and there the South Place Society was organized, 
February 14, 1793. Mr. Conway gives a rather 
full account of Winchester and of his more impor- 
tant successors notably William Johnson Fox, a

really eminent man. Fox was a member of Par- 
liament, a fearless though a distinguishing radical, 
a noted Anti-Corn-Law leader, the founder, with 
Mill and Dr. Brabant, of "The Westminster Re- 
view," and the close friend of the chief English 
literati of the day. " He gave," says the author, 
" the first welcome to the Martineaus ; and he first 
recognized the genius of Tennyson, and over Rob- 
ert Browning's youthful work cried Eureka ! " 
Carlyle said of him that " his eloquence was like 
opening a window through London fog into the blue 
sky " adding, however, " I went away feeling that 
Fox had been summoning these people to sit in 
judgment on matters of which they were no judges 
at all." Mr. Conway was himself for twenty-one 
years the incumbent at South Place Chapel ; and 
his account of the Society, based on four discourses 
given by him in 1893, may be taken to be as accu- 
rate as it is lively and sympathetic. There are a 
number of portraits, together with an interesting 
copy in facsimile of the first draft of Sarah Flower 
Adams's fine hymn, " Nearer, my God, to Thee." 



Dumas^s 
Napoleon 
Romances. 



Under the general title of " The Na- 
poleon Romances," Messrs. Little, 
Brown & Co. have added six vol- 
umes to their neat library edition of the romances 
of Alexandre Dumas. The works translated for 
this set of volumes are " Les Blancs et les Bleus," 
" Les Compagnons de Jdhu," " Les Louves de 
Machecoul," and " Les Freres Corses." These works 
make a tolerably connected series, and there is no 
doubt that a reader may get from them an exceed- 
ingly vivid, as well as a fairly accurate, impression 
of the Napoleonic period of French history. In 
saying this, we do not need to take the author as 
seriously as he took himself, in these words, for ex- 
ample : " We shall soon have covered an immense 
period with our stories : between the ' Countess of 
Salisbury ' and the ' Count of Monte Cristo ' lie five 
centuries and a half ; and we are bold enough to 
think that concerning those five centuries and a 
half we have taught France more history than any 
historian." The present translation is in most re- 
spects satisfactory. We note, however, that in many 
instances proper geographical names appear in their 
French spelling, as Sagonte for Saguntum, Cannes 
for Cannae, Perouse for Perugia, and Genes for 
Genoa. These are curious lapses for anyone suf- 
ficiently familiar with French to translate at all.

us at how early a stage certain principles of criticism 
had become a fixed part of his creed. They are 



also interesting as showing that Mr. Ruskin's ac- 
tivities when just out of college were quite as mul- 
tifarious as they were in later years. Absolutely, 
the letters have slight value, for they merely give 
crude expression to some of . the ideas that later 
found much more adequate presentation. They in- 
clude an essay on the question " Was there death 
before Adam fell, in other parts of creation ? " 
which recalls the disputations of the schoolmen. 
That sort of thing, at least, Mr. Ruskin outgrew, 
and definitely, before he was much older. His en- 
thusiasm for Turner appears more than once, as 
when, speaking of a book concerning which his 
opinion had been asked, he says : " I have not seen 
the book you speak of, but if it praises Turner un- 
qualifiedly you may trust to it." The whole of Mr. 
Ruskin's Turnerian creed is in the following pas- 
sage : "He is the epitome of all art, the concentra- 
tion of all power ; there is nothing that ever artist 
was celebrated for that he cannot do better than 
the most celebrated. He seems to have seen every- 
thing, remembered everything, spiritualized every- 
thing in the visible world ; there is nothing he has 
not done, nothing he dares not do ; when he dies, 
there will be more of nature and her mysteries for- 
gotten in one sob, than will be learned again by the 
eyes of a generation." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Three reading-books for primary schools attest the 
growing desire to provide children with a better sort of 
pabulum than they have been accustomed to. " Fairy 
Tales for Little Readers" (Lovell),by Miss Sarah D. 
Burke, gives simple paraphrases of five familiar nursery 
classics. Miss Sarah E. Wiltse's selection of " Grimm's 
Fairy Tales " (Ginn) includes " stories illustrating kind- 
ness to animals and the unity of life in a variety of con- 
ditions. " A more ambitious undertaking is that of Miss 
Mary E. Burt, whose " Stories from Plato and Other 
Classic Writers " (Ginn) are taken from Hesiod, Homer, 
Ovid, Pliny, and others, and retold in the simplest of 
language. These stories have stood the test of repeated 
use by the author, and are particularly to be commended 
to kindergarten and primary school teachers. 

The " Elementary Algebra " written by Mr. Charles 
Smith and revised by Mr. Irving Stringham (Mac- 
millan) is designed to render less abrupt " the transi- 
tion from the traditional algebra of many of our sec- 
ondary schools to the reconstructed algebra of the best 
American colleges." The book constitutes " a rounded 
course in what may be called the newer elementary al- 
gebra, and includes the subject-matter specified by 
nearly all American colleges as the requirement for ad- 
mission." A book of far more elementary mathemat- 
ics is Miss Florence N. Sloane's " Practical Lessons in 
Fractions " (Heath), following the inductive method, 
and accompanied by "fraction cards," a device of the 
writer, used with marked success in her own teaching. 

The first volume of Mr. James Hamilton Wylie's 
" History of England under Henry the Fourth " (Long- 
mans) was published ten years ago. It has just been 
reissued, iu connection with a second volume, which now

[Sept. 1, 



first sees the light. A third volume, completing the 
work, is promised for next year. The volumes already 
published show that the labor involved in the work has 
been of great magnitude, and the result is in accord- 
ance with the methods of the best modern scholarship. 
The chronicle is too thickly crammed with notes to be 
easily readable, but the author's style, when it takes the 
form of plain narrative, has an honest directness that 
is at least engaging. 

Mrs. Lois G. Hufford's " Essays and Letters Selected 
from the Writings of John Ruskin " (Ginn) is intended 
for use as a reading-book in secondary schools. It in- 
cludes the two " Sesame and Lilies " lectures, " Unto 
this Last," six letters from " Fors Clavigera," and a 
part of "The Queen of the Air." It is supplied with 
notes and introductory matter, the latter appreciative 
and judicious in the main. While we know of no liv- 
ing writing of prose better fitted for school reading 
than Mr. Ruskin, and while we are in hearty sympathy 
with the general purpose of this book, we cannot regard 
as wise the inclusion of such matter as the chapters on 
what Mr. Ruskin (but no one else) fancies to be polit- 
ical economy. High school students are too young to 
discriminate between the ethical wheat and chaff of 
" Unto this Last," and loose thinking upon economic 
questions is about the last thing that should find encour- 
agement in these days. 

One of the most substantial contributions to knowl- 
edge that have resulted from the Chicago Congresses 
of 1893 is the handsome volume (Schulte) which con- 
tains the " Memoirs of the International Congress of 
Anthropology," edited by Mr. C. Staniland Wake. The 
papers are classified under physical anthropology, ar- 
chaeology, ethnology, folk-lore, religions, and linguistics. 
Two supplementary papers are printed in the German 
language. Among the authors are Messrs. Franz Boas, 
Carl Lumholtz, W. H. Holmes, D. G. Brinton, Alice C. 
Fletcher, J. C. Fillmore, Stephen D. Peet, Cyrus Adler, 
and M. Jastrow, Jr. Mrs. Nuttall's paper on " The 
Mexican Calendar System " is to appear as a separate 
monograph, and is consequently not here included. 

" A Gauntlet " (Longmans) is the title given by Mr. 
Osman Edwards to his translation of Herr Bjornson's 
" En Hanske." It is curious that the social dramas of this 
great writer should have remained so long untranslated, 
in view of the vogue of the similar productions of Dr. 
Ibsen. Both writers are at their best in their earlier 
and more poetical works, but the pictures of society to 
which their later years have been devoted constitute 
the most striking dramatic manifestation of the present 
day. Between the two it is hard to choose, but in this 
newer field Herr Bjornson is at least the equal of his 
famous contemporary, while a comparison of their ear- 
lier work shows him to be distinctly the greater artist. 
The subject of " En Hanske " has become somewhat in- 
sistent in recent literature, and it is well to remember 
that the discussion was practically started by the pub- 
lication of this drama. 

Mr. R. D. Cortina publishes a series of paper-cov- 
ered texts for students of the Spanish language. This 
" Serie de Cortina " now includes " Despuds de la Llu- 
via el Sol ," a prose comedy in one act by an unnamed 
writter; "El Indiano," a prose comedy in three acts 
adopted from Garcia de la Vega ; and " Amparo," a story 
from Seiior Enrigue Pe'rez Escrich. The latter two 
publications give the Spanish text with the English 
translation, a page of the one facing a page of the other. 
Mr. Cortina has supplied all these texts with notes. 



[LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 



Mr. Thomas J. Wise has just begun publication, in 
the pages of " The Athenaeum," of his " Bibliography 
of the Works of Robert Browning." It will afterwards 
be extended, and issued in parts to subscribers. 

Mr. Shad well, of Oriel College, will select from Wal- 
ter Pater's papers such matter as he thinks it advisable 
to publish. It is also proposed that several of Pater's 
friends prepare a memorial volume from their remin- 
iscences. 

The Prussian Academy of Sciences has granted to 
Professors Zeller and Diels $2,000 for continuing the 
publication of the writings of the commentators of Aris- 
totle. Professor Zeller took leave of his classes at the 
University of Berlin on August 2 with a speech in which 
he said that his health had always been so good that in 
his 110 semesters he had never missed his lectures for 
a single week. 

Messrs. Charles L. W T ebster & Co. will at once pub- 
lish " Max O'Rell's " new book, John Bull & Co.," 
which deals with " the great colonial branches of the 
firm, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Af- 
rica." If we may judge of the whole book from the 
Australian chapter, which we read the other day in " La 
Revue de Paris," the author has abated nothing of the 
wit, the shrewdness, and the lively intelligence charac- 
teristic of his earlier writings. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons will publish early this 
month a collection of the poems of Mr. Francis How- 
ard Williams, of Philadelphia, author of the novel " At- 
man, or Documents in a Strange Case," several lyric 
dramas, and of a remarkable story entitled "Boscosel," 
published in "The Septameron" in 1888. Mr. Will- 
iams's volume of verse will be called " The Flute- 
Player, and Other Poems," and while containing a few 
pieces which have already appeared in the magazines, 
will be chiefly composed of unpublished poems from 
this poet's portfolio. 

The public library at Los Angeles, Cal., recently pur- 
chased a number of French books, including the works 
of M. Jean Richepin. A local clergyman of the Meth- 
odist persuasion got wind of the affair, and delivered a 
sermon attacking the librarian (a woman, by the way), 
and containing this fervent supplication : " O Lord, 
vouchsafe Thy saving grace to the librarian of the Los 
Angeles City Library and cleanse her of all sin and 
make her a woman worthy of her office." The librarian 
has promptly brought suit for damages against the of- 
fending preacher. 

SCOTT AT THE CLOSE OF HIS CENTURY. 
Professor Charles Eliot Norton thus writes of Scott 
in his preface to the new edition of the latter's poems: 
" In looking back over this century, which is now so 
near its close, there is none among its conspicuous fig- 
ures of pleasanter aspect than that of Scott; and of all 
the men who have lived during its course there is not 
one who has contributed more largely to the pleasure 
of its successive generations. This is a great eulogy; 
no man could desire a better. To amuse men ration- 
ally, to give them wholesome entertainment, is to do 
them a great service ; and to do this through a lifetime 
more successfully than any one else, is to be worthy of 
lasting gratitude. This is what Scott did for our fath- 
ers, and has done for many of us, and will continue to 
do for many of our children. At this moment, more 
than sixty years after the last of his novels was written, 



1894.]

two popular editions of them are in course of publica- 
tion ; while his poems, ninety years after the ' Lay of 
the Last Minstrel ' was first published, are still the de- 
light of youthful readers, and still charm readers of all 
ages by the interest of their animated narrative, the 
ease of the versification, and the manliness of their 
spirit. . . . Let us be grateful for such a gift. There 
is space even on the narrow shelves of the immortals 
for books such as his. Shakespeare, Milton, Words- 
worth may rest on a higher shelf, but Scott will be 
nearer at hand for the multitude of readers, and his vol- 
umes will require more frequent re-binding." 

WALTER PATER. 

(July 30, 1894.) 

The freshness of the light, its secrecy, 
Spices, or honey from sweet-smelling bower, 
The harmony of time, love's trembling hour 
Struck on thee with a new felicity. 
Standing, a child, by a red hawthorn-tree, 
Its perishing, small petals' flame had power 
To fill with masses of soft, ruddy flower 
A certain roadside in thy memory : 
And haply when the tragic clouds of night 
Were slowly wrapping round thee, in the cold 
Of which men always die, a sense renewed 
Of the things sweet to touch and breath and sight, 
That thou didst touch and breathe and see of old, 
Stole on thee with the warmth of gratitude. 

Michael Field in " The Academy." 

A MODERN BIBLIOPHILE'S LIBRARY. 
Mr. Edmund Gosse tells us in one of his books that 
if fortune made him the possessor of one volume of ex- 
cessive value, he should hasten to part with it. And 
yet in Mr. Gosse's library are many books of " exces- 
sive value," which, in " their redolent crushed Levant," 
no " Bonanza King, with millions in his bank," could 
restore if lost or destroyed. From a list originally 
started for insurance purposes, Mr. Gosse was encour- 
aged by the solicitation of friends to make a catalogue 
of his collection which should serve a double purpose. 
" The silliest people who collect books might be consid- 
ered benefactors to their species if they only would cat- 
alogue their collections," said Mr. Falconer Madan to 
Mr. Gosse ; and his catalogue is really a benefaction for 
all book-lovers. Mr. Austin Dobson provides it with 
this cheerful Epilogue: 

" I doubt your painful Pedants who 
Can read a Dictionary through ; 
But he must he a dismal dog 
Who can 't enjoy this Catalogue ! " 

It is not given to many collectors of books to number 
so many poets and men of letters among his friends as 
does Mr. Gosse ; hence few collections embrace so many 
volumes calculated to excite the greed of the biblio- 
maniac. There is a matchless set of Edward FitzGer- 
ald's books, those privately-printed Dramas of Calderon, 
" freely translated," the first " Rubaiyat," and the rest, 
nearly all of which are presentation copies, and some 
of which are enriched with the translator's notes in au- 
tograph. There is also a notable collection of " Restora- 
tion Dramatists," in which department Mr. Gosse's li- 
brary has " no rival, public or private " ; and another 
special department, rich in such books as Mr. William 
Morris's " The Defence of Guenevere " (1858) " rub- 
bishy minor verse," Mr. Gosse pere called it the 
mere enumeration of a few items of which might make 
a bibliomaniac green with envy. If " an affecting and 
chronic want of pounds " has precluded Mr. Gosse from 
purchasing " the white elephants of bibliography," the 



same distressful condition has not stood in the way of 
his forming valuable friendships. 

" ' Book against book.' ' Agreed,' I said : 

But 't was the trick of Diomed ! 

And yet, in Fairy-land, I 'm told, 

Dead leaves as these will turn to gold. 

Take them, Sir Alchemist, and see ! 

Nothing transmutes like sympathy." 

Thus does Mr. Dobson inscribe a copy of his " At the 
Sign of the Lyre," To E. W. G." And many another 
tome in Mr. Gosse's library bears poetical inscriptions 
from his " Neighbor of the near domain," and from many 
another friend, inscriptions that are destined never to 
see the light outside the pages of this catalogue. Many 
of these inscriptions are reproduced in facsimile. A 
facsimile of a letter from Matthew Arnold, acknowl- 
edging the authorship of his Rugby prize poem, " Alaric 
at Rome"; and another of Tennyson's poem, "The 
Throstle," possess a melancholy interest. And so does 
the volume of Rossetti " Relics," which comprehends 
among other items a set of pages from " The Germ," 
containing the story of " Hand and Soul," with frequent 
corrections in Rossetti's handwriting; a corrected proof 
of the Sonnet on the Mulberry Tree planted by Shake- 
speare and felled by the Rev. E. Gastrell, 

" deaf drudge, to whom no length of ears 

Sufficed to catch the music of the spheres ! " 

and the first draft of the " Czar Alexander II." sonnet, 
the text of which differs in almost every line from that 
first published in " Ballads and Sonnets," and which 
may therefore be quoted here: 
"From him did forty thousand Serfs, endow'd 
Each with six feet of death-claim'd soil, receive 
Rich lifelong freeborn land, whereon to sheave 
Their country's harvest. Who to-day aloud 
Demand of Heaven their Father's blood, sore bow'd 
With tears and thrilled with wrath ; and burn to achieve 
On every guilty head without reprieve 
All torment by his edicts disallow'd. 
He stayed the knout's red-ravening fangs ; and first 
Of Russian traitors his own murderers go 
White to the tomb. While he, laid foully low 
With limbs red-lopp'd, with blood-clogg'd brain which nursed 
The Nation's charter, from fell Nihil flown 
No Nought finds now, a witness at God's Throne." 

Nearly all the introuvables of Mr. Andrew Lang are 
in this precious collection, many with brief inscriptions 
by their author; also a complete set of those by Mr. 
Robert Louis Stevenson, booklets that are almost un- 
known beyond the circle of his literary friends, and 
would bring their weight in five-pound notes if offered 
for sale. These were printed by the author's stepson, 
Mr. S. L. Osbourne, and are as limited in the number 
of their pages as in the number of copies printed. One 
of the booklets is entitled " Not I, and Other Poems " 
(1881), and the last poem, reprinted from the catalogue, 
with apologies to Mr. Gosse, states that 
" The pamphlet here presented 
Was planned and printed by 
A printer unindented, 

A bard whom all decry. 
" The author and the printer, 

With various kinds of skill, 
Concocted it in Winter 

At Davos on the Hill. 
" They burned the nightly taper ; 

But now the work is ripe. 
Observe the costly paper, 
Remark the perfect type."

BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON. 

Several pages of the present issue of THE 
DIAL are devoted to a classified list of publish- 
ers' announcements for the coming fall. In com- 
menting upon the similar lists of six months and 
a year ago, we expressed our surprise and grati- 
fication at the fact that the publishing trade 
should have been so little affected by the de- 
pression so general during the past year in 
commercial circles. The list of announcements 
published by us last spring was even longer than 
any previous showing made at that season of 
the year. It is of course true, as we then re- 
marked, that the publishing trade, as far as its 
announcements are concerned, is slow to exhibit 
the effects of a diminished demand. The pub- 
lications of any given season are well under way 
six months before the public hears of them, and 
many of them are arranged for a year or more 
in advance. Some shrinkage might therefore 
reasonably have been expected in the list for 
the coming season, and it is a matter of peculiar 
gratification to us to note the fact that not only 
is there no such falling-off, but that the list 
shows a marked increase over any published in 
a previous year. A close examination, more- 
over, discloses more than the usual number 
of very important and expensive works, with 
at least the usual number of books of unques- 
tionable and serious interest. If the effect of 
a period of commercial depression is to thus 
stimulate to unwonted exertions the trade of 
the publisher, it cannot be regarded as an evil 
wholly unmixed. That such is to a certain ex- 
tent the case, appears quite clear when the 
mind's eye scans the shelves that a bookish 
imagination will at once fill with the volumes 
now promised for early issue. 

Of all the books now announced, the great- 
est interest probably attaches to the long prom- 
ised and impatiently awaited letters of Mat- 
thew Arnold, which have been edited by Mr. 
G. W. E. Russell. This book will occupy a 
place in the literature of the year similar to 
that occupied last year by the letters of James 
Russell Lowell. As next in interest, we may 
mention Mr. Samuel T. Pickard's authorized 
biography of Whittier, which will also include 
many of the poet's letters. Several other 
" lives and letters " are promised, among them 



144 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



Edwin Booth, by his daughter ; Lucy Larcom, 
by the Rev. D. D. Addison ; Erasmus, by Mr. 
J. A. Froude ; and the late Dean of St. Paul's, 
by an editor unnamed. Biographies whose 
titles make no special mention of letters are 
Mr. Edward Gary's George William Curtis, 
Mr. William Winter's Joseph Jefferson, and 
Mr. E. S. Purcell's Cardinal Manning, prom- 
ised for last year, but unavoidably delayed. 
On the other hand, letters without biographies 
are promised for Thoreau by Mr. F. B. San- 
born, for Emily Dickinson by Mrs. Mabel 
Loomis Todd, and for General Sherman and 
his brother, Senator John Sherman. Literary 
history and criticism are to be enriched by Mr. 
Barrett Wendell's " William Shakespeare," 
Mr. J. Churton Collins's " Essays and Stud- 
ies," Mr. O. F. Emerson's "History of the 
English Language," Mr. Horace E. Scudder's 
" Childhood in Literature and Art," Miss Vida 
E. Scudder's " The Life of the Spirit in Mod- 
ern English Poets," Mr. W. E. Simonds's "An 
Introduction to the Study of English Fiction," 
Mr. George Saintsbury's " Corrected Impres- 
sions," and a translation of M. Jusserand's 
new study of English life and literature in the 
times of Langland. Mr. Selden L. Whitcomb's 
" Chronological Outlines of American Litera- 
ture " we expect to find a very useful work. 

In poetry and fiction, it has been our expe- 
rience that announcements are fragmentary, 
and that many of the best books of every sea- ' 
son come almost unheralded. The poetry 
already promised includes new volumes by Mr. 
Aldrich and Miss Thomas ; Mr. Lee-Hamil- 
ton's "Sonnets of the Wingless Hours" ; a reis- 
sue, with additions, of Mr. Gilder's poems ; and 
Mr. Stedman's " Victorian Anthology," which 
is sure to take place immediately among the 
standard works of its class. The most im- 
portant books of fiction in sight are " Trilby," 
by Mr. Du Maurier ; " The Ealstons," by 
Mr. Crawford ; " Highland Cousins," by Mr. 
Black ; " The Vagabonds," by Mrs. Margaret 
L. Woods ; " The Chase of St. Castin, and 
Other Tales," by Mrs. M. H. Catherwood ; 
"Philip and His Wife," by Mrs. Margaret 
Deland; " Coeur d'Alene," by Mrs. M. H. 
Foote ; " Tales of the Punjaub," by Mrs. F. 
A. Steel ; " A Bachelor Maid," by Mrs. Bur- 
ton Harrison ; " When All the Woods are 
Green," by Dr. S. Wier Mitchell ; " Eound 
the Red Lamp," by Dr. Conan Doyle ; " A 
Flash of Summer," by Mrs. W. K. Clifford ; 
and a new volume of short stories from the 
Polish of Henryk Sienkiewicz. 



A few important historical works must find 
mention. We are to have a history of the 
United States by President E. Benjamin An- 
drews, and a history of the Civil War by Mr. 
John C. Ropes. Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, in 
his " The Founding of the Trans- Alleghany 
Commonwealths," will make another excursion 
into his favorite field of investigation. A vol- 
ume of historical essays by Mr. Frederic Har- 
rison will be awaited with interest, as will 
also Professor von Hoist's lectures on " The 
French Revolution tested by the Career of Mira- 
beau," and two posthumous volumes by Profes- 
sor Freeman, one upon "Western Europe in the 
Fifth Century," the other a last instalment 
of the colossal but fragmentary history of 
Sicily. A translation, in six volumes, of Herr 
Duncker's " Geschichte des Alterthums," is 
one of the most ambitious of enterprises in the 
department of historical publication. Even 
more ambitious is the promised facsimile re- 
print, in no less than fifty-four volumes, of 
" Les Relations des Jesuites," that important 
source of the raw material of American history. 

The most attractive announcement in class- 
ical study is the volume of lectures on Latin 
poetry, delivered upon the Turnbull founda- 
tion by Professor R. Y. Tyrrell. A certain 
adventitious interest of course attaches to Mr. 
Gladstone's new translation of Horace, also 
promised for early publication. Mr. Thomas 
Davidson will have a book on " The Educa- 
tion of the Greek People." Since we are 
upon the subject of education, we may men- 
tion Professor Paulsen's history of the Ger- 
man universities, and call attention to the 
unusual activity of the producers of educa- 
tional treatises, manuals, and texts. These 
are so numerous, and of so high a character, 
that selection would be invidious. But our 
readers will be interested to learn that THE 
DIAL'S papers upon the teaching of English in 
the American universities are to be edited for 
publication in book form. 

Of the hundreds of announcements in other 
departments, our space forbids the selection 
of more than a very few titles. Two great 
works of reference, Mr. John Bartlett's Shake- 
spearian Concordance and " The Century 
Cyclopaedia of Names," cannot go unnoticed. 
Among illustrated holiday books, Mr. Karoly's 
" Raphael's Madonnas and Other Great Pic- 
tures," and Walpole's " Memoirs of the Reign 
of George III.," assume special prominence. 
Two new editions of Omar Khayyam are also 
promised. " The Art of the American Wood- 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



145 



Engraver," by Mr. P. G. Hamerton, with forty 
signed artists' proofs on India paper, is a 
sumptuous work that will be eagerly awaited. 
The new edition of Poe, in ten volumes, to be 
edited by Mr. Stedman and Professor Wood- 
berry, will supply a long-felt want. Among 
books of travel, Messrs. Allen and Sachtleben's 
"Across Asia on a Bicycle," Mr. Lafcadio 
Hearn's " Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan," and 
Mrs. Bishop's " The Hawaiian Archipelago " 
promise rich entertainment for those who like 
to visit foreign parts without leaving home. 
Finally, we will mention "The Religions of Ja- 
pan," by the Rev. W. E. Griffis ; and a new 
translation, with many plates, of the Egyptian 
"Book of the Dead," for which we are to thank 
the industrious scholarship of Dr. Charles H. 
S. Davis. And with these random selections 
we think we have sustained our preliminary con- 
tention that the list of announcements for the 
season is even richer than the list of its prede- 
cessors in its promise of entertainment, instruc- 
tion, and helpfulness. 



"TELL US A STORY!" 

Kant was not the first to mark out Time and Space 
as categorical imperatives in man's sense-perception of 
the external world. Carlyle was not the first to see that 
Time and Space are for our eyes the garments of spir- 
itual mysteries. Lessing was not the first to write a 
sharp division between the Arts of these two lords of 
our imagination, shutting up Sculpture to the Beauty of 
Color and Form, which Space can give us without Time; 
allowing to Poetry the Beauty of Movement and Suc- 
cessive Moments. 

These masters of analysis we anticipated when we 
were infants. We found out that our cradle stood in 
a nursery, and the nursery in a house, and the house in 
a yard ; that things happened and were over, and to-days 
rolled into yesterdays. We felt the mystery of Time 
and Space, when we so loved the little girl in Grandma's 
stories, who lived over in England, and was really 
" Mamma, when she was a little girl." We saw that there 
was one Beauty of Rest and another of Motion, when 
the horse in the park statuary did not quite satisfy us, 
because he never put his other two feet down, like that 
other most fascinating horse that " brought the good 
news from Ghent to Aix " : 

" I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he ; 
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three ; 
' Good speed ! ' cried the watch, as the gatebolts withdrew ; 
' Speed ! ' echoed the wall, to us galloping through ; 
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest, 
And into the midnight we galloped abreast." 
That was the start. And the finish ! 
" Then I cast loose my buff coat, each holster let fall, 
Shook off both my jackboots, let go belt and all, 
Stood up in the stirrups, leaned, patted his ear, 
Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer ; 
Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good, 
Till at length into Aix Eoland galloped and stood ! " 



But clear as is this distinction between the statue and 
the poem felt by a child, analyzed by a Lessing, 
must it be absolute ? Must a picture be all repose, and a 
story all movement ? Must a picture never suggest a, 
story, and a story never stay for a picture ? These are 
the burning questions that divide Mr. Whistler from 
Mr. J. G. Brown, Mr. Howells from Mr. Stevenson. 

Mr. John C. Van Dyke, in a paper in a recent num- 
ber of " The Century " on Painting at the World's Fair, 
says that the wish for narrative even in a picture makes 
the difference between the Teutonic and the Latin races. 
The Italians and French, he claims, can observe directly. 
The Germans and English must get at Form and Color 
by the medium of Thought. Pictures, to please them, 
must tell a story. If among them comes a man that 
can paint a " field of waving grain with a blue sky over 
it," " he is afraid to let it stand as a harmony of blue 
and gold. He puts it to the title of 

' the happy autumn fields, 
And thinking of the days that are no more.' " 

Isn't it just the reverse of this that people are com- 
plaining of, in Mr. Howells ? If the " harmony in blue 
and gold " was really a picture, but was made to sug- 
gest a story to please people that prefer poetry to paint- 
ing, Mr. Howells's " Rise of Silas Lapham," though given 
out as a story, is really a series of sketches of certain 
types in the city of Boston, made to please people that 
prefer analysis, which is literary sketching, to a narra- 
tive of events. 

There are plenty of artists that lose faith in the pub- 
lic ever seeing the picture they saw from the day they 
chose the subject to the day of the finished painting. 
There are plenty of delicious jokes about the artists' wives 
selling these pictures to romantic old gentlemen by nam- 
ing them " His Mistake " or " It Might Have Been." 

But has the story-teller a like temptation to pass off 
his wares as belonging to another art ? If most people 
prefer narrative to picturesqueness, has he not a clear 
path to a fairly gained audience ? 

Right here comes in the difference that tells. The 
number of men and women that have had a little train- 
ing in the technique of story-writing is to the number 
of those that have had similar training in painting as a 
hundred to one. Almost all our schools, in their liter- 
ary departments, give the more advanced students hints 
of the methods by which this or that " touch " may be 
given. It is much easier to teach how to describe than 
how to narrate; for description is a critical, artificial 
process, compared with narration, which must be spon- 
taneous, the knack of it not easily to be imparted. 

So it is that in an advanced civilization, there are 
enough writers and readers trained to methods of liter- 
ary picturesqueness to keep our best magazines full of 
"stories" which are really pictures; while the masses 
of the people, secretly or openly, flee to second-rate 
periodicals with stories that have no " style " at all, but 
that have the action that belongs to a story. And the 
few far-sighted and honest critics, revolting against the 
cheap dialect-and-other methods of word-painting, are 
lamenting the days of good Sir Walter, and are loud in 
praise of the rare stories like " Trilby." 

Well ! In a year or two, according to the Persian 
proverb, " this, too, shall pass." And when the maga- 
zines shall have published their present supply of genre 
sketches, they will be found responding to the growing 
clamor of the children at bedtime, and the children of 
a larger growth, " Tell us a STORY ! "

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
PENNSYLVANIA .* 

There is a well-known story in the " Autobiogra- 
phy of Benjamin Franklin," in which the author 
informs us how he anticipated the advice of Dr. 
Johnson for the acquisition of " an English style, 
familiar, but not coarse, and elegant, but not osten- 
tatious," by giving " his days and nights to the 
study of Addison." With so sagacious a recogni- 
tion of the value of English as a part of practical 
education from the founder of the University of 
Pennsylvania, it is not surprising that English has 
from colonial times held a position of recognized 
importance at the University ; although it is only 
within the last decade and a half that that position 
has been defined, with its relations to the other 
courses of the curriculum. 

The Department of English at the University of 
Pennsylvania, as at present constituted, is concerned 
with four subjects : (1 ) Composition, (2 ) English 
Literature, (3) English Language and Philology, 
and (4) Forensics. Of these, (1) and (4) are con- 
fined to undergraduates, the others extend to grad- 
uate courses. Whether for good or bad, we make 
comparatively little of Forensics, beyond care exer- 
cised incidentally in reading aloud and in opportu- 
nities offered for declamation by students of the 
lower classes. Elective and voluntary courses in 
speaking and debate follow in junior year ; but the 
chief practice of our students in these subjects is 
derived from the exercises of their literary socie- 
ties. There is an opinion prevalent at the Univer- 
sity that it is perhaps well that " elocution " be not 
too professionally taught ; but that the character 
of the individual should be developed in his utter- 
ance rather than overwhelmed with the oratorical 
mannerisms to which special teaching sometimes 
leads. , 

In composition work we set before the student 
one simple aim the plain and unaffected use of 
his mother tongue ; and we believe that the short-

[EDR. DIAL.] 



est way to facility of expression in writing is con- 
stant practice, and a practice unaffected and free 
from false conceptions of the purpose of such prac- 
tice. With this in view, every Freshman in the 
University writes two or three themes a week ; 
Sophomores and Juniors, except those hopelessly 
given over to technology, at least one a week ; 
whilst in Senior year the subject except as indi- 
rectly represented in the papers of the " semina- 
ries " or study-classes in literature remains op- 
tional. All of this work is carefully superintended 
by the instructors in charge ; every composition is 
read occasionally before the class or a section of 
it, corrected, annotated, if need be handed back 
to be rewritten, the faults explained with the prin- 
ciples involved, the personality of the writer stud- 
ied as far as possible, his abilities trained and 
directed. In the assignment of themes there is an 
endeavor to avoid subjects which can be read up 
and crammed for the occasion, although the stu- 
dent is kept in continual touch with good English 
style by required collateral reading. The study of 
Rhetoric is developed out of the reading and com- 
position work ; and, although systematized by ref- 
erence to a text-book, is not studied as a thing 
apart from daily practice. 

And now as to the study of English literature, 
which we confine, except for a brief estimate of the 
historical values of other products, entirely to the 
range of what is known as " the literature of pow- 
er." English literature forms a part of the require- 
ment for entrance to college, and is involved in the 
reading and instruction of Freshman year, although 
there subsidiary to the more immediate claims of 
the drill in composition. In Sophomore year the 
special study of literature begins, continuing until 
graduation in periods from two to five and six 
hours a week according to the course elected. I 
omit any enumeration of courses, as this may be 
readily gleaned by the curious from the catalogues 
and bulletins of the University. 

In our method of work we endeavor to follow 
some such course as this : Our first task is to teach 
the student to observe literary phenomena ; to have 
him read, never more, however, than he can ab- 
sorb ; to let him prove by written and oral exercise 
that he has read, and also to demand from the first 
that he formulate in words his impressions of his 
reading. These impressions are crude to a degree, 
and bear to his mature work precisely the relation 
which the antics he performs in the gymnasium 
bear to applied physical activity. But we esteem 
it no small thing to have trained a boy to think on 
something for himself. The authors chosen for 
these earlier exercises are those least distantly re- 
moved from the student's modes of daily thought. 
They are modern, and writers in prose ; as the 
problem is greatly simplified by the elimination of 
a strange or unusual medium, and the allowances 
which must be made for historic environment.

phenomena with some degree of ease, we direct his 
attention to the relation subsisting between the va- 
rious phenomena noted, still demanding that he 
increase his data by constant reading of literature 
and frequent exercises such as those noted above. 
We are now prepared for that orderly exposition 
of the relation of literary phenomena which we 
call the history of Literature. This history should 
proceed, as far as possible, from the more familiar 
to the less familiar ; and for this reason we arrange 
the courses in the history of more recent periods to 
precede such periods as that of Chaucer or of Shake- 
speare. We aim to have such courses deepen the 
impression of the student by a minuter attention to 
the relations of things, by seeking out the begin- 
nings of various modes of literary thought and 
tracing their development in the light of contempo- 
rary conditions. Nor is this all. We require the 
student to keep himself in daily touch with the 
writings of those authors that form the subject- 
matter of the lectures, and to submit the results of 
his reading in frequent " seminary meetings " for 
correction and general discussion among his fel- 
lows. Thus we arrive at the beginning of Senior 
year with that training in the perception of the 
qualities and relations of literary products, and 
that general knowledge of the course of their de- 
velopment, which alone can render the study of 
organic and aesthetic detail practicable. In Senior 
year the whole subject is approached again from 
these points of view in the study of poetics, the his- 
tory of criticism and aesthetics, the " seminary " or 
literary workshop, continuing as in previous years. 
We insist that all talk about theories, aesthetic, 
philosophical, or other, which the student may not 
investigate for himself by actual reference to the 
authors in question, be banished from our work. 
In conclusion of the undergraduate work in En- 
glish literature, we feel that the study holds a pe- 
culiar position from its capabilities in developing 
the taste and artistic discernment, its liberalizing 
influence in broadening the student's views of life 
and man, its enormous weight against utilitarian- 
ism, and its power in giving us, when properly 
taught, the very essence of the now all but de- 
throned humanities. 

The Philology of English holds a recognized and 
important place in the undergraduate courses of 
the University of Pennsylvania, although we have 
not seen the necessity of making the sight reading 
of " Beowulf " a requirement for entrance to col- 
lege, as some of our radical friends would have it. 
The reading and philological study of Old and 
Middle English, especially Chaucer, is offered to 
undergraduates in the form of elective courses ex- 
tending through Junior and Senior year, whilst a 
brief practical course in the history of the English 
language is a required study for all Freshmen. 
Neither in Literature nor in Philology do we set 
undergraduates to what is sometimes called in the 
English of catalogues "original research," prefer- 



ring to devote these years to the laying of such 
foundation stones as we may, rather than to the 
amateurish collection of unimportant literary data 
or the perfunctory compilation of unnecessary in- 
dices. 

The graduate courses in English of the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania are confined to Literature and 
Philology. Under the latter is included not only 
the Philology of English but the intensive study of 
literary products of Old and Middle English, con- 
ducted by means of lecture and seminary, with 
carefully superintended original investigation on 
the part of the student. In literature too, while 
the subject is treated in lectures and by discussion 
from the historical as well as the organic and aes- 
thetic point of view, it is the duty of each student 
pursuing English as his major subject to determine 
upon some definite literary period, movement, or 
writer, for special study and investigation, and later 
to choose some theme within the range of this 
special field for his thesis. The graduate theses in 
English, as in all other departments of the Univer- 
sity, must be submitted to the Faculty of Philoso- 
phy, and upon acceptance published.

AUTUMN. 



Through scarlet arches and dusk corridors 
She moves, faint perfumes at her queenly feet, 
And plaintive voices calling at her side. 
Her grandeur blanches, passes. Autumn, she 
With colors of the cloud, the rose, the bird, 
Woven in her leaves, sweet-flushed as Love herself, 
She too shall fade away; and where she was 
Shall be low fluttering pulses, vanishings, 
And solemn shadow, weight of frost and rain. 
Already do the trees, those giant flowers, 
The blossoms of the gods, from their bright tops 
Begin to shed the splendor, and look down 
In silent wonder on the wealth they wore, 
Gleaming below. The maple that doth wake 
His own glad sunshine, make his own fair day, 
Begins to darken; wailing haunts the wind, 
Strange wailing from the lowlands; on the hill 
Slow spreads the fatal gray. Yea, Autumn, all 
Of loveliness, for whom strong Beauty wrought 
Till she could do no more, she too must go. 
She passes; and to listening hearts she sings, 
She and her maids, their tresses backward blown, 
Shining under the wind : 

These colors, memories are they, 

The past this beauty wore ; 
These splendors wove the charm of May, 

They all were in the summer's golden store. 

They dwelt, they shone, and passed away ; 

All, all have been before: 
'Tis but the glamour of the day, 

The glory of the day, that is no more.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE STUDY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE FROM 

THE STANDPOINT OF THE STUDENT. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The readers of THE DIAL have been interested dur- 
ing the past few months in the series of articles on the 
Teaching of English in our large Universities. These 
have given the standpoint of the teacher. But that of 
the student may be of no less interest. And as I am just 
completing my student life in that department, after 
the regular preparatory, college, and graduate work, 
I wish to present a few thoughts from this other side. 

The favored methods, scientific or other, of secondary 
schools do not invariably bear fruit in a thorough cul- 
ture. But wide reading in good books, not necessarily 
classics, is absolutely indispensable in forming a good 
taste for reading, and for exciting an interest in the 
study of literature; it is a sub-conscious preparation for 
the conscious activity of the matured mind. I say sub- 
conscious advisedly; for the young student has a direct 
interest in the good and beautiful in what he is reading, 
and is influenced, whether he knows it or not, by his in- 
terest; but once urge him to give conscious articulation to 
his opinions, and to dissect his sentiments, and the charm 
of his reading is decreased. Then his primitive interest 
must be supplanted by something further. The later 
process of studying the isolated fact is good in its time ; 
but if premature, it causes the student to regard his 
study of literature as a de-naturalizing, unbeautifying 
process, and he will look in later years with a horrified 
remembrance on the classics that suffered such a pro- 
cess at the hands of his teachers. 

I wish to speak of an objection to the study of liter- 
ature, which, as it meets every student, must be met by 
the teacher. As the student enters his second or third 
year in college he is confronted by lines of elective study. 
He is called on, to a certain extent, to shape the growth 
of his own mind. He is eager to make the best of his 
college course ; he wishes to choose wisely, that he may 
make the most of himself. Nine students out of ten in 
this situation say to themselves on first thought: " I can 
study literature for myself after leaving college ; I must 
not let work that can be accomplished then stand in the 
way of what must be done now or not at all ; the study 
of literature would be delightful, but it would require 
a good deal of time, and under the circumstances would 
be an indulgence." This, I repeat, is the thought of 
many students at the critical moment of their college 
lives. I must take for granted that many readers of 
THE DIAL have already answered this objection for 
themselves. Yet it is an objection that the teacher must 
carefully answer to those who enter at all on his elect- 
ive work, not with an ex-cathedra answer, but the 
silent, satisfactory answer of skilfully conducted work. 
As the Latin and Greek classics were made the instru- 
ments of culture by the instructors of English youth 
during the past centuries, so our English classics, with 
less intervention of the merely technical, can be made the 
instruments of culture for the American youth. These 
English classics were, primarily, the education of James 
Russell Lowell; and they must be the education of the 
American Chaucers and Miltons and Wordsworths who 
will yet come. Let the teacher convince the student of 
this, as every good teacher of literature does, and he 
will have the choicest students of the college in his elect- 
ive courses. 



The student, in consequence, makes certain require- 
ments of his teacher in this department. He expects a 
living, cultured personality, not a fact-hopper warranted 
to grind and sift a certain quantum of knowledge in 
a given period of recitation hours. The life in the 
teacher which adds real zest to the study is helpful in 
any line; personal enthusiasm can modify even a prop- 
osition in Euclid, though the fact that the " sum of the 
angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles " may be 
demonstrated by an automaton. But to the successful 
teaching of literature, such life is absolutely indispens- 
able ; for the study of literature is more directly a study 
of life in its wide relations, and life only can interpret 
life. The teacher needs natural and manly sentiments 
and thoughts, not technical apparatus; and these can 
find origin only in the essential character. 

The student also has his opinions as to what the teach- 
er's purpose with a student should be. It is an almost 
universal trait of young minds to rebel against being 
reduced to a means. They are still idealists in life; 
nothing presents itself to them as more worthful than 
their own life and its prospects. Hence, while they are 
willing to do almost any amount of work for their own 
growth, they are very slow to make of themselves stones 
for the temple of learning. They are still possessed by 
the thought that a whole is greater than its parts that 
the individual life is greater than learning; they are 
still in what some lament as a state of primitive egoism. 
The successful teacher must adapt himself to this state 
of the young mind. He must bring some real contribu- 
tion to that self-treasured life ; he must make the stu- 
dent feel that he considers that life worth working for, 
and must shape his methods and choice of masterpieces 
to that end. And to do this, the student must be made 
to feel that he is a man, or at least has the promise of 
manhood; that his natural sentiments are right in gen- 
eral, and need training and direction, rather than nox- 
ious weeds to be extirpated and replaced by flowers 
transplanted from the teacher's mind. Thus the pur- 
suit of his own ambition and his natural interest in good 
reading will lead him on to the most serious efforts for 
a literary education. 

Facts leave us, faculties never. No student who has 
reached the junior year doubts this. He has forgotten 
the tables for compound numbers, he is unable to name 
the figures of speech. But he knows that he himself, 
his essential manhood, in its intellectual and moral as 
well as its physical self, has been developing thews, has 
gained power to grapple with problems of much more 
importance. He even goes at times to the dangerous 
extreme of nonchalance for fact. In his studies, includ- 
ing his study of literature, he will appreciate an effort 
on the part of the teacher to form proper tastes and 
develop powers of doing within him. He will travel 
laboriously through disjointed facts of literary history 
and literary origins with an inward protest; but he will 
eagerly labor for the literary taste which he sees can 
interpret whatever literature is presented to it; for he 
is really anxious to get that invaluable secret of which 
Mr. Edward Dowden speaks the interpretation of 
one good book, and by it the power over many. Hence 
he will be ready to study that in literature which has 
essential worth, but will be less moved by historical, 
technical, or other adventitious interest. He will wel- 
come his Shakespeare, but care little for Shakespeare's 
antecedents. He will care less for origins than for life. 
And so the great treasure for which his teacher will 
ever be held in grateful remembrance will be the sound

judgment and sympathetic heart so necessary for en- 
trance into the kingdom of intellectual and moral life. 
I do not wish to be understood as attacking the in- 
vestigation of the historical and adventitious. I simply 
speak from the standpoint of the growing young mind. 
Once let it arrive at its proper maturity, and it will see 
these things in their right relations and work for them 
accordingly. But let no teacher hasten this time unad-

A WORD UNFITLY SPOKEN. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Many of your readers besides the personal friends of 
Professor Ely must have read with satisfaction the let- 
ter in your issue of Sept. 1, headed "The New York 
' Nation ' and Its ' College Anarchist.' " The writer is 
clearly very much in earnest, and he does his theme jus- 
tice so far as he chooses to go. He omits, however, to 
note a material point upon which he as well as others 
who have canvassed the matter might well have en- 
larged in the interests of sanity and precision in current 
economic discussion. It is surely high time that news- 
papers which assume to instruct people and even to 
speak ex cathedra on social questions should themselves 
grasp such elementary facts as that " socialist " and 
" anarchist " are not interchangeable terms of political 
philosophy. To urge this is certainly not to stickle for 
any metaphysical nicety of definition. Whatever social- 
ism may mean, it does not mean anti-socialism; and to 
style a man of Dr. Ely's views an " anarchist " is to be- 
tray a looseness of thinking and a vagueness of element- 
ary conceptions not very consistent with special preten- 
sions to accuracy. No friend of " The Nation " will 
willingly admit that, in the case in point, it stooped to 
the methods of " The Rowdy Journal," and called Pro- 
fessor Ely " anarchist," instead of socialist, simply be- 
cause the former term is the more abusive and vitriolic 
of the two. We prefer to ascribe the use of the unfor- 
tunate epithet to passing inadvertence rather than de- 
liberate scurrility. Inadvertence, however, in a journal 
of standing, may prove to be a serious matter to the 
victim of it. One does not expect much in the way of 
technical precision from the ordinary newspaper, which 
is admittedly made, like the razors in the ballad, " to 
sell." Neither its readers nor its victims take its epi- 
thets in other than a very Pickwickian sense ; but when 
a journal like " The Nation " styles this or that teacher 
or preacher an " anarchist," the public justly assumes 
that it means to characterize and not merely to abuse 
him in short, that it means what it says. For instance, 
when the good people of Wisconsin learned through its 
columns that the Director of the School of Economics 
in their State University was, presumably, moulding the 
young gentlemen in his charge into embryo Mosts and 
Bakounines, they promptly proceeded to investigate him. 
Probably the next cry of " Wolf ! " from the same quar- 
ter will receive less attention. To lump socialists and 
anarchists together, as is sometimes done, on the ground 
that both schools are dissatisfied with existing civil ar- 
rangements, seems a poor quibble. The classification 
simply makes a socialist, or an anarchist, or both, of 
every man of us whom nature has favored with the nor- 
mal capacity for thinking and feeling. Even the hardiest 
exponent of newspaper " cocksureness " would hesitate 
to rank, say, Professor Huxley with the "dangerous 
classes"; yet we find him saying: "Even the best of 



modern civilizations appears to me to exhibit a condi- 
tion of mankind which neither embodies any worthy 
ideal nor even possesses the merit of stability. I do 
not hesitate to express the opinion, that, if there is no 
hope of improvement of the condition of the greater 
part of the human family. ... I should hail the ad- 
vent of some kindly comet, which would sweep the whole 
affair away, as a desirable consummation." If there be 
anything in the writings of even our " College Anarch- 
ist " savoring more strongly of the gospel of discontent 
than this, I have failed to see it. w. R. K.

"THE FREEDOM OF TEACHING." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The editorial in your last issue discussing the recent 
heresy trial in our State University, and incidentally 
the freedom of teaching, meets my cordial approval in 
the main. I cannot agree, however, that it is an " out- 
rage " to question the teaching of any person employed 
by the State in a proper case. Indeed, I believe it to 
be the paramount duty of the board of management of 
every educational institution to know that no instruc- 
tion is given subversive to the power which employs it. 
To decline to do this, the governing body would, in my 
judgment, be recreant to the important trust reposed 
in it. I do not wish to be understood that there should 
be any attempt at dictation on the part of governing 
boards. No teacher worthy the name would tolerate 
that. But I insist that teachers of whatever experience 
should not "be practically unassailable," and should not 
" be absolutely free to do their own work in their own 
way." In other words, I hold that teachers, like all the 
rest of the great army of the employed, should be al- 
ways accountable to some authority or power greater 
than they, yet freely granting to them the largest lati- 
tude and freedom in matters of detail and routine. I 
hold that in matters in which the State is concerned, 
the State, through its appropriate officers, ought to be, 
as a matter of right, consulted. So in the sense here 
indicated there should be a supervisory power and con- 
trol somewhere, not to interfere with " untrammelled 
research and the unbiased pursuit of truth," but to make 
impossible the instruction and advocacy of the wild and 
untried theories, systems, and notions of mere partisans, 
whose erudition is not above suspicion. We want the 
fullest freedom of teaching. But let that teaching be 
always subject to the scrutiny of the power which em- 
ploys it, not for the purpose of unreasonably placing; 
the brakes on intellectual progress, not to hamper meth- 
ods of teaching, not to prevent the right of personal in- 
vestigation of any question, but because there should be 
accountability to some authority. I feel certain that 
in this position I am sustained by many members of the 
teaching profession. DUANE MOWRY. 

Milwaukee, Wis., Sept. 12, 1894. 

[The question at issue in the editorial referred 
to is precisely that of what constitutes a "proper 
case " for State interference. Such interference, we 
contended, would only be justified by an " offense of 
the grossest sort." The time for inquiry and vigil- 
ance is when a man's appointment to an important 
university post is in question ; that time is past, except 
for some extraordinary emergency, when he has be- 
gun to perform the duties of his professorship.

A SUNBEAM FROM THE THIRTEENTH 
CENTURY. * 



M. Paul Sabatier's Life of St. Francis of 
Assisi " is not an easy volume to review. The 
author confesses that it was hard to write. The 
translator would perhaps acknowledge that 
it was hard to put into English. If Gallic 
measure and precision seemed unsuited to 
the expression of expansive Italian emotion, 
perhaps certain delicate shades of French 
sentiment were difficult to transfer into their 
English equivalents. Some question of rival 
editions is said to have hurried the translator's 
pace and allowed small opportunity of revis- 
ion. We have not the original at hand, but 
there must be something wrong on page 445, 
where several most legendary authorities are 
said to " sin only by excessive critical scru- 
ples." The context suggests that for " sin 
only " we should read " hardly err." A single 
such lapse may be forgiven in so long a labor. 
Mrs. Houghton's English is in the main clear 
and simple, telling the story without compelling 
attention to the fact that it is a translation. 

M. Sabatier is not a novice in the art of bi- 
ography. His masterly volume upon St. Paul, 
a few years since, prepared a welcome in ad- 
vance for any of its author's subsequent writ- 
ing. There is a wide gap between the first 
century and the thirteenth, between the Apos- 
tle to the Gentiles and the founder of the Fran- 
ciscans ; but each period and each character 
unfolds its secrets under one method of labo- 
rious investigation, sound judgment, and sym- 
pathetic vision. The author looks out of his 
own eyes and suffers no mists of tradition to 
befog him. Yet he is no iconoclast. He rev- 
erences the essential humanity of his heroes. 
They may be shadowed by the hood of the 
monk or transfigured by the halo of saint or 
apostle, but they are still men, to be helped 
down from their pedestals and restored to life 
and motion. 

It is not strange if they seem cramped at 
first, and if they limp a little. M. Sabatier is 
less clear and logical in his narrative than we 
could desire. It is not always easy to see how 
far he is leading us. Perhaps his position 
makes him cautious and induces him partially 
to veil his results. Perhaps, in protracted grop-

ing among mediaeval chronicles, he has blunted 
the edge of his French instinct for form and 
order, or perhaps he has approximated too 
closely to the nature of his subject. St. Francis 
was a great heart rather than a logical intelli- 
gence. He had the " vision " rather than the 
" faculty " divine. Shall we say that his bi- 
ographer seems rather to feel him than pre- 
cisely to comprehend or clearly interpret him ? 
After all, M. Sabatier cannot be expected to 
be altogether of the thirteenth century. His 
book attracts and vexes you. You love the 
writer and are out of patience with him through 
alternate pages and paragraphs. He inserts a 
parenthetic moral or rhapsody in the midst of 
a dispassionate examination of contemporary 
authorities. You are not in the mood for it 
and resent the abrupt transition. 

M. Sabatier has critically dealt with his am- 
ple materials. He tells us that few lives in 
history are so abundantly provided with docu- 
ments as that of St. Francis. They consist of 
his well authenticated writings ; of contempo- 
rary or early memoirs ; of numerous papers of 
Cardinal Ugolini (afterwards Gregory IX.), 
the man who, " without perhaps excepting St. 
Francis, most profoundly fashioned the Fran- 
ciscan institutions "; of pontifical bulls relating 
to the order during the critical years of its in- 
fancy ; of chronicles penned by its first asso- 
ciates, including that volume of fairy tales, the 
Fioretti, in which we behold things not as they 
were but as they seemed to that imaginative 
and childlike generation ; and of other records 
by those not connected with the order, but 
brought within the range of its founder's magic 
influence, writings which still " vibrate with 
enthusiasm," while often " absolutely fantastic " 
as to the details which they relate. 

The first life of St. Francis, by Thomas of 
Celano, is a party pamphlet, to be entitled 
" The Legend of Gregory IX." It was written 
soon after the death of its subject, in the midst 
of an eager struggle between those members 
of the Franciscan order who wanted only what 
St. Francis had wanted, and those who were 
bent on remoulding his work into closer har- 
mony with the ecclesiasticism of the period. 
At least five years before his death the Papacy 
had prevailed ; the laic and popular elements 
of the work had been suppressed ; Francis had 
been gently set aside from any practical con- 
trol of affairs, and transfigured into a remote 
glory as saint and founder. Twenty years 
later Thomas of Celano, becoming better in- 
formed of the meaning of the struggle, wrote

a revised and corrected biography, in which, 
however, the strife of factions still occupies the 
foreground, " history becomes the vehicle of a 
thesis, and instead of a poem we have a cleverly 
constructed catalogue." 

The memoir of the " Three Companions," 
the near associates of the founder through the 
formative period of the order, is very precious, 
and though in its present condition but a mu- 
tilated fragment, is still " the finest piece of 
Franciscan literature." The legends of the 
Fioretti convey the spirit of the saint, and 
" while charming as literature, are not value- 
less as history." You smile at the incidents 
and inhale with gratitude the atmosphere. 
Such things never happened, perchance, yet 
the coloring is vivid and true. Better than 
any cool daylight is the light that never was 
on sea or land. 

It was in 1260, a generation after the death 
of St. Francis, that St. Bonaventura, in the 
supposed interest of his order, prepared a new 
biography. It was voluminous but lifeless, a 
compilation with a purpose, meant to steer a 
safe middle course between " the Scylla of 
Yes and the Charybdis of No," and so satisfy 
at once the Zealots of the old Rule and the 
Liberal Constructionists who had explained it 
away into something quite different from the 
intention of St. Francis. This biography was 
declared the one authorized version, and all 
other lives were ordered to be destroyed as 
unofficial and conflicting. From these varied 
sources, with many sidelights from other quar- 
ters, M. Sabatier has constructed his picture. 
It is a portrait by an impressionist of a winning 
and simple and wise-hearted lover of mankind. 

That was his distinction. The hero of Charles 
Lamb's tragedy of " John Woodvil " describes 
himself as " in some sort a general lover." 
Being asked to specify " What is it you love " ? 
he answers 

" Simply all things that live, 
From the crook'd worm to man's imperial form 
And God-resembling likeness. The poor fly 
That makes short holiday in the sun-beam 
And dies by some child's hand. The feeble bird, 
With little wings, yet greatly venturous 
In the upper sky. The fish in the other element 
That knows no touch of eloquence." 

That was St. Francis. He loved simply all 
things that live. They were his brothers, his 
sisters, from the insects, the birds, the fishes, 
to the wolf of the Appenines or the hardly less 
predatory inhabitant of the Umbrian plain. 
Nay, to him sun, moon, and stars were of the 
one great family, and He that made them was 
loved no less simply and naturally than they. 



And just here the life of Francis becomes ob- 
scure, and to men of colder frame and less child- 
like spirit, scarcely intelligible. What gush- 
ing nonsense all that talk about his brother, 
the sun those sermons to the birds and the 
fishes, the rabbits and the wolves ! It is com- 
paratively easy to guess at the processes of a 
large intellect, but who can trace and measure 
the pulse-beats of a great throbbing heart? 
Even in his lifetime those nearest to him mis- 
conceived and misinterpreted him. They were 
dull as the disciples about our Lord. They 
meant to echo him, but lost the key and changed 
the tone. They refracted his white light even 
in transmitting and reflecting it. He, a spir- 
itual troubadour, " God's juggler," gay as a min- 
strel, soaring and singing as a lark, went, " in 
a rapture of love, from cottage to cottage, from 
castle to castle, preaching absolute poverty," 
absolute freedom from wordly care, nothing for 
self, everything for others ; and the sweet dar- 
ing strain charmed the ear and touched the 
soul, but perplexed the timid judgment. " That 
buoyant enthusiasm, that boundless idealism, 
could not last." The order was open to every- 
one ; and everyone, after the manner of men, 
fashioned it in his own likeness and wore his 
rue with a difference. For the unsystematic 
mind of St. Francis had been averse to any 
elaborate organization. He, and those drawn 
to him in spirit, undertook the simplest follow- 
ing of Jesus, the reproduction of that holy life 
under the changed conditions of their time. It 
was a monastic age, and the pallor of the clois- 
ter touched even the healthiest cheek. It was 
an ascetic age, and it was hard to escape its 
influence and not despise and maltreat the body 
in the interest of the soul. It was an eccle- 
siastical age, and it was hard to see that the 
laity were indeed the Church, and the clergy 
but its working officials. It was a dogmatic 
age, and men lived under a pressure of author- 
ity that cramped all independent thinking. But 
in spite of his time, not by virtue of an extra- 
ordinary intellect but of a great heart, hardly 
conscious of his departure from the mood of 
his period, Francis went out for himself into a 
large liberty, and sought to enfranchise others. 
His Rule was little more than a brief extract 
from the words of Jesus in the Gospels. Catch 
that spirit, he seemed to say, and all the rest 
will follow. It was enough indeed for him, and 
for those who stood nearest him. But pres- 
ently the dense environment encroached upon 
this first childlike simplicity. The mood and 
fashion of the age stole over it. The little un-

worldly group of brothers were speedily com- 
pacted into a drilled group of mendicants. The 
Rule, which the worn saint with his dying 
breath conjured the brethren never to change 
by gloss or comment, soon was authoritatively 
interpreted into more definite conclusions, and 
subtly explained away, with wire-drawn dis- 
tinctions between the founder's counsels and 
his commands, " until poverty, as St. Francis 
understood it, became a memory." Men " for- 
got the freshness, the Italian gayety, the sunny 
poetry " of his conception. Admiring, rever- 
ing, canonizing him, they thought to give body 
and force to his somewhat vague and ineffect- 
ive dreams. They magnified and distorted the 
image of their saint. They lost sight of what 
he was, and praised him for what he was not 
and never sought to be. They made dull prose 
out of all his poetry. The institution grew as 
the impulse which originated it dwindled. There 
was a new order in the Roman Church, a new 
saint on the Roman Calendar ; but the fine 
dream of St. Francis had been dissipated. It 
had fled to the limbo of dreams that were 
dreamed too soon, of fond ideals of which the 
world was still unworthy. Meanwhile, the peo- 
ple, with their unsophisticated hearts, cherished 
the memory of the dreamer, loved this " gen- 
eral lover," and so came dimly to know him, to 
love and know him as the chiefs of his order 
never loved or knew. The popular imagina- 
tion of Italy retains his image, while grave his- 
torians, biased by preconceptions, unfamiliar 
with childlike genius touched with heavenly 
radiance, have fumbled over their records and 
missed the meaning of such gracious, guileless 
sainthood. M. Sabatier, by sheer sympathy of 
spirit, has caught the clue, and put it into his 
reader's hands. If its windings seem some- 
times obscure and labyrinthine, it is yet well 
worth their following. For character of this 
large-hearted sort is rare. The pilgrims that 
are minstrels, the saints that can laugh and 
sing, the indiscriminate lovers of God and man 
and every living thing in earth and heaven, 
are a scant company a precious possession of 
the race, not to be forgotten through the ages. 
The mitred bishops and the hooded doctors 
pass, and the dust settles upon their footprints. 
But Love, the buoyant, wayward, blundering 
child, goes singing on his way, and is immor- 
tal. 

St. Francis, in an age " when men had all 
the vices except triviality and all the virtues 
save moderation," when Nature was a realm of 
magic, and all imaginations were peopled with 



visions of heaven and hell, was " not born with 
nimbus and aureole." He could say with the 
chief Captain, " With a great sum obtained I 
this freedom." At his own grave cost he en- 
tered upon his mission. He was a man of the 
people, yet at home with the privileged classes. 
He was loyal to the Church, which he persisted 
in beholding in its evangelical ideal, while im- 
patient with the actual faltering reality. He 
was a poet-prophet, no mere founder of an or- 
der. He claimed from the Papacy the privi- 
lege of owning nothing, which proved to be 
more than the Roman Curia could grant. The 
poverty he sought and sang was not a disabil- 
ity but a power, the bird's careless freedom 
on its bough, the flower's fragrant joy in the 
sunshine. The religion of the time could con- 
ceive of no such glad liberty. It brooded over 
its own soul, and sadly shrivelled from inac- 
tion. It tried to love God without serving man, 
and found in a God so loved a Moloch, stern 
and awful. St. Francis caught the secret of 
Jesus. He gave himself to the right hand and 
the left, gave his best to the neediest. His aim 
was to awaken love by loving, and transform 
character through self -consecration. It was an 
innocent, a beneficent, a Christlike aim. Such, 
however, was the unripeness of the time that 
his work was wrested from his hands and 
warped from his purpose. It was an effort 
after an ideal even now unattained, for while 
" the Revolution made us all kings, neither the 
Revolution nor the Reformation was able to 
make us all priests." That is the task that 
lies before the leader of souls to-day, and M. 
Sabatier has bravely forwarded it.

A LIBRARY OF HISTORY.* 



To the present writer, as doubtless to most 
literary workers, the need of an encyclopedia 
of purely historical information has long been 
apparent ; and he once began, in a somewhat 
desultory way, to collate material for a work 
of that nature. He proceeded far enough to 
learn something of the amount of labor involved 
in such a work, and thus to appreciate the ex- 
tent of this labor when performed by another. 
A cursory glance at the first two volumes of

Mr. J. N. Larned's " History for Ready Ref- 
erence and Topical Reading " is sufficient to 
discover that they represent years of patient 
labor and exhaustive study. That Mr. Lamed 
is President of the American Library Associa- 
tion and Superintendent of the Buffalo Public 
Library implies that he has had unsurpassed 
facilities for carrying out to a satisfactory con- 
clusion his conception of a cyclopedia and 
index of history. The work is not a mere dic- 
tionary of dates. It recognizes history as em- 
bracing far more than chronology or narratives 
of events. In its preparation the entire field 
of historical literature has been laid under con- 
tribution. The articles are composed of ex- 
tracts from recognized historical experts, to 
whom due credit is given. References are 
freely given by which the study of the various 
topics can be still further extended. Abund- 
ant opportunity is found to judge of the edit- 
or's discriminating judgment and critical skill 
in an examination of the following important 
articles in the first two volumes, ranging from 
twenty to two hundred pages in length : Amer- 
ica ; American Aborigines ; Athens ; Austria ; 
Balkan and Danubian States ; Barbary States ; 
Canada ; China ; Christianity (down to the 
tenth century) ; Education ; Egypt ; England ; 
Florence ; France ; and Germany. The editor's 
only original contribution to either of these vol- 
umes is a historical review of Europe, covering 
seventy-four pages. This is sufficient, how- 
ever, to illustrate his ability to handle lucidly 
a complex subject. 

It is difficult to give in brief space a clear 
idea of the comprehensiveness of the work. But 
it is partially indicated by the fact that, the 
above-named important papers being set aside, 
each volume contains about eight hundred sub- 
jects fully treated, though in length varying 
from a single paragraph to several pages ; and 
about twenty-four hundred titles introduced as 
cross references. Biographical and geograph- 
ical names are thus treated. The wide scope 
of the work is further indicated by its treat- 
ment of such subjects as Education (an im- 
portant review of the history of education 
brought down to include the University Ex- 
tension movement), Electrical Discovery, Fac- 
tory Legislation, Debt Legislation, and Civil 
Service Reform in England and America ; by 
its giving, in extenso, the constitutions of thir- 
teen existing nations, as well as cross references 
to at least ten others ; and by explaining many 
terms of historical significance (e.g. " Bossism," 
" Sherman's Bummers," " Contraband," and 



" Creole "), for whose origin and meaning fu- 
ture generations will undoubtedly inquire. Ap- 
parently the editor is more willing to incur the 
fault of including too much than too little. 

The two volumes now ready are to be fol- 
lowed by three others at intervals of about three 
months. The paging is continuous throughout 
the volumes. The work has reached page 1564. 
The maps, supplied by Alan C. Reiley, are new 
and valuable. A> H. NOLL. 



RECENT STUDIES IN SOCIOLOGY.* 



The table of contents of the " Introduction to the 
Study of Society," by Professors Small and Vin- 
cent, is, to a student of sociology, a most appetiz- 
ing menu. Here we find discussed, in pure and 
strong English, the origin and scope of sociology, 
the natural history of society, social anatomy, phy- 
siology, pathology, and psychology. By Descriptive 
Sociology the authors mean " the organization of all 
the positive knowledge of man and of society fur- 
nished by the sciences and sub-sciences now desig- 
nated or included under the titles Biology, Anthropol- 
ogy, Psychology, Ethnology, Demography, History, 
Political and Economic Science, and Ethics." By 
Statical Sociology is meant " a qualitative and ap- 
proximate account of the society which ought to be. 
Social Statics is, in brief, social ethics." It is de- 
clared that a distinction should be made, in the 
interest of clearness of thought and of practical 
efficiency, between Statical and Dynamic Sociology. 
This last " proceeds to investigate means of employ- 
ing all the available forces of society in the interest 
of the largest human welfare." The present vol- 
ume does not attempt to go beyond Descriptive So- 
ciology. It is a " laboratory guide " for sociological 
observation and investigation. It directs attention 
upon significant facts and to the essential relations

of facts to each other. The reading of Book One 
will require the closest attention of trained students. 
In Book Two, " The Natural History of a Society," 
we have an account of the growth of a city from 
the time a single settler took his homestead on the 
prairie, through the stages of village and town and 
the transition stage, to the hour when a highly com- 
plex commercial centre conies into existence. Every 
statement is illustrated by concrete examples. The 
effort is made to hold attention to social reality, just 
as in a physical or biological laboratory the teacher 
seeks to keep the student's eyes fastened upon the 
matter of investigation. In the later Books the au- 
thors return to exposition of social doctrine. With- 
out slavish imitation of Schaffle, we have here the 
essential elements of his exposition for the first time 
in intelligible English ; but there is original treat- 
ment with local illustrations. In this work we have 
the pioneer text-book for college classes and begin- 
ners in sociology. It does not claim to offer con- 
tributions to the science, and yet so clear an expo- 
sition of so complicated a subject may legitimately 
be regarded as an actual addition to the discussion. 
The chapter on the scope of sociology will provoke 
a debate which will promote the settlement of the 
vexed question of the place of sociology in the cir- 
cle of the sciences and in a course of study. 

The romance of Mr. Howells, " A Traveler from 
Altruria," belongs in the same general category with 
Plato's " Republic," More's "Utopia," Campanella's 
" City of the Sun," and Bellamy's " Looking Back- 
ward." Every man creates for himself a picture 
of a future perfect society in his imagination, but 
once in many years some poetic mind embodies the 
vision in a description. No harm is done, so long 
as the dream is not seriously regarded as a working 
programme to be carried out in details. Fortunately 
these visions are contradictory, and one illusion cor- 
rects another. This prophetic spirit, hovering over 
those who toil along the dusty way of pain-bought 
progress, cheers the pilgrims and keeps up heart- 
courage for the journey and the strife. This seems 
to be the social function of those who write novels 
and romances. The humiliating contrast between 
our own ideals and conduct awakens the conscience 
and sets us upon immediate correction of obvious 
evils. Mr. Howells's Altrurian traveller leaves us 
angry at his rebukes, but reflecting on our deeds. 
Not in vain has he visited this green earth ; not 
in cruelty and wrath has he rudely shocked our 
apathetic complacency. 

In Mr. Benjamin Kidd's " Social Evolution " we 
have a work whose popular form, earnest spirit, and 
bristling paradox insure a wide reading. Buckle 
taught that the intellectual factor is dominant in 
social progress, and that morality is stationary. 
Draper represented that religion, as embodied in the 
Church, was the foe of advance. Marx and many 
other socialists look to materiah'stic and economic 
interests for their revolutionary forces. Here is a 
writer who regards the intellectual factor as a sub- 



ordinate element, religion as the mainspring. But 
the teachers of religion must beware of the Greeks 
who bring such gifts, for religion is not " rational," 
it is distinctly "irrational." The doctrine is so 
startling that it must be stated in the author's own 
words (pp. 185-186) : 

" The most essential conclusions to which we have 
been led . . . are as follows. First, that the process 
of social development which has been taking place, and 
which is still in progress in our Western civilization, is 
not the product of the intellect, but that the motive force 
behind it has had its seat and origin in that fund of al- 
truistic feeling with which our civilization has become 
equipped. Second, that this altruistic development, and 
the deepening and softening of character which has ac- 
companied it, are the direct and peculiar product of the 
religious system on which our civilization is founded. 
Third, that to science the significance of the resulting 
process of social evolution, in which all the people are 
being slowly brought into the rivalry of existence on 
equal conditions, consists in the single fact that this 
rivalry has tended to be thereby raised to the highest 
degree of efficiency as a cause of progress it has ever 
attained. The peoples affected by the process have been 
thereby worked up to a state of social efficiency which 
has given them preponderating advantages in the strug- 
gle for existence with other sections of the race. . . . 
The intellect continues to be a most important factor in 
enabling the system to which the individual belongs to 
maintain its place in the rivalry of life; but it is no 
longer the prime factor." 

These positions will not be read without strong 
protests. The author emphasizes the radical and 
inevitable conflict between social and individual 
interests. But the other side of social progress is 
slightly treated : the increase in numbers and sat- 
isfactions in society as it exists ; the improved con- 
dition even of paupers and criminals ; and the fact 
that all this advance is due to that social order which 
gives security to the weak. It is not altogether 
" irrational " for the strong and rich to serve the 
commonwealth, since in its prosperity alone they 
are prosperous. And as for the weakest members 
of society, they owe existence itself to this progress. 
Other questions naturally arise. Will society con- 
tinue to obey an " irrational " impulse ? If the 
sanction of an order cannot be found in human life 
itself, whence can it originate ? Is it a wise use of 
language to call that alone " rational " conduct which 
secures the immediate individual satisfaction ? Was 
the death of Socrates " irrational " ? Was the hero- 
ism of those who fell at Gettysburg insane? Can 
there be a permanent conflict between reason and 
conscience, intellect and altruism ? Many such prob- 
lems and paradoxes will present themselves to the 
reader of this interesting and suggestive book. 

Mr. Charles Booth gives the world another mon- 
umental study of the depressed classes, in a work 
entitled " The Aged Poor in England and Wales." 
The object of this book is " to make more possible 
and profitable a study of the six hundred and forty- 
eight separate lessons in administration which the 
conduct of the Poor Law Unions of England and

Wales affords." We have here something more than 
a careful and complete description of facts. The 
method of collecting the material is very instructive. 
The causal relations between the facts of depend- 
ence in old age and the domestic, economic, educa- 
tional and ecclesiastical conditions are distinctly 
brought out. The various results of the diverse 
methods of administration are disclosed and tabu- 
lated. The book is more than a political study, more 
than an economic study; it is a social study. The 
entire social system, so far as it bears on the prob- 
lem of the aged poor, is analyzed, and its working 
explained by reference to fundamental and univer- 
sal social forces. It is a truly sociological method, 
fruitful and comprehensive. Mr. Booth is a busi- 
ness man who has the outlook of the man of science. 
He gives means and time to the pursuit of social 
inquiries. We stand in need of such men in this 
country. If our National Conference of Charities 
and Corrections could secure the services of such a 
man its lame and imperfect inquiries into the facts 
of out-door relief could in a few years be set for- 
ward to satisfactory condition. A few illustrations 
of results may be set down. Taking a census of a 
single day in 1892 : 

" While only 5 per cent, of the population are paupers, 
taking all ages together, and not half of that proportion 
taking the active years of life alone, the rate is about 
10 per cent, between 60 and 65, 20 per cent, between 
65 and 70, 30 per cent, between 70 and 75, and not 
much less than 40 per cent, over 75." 

These figures would be confirmed by the similar 
inquiry of Dr. Victor Bohmert in seventy-seven Ger- 
man cities. To see the full force of such statistics 
we must separate the <k working classes " from others, 
and then we find that amongst these and small 
traders "the rate of pauperism for all over 65 is 
not less than 40 to 45 per cent." That means that 
nearly half the working people of England must 
look forward to public support if they reach old age. 
It is such facts as these which demand some better 
method of providing for the last years of life than 
any hitherto discovered. 

Professor Giddings, whose transfer to the chair 
of Sociology in Columbia College marks distinct 
progress in the new study, gives us, in his work on 
"The Theory of Sociology," a brief sketch of "the 
theoretical positions that will be more fully described 
and defended in a work on the Principles of Sociol- 
ogy, which is now well advanced towards comple- 
tion." This treatise, which embodies the substance 
of previous publications, discusses the sociological 
idea, the promise, problems, and method of sociology. 
It is of exceeding interest to all students who are 
seeking to define the field of sociological investiga- 
tion. 

In " Random Roamings," by the Rev. Augustus 
Jessopp, we have the leisurely description of a culti- 
vated Anglican clergyman who finds time to inves- 
tigate the archaeology, history, and contemporary 
conditions of rural England. The aristocratic clergy- 



man's point of view is by no means concealed in 
the chapters on "A Scheme for Clergy Pensions" 
and " Something about Village Almshouses." He 
feels like patronizing the poor, and is not sanguine 
about free schools. 

" The English Peasant," by Mr. Richard Heath, 
is a book of a different kind, written by a man with 
the descriptive powers of an artist and the sympa- 
thies of a modern layman, deeply religious but not 
sectarian. The author has travelled on foot over 
much of England, and delivers the testimony of an 
eye-witness. He can appreciate the value of free 
schools, of agricultural trades-unions, of voluntary 
efforts of church and chapel, of kindly patronage 
of rich squires, and of the narrow and fanatical, but 
morally earnest, denominational preachers. 

The able Secretary of the English Labor Com- 
mission gives the public in a volume of 277 pages 
a complete survey of contemporary schemes, Brit- 
ish and Continental, for caring for the unemployed. 
The services of trades unions, labor bureaus, news- 
papers, labor colonies, municipal agencies, and many 
associations, are here described and their relative 
values weighed. The book should be read by those 
who will this winter have to face the problems of 
want in our cities. 

Professor John R. Commons has collected several 
papers on the relation of the church to social re- 
forms into a neat volume, which he entitles " Social 
Reform and the Church." He urges that the mighty 
emotional forces of religion should be utilized for 
the amelioration of human life on this planet. Pau- 
perism, politics, temperance movements, municipal 
monopolies, and proportional representation are dis- 
cussed from this standpoint. 

The " Handbook of Sociological Information " 
prepared by the City Vigilance League of New York 
will furnish a convenient list of books and articles, 
and accounts of typical beneficent institutions in the 
metropolis. In preparing the bibliography, the edit- 
ors have sought the assistance of specialists in many 
lines of investigation and experience. It is not in- 
tended to be a complete bibliography, but a selected 
list for immediate use of busy social leaders. 

The works here noticed are typical of the various 
methods by which the study of society is to be ad- 
vanced. We need the broad study of fundamental 
principles revealed in historical investigation, the 
minute study of contemporary facts in a limited 
field, and even the inspiring ideals of romance. It 
is important to determine the limits of each special 
social science, and the theory of the relation of 
science to art. It is also essential to progress that 
all the conscious and unconscious experiments of so- 
ciety be investigated and their results revealed. This 
investigation may yield a fragmentary product and 
yet be conducted by a scientific method. It is some- 
times objected to sociology that its ability to direct 
social action falls far short of completeness. But 
this is true of each special social science, even of

those whose simple character made an earlier de- 
velopment possible. Sociological literature shows 
the effort to consider all the facts of all classes, an 
attempt at coordination of all factors in thought and 
in practical action. Most of the works here exam- 
ined are " sociological " only so far as they supply 
fragments of raw material for scientific treatment.

EXTREMES OF FAITH.* 



Mr. Knox Little's treatise on Sacerdotalism is a 
book chiefly fitted to interest those in the Church 
of England who are striving to maintain and re- 
store its current beliefs and usages, and those who 
would subject them to the modification of advanc- 
ing thought. The controversy lies in a single Church 
between a conservative and a radical or reformatory 
tendency. The interest of the book, outside of this 
narrow relation, is in leading the liberal mind to a 
more cheerful recognition of the great variety of 
ways in which a true spiritual development is open 
to men. The book is very positive and exact in its 
belief, and yet one feels that this force of assertion 
and precision of method simply express the idiosyn- 
crasies of a certain class of minds idiosyncrasies 
which we do well to respect, and well to disregard. 
The author is a warm advocate of sacerdotalism. 
"I, my dear friend, as you know, am a sacerdotalist 
from head to heel. It is difficult for me to under- 
stand how a Christian can be anything else " (page 
2). Some of the points included in sacerdotalism 
are given in the preface : " There are objective truths 
which must never be forgotten the fact of the vis- 
ible church, the truth of a spiritual succession of the 
ministry, the necessary office of bishops, the real 
functions of the priesthood, the effectual force of 
sacraments, the practical value of the penitential 
system" (p. x.). The book is made up of four let- 
ters on Confession and Absolution ; Fasting, Com- 
munion and Eucharistic Worship ; the Real Pres- 
ence and the Eucharistic Sacrifice ; the Apostolic 
Ministry. As the volume is drawn out by the pres- 
ence in the Church of England of a strong tendency 
to regard these beliefs as outworn, it is necessarily 
controversial. This contention is but a small por- 
tion of that universal conflict which lies between the

old and the new. The more coherent and consist- 
ent temper may be found with those who maintain 
the old, but the more profoundly penetrative and 
constructive thought is with those who see and seek 
the new. The reader will find in the volume an 
earnest and comparatively compact statement of the 
attitude of those who cling to the old, walk in it, 
and live by it. The defense is essentially that of 
the more conservative branch of the Tractarians, 
that the Thirty-nine Articles are directed against the 
abuses, not the uses, of the earlier forms of belief. 

There is a very striking contrast between the 
attitude of mind indicated in this volume, and that 
which gave rise to the one on " The Meaning and 
the Method of Life." The author of " Sacerdotal- 
ism " adheres tenaciously many would say ser- 
vilely to the positions in faith which have long 
been held. The author of "The Meaning and 
Method of Life " goes forth quite by himself, and 
in a path in which very few are likely to follow 
him. A discrepancy so wide as this seems to re- 
flect discredit on human faculties. Reason is not 
nearly so dominant oftentimes least dominant, 
when thought to be most dominant in the action 
of mind as the forms of discussion seem to imply. 
We fling and catch the ball in groups, but each 
group has its own ball and its own game. "The 
Meaning and the Method of Life " is a book not 
easily read, nor will it reward most minds for the 
labor. The author regards matter as eternal and 
of infinite extension. It makes no revelation of any 
supreme intelligence. Life, personified as a single 
energetic and intelligent agent, is in contention with 
these physical conditions, and slowly subjects them 
to itself. This often baffled but steadily conquer- 
ing intelligence is God, whose struggles and vic- 
tories we share. " The God we see daily at work 
all over the globe is primarily and essentially Life " 
(p. 15). The difficulties and ills and blessings of 
the world lie along the pathway of this slow evolu- 
tion of life. Here is found the promise of victory. 
These ideas are capable in their treatment of much 
poetry and pathos, and these the author liberally 
bestows on them. His convictions are as positive 
as if half the human race stood by his side. Many 
of the principles by whose aid he so boldly inter- 
prets the world are sound, but he grades the facts 
to them rather than ascends and descends by means 
of them, and winds in and out in fellowship with 
the infinitely variable things about him. 

The third volume in our list, " The Question of 
Unity," is made up of an expression of opinion by 
leading men, chiefly in the Presbyterian, Congre- 
gational, Episcopal, and Baptist churches, concern- 
ing Christian Unity. These opinions were called 
out by a paper of Dr. Shield on the Historic Epis- 
copate a discussion of a possible unity of churches 
on the basis of the Chicago-Lambeth Articles. The 
writers agree quite generally, both as to the great 
desirability, and also as to the present impossibility, 
of Church Unity. The trouble would seem to be

that the notion of Church Unity, secured on the 
basis of a creed narrowed and sifted in its terms, 
is embarrassed by precisely the same difficulty which 
has given rise to existing divisions to-wit, attach- 
ing too much relative importance to the intellectual 
formulae of faith. A unity restored by a new form- 
ula, a unity resting on a formula, is of very secondary 
moment. The intellectual discussions and dissen- 
sions of the past have played a part in the devel- 
opment of Christian thought. They cannot be 
wiped out. Farther consideration is as likely to 
extend and deepen divisions as to efface them. The 
evil does not lie in these discrepancies of thought, 
but in the false position given to them. Unity is 
before the Church, not behind it. It is to be found 
in its action, in the objects it pursues, and not in 
its speculations. Of the papers in this volume, Dr. 
Ecob's seems to us the most faithful and just. He 
discards a unity of creeds, and counsels a unity of 
effort. Those who urge a formal unity in faith, 
will find that they are simply reviving old conflicts ; 
blowing the ashes off the burning embers. 

Our fourth volume is " An Historical Sketch of 
the Unitarian Movement." Unitarianism stands, 
and has stood from its origin, quite as much for a 
movement as for a faith. It has not so much ex- 
pressed a new type of faith, of belief, as a disposi- 
tion to secure a new liberty changeable and per- 
sonal terms in belief. It has at no time been able 
to restrain its own movement, and settle down in 
firm outlines of faith. Many would regard this in- 
capacity to say anything final, as its weakness ; 
others, more justly, would accept it as its chief ex- 
cellence. This characteristic of free movement gives 
to its history wide affiliations and a less definite 
outline. The work before us is a comprehensive 
and concise tracing of that movement of which mod- 
ern Unitarianism is the most distinct expression. 
Wherever the correction of reason begins to find its 
way freely in Christian faith, elements allied to 
Unitarianism make their appearance. The history 
is thoroughly interesting, and the more so in its 
later portions as dealing with events with which the 
author has been personally familiar. It will give 
pleasure and instruction to all who look on this gain 
of thoughtfulness in religion as truly regenerative. 

" The Apostolic Age " is the product of liberal, 
earnest, thoughtful scholarship. After a brief dis- 
cussion of the Resurrection and the first collective 
action of the Church, it dwells chiefly on the Apos- 
tle Paul, his calling, his theology, and the churches 
founded by him. As the work emanates from a 
very independent and therefore self-confident mind, 
it needs to be read with something like the same 
breadth of view and freedom of interpretation. 
Studied in this temper, it is well fitted to give clear- 
ness, accuracy, and mastery to our apprehension of 
the apostolic age. As we cease to accept an author- 
itative and conventional rendering of the Biblical 
narrative whose wise study must give us almost 
exclusively our knowledge of the facts in the early 



history of the Church we must put in its place the 
mutual correction of many considerations, and the 
reciprocal outlook of diverse minds. If we fail of 
this, we shall find ourselves substituting for the 
somewhat blind consensus of the Church the impres- 
sions which happen to have come uppermost in a 
single person. The volume is not so much argu- 
mentative as presentative, and is liable, in its posi- 
tive and confident movement, which has the advan- 
tage of directness and simplicity, to sweep along 
unduly those of less scope of knowledge. As a 
thoughtful book, it calls for a thoughtful handling. 
The style is somewhat obscure. 

The author of " The Natural History of the Chris- 
tion Religion" expresses his purpose and method 
very distinctly : 

" In few words, let it here be said, summarily, that the 
negative or < destructive ' criticism which we propose to 
direct against orthodox Christianity is based on the anti- 
supernatural view of the divine government, and that 
our positive but undogmatic construction of Christianity 
is based on the teaching of Jesus. In this section, we 
shall seek to define and to defend the anti-supernatural 
view, and to draw the inferences in regard to dogma 
which seem to flow from it. In several of the follow- 
ing sections we shall seek to show that the doctrine 
of Jesus is the doctrine of the absolute religion, or of 
that form of religion which answers to the religious 
idea; and, also, that the path by which Jesus was led 
to his great discovery was by the way of historical de- 
velopment. In the remaining sections, we shall en- 
deavor to trace the steps by which the dogma in its ca- 
nonical form grew up out of the doctrine and the life of 
Jesus" (p. 19). 

This purpose is pursued very fully. There is noth- 
ing to object either to the intention or spirit of the 
work. The labor is undertaken in behalf of truth 
as the author conceives it, and is carried forward in 
an earnest, and also, so far as the conditions of the 
effort will allow, in a constructive temper. It is by 
no means made up of simply destructive criticism. 
Those who share the author's disbelief in the super- 
natural will be likely to find in the book much that 
will strengthen them. It proceeds on the ground, 
not only that miracles do not, but that they cannot, 
happen. It is sustained throughout by the assump- 
tion that the instruction of science is complete and 
final on this point. So strong an a priori position 
h priori in reference to most of the grounds and 
proofs of faith must necessarily close the mind to 
the considerations which sustain the supernatural. 
If science, with explicit proof, precludes the super- 
natural, there is an end. There is much antecedent 
work which needs to be well done before this book 
can fairly enter on its undertaking. We need to 
know what we mean by science, the breadth of 
the ground covered by it, the nature and force of its 
affirmations touching the natural and supernatural. 
We need to know exactly what we mean by the su- 
pernatural, and the relation of the miracle to it. 
The connection of the miracle, in the form in which 
we either accept it or reject it, with the physical and 
spiritual mechanism of the world, must also be dis-

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



tinctly put. If we assume it to be an arbitrary 
ab-extra act, we have thrown it out in advance. 
What we mean by philosophy as contrasted with 
science, and what it has to say as to the ultimate 
terms of the universe, must also be present with us. 
These inquiries, which are preliminary to most of 
what the author has written, will, we believe, en- 
tirely turn his position, and leave it untenable. A 
strictly and exclusively natural world is unmanage- 
able to thought. Reason, in its own supernatural 
relations, must be saved in order that the world, as 
a product of thought, may remain to us. Fatalism 
is a gulf in which all things finally go down. Ideas 
involved in the above points are treated briefly in 
the second chapter. As they are, however, so fun- 
damental as to determine the value of most that is 
to follow, they demand a much more searching pre- 
sentation. The governing power of the universe 
must so it seems to us be at once natural and 
supernatural. The two elements must hold each 
other in equal, even, constant interpoise. The au- 
thor destroys the truly greater notion by swinging 
the world forcefully over to the side of physical 
law; as if the physical world could stand by itself, 
or hold in itself its own tendencies. The author's 
contention is chiefly successful as directed against a 
crass notion of the supernatural. The work is able, 
candid, and instructive; one that calls out much 
assent and dissent. 

These books collectively indicate how wide are 
the yet unexplored fields of spiritual thought, and 
the very diverse conclusions, therefore, which must 
still crown our quests. We are very slow to accept 
our wealth as wealth, and tear it into fragments in 
our analysis of it. JoHN BASCOM> 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Macpherson While the Ossian problem has proved 

and the Ossianic much knottier than the Rowley prob- 
lem, competent critics, on both sides 
of the Tay, have pretty generally put down " Os- 
sian " Macpherson as an impostor. Some of them, 
zealous for the honor of literature, have even re- 
gretted that Dr. Johnson's oak twig, " six feet long, 
with a knob as big as an orange," was not put to 
its intended use. The case, however, is admittedly 
one in which there is still, to quote Sancho Panza, 
" a great deal to be said on both sides." We do not 
ourselves believe that Macpherson was all impostor, 
and that his work was, as his harsher critics allege, 
a mere patchwork of plagiarisms and forgeries. 
The first Ossianic fragments, the ones shown by 
Macpherson to Douglas " Home in 1759, and pub- 
lished in 1760, were probably actual translations 
from Gaelic originals of considerable antiquity ; and 
it was in all likelihood the prodigious and unex- 
pected vogue of these early pieces, backed by the 
patriotic importunities of the Edinburgh literati, 
that started the ambitious tutor on his career of de- 



ception. While Macpherson in his longer poems 
flagrantly abused the poet's and the translator's 
license, inserting long passages of his own, supply- 
ing chasms, and omitting and shortening incidents, 
there can now be little doubt that even these poems 
have a basis, however frail, of genuineness. Later 
researches notably those of the Highland Society's 
committee in 1805, and of Dr. Waddell in 1875 
tend to show that the " epic " (" foolishly so called,'* 
as Gray properly said) of " Fingal " consists largely 
of fragments and episodes for which there were au- 
thentic originals. Macpherson's ascription, how- 
ever, of his originals to a Gaelic bard of the third 
century seems, aside from its antecedent incredibil- 
ity, fairly thrown out of court by the verdict of the 
best Gaelic scholars, that the language of Ossian is 
a modern and mutilated form of Erse that did not 
exist five hundred years ago. Caledonian faith, 
however, where Caledonian honor is concerned, is 
strong; and it may be that there are still, as even Mr. 
Gosse admits, " some persons north of the Tay who 
indulge the pleasing supposition that Fingal fought 
and Ossian sang." It has remained for Mr. Bailey 
Saunders, the author of a comely volume entitled 
"The Life and Letters of James Macpherson" 
(Macmillan), to give a full biographical account of 
the translator (or fabricator, if the reader please) 
of the " misty songs of Ullin," and to review the 
whole controversy in a really critical and liberal 
spirit. The facts of Macpherson's life, hitherto 
vaguely known, really form, or should form, an im- 
portant factor in the dispute ; for, as Mr. Saunders 
justly observes, the question of authenticity largely 
turns on his actual proceedings, and his personal 
character and attainments. In the present volume, 
which is in itself an altogether charming piece of 
biography, the reader will find an exhaustive account 
of Macpherson, and of the controversy of which he 
was the central figure. A number of extracts from 
the Ossianic poems are given, and there is a fine 
portrait, after Romney, of Macpherson. 

A help to the ^ e ta ^ e pl easure i n calling attention

Herbert Spencer. son > s com p ac t Introduction to the 

Philosophy of Herbert Spencer " (Appleton). The 
need of a simplified outline-map of Mr. Spencer's 
complex system has often occurred to us, and Pro- 
fessor Hudson is the first, we think, to meet it sat- 
isfactorily. No better book could be placed in the 
hands of the tyro about to face the difficulties of 
the Synthetic Philosophy, nor can we point to one 
more likely to prevent him turning back disheart- 
ened before his unsentimental journey is fairly be- 
gun. Professor Hudson has not attempted an ex- 
haustive or a critical exposition; still less does he 
hold out to the student any illusory hopes that his 
book is a royal road that does away with the need 
of a first-hand study of Mr. Spencer himself, or 
even renders such first-hand study a light and easy 
task. Still, he modestly claims, " something may 
be done to smooth the way for untrained and un-

wary feet," and to make the approach to the Syn- 
thetic Philosophy "less thorny and toilsome than it 
would otherwise be." The beginner may be helped 
to a general conception of Mr. Spencer's ground- 
idea, and to a knowledge of its genetic history ; and 
he may be shown its relation to current intellectual 
tendencies, and its influence upon current practical 
problems. It is fair to say that Professor Hudson, 
unlike too many expositors, performs rather more 
than he promises. Possessed of a clear and agree- 
able style, he has succeeded admirably, where feas- 
ible, in smoothing the asperities, without losing the 
sense, of the Derby philosopher's rather alarming 
phrase and terminology ; and he has added, more- 
over, a good deal in the way of citation and orig- 
inal comment and illustration, that will commend 
his book to more advanced Spencerians. Of the 
lighter citations, it is worth while to note in passing 
Goldwin Smith's pregnant witticism on the world- 
famous formula of evolution a point where, in the 
matter of style at least, Mr. Spencer may fairly 
claim to have out-Kanted Kant himself. "The 
universe," observed Mr. Smith, " must have heaved 
a sigh of relief when this explanation of her pro- 
cesses was given to an astonished world through the 
cerebration of a distinguished thinker." Perhaps 
Mr. Smith, like some others, thinks the reduction 
of the phenomena of the universe to a single dy- 
namic principle more satisfactory as a proof of Mr. 
Spencer's powers of generalization than as a solu- 
tion qua solution. Professor Hudson discusses in 
separate chapters " Spencer's Earlier Work," " The 
Synthetic Philosophy," "The Spencerian Sociology" 
(considered chiefly in its logical connection with 
the general scheme), "The Ethical System," and 
" The Religious Aspects of the Synthetic Philos- 
ophy." A chronological list of Mr. Spencer's works 
is appended, and there is a biographical sketch that 
should prove specially welcome to American readers. 

Few in their generation have added 

SSSSl more to " the world ' s stock of harm - 

less pleasures " than those cheery 
inseparables, Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan ; and we 
are glad to find their lives and performances so well 
chronicled in Mr. Percy Fitzgerald's " The Gilbert 
and Sullivan Operas" (Lippincott). The book is 
not too big, and it gives what most readers will ask 
of it. Mr. Fitzgerald has collected about every- 
thing worth knowing of the Savoy operas, authors, 
and players, and his book is a pretty and acceptable 
souvenir of the days when "Patience" and "Pin- 
afore " were sung, quoted, whistled, and barrel- 
organed from unique popularity into relative dis- 
use. A separate chapter is given to the history 
and analysis of each opera, and criticism, musical 
and dramatic, is duly mingled with quotation and 
stage gossip and anecdote. Mr. Fitzgerald's abili- 
ties as a dramatic writer are well known. He clearly 
explains the rationale of the Gilbertian play, and 
pays a just tribute to the genuine quality of Mr. Sul- 
livan's music really good music in its way, crisp,

spontaneous, wholesome, and seldom savoring of the 
" Varieties " and the Cafe Chantant. It is amus- 
ing to learn that the early bent of the composer of 
" Little Buttercup " was strongly in the direction 
of oratorio. There are many illustrations, most of 
them portraits of well-known Savoy Thespians in 

favorite roles. 

" The Book of the Fair " (Bancroft 
Co.), which we have more than once 
had occasion to commend, is making 
rapid progress. Parts twelve to sixteen, inclusive, 
are now issued, leaving but nine more to complete 
the work. The first of these five parts concludes 
the description of the Agricultural, Horticultural, and 
Forestry exhibits, and starts the chapter on " Mines, 
Mining, and Metallurgy." This subject is con- 
cluded in the second part, and the Fisheries Build- 
ing is taken up. Some of the plates well illustrate 
the characteristic and genial decoration of that 
charming structure. In the third of these parts 
comes the Transportation Building, with its loco- 
motives, palace cars, and other objects of interest. 
A fine plate of the Viking Ship occurs in this con- 
nection. The Columbus Caravels, the U. S. Battle- 
ship, and the Moving Sidewalk also find illustration 
here. The subject of Transportation is thus carried 
through the fourth part and into the fifth, where it 
finally gives place to "The Live Stock Department." 
Many fine portraits of horses, sheep, and cattle ac- 
company this chapter. Anthropology is next taken 
up, and there the tale ends for the present. The 
plates that go with these chapters are, we need 
hardly repeat, exceptionally fine examples of pho- 
tographic process, and the selection of subjects is 
admirably judicious and comprehensive. We shall 
await with interest the concluding instalments of 
this praiseworthy publication. 

The changing seasons, the birds, the 
flowers, the trees, sea and shore, are 
themes which never fail to inspire 
the pen of the true nature-lover. A dainty little 
volume of short papers on such themes, by Miss 
Mabel Osgood Wright, comes with the title " The 
Friendship of Nature" (Macmillan). The writer 
has a sympathetic eye and touch for every face that 
nature wears in her New England home. Begin- 
ning with " A New England May-Day " and " When 
Orchards Bloom," these graceful sketches reflect 
the changing aspects of the blooming and the wan- 
ing year, and convince us that the author, though 
writing prose, is a true poet in the Emersonian sense, 
namely, in the power to see the miraculous in the 
common. From the same publishers comes another 
delightful book with nature for a theme, but with 
considerable of the human interest added, " The 
Garden that I Love," by Mr. Alfred Austin. Poet, 
story-teller, and gentle humorist, as Mr. Austin has 
frequently shown himself to be, he shines in all 
three characters in this volume. A brother and a 
sister in an old English country-house, with their 
guests the " Poet," who recites dainty verses, and

" Select Specimens of the Great 

French Writers in the 17th > 18th > 

and 19th Centuries," edited by M. 
G. E. Fasnacht (Macmillan), is one of the best 
French reading-books with which we are acquainted. 
It has the great merit of being large enough to pre- 
sent extracts of considerable length, and to allow 
the teacher wide latitude in its use. The selections 
are all from the " Great Writers who tower head 
and shoulders above their contemporaries." With 
each writer appears a selection of " appreciations " 
from the best French critics, and the whole is pre- 
ceded by a historical sketch of French literature, 
abridged from MM. Vinet and Faguet. There are 
nearly six hundred pages of rather small type. A 
much smaller reading-book, intended for beginners, 
is Mr. A. N. Van Daell's " Introduction to French 
Authors" (Ginn). It includes simple pieces in 
prose and verse from nineteenth century writers, a 
resume of French history, based upon a book by M. 
Lavisse, and a sketch of the government of the pres- 
ent Republic. There is also a vocabulary, so that 
the book may be used before the dictionary pur- 
chasing stage has been reached. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Dr. John T. Prince is the author of a new system of 
" Arithmetic by Grades " (Ginn), which is differentiated 
into a " Teachers' Manual " and eight booklets for the 
uses of the pupil, corresponding to the accepted grading 
of lower school work. The special features of the sys- 
tem, besides the above differentiation, are a careful 
gradation of work, frequent reviews, a great amount 
and variety of oral work and problems, and the practi- 
cal character of most of the examples. The books for 
the seventh and eighth grades introduce a small amount 
of elementary work in algebra and geometry, a partic- 
ularly praiseworthy feature of the series. 

" A Laboratory Manual of Physics and Applied Elec- 
tricity," edited by Professor Edward L. Nichols, is to 
consist of two volumes, the first of which is now pub- 
lished (Macmillan). The sub-title of this instalment is 
a " Junior Course in General Physics," and it is the work 
of Messrs. Ernest Merritt and Frederick J. Rogers. 
All the persons named are teachers at Cornell Univer- 
sity. This first volume, intended for beginners (in the 
college sense) gives explicit directions for work, to- 
gether with demonstrations and occasional elementary 
statements of principles. The forthcoming volume will 
take more for granted. The use of this work presup- 
poses some knowledge of physical principles, as well as 
of analytical geometry and the calculus. 

" The Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow, Lieutenant-Gen- 
eral of the Horse in the Army of the Commonwealth of 



England, 1625-1672," edited by Mr. C. H. Firth, comes 
to us in two volumes, with the beautiful typography of 
the Oxford Clarendon Press (Macmillan). Ludlow's 
" Memoirs " were first published in 1698-9. The title- 
page of the original edition pretends that the work was 
printed at Vevay, in Switzerland, but this pretence is 
disproved by contemporary evidence. They have been 
several times reprinted in 1721, 1751, 1771, and 1807. 
" The justification of the present edition lies in the fact 
that it is the first to restore a number of passages sup- 
pressed by Ludlow's editor, and the first containing crit- 
ical and explanatory notes, and adding the letters of 
Ludlow." 



ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL, BOOKS. 



Following our annual custom, we give herewith a 
list of the books that are announced for publication in 
this country during the present season. The publishers 
have responded freely and promptly to our requests for 
information, and probably few if any important omis- 
sions will be found. The avalanche of material has 
been sifted and the list of titles classified and arranged 
with the greatest care ; and though errors in such work 
are of course inevitable, it is believed that these are in- 
significant, and due to meagre or misleading informa- 
tion. The books in the list are presumably all new 
books new editions not being included unless having 
new form or matter. The fulness and comparative ex- 
cellence of the list are matters for general congratula- 
tion, and some comments upon its more interesting fea- 
tures may be found in the leading editorial article of 
this issue.

YORK TOPICS. 



New York, September 8, 1894. 

The publication, by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., of 
a new and handsome edition of Mrs. Trollope's amus- 
ing impressions of American life, first issued in 1832, 
recalls to mind her friendship with an American lady, 
the writer's ever-youthful grandmother, the late Mrs. 
Elizabeth C. Kinuey. Their acquaintance began at 
Florence in the early fifties, whither Mrs. Kinney re- 
moved with her husband at the expiration of his term 
as American minister at Victor Emmanuel's court. 
There they found the Brownings, the Trollopes, Hiram 
Powers, and a number of other literary and artistic 
celebrities then resident in Florence. Mrs. Kinney, in 
addition to her more formal literary work, preserved a 
record of her Florentine experiences in a journal, por- 
tions of which are incorporated in her as yet unpub- 
lished autobiography. Various anecdotes, descriptions, 
and characterizations of the group are given which can- 
not see the light these many years. There is, however, 
a lively little passage concerning Mrs. Trollope and her 
" Domestic Manners of the Americans " which will bear 
present quotation. 

" 'Mrs. Trollope,' says ray journal, 'is another of these 
off-hand writers ; but certainly, in spite of this, a remarka- 
ble one. having published one hundred volumes. What are 
they ? Novels, and they sell ! In her first book of travels 
she served up us Americans with piquant sauce ; but we for- 
give her ; for, as her speculations in the West fell to naught, 
so did the froth of her ill-humor evaporate. Besides, she 
now [in 1 855] affects Americans greatly, as she does cards and 
other amusements : she finds tongues in green-ones, sermons 
in grave-ones, and good in every one, f. e., good subjects for 
pen portraits. The old lady lives freely, and has free means 
to live on, thanks to her wits, or her industry.' At the date 
I wrote that, Mrs. Trollope was an unbeliever in the Chris- 
tian religion, and indeed in any future state ; had been all 
her life a materialist. Soon after, as she was nearing 80, her 
mind became uneasy on religious subjects, and she became 
convinced of a soul through the doing and teachings of the 
so-called Spiritualist, Daniel Home." 

Almost everyone will now agree with Prof. Harry 
Thurston Peck, the editor of this edition of Mrs. Trol- 
lope's book, that it was written with an honest purpose, 
and not of malice aforethought, and that its unfavora- 
ble survey of our conditions at that time was largely 
due to the fact that most of the period of her residence 
here was passed in " a little, raw, backwoods settlement, 
the Ultima Thule of civilization, among men who drank 
whiskey, chewed tobacco, and kept their hats on in her 
parlor, and among women who entered her house unin- 
vited, and who habitually spoke of her as ' the English 
old woman.' " And yet, her extensive literary labors 
were all performed after this period. 

The death of Mrs. Edward L. Youmans, a " figure 
of the past " in our own literary circles, has passed 
almost without comment here. She had been spending 
the summer as usual at Ridgefield, Conn., and died 
there on August 29, after a short illness. Some of 
those who attended her funeral at that place were 
Prof. John Fiske, Mr. John Bigelow, Mr. Donald G. 
Mitchell, and Dr. Henry M. Field of the " Evangelist." 
Among her more intimate friends may be included Dr. 
Titus Munson Coau, who first met her in his boyhood, 
when she was the wife of Chief Justice William L. 
Lee, of the Hawaiian Islands, to which place she sailed, 
after an extremely romantic courtship, in 1849, and 
was there married, Mr, Lee having preceded her. Dr. 
Coan tells me that she was a favorite in the small but 



refined and cultivated circle (if American and English 
society at Honolulu, attracting all who knew her by 
her great social charm and personal vivacity. On the 
death of Judge Lee, she returned to New York in 
1857, and a few years afterward married the late Pro- 
fessor Youmans. As already mentioned in this cor- 
respondence, Professor and Mrs. Youmans were for 
many years prominent in New York literary circles, 
and their home in the old Haight house was the resort 
of the group of which Mrs. Anne Lynch Botta was a 
central figure. Since her husband's death, in 1887, 
Mrs. Youmans has taken an active part in the affairs 
of the XlXth Century Club, a social-literary organiza- 
tion for men and women. 

Philadelphia ten years ago was, I fear, a byword 
among Boston and New York writers as a city practi- 
cally destitute of literary impulse and production. Mr. 
Boker, Dr. Furness, and Mrs. Davis were then, as two 
of them are now, active contributors to American schol- 
arship and literature ; but there seemed to be no pros- 
pect of any succession. It was about this time that a 
small band of literary enthusiasts, most of them en- 
gaged in material occupations, began to assemble and 
encourage each other in efforts to overcome the exist- 
ing inertia. Among them were the late Charles Henry 
Liiders and John A. Henry, S. Decatur Smith, Jr., 
Francis Howard Williams, Charles Leonard Moore, and 
two or three others. The first fruits of this literary 
comradeship were two thin little volumes of verse, " A 
Duet in Lyrics," by Messrs. Morris and Henry, and 
" Hallo, My Fancy ! " by Messrs. Liiders and Smith. 
Later on, these gentlemen formed themselves into the 
Pegasus Club, of which I have written in a former let- 
ter. Gradually the impulse extended itself, and besides 
those mentioned, Miss Repplier, Mr. R. H. Davis, and 
Mr. Owen Wister have won new laurels for the city 
which was really the birthplace of American letters. 

The text of this little sermon on literary Philadelphia 
is based on the advance sheets of Mr. Harrison S. Morris's 
forthcoming volume, " Madonna and Other Poems," to 
be published by the J. B. Lippincott Company next month. 
This is the first collective edition of his poems, and con- 
tains those which he wishes to preserve in permanent 
form. There are reminiscences of Keats and Lowell in 
some of the poems, but they strike original notes in the 
main, and the volume is marked by a sustained eleva- 
tion of tone somewhat unusual in first books of poetry. 
The title piece, " Madonna," which readers of the " Cen- 
tury Magazine " will remember, a fine mediaeval ballad 
entitled "A Garden Quest," "To a Comrade" (John 
A. Henry), " Winds and Leaves," and sonnets to Homer, 
Walt Whitman, and Thoreau, may be marked for spe- 
cial notice. There is also a section of landscape verse, 
in which Mr. Morris excels. 

It is announced that Mr. F. Marion Crawford, hav- 
ing acquired a fine piece of property near Hanover, 
N. H., his wife's birthplace, will shortly erect upon it 
" a magnificent summer residence " commanding an ex- 
cellent view of the Connecticut river for miles. He will 
hereafter spend his summers in this ideal retreat, which 
is some fifty miles north of Mr. Kipling's home at Brat- 
tleboro', and on the opposite side of the river. It is 
due west of Lake \Vinnipeseogee, and is a short distance 
from the Shaker village at Lebanon. I have observed 
that Mr. Crawford has always asserted his American 
citizenship, in spite of his foreign birth and residence. 
The place of his birth cannot well be changed, but he 
evidently intends to become a resident of his country in 
fact as well as in theory. ARTHUR STEDMAN.

LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 



The " Revue de Paris " has secured as serials the new 
novels of MM. Daudet, Bourget, and Hale'vy. Their 
respective titles are " Quinze Ans de Mariage," " Une 
Idylle Tragique," and " Deux Jeunes Filles." 

We are glad to learn that Judge Gayarre", the ven- 
erable historian of Louisiana, who has been seriously ill 
during the summer, is now restored to his usual health. 
Judge Gayarre* will be ninety years old on the fifth of 
next January. 

THE DIAL'S articles on the Teaching of English in 
American Colleges and Universities have aroused a hope- 
ful degree of interest in this important subject, and this 
will be continued by the publication of the articles in 
book form, by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 

Dr. Elliott Coues, who has nearly completed his new 
edition of " Pike's Expedition," has just returned from 
a canoe trip of over four hundred miles to the sources 
of the Mississippi River. He reports finding many im- 
portant facts and interesting items that will be added 
to his extensive notes. 

We have been awaiting with much interest the arrival 
in this country of three distinguished English men of 
letters, Dean Hole, Dr. Conan Doyle, and the Rev. Stop- 
ford Brooke, who have all been announced for lectures 
during the autumn. We now learn that Dr. Brooke 
has been compelled by illness to postpone his visit. 
The other two, however, may be expected at an early 
date, and will appear under the management of the vet- 
eran Major Pond. Dr. Doyle will be entertained soon 
after his arrival by the Twentieth Century Club of Chi- 
cago. 

In response to frequent inquiries we wish to say that 
the volume of " Proceedings of the International Con- 
gress of Education of the World's Columbian Exposi- 
tion" may be purchased from Dr. N. A. Calkins, 124 
East Eightieth street, New York, for two dollars and 
fifty cents. We may also mention the fact that the fa- 
mous " Report of the Committee of Ten " has been re- 
published on behalf of the National Educational Asso- 
tion by the American Book Co., 808 Broadway, New 
York, from whom it may be had for the nominal price 
of thirty cents. 

Thomas Dunn English, M.D, LL.D., the author of 
the once popular song "Ben Bolt" (interest in which 
has recently been revived by Du Maurier's story of 
" Trilby ") still lives in Newark, N. J., and is now com- 
pleting his second term in Congress. " Ben Bolt " was 
written in 1843. At the request of many friends, the 
poet's daughter, Miss Alice English has collected and 
edited, for publication by private subscription, about 
240 of his poems. The volume will be entitled " The 
Select Poems of Dr. Thomas Dunn English," and will 
not include the " Battle Lyrics " published by Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers several years since. 

The encouraging prospects of the book trade, shown 
in the unexpectedly profuse announcements of Fall books 
in this issue of THE DIAL, are confirmed by a New 
York publisher, Mr. J. Selwin Tait, who summed up 
the situation in a recent interview: "I think that pub- 
lishers generally feel that, accident aside, they have be- 
gun a period of prosperity which will last them through 
the century. The period of depression through which 
we have passed has not been an unmixed evil for the 
publishing business, since it has resulted in the clearing 
out of enormous stocks of standard publications held by 



bankrupt concerns, the result of the reckless manufac- 
ture of previous years." 

The " Athenaeum " states that the slab that is to cover 
the grave of Robert Browning in Westminster Abbey 
is almost completed, and will be sent to England quite 
shortly from Venice. Owing to the limitations of the 
allotted space, it was not easy for Mr. Barrett Brown- 
ing to decide upon a design. The gravestone will be 
of Oriental porphyry, of which the poet was particularly 
fond. It was difficult to find a piece sufficiently large, 
but finally Mr. R. B. Browning met with one at Rome. 
It has been put into a frame of Siena marble, and the 
whole, though rich, is of the greatest simplicity, and in 
accordance with what would have been the poet's taste. 
The inscription will consist of only the name and date 
of birth, with an English rose at the head and a Flor- 
entine lily below. 

Mrs. Augusta Webster, the news of whose death was 
cabled on the sixth of this month, occupied an hon- 
orable position among the minor Victorian poets. A 
daughter of Admiral Davies, and born about 1840, she 
made her first appearance in literature under the nom 
de guerre of " Cecil Home," publishing two or three 
novels. Her first volume of poems was the " Dra- 
matic Studies " of 1865, which appeared in her own 
name. Other volumes of verse were " A Woman Sold 
and Other Poems " (1866), "Portraits" (1870), "The 
Auspicious Day" (1872), "Disguises" (1880), and 
translations of the " Prometheus Bound " of ^Eschylus 
and the " Medea " of Euripides. A volume of selec- 
tions from her poems appeared last year. 

The Comte de Paris, who died in exile in London on 
the eighth of September at the age of fifty-six, belongs 
rather to politics than to letters, yet Americans should 
not be forgetful of the fact that he served in the Army 
of the Potomac as an aide-de-camp of McClellan, and 
that his " History of the Civil War in America " is one 
of the most substantial and meritorious accounts of 
that great subject that have yet been written. 

The eighth of this month also brought the sad news 
that Professor Helmholtz had succumbed to a second 
stroke of paralysis, just as he was fairly recovering 
from the first stroke of some weeks ago. Baron Her- 
mann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz, to give him 
his full title, was born at Potsdam, August 31, 1821, 
and had thus completed his seventy-third year. He 
studied medicine at Berlin, and took his degree in 
1842. His dissertation upon the nervous system of the 
Invertebrata was followed in 1843 by a memoir on Pu- 
trefaction, and that by a series of physiological papers. 
In 1847 he read before a learned society of Berlin his 
epoch-making paper on " The Conservation of Force." 
In 1848 he was made an assistant in the Anatomical 
Museum of Berlin, and in 1849, Professor Extraordi- 
nary of Physiology in the University of Konigsberg. 
In 1851 he invented the ophthalmoscope, and began 
his investigations in electrodynamics. His promotion 
to a regular professorship in the University followed 
in 1852, and his inaugural address, upon the subject of 
sensations and their physical basis, outlined the doc- 
trines which were to be further developed in his great 
works upon Light and Sound. In 1855 he became a 
professor at Bonn, and in 1858 at Heidelberg. This 
latter year also gave the world his great memoir on 
Vortices. The treatise on Physiological Optics was 
published in sections between 1856 and 1866, while 
1862 was the date of the equally important " Tonemp- 
findungen." In 1871 he went back to Berlin, this

time as Professor of Physics. His last quarter-century 
was one of untiring activity, and witnessed the produc- 
tion of memoirs too numerous to be here specified. 
His visit to America last year, and his participation in 
the Electrical Congress at Chicago, are events fresh in 
the memory. His name is the greatest in nineteenth- 
century physical investigation ; one of the greatest, 
also, in mathematics and physiology. 

Another German scholar, Heinrich Karl Brugsch, died 
on the tenth of the month. He was born in 1827 in 
Berlin. His interest in Egyptology, which remained 
almost undivided throughout his life, began when he 
was a student of twenty at the gymnasium. He first 
visited Egypt in 1853. The following year he became 
Keeper of the Egyptian Museum at Berlin. After- 
wards he became a professor at Gottingen, and in 1869 
went to Egypt and succeeded M. Mariette as custodian 
of the Boulak collections. His works include a widely- 
read " History of Egypt," and numerous contributious 
to Egyptian philology, archaeology, and literature.

A NEW BOOK BY MAX O'RELL.

By MAX O'RELL, author of "John Bull and his Island," 
" Jonathan and his Continent," " A Frenchman in Amer- 
ica," etc. 

Max O'Rell's latest book is a much more ambitious piece of work 
than anything which he has previously done. It is often reminiscent of 
the author's pleasant impressions of the United States upon his late 
visits, and gives him an opportunity for entertaining comparisons be- 
tween the Yankee and his cousins in the English colonies. Canada, 
Australia, California, and Hawaii are visited in turn, and valuable in- 
formation about these places and their people is interwoven with spir- 
ited comments by the author. It does not concern itself with the peo- 
ple of any special country, but is an account of the whole Anglo-Saxon 
race all over the world. It is practically a humorous study of the de- 
velopment of the English-speaking character under all manner of con- 
ditions and climates, from the tropics of North Queensland to icebound 
Winnipeg. The book is illustrated with numerous full-page and text 
illustrations. It will be published simultaneously in England, France, 
and America.

velling in the East, and of long study of Eastern questions. Perhaps no 
Englishman has journeyed so widely in the less known parts of the 
Oriental world. Certainly no Englishman who has been there at all has 
shown an equal power of trained observation and of seizing the true

bling influence of a love for a good woman upon the gamester's charac-

lieve that such an excellent story as ' Major Joshua ' is a first effort."

" Major Joshua Robinson is a new character in literature. . . . He 
can hardly be called the hero of Francis Forster's new novel, since he 
is not of the stuff of which heroes are made ; but the author makes him 
the prominent figure in a very delightful story." Boston Advertiser. 

" It is more interesting than nine-tenths of the novels now written, 
since it deals with unusual but not unnatural people, and analyzes their 
motives and emotions in a remarkably clever way. . . . Mr. Forster has 
written a book which people will think about." Detroit Press.

C. e/f. &C/CHOLS CO., Publishers, 

SPRINGFIELD, MASS. 

" This magnificent work is at once a convenience and 
a delight, and the reader in turning over its pages won- 
ders why it was never before attempted. While it is 
history in its completest form, it is not history compiled 
and remoulded to display the style or to suit the ideas 
and prejudices of any one man, but history as related 
by the great historians themselves. . . ." Boston 
Transcript. 

At an Early Date: A FACSIMILE EEPEINT of 

The Jesuit Relations. 

The important announcement is made that, beginning early 
in the Fall, there will be issued, in exact facsimile from the 
very rare originals, the series known as "Les Relations des 
Jesuites." The volumes will be published at the rate of one 
per month, printed on good paper, with large margins and 
uncut edges ; the edition will be strictly limited, and every 
pains taken to make the work a model of typographic excel- 
lence. Fifty-four volumes will be issued at $2.50 per volume 
net, and no orders can be taken except for the entire set. The 
importance of the work will be readily conceded by those in- 
terested in American History, and it is earnestly hoped it will 
have the liberal support that such an undertaking so well 
deserves.

Little, Brown, and Company's Announcement 

OF 

NEW AND FORTHCOMING WORKS. 



THREE HEROINES OF NEW ENGLAND 

ROMANCE. 

I. Priscilla, by HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD. 
II. Agnes Surriage, by ALICE BROWN. 
III. Martha Hilton, by LOUISE IMOGEN GUINEY. 
With notes on the towns in which they lived, and about 
80 illustrations, including numerous full-page pic- 
tures, by EDMUND H. GARRETT. 12mo, cloth, gilt 
top, $2.00; full morocco, gilt edges, $4.50. 

A charming volume, dealing with the courtship and marriage of three 
famous beauties of old colonial times. The stories have been told in 
prose by three noted American writers, and Mr. Garrett has contributed 
a number of characteristic illustrations, in which New England land- 
scape, colonial houses, costumes of old time, austere Puritan men and 
pretty Puritan women, greet the eye upon almost every page. 

A New Volume of Stories by the author of" With Fire and 
Sword" " The Deluge," " Pan Michael," etc. 

LILLIAN MORRIS, and Other Stories, 

By HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ. Translated from the Polish 
by JEREMIAH CURTIN. With illustrations by ED- 
MUND H. GARRETT. 16mo, white and gold, $1.25. 

The scene of two of the stories in this volume, " Lillian Morris " and 
" Sachem," is laid in the far West of America. The Bull Fight is a 
sketch rather than a story, and gives a most vivid and powerful de- 
scription of that favorite amusement of Spain. Angel is a pathetic little 
story of Polish life. 

Six New Volumes in the Library Edition of 

THE ROMANCES OF ALEXANDRE 
DUMAS. 

I. The Companions of Jehu. 2 vols. 
II. The Whites and the Blues. 2 vols. 

III. The She- Wolves of Machecoul and the Cor= 
sican Brothers. 2 vols. 

With 12 etchings and photogravures, and 12 half-tone 
plates, including historical portraits and original illus- 
trations by E. VAN MUYDEN, EDMUND H. GARRETT, 
FELIX OUDART, and FRANK T. MERRILL. 6 vols. 
12mo. In box. Decorated cloth, gilt top, $9.00; 
plain cloth, gilt top, $7.50; half calf, extra, gilt top, 
$18.00; half morocco, gilt top, $18.00. 

These very powerful historical romances will be somewhat of a nov- 
elty to readers of Dumas in English. " The Companions of Jehu " and 
' The Whites and the Blues " both deal with the French Republic under 
the Directory and with the Consulate of Napoleon. " The She-Wolves 
of Machecoul " has for its historical theme the last Vendee rising, in the 
reign of Louis Phillippe, and the Duchess de Berry is its leading his- 
torical personage. To this romance has been added a new translation 
of " The Qorsican Brothers," the story upon which was founded the 
famous play of that name. 

Nora Perry's New Book for Girls. 

HOPE BENHAM. 

By NORA PERRY, author of " Another Flock of Girls," 
" A Rosebud Garden of Girls," etc. With 8 full- 
page illustrations by FRANK T. MERRILL. 12mo, 
cloth, gilt, $1.50. 

Miss Perry's books for girls are constantly increasing in popularity, 
and no writer is more successful in creating wholesome stories which 
girls read and enjoy. She has hitherto devoted herself to short stories, 
and the present work is the first from her pen in which her heroine's 
experiences are given an entire volume. " Hope Benham " is destined 
to be a favorite. 



CENTURIES APART. A Romance. 

By EDWARD T. BOUVE. With full-page illustrations 
by W. ST. JOHN HARPER. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

A new story with a novel idea. It brings together the laws, manners, 
customs, and dress of England at the period of the reign of Henry VII., 
and of America during the Civil War. The scene of the romance is 
" South England," a hitherto unknown country in latitudes far south. 
The characters so strangely brought together are in almost everything 
" centuries apart. " 

A NEW BOOK ON RIDING. 
CURB, SNAFFLE, AND SPUR. A Method of Train- 
ing Young Horses for the Cavalry Service and for 
General Use under the Saddle. By EDWARD L. AN- 
DERSON, author of " Modern Horsemanship." With

$1.25. 

"Mrs. Catherwood has hit exactly on that fine wedding

GLIMPSES OF UNFAMILIAR JAPAN. 

By LAFCADIO HEARN, author of " Stray Leaves from 

Strange Literature," etc. 2 vols., 8vo, $4.00. 
Mr. Hearn has had exceptional opportunities for observing 
the less known features of Japan, and his aptitude for under- 
standing and appreciating foreign customs and ideas lends 
unusual value to his work, while his picturesqueness of style 
is especially suited to the Oriental scenes and customs he de- 
scribes.

THE LIFE OF FRANCES POWER COBBE. 

Written by Herself. With a portrait. 2 vols., crown 

8vo, $4.00. 

Miss Cobbe is one of the most famous of living English- 
women, and the story of her life cannot fail to be a book of 
extraordinary interest. She has been devoted to so many 
large causes ; her associations have been so varied and with 
persons so influential and so interesting ; she has so fine a fund 
of humor and so admirable a gift of literary expression, that 
her autobiography must be one of the most engaging works 
of its class. 

TUSCAN CITIES.

THE YELLOW BOOK. 

An Illustrated Quarterly under the Editorship of HENRY 
HARLAND and AUBREY BEARDSLEY. Small Quarto, 
cloth bound, $6.00 a year or $1.50 a number. The 
Yellow Book's pictures in no case serve as illustrations 
to the letterpress; each stands by itself as an inde- 
pendent contribution, while the articles contributed 
to the magazine are modern in spirit and indepen- 
dent in thought. 

" It has attracted attention. The ' Yellow Book ' has brought in 
the Yellow Gold and its purpose is fulfilled." The Critic. 

" The ridicule heaped on this novelty in periodical literature seems 
to have been earned by its originality. . . . There is a wide variety in 
the literary contents of the ' Yellow Book '; and there seems to be no 
disposition on the part of the editors to fall back on stereotyped forms 
of verse and fiction." Chicago Tribune. 

"They [Mr. Beardsley's drawings] are caricatures, which have no 
excuse for being while men are men and women are women ; they are 
fraudulent, impudent, worthless, and being such findja fitting place in the 
' Yellow Book,' which is an insult to the intelligence of the nineteenth 
century." New York Mail and Express. 

" The present Reign of the Queer has reached its climax in the ' Yel- 
low Book.'" Philadelphia Record. 

" As to the raison d'etre of the ' Yellow Book ' the periodical seems 
to fill the function of presenting to the public things that other maga- 
zines would refuse to publish, and which were perhaps better left un- 
said. Furthermore it is exclusively literary, as our great magazines, 
except one, are not." Boston Commonwealth.

THE SECOND EDITION OF 

The Manxman. 

By HALL C AINE, author of " The Deemster," " Capt'n Davy's Honeymoon," " The Scapegoat," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" A wonderfully strong study of character ; a powerful analysis of those elements which go to make up the strength and 
weakness of a man, which are at fierce warfare within the same breast ; contending against each other, as it were, the one 
to raise him to fame and power, the other to drag him down to degradation and shame. Never in the whole range of literature 
have we seen the struggle between these forces for supremacy over the man more powerfully, more realistically, delineated, 
than Mr. Caine pictures it." Boston Home Journal. 

" To get a book like this a good thick volume, compactly printed, the language close-grained and nervous and possessed 
of real style, the characters firmly drawn and striking, a distinct motive to the story and yet with hardly a page in it all where 
the author finds room or need to lay aside his mask and philosophize face to face with his reader to come upon a book like 
this recalls the days of the immortals. There have been other phenomena of the same kind in recent years, to be sure, but 
not a great many." Buffalo Express. 

A SECOND VOLUME OF 

A History of the United States Navy, from 1775 to 1894. 

By EDGAR STANTON MACLAY, A.M. With Technical Revision by Lieut. ROY C. SMITH, U.S.N. In two volumes. 

Vol. II. With numerous Maps, Diagrams, and Illustrations. 8vo, cloth, $3.50 per vol. 

In this volume Mr. Maclay depicts the closing scenes of the War of 1812, and recounts the events of consequence in the 
history of the navy down to the civil war. The larger part of the volume is naturally devoted to the war, and in view of the 
author's exhaustive researches and the collaboration of many officers who were actors in this great drama, the publishers 
feel justified in emphasizing the importance of the succinct but comprehensive naval history of the civil war presented in this 
volume. The concluding chapters relate to the naval happenings of importance since the war down to the launching of the 
Columbia, and the building up of the new navy is fully described. 



City Government in the United States. 

By ALFRED R. CONKLING. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 
The awakening of the American citizen indicated in the revolts 
against boss and ring-rules, and the formation of organizations for non- 
partisan and pure municipal government, render the appearance of this 
book peculiarly timely. The author has learned his subject by actual 
experience as an Alderman of New York, a member of the Assembly, 



ttiiu ill"* uieui" jirrrttmuinuu ui ma tm:iur 10 nmnii <ltt'<l by ir^iGicin^n uw 

only to the various American cities but also to Paris, London, Glasgow, 
Birmingham, and Berlin, which he has visited and studied in the pre- 
paration of this book. Strangely enough, in view of the value of such 
a work to every citizen, there is no book of equal scope. 

Schools and Masters of Sculpture. 

By Miss A. Q. RADCLIFFE, author of "Schools and Masters 
of Paintings." With 35 full-page illustrations. 12mo, cloth, 
$3.00. 

Those who know Miss Radcliffe's previous work will require no com- 
mendation of the grasp of subject and thoroughness of treatment shown 
in this. In addition to her popular but thorough survey of the history 
of sculpture in all countries, Miss Radcliffe sketches the various Amer- 
ican collections of casts, and explains the opportunities for study which 
we have at hand. 

Round the Red Lamp. 

By A. CONAN DOYLE, author of "The White Company," 
" Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The " Red Lamp," the trade mark, as it were, of the English country 
surgeon's office, is the central point of these dramatic stories of profes- 
sional life. There are no secrets for the surgeon, and a surgeon himself 
as well as a novelist, the author has made a most artistic use of the mot' 
ives and springs of action revealed to him in a field of which he is the 
master. 



Woman's Share in Primitive Culture. 

By OTIS TUFTON MASON, A.M., Curator of the Department 
of Ethnology in the United States National Museum. With 
numerous illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
This is the first volume in the " Anthropological Series," edited by 
Prof. Frederick Starr, of the University of Chicago. The series is un- 
dertaken in the hope that anthropology the science of man may be- 
come better known to intelligent readers. While the books are intended 
to be of general interest, they will in every case be written by authori- 
ties who will not sacrifice scientific accuracy to popularity. In the pres- 
ent volume is traced the interesting period when with fire-making began 
the first division of labor a division of labor based upon sex the man 
going to the field or forest for game, while the woman at the fireside 
became the burden-bearer, basket-maker, weaver, potter, agriculturist, 
and domesticator of animals. 

Race and Language. 

By ANDRE LEFEVRE, Professor in the Anthropological School, 
Paris. No. 72, International Scientific Series. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.50. 

Prof. Lefevre has written in full sympathy with modern scientific 
research and in full possession of its latest results ; moreover, he has 
made a book that is adapted to the needs of educated persons who are 
not advanced students of philology. He describes first the evolution of 
language, then the geographical distribution of languages and races, and 
closes with a somewhat comprehensive account of the Indo-European 
group of tongues. 

A Flash of Summer. 

By Mrs. W. K. CLIFFORD, author of " Love Letters of a 
Worldly Woman," " Aunt Anne," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The mere announcement of a new novel by the author of " Love Let- 
ters of a Worldly Woman " will attract those who seek the most brilliant 
contemporary fiction. The new novel will be certain to add to the au- 
thor's reputation.

THE ART OF THE SHORT STORY. 

Although the arts of design, color, and tone 
have long been reduced to something like a 
scientific system of underlying principles and 
methods of procedure, and while schools for 
the inculcation of these principles and methods 
have long held a secure place among educa- 
tional institutions of the higher sort, the va- 
rious forms of the literary art have hitherto 
kept out of the hands of the schoolmaster, and 
their pursuit has been left to such eager and 
confident aspirants as have had the courage to 
clear paths for themselves. Literary art is, of 
course, made a subject of study in every school 
and college of the land, but rather as provid- 
ing a means of aesthetic gratification than as 
opening the way to a professional career in lit- 
erature. It is admitted that exercises in verse 
and prose composition are common enough in 
educational programmes ; but this is a very 
different thing from the deliberate attempt to 
master some form of the literary art for the 
purpose of finding in its pursuit the work of 
a lifetime. Even the French, who might nat- 
urally be expected to take the lead in such a 
matter, and who have their special schools and 
their Prix de Rome in painting and sculpture, 
in architecture and music, have never thought 
of stimulating poets and novelists except by 
approving of them, by the bestowal of a meta- 
phorical crown, when they are already arrives. 

The reason why literary art is thus left to 
shift for itself the Cinderella of the sister- 
hood is not far to seek. The conviction is 
very widespread that literature is too elusive 
to be made the subject of instruction, that the 
most successful of poets or novelists could by 
no possibility impart to anyone else his secret, 
or even a respectable share of it. Possibly 
there may be added to this the other convic- 
tion that there is far too much scribbling in 
the world as things are, and that he would be 
no friend of mankind who should seek to en- 
courage still greater numbers to a reckless ex- 
penditure of ink and a wanton defacement of 
good white paper. 

There are some people, however, so consti- 
tuted as to be uninfluenced by the fact that a 
thing is generally accounted impracticable, pro-

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



vided they themselves see the way to its accom- 
plishment. Of such is the anonymous author 
of a treatise upon " The Art of Short Story 
Writing," now modestly put forth through 
the Riverside Literary Bureau, not published 
in any regular form, but issued in facsimile of 
the type-written manuscript, and limited to a 
very small number of copies. This curious pro- 
duction professes to be " a practical course of 
instruction after the French method of Mau- 
passant." The author clearly believes that the 
art of this particular form of literature with 
which he is concerned, at least, is capable of 
being imparted to persons of fair talent and 
education, and he sets about his task with a 
confidence that proves fairly contagious while 
one is reading his pages, although doubts may 
afterwards intrude. 

After some introductory remarks about the 
scientific method in fiction, the author begins 
the systematic treatment of his subject by a 
classification of short stories. There are five 
species : the tale, the fable, the study, the dra- 
matic artifice, and the complete drama. The 
tale deals with adventure or incident, and is 
illustrated by Mr. Stevenson. The fable is a 
tale with a direct moral, and Hawthorne was 
preeminent in its composition. The study is 
illustrated admirably by Miss Wilkins, and 
the dramatic artifice by Mr. Richard Harding 
Davis. The complete drama " combines all 
the elements found in the other kinds of stories 
into a single effective story. It tells a tale, it 
has a moral, although one usually more remote 
than the allegory, it has a study of character, 
and it usually suggests some problem of life, 
or has some clever turn, or unexpected episode, 
or climax." This, the most consummate type 
of the art of the short story, is illustrated by 
Maupassant. After setting forth this acute 
and reasonably exhaustive classification, the 
author gives some sensible general directions 
about methods and materials, and then pro- 
ceeds to an analysis of the thirteen stories by 
Maupassant accessible to English readers in 
the volume entitled " The Odd Number." From 
this time on, these stories are used by the au- 
thor to point his morals, and to illustrate the 
rules which he lays down for the guidance of 
those to whom the book makes a practical ap- 
peal. 

We should be as far as possible from doing 
justice to the writer of this book if we gave the 
impression that he represented the art of story- 
writing as one easy of attainment. It is no 
course of " Novel- Writing in Six Lessons," no 



" Meisterschaf t " system that he offers us, no 
level path to the height that he points out. 
" The writer must understand the life he writes 
about to the very roots. He must have a deep 
and vivid knowledge of the principles of psy- 
chology, of the actions and reactions of human 
feeling in short he must know practically all 
there is to know about the life in which the inci- 
dent occurs." " If one does not know something 
worth knowing about life, something of value 
or suggestiveness, something new and meaning- 
ful, he has no material out of which to create 
a soul." Such are the statements made over 
and over again, until, whatever other ideas the 
novice may get from these pages, he is sure to 
get a deepened sense of the old truth that art 
is long. Possibly the principle is carried to an 
unnecessary, as it certainly is to a discourag- 
ing, extent, in such a passage as the following : 
" Every writer ought to formulate for himself 
more or less completely a philosophy of life. 
He should arrange his thought about the uni- 
verse into a system, so that he will feel clear as 
to what God is, what love is, what the mean- 
ing of life is, what is to be looked into and 
known and what is to be left untouched by the 
human mind." Doubtless the great story tell- 
ers have done all this, but it can hardly be 
claimed for many others who have yet had a 
large measure of success. But such precepts 
are wholesome, even if they are forbidding, for 
they apprise the writer that he cannot set his 
ideals too high. Of the greatest importance, 
also, is the closing reminder that the most dil- 
igent study of rules and principles must have 
for its ultimate aim the relegation of those very 
rules and principles to the domain of the sub- 
conscious. " While one is actually writing a 
story, rules are the most fatal thing to have in 
mind. Self -consciousness during the actual 
feat of writing a story is the most dangerous 
thing in the world ; but there is no surer way 
of escaping it than by submitting first to a rig- 
orous course of self-conscious preparation." 

The strictures we are inclined to make upon 
the system set forth in this book are few in 
number and of no great importance. We think 
the writer goes too far when he says that " the 
subject of literature is almost solely the emo- 
tional side of life." It is doubtless true that 
to be successful, " you must coin your heart's 
blood into the universal coin of the realm of 
heart," but why not also coin your ripest 
thought (with its proper emotional associa- 
tions) into the mintage of the intellectual prov- 
ince ? The suggestion that a good story should

THE DIAL

have an unexpected end is not a principle of 
the highest art, even in the short story. Rather 
should the inevitableness of the end be fore- 
shadowed from the beginning. This is, to our 
mind, one of the ultimate differences between 
art and artifice. We must also question the de- 
sirability of advising " all young writers to be- 
gin by being humorists," and must regard as 
anything but a counsel of perfection the recom- 
mendation of journalism as a collateral pursuit 
helpful to literary achievement. There is even 
something ludicrous in one device of the writer 
the use of diagrams to illustrate the charac- 
ter-relations of the Maupassant stories taken 
for texts throughout. We fancy, also, that the 
principles so neatly deduced from the practice 
of the French story-teller would require con- 
siderable modification if a systematic attempt 
were made to test them by the practice of two 
or three others, say of Hawthorne and Poe, or 
of Tourguenieff, the greatest of all artists in 
this kind. 

But we have no doubt that a young writer 
may get a good deal of real help from this hand- 
book of the art of fiction, provided, of course, 
he is the kind of person who can be helped by 
anything. His attention will be called to many 
things which he ought to avoid, and he will 
find many hints about the right way to set 
about his tasks. Fiction has its technique al- 
most as fully as has the drama, and our writer 
has evidently tested his methods by practice, 
although he modestly avers that " he is not the 
author of very many great short stories." And 
we could forgive greater inadequacies than any 
we have pointed out for the sake of his un- 
equivocal repudiation of the sort of realism that 
has played such havoc with latter-day fiction. 
He never forgets that story-writing must be 
the work of creative imagination, and the issue 
is not often so well put as in the following 
words : " It would seem preposterous to let any 
outside circumstance determine for a writer of 
music the selection of chords, much less the ad- 
mission of discords ; but that is exactly what 
a writer of fiction does when he tells a story 
just as it happened in real life. His object 
should have been to play upon the heart of the 
reader a beautiful tune of life ; instead, he pro- 
duces a jangle of discords." 



A CORRESPONDENT asks the pertinent question why 
Professor Drummond has been allowed to appropriate, 
without a protest, the title of Miss Mathilde Blind's 
book called " The Ascent of Man." It is one of those 
peculiar " coincidences " which certainly seem worth ex- 
plaining. 



THE RISE AND THE FALL OF THE 
"THREE DECKER." 



There are three institutions in this country which 
pass the understanding of the American. Since 
we are able to understand them very well, some of 
our insular conceit is accounted for. If you think 
of it, indeed, that level of intelligence which enables 
us to understand anything which your people can- 
not understand is something to be proud of. These 
three institutions are the House of Lords, the Es- 
tablished Church, and the Three Volume Novel 
the " Three Decker." The first two of these, in 
spite of long continued and determined attacks, are 
stronger than ever. The last of these, with which 
I have been intimately connected for five and twenty 
years, has just received a blow which threatens to 
be mortal. Often assailed, long derided, much 
abused, the Three Volume Novel has been stabbed 
at last in a vital part and by the hand of its oldest 
friend. It is not dead : it will, perhaps, partly re- 
cover ; but it is doomed to carry on a languishing, 
lame, and limp existence for the future. The his- 
tory of the Three Decker and the curiously artifi- 
cial character of its publication and price forms a 
little chapter in our branch of English literature that 
may not be without interest to American readers. 
At least, one may explain the genesis and the mean- 
ing of an institution which is full of absurdity ; 
which exists in no other country ; which will shortly 
be numbered among the things of the past. 

The English novel in its popular form, as an ar- 
ticle of daily or constant consumption, was born 
and grew up in the last century. It appeared in 
one, two, or more volumes, as the author chose ; 
there was no rule or practice as to length. " The 
History of Tom Jones " took three or four times 
as much space and time in the telling as that of 
"The Vicar of Wakefield." The woes of Clar- 
issa could not be contracted in the narrow limits 
which contained the adventures of Rasselas. But 
the volumes themselves were generally of equal 
length, forming a small octavo containing from 
twenty to thirty thousand words. And between the 
years 1750 and 1800 these volumes were priced at 
three shillings each, so that a novel in three volumes 
was sold for nine shillings and one in four volumes 
for twelve shillings. The reading ( and purchasing) 
public of that time was mostly found in the towns : 
in every large town, in every cathedral town, and 
in many smaller towns, there were literary coteries, 
clubs, and societies, a few of which were important 
enough to occupy a place in the history of literature. 
The literary circles of Norwich, Lichfield, Exeter, for 
instance, cannot be neglected by the historian of the , 
last century. London, of course, provided the greatest 
demand for new books; and there were the two Uni- 
versities of Oxford and Cambridge. In the country, 
in the quiet houses of squire and parson, there was 
as yet very little reading and very little demand for 
books. But the circle of readers went on widening 
year after year, steadily, though as yet slowly. And

[Oct. 1, 



the habit of reading, as the most delightful form of 
recreation, went on growing. People read faster as 
well as more ; they devoured books. No purse was 
long enough to buy all the books that one could 
read ; therefore they lent to each other ; therefore 
they combined their resources and formed book 
clubs ; therefore the circulating libraries came into 
existence. It was not that we ceased to buy books : 
it was that we could no longer afford to buy a tenth 
part of the books we wanted to read, and that we 
clubbed together and passed on the books from 
hand to hand. 

All this took place in the latter half of the last 
century. Then followed a long war a war of three 
and twenty years, nearly a quarter of a century 
when Great Britain stood in arms for a time against 
the whole of Western Europe, the one undefeated 
enemy of military despotism. I fear we are forget- 
ting, as a nation, that long conflict : what it meant 
for the liberties of the world ; the sacrifices which 
we made to maintain it. These sacrifices fell with 
the greatest weight upon the professional classes, 
those in which were found the reading public. They 
could no longer afford to buy books at all ; the book 
clubs increased in number : so did circulating libra- 
ries. The booksellers, finding that their buyers were 
growing fewer, had to raise the price of their books. 
And from 1790 to 1850 the price of novels (not to 
mention other branches) ran up from three shillings 
a volume to ten shillings and sixpence a volume. At 
the same time the number of volumes gradually 
became limited to three at the most, and was sel- 
dom under three. For forty years or so this arbi- 
trary rule has prevailed. The novel has had to 
be in three volumes ; the price has been, nominally, 
thirty-one shillings and sixpence ; the only pur- 
chasers have been the circulating libraries. 

Other changes have occurred : the book clubs, 
with very few exceptions, have been dissolved ; the 
circulating libraries, for practical purposes, have 
been reduced to two Mudie's and Smith's : these 
two have long since refused to pay the nominal price 
of thirty-one shillings and sixpence, and have ob- 
tained the novels at fifteen shillings a copy, and in 
some cases at very much less. 

Again, forty years ago the reprint of a novel in 
a cheap form was a rare event ; only the most pop- 
ular novelists were so honored, and then after a 
long interval. It is now the custom to bring out 
a new and cheap edition of every novel the least 
above the average. This edition appears about nine 
months after the first ; the price varies from three 
shillings and sixpence to six shillings. 

We have, therefore, this remarkable custom in 
the publishing of novels. We bring out the first 
edition exclusively for the readers of Mudie's and 
Smith's libraries. These number about 250,000, 
reckoning about four to each subscribing family. 
That is to say, in a home population of 37,000,000, 
and a colonial population of 15,000,000, without 
counting India, whose educated natives read our 



literature extensively, we keep everybody waiting 
for our best works of fiction until this lucky quar- 
ter of a million has had a nine months' run among 
them. Of late, there have been revolts here and 
there. Two or three of our best and most popular 
writers have refused to recognize the Three Vol- 
ume rule. Mr. Louis Stevenson is one ; Mr. Rudyard 
Kipling is another. And now the two libraries them- 
selves supposed to be the props and pillars of the 
old system have announced to the trade that in 
future they will only give eleven shillings a copy 
instead of fifteen shillings for the Three Volume 
novel, and they will make it a condition that they 
shall have the exclusive use of it i. e., that there is 
to be no cheap edition for twelve months after first 
publication. I dare say American readers have heard 
of the storm which during the whole summer has 
raged about this question. The Society of Authors, 
taking counsel of its novelist members, have de- 
clared against the Three Volume system altogether. 
Some of the publishers have advertised that they 
will issue no more novels in that form. Those of 
our novelists who are already engaged ahead for 
the old form I am myself one of these will 
break away from it as soon as they can. And 
although the old form will linger on for some time, 
its tyranny is now past. Henceforth, in this coun- 
try as in the States, we shall appeal to the whole 
reading public at the very outset ; and we shall ask 
them, for the present, to buy our stories in one vol- 
ume at the price of six shillings. And here again 
because we really are a most illogical race the 
six shillings means four shillings and sixpence, for 
the retail bookseller has to take off twenty-five per 
cent from the nominal price. 

It is often advanced in newspapers that this re- 
volt means a demand for shorter stories. The state- 
ment is made in ignorance. The Three Volume 
novel ranges from one hundred thousand words to 
three hundred thousand words in length. The one 
volume novel has exactly the same range. For in- 
stance, Mr. Louis Stevenson will be found, as a 
rule, somewhat under one hundred thousand words. 
" Marcella," on the other hand, now in one volume, is 
nearly three hundred thousand words. The only de- 
mand, in fact, for a shorter story I do not mean 
the "short story," which is another thing is raised, 
so far as I can see, by those who write reviews for 
London papers. Readers, when they get hold of a 
good novel, care not how long it is. Who would 
wish " Vanity Fair " to be reduced by a single page? 
When we are in good company we are loth to leave 
them : there are even characters with whom one 
would like to live for years. A long novel which 
is also tedious is, indeed but then I, for one, never 
allow myself to be bored by a tedious novel. 

And this if you have had patience to read so far 
is the history of the rise, the growth, the great- 
ness, and the fall, of that mysterious institution, the 
Three Volume Novel. WALTER BESANT.

ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY 
OF WISCONSIN. * 

The work in English in the University of Wisconsin 
is done in the two departments, Rhetoric and Oratory, 
and English Language and Literature. The combined 
instructional force is two professors, two assistant pro- 
fessors, and three instructors, seven in all. 

For many years the required work in rhetoric and 
composition consisted of one term's work in formal 
rhetoric, and of weekly rhetorical exercises throughout 
the course. The growth of the University has led to 
concentration. Rhetoric is now required twice a week 
through the Freshman and Sophomore years. There 
are eleven courses in the department, nearly all running 
longer than one term. In the Freshman year the aim 
is thoroughly to ground the students, by precept and 
by steady practice, in the fundamentals of composition ; 
the emphasis is constantly thrown on rhetoric as an art. 
Analysis of themes, paragraph formation, the study of 
the fundamental qualities of style and of great literary 
types, with much practice in writing both within and 
without the class-room, such, briefly stated, are the 
aim and method of the Freshman's rhetorical training. 
Much attention is paid to the mechanics of composition. 
The unevenness of the entrance preparation in English 
compels this. 

Although rhetoric is now required in our accredited 
high schools, still the preparation is very inadequate. 
In some of the schools the study is merely formal, not 
looking to the production of anything ; usually too much 
work is required of the instructor, and not seldom the 
work is assigned to those teachers who have little or no 
special preparation for it ; helpful criticism is therefore 
rare. The course in English composition as laid down 
in the catalogue of the schools is seldom carried out even 
in the letter. 

With our Freshmen, all written work is inspected; 
most of it is carefully criticised, and much of it is re- 
written. We try to lighten the burden of criticism 
somewhat by massing the faults, and then treating 
them before the class. Typically defective essays are 
type-written, reproduced on the mimeograph, and crit- 
icised in the class-room. Some of the faults common 
to beginners arise from ignorance, or carelessness, or

general inexperience, while some are due to lack of cul- 
ture and of mental training. Persistent criticism may 
profitably be applied to the former group of faults r 
while a kindly patience may often note the disappear- 
ance of the latter group. The division may not be ex- 
act, yet it holds true that something may be left to the 
general development of the student. Over-criticism is 
as bad as under-criticism or no criticism. Facility in 
expression may, at times in the student's course, count 
for more than mere conformity to rhetorical principle. 
Criticism that freezes the currents of invention is always 
of doubtful utility. It is apt to lead to mere perfunctory 
work, just as no criticism leads to such work; and per- 
functory work is the bane of the rhetorical class-room. 

In the Sophomore year the essay-writing is continued. 
The application of the principles of the paragraph ar& 
more strongly insisted upon; the great problems in ex- 
pression are pushed to the front. The writing of essays- 
in description, narration, argumentation, and exposition 
proceed with the study of brief extracts of literary 
masterpieces. Milton and Macaulay, Addison and De 
Quincy, Ruskin and Huxley, are critically studied for 
diction, adaptation, and mastery of materials. The 
great webs are pulled just enough apart that the stu- 
dent may see with what pains and skill the weaving has 
been done. We aim not at the production of literature, 
but in some little degree to arouse and cultivate the lit- 
erary spirit; not that spirit that simply enjoys litera- 
ture, feeling what is good, but the artist spirit that re- 
joices in creation, in the perfect embodiment of an idea, 
the critical spirit as Matthew Arnold understood the 
term. At this stage of the work, the criticism of essays 
is largely personal. Many of the essays are read be- 
fore the class. The other influences in the University 
that help the Freshmen and Sophomores to the attain- 
ment of some degree of proficiency in English composi- 
tion I shall speak of later. 

The required work in rhetoric ends with the Sopho- 
more year. The advanced courses in rhetoric, as well 
as the courses in elocution, are optional. The principal 
advanced course in rhetoric is given three times a week 
throughout the year, and is open to those students who 
have completed the required work. The method of in- 
struction is by text-book and lectures, and by wide aux- 
iliary reading. The aim is to cultivate the literary taste. 
Minto's " Manual " and Lessing's " Essays on Criticism " 
are read by the class. The text-book furnishes mate- 
rial for lectures or talks by the students. Orations, 
speeches, and debates are delivered before the class, 
then carefully written out and criticised. Essays of the 
Freshmen or of the Sophomores are corrected by mem- 
bers of this advanced class, who then look over the cor- 
rected work with the instructor. 

The above work in English is done in the academical 
courses. In the College of Engineering, the Freshmen 
are required to take Rhetoric and Composition three 
times a week during the year. The work is similar to 
that required of the Freshmen in the literary courses, 
except that special stress is laid upon scientific and tech- 
nical description and exposition. This is further carried 
out in an elective course in the same departments, open 
only to Engineering students, where the training is purely 
practical, intended to aid the student clearly to express 
himself on scientific and professional subjects. 

An article on English at the University of Wisconsin 
would be incomplete that did not give some account of 
the work of the literary societies. They form a great 
practice department in English composition and elocu- 



188 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



tion. The work is so certain, and so uniform in quality, 
that it may be looked upon as part, and not an unim- 
portant part either, of the students' training. Freshmen 
and Sophomores, while carrying on the work in English 
composition in the class-room, are listening to or en- 
gaging in weekly debates in the society halls. There 
are in all eight general literary societies; and in all of 
them, I believe, essay writing and oration writing is sub- 
sidiary to debating. The competition runs high even 
within the societies. The Sophomores of each society 
hold annually a public exhibition; those who appear are 
chosen for the excellence of their work in the society. 
The most important literary event of the college year, 
not excepting commencement, is the joint debate be- 
tween two of the several literary societies that consti- 
tute the Joint Debate League. The joint debaters are 
usually chosen from those who have made a good record 
in the Sophomore public debate. No labor or expense 
is spared in preparation. 

The relation of the department of Rhetoric and Ora- 
tory to the other departments of a college or university 
is peculiar. It should be in close alliance with them; a 
sharp insistence by all departments upon correctness in 
the composition of themes and topics, and upon correct 
pronunciation and correct speech in the recitation room, 
would add greatly to the efficiency of the English de- 
partment. A graduate's English should be the result 
of all university work; and by English I mean both 
spoken and written English. 

The department of English Language and Literature 
offers twenty-one courses; a few of these are given only 
every second year. Anglo-Saxon and Middle English 
as an introduction to the historical study of English are 
required of students in the English course. This is fol- 
lowed by an elective course in Anglo-Saxon poetry and 
a survey of Anglo-Saxon literature, and this by a course 
in Beowulf as an introduction to the study of Old Ger- 
manic life. A general course in the history of the En- 
glish language is given every second year. A general 
survey of English literature is a prerequisite to all other 
courses in English literature, and is required of the 
Sophomores in the English course. All other courses 
in the department are elective. 

The method of instruction is scientific. Little atten- 
tion is paid to text-books ; the works under consideration 
are studied, commented upon, interpreted. Long lines 
of reading are assigned, and the results are embodied 
in a paper which is read and discussed before the class. 
In the Literature Seminary meeting, once a week for 
two hours, the general principles of literary criticism 
are expounded and applied. 

The scope of instruction in the department is suffi- 
ciently broad. After the general survey required for en- 
trance upon the elective courses, the students may study 
the history of literature of the fourteenth century, the 
literature of the Elizabethan period, the literature of 
the eighteenth century with special reference to the so- 
cial and intellectual life of the period, the English Ro- 
mantic movement, and the Victorian era. There is a 
group of courses on the Drama, beginning with the an- 
cient classical drama in translation, going to the history 
of the English drama, and the interpretative readings of 
selected plays of Shakespeare, with themes and discus- 
sion. Epic poetry is studied in translations of Virgil, 
Homer, and Dante, leading to the great English lyric 
poets. The development of the novel and the develop- 
ment of English prose are each given a place. The En- 
glish essayists, from Dryden to the present day, are fol- 



lowed by the English and American prose masterpieces, 
and those by the English Literary Seminary on the his- 
tory and theory ef literary criticism; the subject for 
study in the seminary for the present year is Robert 
Browning. The courses in English literature are, I 
think, the most popular courses in the University.

THE CHANGELESS BARD. 

(Written on a fly-leaf of Mr. Andrew Lang's "Homer and the Epic.") 

It is an age that knows thee not, I fear, 

Child of the Dawn, which, kissing, smit thee blind; 

Or else could any lover cease to find 

Thy presence in thy works ? Doth not the year 

That rolls, show Nature's face ? Yea, full as clear 

Thine rises still before the adoring mind, 

O Bard serene with love of human kind 

And favor of the gods. What ! could the sheer 

Blank fall of Time engulf thee, eldest born 

Of the Elect ? Nay, sooner had wide space 

Swallowed the pristine stars that sang the birth 

Of this new world, what time the first glad morn 

Showed o'er the eastern hills her gracious face, 

And made for men a habitable earth.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

A WORKING SHAKESPEARE LIBRARY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The appearance of that monumental work, Bartlett's 
Shakespeare Concordance, suggests the question of what 
constitutes a good working Shakespeare Library. The 
veteran Shakespeare teacher, Professor Corson, believes 
that the absolutely needful apparatus for Shakespearean 
study may be supplied by a very few works, and re- 
commends, as constituting an excellent working Shake- 
speare Library, the following: The Cambridge Shake- 
speare,.edited by W. Aldis Wright, nine volumes; (The 
student is presented, at the foot of the page, with a col- 
lective view of all the various reading of the Quartos 
and Folios, 16th and 17th centuries, Octavos, 18th cen- 
tury, and all subsequent editions, together with all the 
more important conjectural emendations that have been 
proposed but not adopted into any text. In the case of 
Plays of which there are Quarto editions differing from 
the received text to such an extent that the variations 
cannot be shown in foot-notes, the texts of the Quartos 
are printed literatim in a smaller type after the received 
text.) The Globe Shakespeare, for line numbering; 
Abbott's Shakespearean Grammar; Dowden's Shake- 
speare Primer ; Dr. Schmidt's Shakespeare Lexicon ; 
Charles and Mary Cowden-Clarke's Shakespeare Key; 
and Bartlett's Concordance. The student who has all 
these works at hand, Professor Corson thinks, is not 
badly off for aids to his study of Shakespeare; he is 
better off, perhaps, than if he had a great Shakespearean 
library at his command, which would tempt him to 
browse around and thus have his mind distracted with 
an excess of material. It would be interesting to have 
expressions on the subject from other Shakespeare stu- 

dents - A. J. H.

JAPAN KOREA CHIXA. * 

Mr. Curzon's book on " Problems of the 
Far East " comes in the nick of time, and has 
scarcely a rival in the field it covers. The eyes 
of the Western world are intently fixed on the 
international drama now enacting in Korea, 
in which Japan and China are the protagon- 
ists ; and there is an eager demand for precisely 
the sort of information that Mr. Curzon gives. 
Of the Oriental " impressions " of the globe- 
trotter we have had enough and to spare save 
in the case of Korea, which floats in the minds 
of most of us chiefly as a land of white clothes 
and miraculous hats. Japan we know (or fan- 
cied we knew) pretty thoroughly. Pilgrims in- 
numerable, from sugary Sir Edwin Arnold f to 
" breezy " Miss Duncan, have journeyed thither 
as to a traveller's paradise, bent on seeing a 
fairy-land of tea-gardens and bric-a-brac, pa- 
per lanterns and tea-tray landscapes, with in- 
habitants to match ; and, naturally, they saw 
what they were predisposed to see. But of 
Japan, the land of aspiring statesmen and de- 
finite ambitions ; the potent factor in the loom- 
ing Pacific Question ; the scheming, far-seeing 
rival of China and Russia for the tongue of 
land the mastery of which will go far in deter- 
mining the maritime supremacy of the Pacific ; 
the country that is bridging with such mar- 
vellous celerity the gulf between feudalism and 
democracy, and between Oriental stagnation 
and Western progress, of this, the actual and 
all-important Japan, travellers heretofore have 
told us relatively little. Painting pictures is 
no part of Mr. Curzon's main design, though 
he shows on occasion that he can wield the 
brush with brilliancy and effect. His stand- 
point is that of the political student, and his 
view throughout is broad and statesmanlike. 
The volume is the outcome of two journeys 
round the world, in 1887-8 and in 1892-3, 
and it is essentially a comparative study of the 
political, social, and economic conditions of 
Japan, China, and Korea. What is the part

t " I conceive that no worse service could have been ren- 
dered to Japan than the publication of the last work in En- 
glish which has been dedicated to her charms by a well- 
known writer and poet. These overloaded encomiums not

which the Japanese require to be on their guard, and which

they are now playing, or are capable of play- 
ing, on the international stage ? What is the 
political future that may, without foolhardiness 
of prediction, be anticipated for them ? These 
are the leading questions Mr. Curzon attempts 
to answer. His treatment of Japan is purely 
political, and his picture of Japanese home pol- 
itics is not, on the whole, a bright one. After 
a twenty years' travail, Japan has given birth 
to a Parliamentary Constitution, and the two 
chambers created under it are rapidly intro- 
ducing the people to the amenities of parlia- 
mentary methods obstruction within doors 
and demagogism without to the phenomena 
of Radical and Conservative parties, and to 
the familiar palaestra of begging and refusing 
supplies. The Diet approximates to the Prus- 
sian model. There is a House of Peers (270 
members) which is partly hereditary, partly 
nominated, and partly elected. The members 
of the first two classes sit for life, those of the 
third class for seven years. The Lower House, 
which contains 300 members, and sits for four 
years, being bound to meet at least once a year 
for a three months' session, is wholly elective, 
and is composed of the representatives of the 
principal prefectures and towns, returned in 
the proportion of one to every 128,000 of the 
people, upon a tax-paying, residential, and age 
franchise. The Japanese have acquired the 
routine of parliamentary conduct with their 
usual facility, and the new regime has had its 
natural effect upon the people at large. There 
is a prodigious growth of mushroom journals 
of the " organ " variety ; and we read of polit- 
ical clubs, of agitations for an extension of 
the franchise, of mass-meetings, of " silver- 
tongued " orators and " scathing " speeches ; 
and we realize that in far Japan, Demos, hav- 
ing found belated utterance, is being flattered, 
cheated, and cajoled by his natural mentors in 
the good old way. Happily, with a limited 
franchise, the Japanese " boss " is still below 
the political horizon. The Lower House, says 
Mr. Curzon, is by its constitution afflicted with 
the vices of an irresponsible opposition ; and 
so far it has combated successive governments, 
impeding their measures and defeating their 
budgets, with a persistency worthy of Irish ob- 
structionists. Of the many " rocks ahead " 
pointed out by our author which threaten con- 
stitutional rule in Japan, the most menacing 
by far is the question of the relations of the 
Chamber with the Government, which repro- 
duce, though in different form, the controver- 
sial impasse presented from time to time in 



190 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



England between a Eadical majority in the 
House of Commons and a Conservative one in 
the House of Lords. Japan has parties, but 
no party government. The Ministers are re- 
sponsible, not to the Diet, but to the Emperor, 
retaining office during his pleasure. There is 
no a priori reason why the dangerous situation 
presented by a majority hostile to the Exec- 
utive, in both Houses, should not exist and be 
indefinitely prolonged. 

" The theory of the Japanese Constitution, therefore, 
being the rule of a Government legislating through two 
Chambers, but not responsible to either, and treating 
their representatives with comparative indifference, it 
may be readily understood that the popular Chamber, 
at any rate, which rests solely upon election, though on 
a narrow franchise, becomes an almost automatic ma- 
chine of opposition." 

Frequent dissolutions are obviously a dan- 
gerous expedient ; and should the present at- 
tempt of Count Ito's Ministry to tide over do- 
mestic dissensions by means of foreign war 
prove disastrous (and Mr. Curzon seems to 
think it must, eventually) Japanese politicians 
may look for interesting times in the near fu- 
ture. Broadly stated, the main questions in 
the three-fold problem with which Japanese 
statesmen have to deal are these : the ances- 
tral conflict between democratic and oligarchi- 
cal theories of government ; the role of the 
sovereign in a so-called constitutional polity ; 
and the relation of ministerial responsibility 
to a parliamentary system. They are essen- 
tially the issues over which European states 
have been battling for centuries ; and it is to 
be hoped that here again Japan may profit by 
the experience of the Occident. 

Of especial interest at present is a con- 
sideration of the military and naval forces of 
the Mikado's Empire. Born sailors, and con- 
scious of an extensive and vulnerable seaboard, 
the Japanese are peculiarly sensitive to criti- 
cism of their navy ; and while the administra- 
tion of the department excites acrimonious 
party strife, there is no dispute as to the crown- 
ing need of a policy of liberal naval outlay. 
When in 1893 the government placed the stan- 
dard of national requirement at 120,000 tons, 
extreme radicals proposed an increase to 150,- 
000. An order amounting to 2,000,000 is 
now undergoing execution in Europe ; and re- 
cent events more than justify Count Ito's boast 
to our author, that " the Japanese fleet is the 
next strongest to that of China in the North- 
ern Pacific, and is far more serviceable for ac- 
tion." Not less satisfactory is the condition of 
the army. 



" With a mobilized peace-footing of between 50,000 
and 60,000 men, with a reserve of 113,000, and a Land- 
wehr of 80,000, armed, equipped, and drilled according 
to the highest standard of nineteenth-century require- 
ment, and, moreover, honestly and economically admin- 
istered, the Japanese army need not shrink from the 
test of comparison, in point of efficiency, with the forces 
of European states." 

The Japanese soldier has, unquestionably, dis- 
cipline, perseverance, and endurance. " Has 
he valor also ? " is the question recently put 
by an English military authority. The annals 
of the nation, teeming with the records of per- 
sonal valor and patriotic devotion, certainly re- 
turn an affirmative answer. The high ideal of 
Japanese feudal and national loyalty is fitly 
expressed in the old verses current for a thou- 
sand years among the people : 

" Is my path upon the ocean yonder ? 
Let the waves my shipwrecked body hide ! 
Must I over plain and mountain wander ? 
Let my slain corse 'neath the grass abide ! 

Where'er I cease, 

For me no peace 

Of last release, 
I shall perish by my liege-lord's side ! " 

We gather from Mr. Curzon's reports that, 
despite the heavy draughts on the national 
capital implied by her war establishments, the 
trade and manufactures of Japan are exceed- 
ingly prosperous to the British apprehension 
rather alarmingly so. Surprising advances 
have been made, notably in the manufacture 
of cotton clothing, Japan's export of the pro- 
duct of her own looms having quadrupled in 
the last five years. With the great increase 
in the import of raw material, there has been 
a corresponding decrease in that of manufac- 
tured goods. Especially, thinks Mr. Curzon, 
will she profit in her export of manufactured 
cottons to China. 

" Both are silver-standard countries, and in both 
wages are paid in stiver; and when her superior prox- 
imity, her low rate of wages, and the cheapness of coal, 
are taken into account, Manchester and Bombay alike 
should find in her a most formidable competitor." 

What will be the effect of the present war upon 
this promising industrial outlook, remains to 
be seen. 

Having glanced at Mr. Curzon's account of 
Japan's army, it may be interesting to learn 
his opinion of her rival's. While China has 
made some improvements in her military or- 
ganization, especially since the French war of 
1884-5, it is, as a whole, little less antique and 
no less rigid than its civil counterpart. Its 
first main division is the Army of the Eight 
Banners, a close corps forming a sort of hered- 
itary body or caste maintained at the expense

of the Crown, and, like the Roman legionaries 
of the outlying provinces, holding military 
lands. The nominal strength of the Eight 
Banners varies from 230,000 to 330,000 men ; 
but of these, not more than 80,000 are on a 
respectable war footing. The Imperial Guard 
at Peking, drawn from the Banner Army, con- 
sists of eight regiments ; and side by side with 
them is the National Army, a sort of militia, 
nominally 540,000 to 660,000 strong, about 
one-third of whom are usually called out, " and 
the whole of whom are never organized, and 
are probably incapable of being organized, for 
war." The only really formidable contingent 
of the National Army is the Tientsin army 
corps (mobilized strength 35,000), a compact 
troop armed with modern rifles and Krupp 
guns, and drilled and organized on the Prus- 
sian model. The total land army of China, 
called on to garrison an Empire whose area is 
half as large again as Europe, and whose popu- 
lation is equivalent to that of all Europe, is, 
on a war footing, about 1,000,000 men. When 
we approach the question of discipline, train- 
ing, and personnel, the true value of the Chi- 
nese army appears. The men have many ex- 
cellent qualities good physique, wonderful 
endurance, natural docility and sobriety, and 
considerable intelligence ; of discipline, in the 
proper sense, they have none. 

" No arms in the world, shuffled out from the arsenal 
upon the declaration of war, like cards from a pack, and 
placed in untrained hands, can make them follow lead- 
ers who are nincompoops, or resist an enemy whose tac- 
tics, except when it comes to getting behind a mud ram- 
part themselves, they do not understand." 

Their ordinary weapons are lances, spears, bat- 
tle axes, tridents, ancient rifles bought second- 
hand or third-hand in Europe, with a plentiful 
accompaniment of banners and gongs. The 
arm of the majority, however, is an archaic and 
(to the bearer) formidable matchlock, which 
requires two men to fire it. Bows and arrows 
are common ; and European Dugald Dalgettys 
in Peking are every day scandalized by seeing 
the garrison at archery practice, shooting " at 
a straw doll stuck up in a ditch." In fighting 
the French at Tonking, men of the same regi- 
ment had different rifles, and there was even 
a larger confusion of cartridges. 

" To a Chinaman all cartridges are alike ; and what 
with those that were too large and those that were too 
small, and those that jammed and could not be extracted, 
it may be judged what amount of success attended the 
firing." 

All military drawbacks, however, sink into 
insignificance compared with the final and fatal 



handicap of the native officer. In China, the 
pedant's paradise, where distinction is identi- 
fied with proficiency in the classics, the mili- 
tary profession is regarded with contempt, and 
attracts only inferior men. 

" In the bulk of the army an officer still only requires 
to qualify by passing a standard in archery, in fencing 
with swords, and in certain gymnastic exercises." 

Oddly enough, even for China, where every- 
thing seems to go, as it were, stern-foremost, 
and where a sense of practical fitness, like the 
verb in a German sentence, usually comes last, 
the study of the theory of war is relegated to 
civilians, as a branch of polite learning. When 
we learn, however, that the standard military 
works are some three thousand years old, and 
that the chief authority (one Sun-tse) recom- 
mends such manosuvres as " Spread in the 
camp of the enemy voluptuous musical airs, so 
as to soften his heart " the practical loss to 
the profession seems inconsiderable. Summar- 
izing his impressions of the Chinese officers, 
Mr. Curzon concludes : 

" It cannot be considered surprising that, so recruited 
and taught, destitute of the slenderest elements, either of 
military knowledge or scientific training, they should earn 
the contempt of their followers. Their posts are usually 
acquired either by favoritism or purchase. When it is 
added that they are also, as a rule, both corrupt and 
cowardly; that they stint the men's rations and pilfer 
their pay; and that when an engagement takes place 
they commonly misdirect it from a sedan chair in the 
rear, we have the best of reasons for expecting uniform 
and systematic disaster." 

As to the employment by China of European 
officers, Mr. Curzon observes that she is ready 
enough to enlist them and to pay them liber- 
ally, in the initial stages of a policy of recon- 
struction and to cast them aside, unrewarded 
with gift or preferment, as soon as she has 
sucked them dry. 

" She kowtows to the foreigner as long as she has 
something to gain from him ; but her inordinate conceit 
presently reasserts itself, and a Chinaman is appointed 
to continue, one might rather say to take to pieces, the 
laborious efforts of his predecessors." 

In the light of Mr. Curzon's account it is 
manifest that, despite its great numerical supe- 
riority, the ill-armed, ill-disciplined, and worse- 
led horde, by courtesy called the Chinese Army, 
must go down in the field before Japan's thor- 
oughly modern and efficient fighting-machine. 
It is a corps of regulars against a rabble of 
tramps ; and the issue of the first onset is not 
doubtful. But what of the issue of a long sus- 
tained struggle ? or of a conflict renewed after 
China, profiting by her disasters and eager to 
avenge them, shall have taken the field with an

army numerically far beyond the resources of 
the Island Empire, and equipped, drilled, and 
officered in some conformity with modern stand- 
ards ? A defeat by Japan seems not unlikely 
to prove the rude jog needed to startle China 
from her sleep of centuries, and to bring about 
that real " awakening " predicted by Marquis 
Tseng. 

Mr. Curzon's graphic and comprehensive ac- 
count of Korea can only be touched upon here. 
Korea's new-born prominence in international 
politics is largely due to the bearing of her 
geographical position upon the maritime and 
commercial ambitions of China, Russia, and 
Japan. The opening of the Canadian Pacific 
Railway and Trans-Pacific route on the east- 
ern side ; the probable completion of the Nic- 
aragua or some other inter-oceanic canal to the 
south ; the Siberian Railway, and the ominous 
meddling of foreign states in the affairs of the 
isles of Oceania, all foreshadow a future Pa- 
cific Question to the vital importance of which 
the three Powers named are fully alive. Rus- 
sia, already dissatisfied with her base at ice- 
bound Vladivostock and thirsting for a Pacific 
commerce and a Pacific armament, is quietly 
pushing her outposts into the coveted penin- 
sula ; and, as against her, the interests of China 
and Japan would seem to coincide. Says Mr. 
Curzon : 

" That the true policy for Japan, ignoring tradition 
and history and burying national antipathies, is a friendly 
understanding with China, interesting herself in keeping 
at a distance the common peril namely, the advance of 
the Muscovite from the north appears to me self-evi- 
dent, and is, I believe appreciated by her own statesmen." 

Every Japanese minister has, however, in 
shaping his course now, to reckon with a large 
and aggressive body of his countrymen, who, 
when their " patriotic " instincts are touched, 
" are apt to respond by going stark mad." To 
the latter phenomenon Mr. Curzon ascribes the 
present conflict in Korea ; and he adds : 

" In the event of open war Japan cannot, in my judg- 
ment, escape the blame of provocation, and will, in the 
long run, be the sufferer by the issue." 

Touching the merits of the Korean dispute, 
it may be said, broadly, that while Japan's 
claims, technically surrendered but popularly 
held to, to ascendancy in the peninsula are 
supported by priority in time, China's rest on 
the firmer ground of community of language, 
of manners, and of religion, as well as on ter- 
ritorial connection. Japan's claim dates back 
to the third century A. D., when an Amazonian 
Empress-Regent (appropriately named Jingo) 
led an expedition into Korea, and received its 



submission. Up to the end of the fourteenth 
century Korea remained tributary ; and there 
thus grew up in most Japanese minds the abid- 
ing conviction that to give up this suzerainty 
meant an indelible stain on the national honor. 
The substantial results of the feudal relation 
dwindled away, however, in time, into a barren 
exchange of compliment ; and in 1876 Japan, 
exhausted by her civil wars, prudently closed 
a treaty with Korea, in which was embodied 
the pregnant statement that " Chosen, being 
an independent State, enjoys the same sover- 
eign rights as does Japan " an admission fool- 
ishly winked at by China " from the mistaken 
notion that by disavowing her connection with 
Korea she could escape the unpleasantness of 
being called to account for the delinquencies 
of her vassal." By the Convention of Tient- 
sin (1885), following the revolution in Soul, 
the rival nations agreed for the future not to 
send an armed force to Korea to suppress do- 
mestic disorder, without giving previous notice 
to each other. Says our author : 

" This document was a second diplomatic triumph 
for Japan; for, whilst it was safe to aver that neither 
Power would ever be seriously deterred thereby from 
hostile action, it yet involved the very admission of sub- 
stantial equality of rights as regards Korea, which Japan 
had all along been laboring to reassert, and which China, 
except in the moments when she had been caught nap- 
ping, had as consistently repudiated." 

It should be noted that while Japan, in 1876, 
formally relinquished her shadowy feudal claim 
(born of aggression and weakened by time) 
upon Korea, she has since pursued with unflag- 
ging energy the more substantial goal of com- 
mercial and fiscal control in the peninsula. Her 
colonists and merchants, possessed of capital 
and understanding the use of it, have fastened 
a grip upon the unwary and indolent Koreans 
that will be hard to shake off. The mint and 
the banks are in their hands, and the Govern- 
ment is in their debt ; and (leaving the pos- 
sible fruits of the war out of the count) every- 
thing seems to indicate that in a few years' 
time the Japanese will have obtained a mastery 
of the resources of Korea that will render, as 
Mr. Curzon thinks, " her political dependence 
| upon China a constitutional fiction which the 
wisdom born of accomplished facts may ulti- 
mately allow to expire." Japan has definite 
ambitions ; and it may be that the recent ad- 
vance on Korea is as much a bold move in the 
line of her general policy as a mere piece of 
ministerial Jinesse calculated for home effect. 
The role she aspires to play in the Far East is 
determined by her geographical situation.

" Placed at a maritime coign of vantage upon the 
flank of Asia, precisely analogous to that occupied by 
Great Britain on the flank of Europe, exercising a pow- 
erful influence over the adjoining continent, but not nec- 
essarily involved in its responsibilities, she sets before 
herself the supreme ambition of becoming, on a smaller 
scale, the Britain of the Far East. ... If she can 
but intimidate any would-be enemy from attempting a 
landing on her shores, and can fly an unchallenged flag 
over the surrounding waters, while from her own re- 
sources she provides occupation, sustenance, clothing, 
and wages for her people, she will fulfil her role in the 
international politics of the future." 

To readers interested in the more serious side 
of Eastern life, and in its political problems, 
Mr. Curzon's book is indispensable. His treat- 
ment of Japan is, as said, purely political. 
The excellent chapters on Korea and on China 
are more pictorial ; but here also, as the author 
says, " the trail of politics is over all." Mr. 
Curzon's vaticinations as to the destinies of the 
Far East, and the probable share of Great 
Britain therein, are full of interest, and they 
have the decided advantage over Mr. Pearson's 
melancholy " Forecast " of being founded on 
direct observation. The volume is a handsome 
one externally, and it is liberally illustrated. 

E. G. J. 



BARTLETT'S CONCORDANCE TO 
SHAKESPEARE.* 



The Works of Shakespeare have been, per- 
haps, more completely laid open, in respect to 
his vocabulary, his phraseology, every feature 
of his language-shaping, his every thought and 
sentiment, than those of any other modern au- 
thor ; it may, indeed, be quite safe to say, than 
those of any ancient classic, Greek or Roman. 
Before noticing the work whose title heads this 
article, a cursory glance at previous works of 
the same class seems to be called for. 

More than a hundred years ago namely, in 
1790 was published, as a companion volume 
to an edition of Shakespeare's Dramatic Works 
in two volumes royal octavo, published by John 
Stockdale, London, " An Index to the remark- 
able Passages and Words made use of by Shake- 
speare. . . . By the Rev. Samuel Ayscough, 
F.S.A. and assistant librarian of the British 
Museum." (There was a Dublin edition in 
1791, and there were London editions in 1807, 
1827, and 1842.) The references in this Index 
are to the play, act, and scene, and to page, 

* A NEW AND COMPLETE CONCORDANCE, or Verbal Index, 
to Words, Phrases, and Passages in the Dramatic Works of 
Shakespeare. With a Supplementary Concordance to the 
Poems. By John Bartlett, A.M., Fellow of the Academy of 
Arts and Sciences. New York : Macmillan & Co. 



column, and line, of Stockdale's Shakespeare. 
The passages given in connection with the 
index-word generally make complete sense in 
themselves. There are in all somewhere be- 
tween forty and fifty thousand references. Ays- 
cough was a skilled and experienced index- 
maker ; and this Shakespeare Index is a very 
creditable piece of pioneer work. It was, at 
the time, up to the demands of Shakespearean 
study. 

In 1805 - 7 was published, in two octavo 
volumes, in London, " A Complete Verbal In- 
dex to the Plays of Shakespeare : adapted to 
all editions. Comprehending every substan- 
tive, adjective, verb, participle, and adverb, 
used by Shakespeare ; with a distinct refer- 
ence to every individual passage in which each 
word occurs. By Francis Twiss." This is now 
a scarce work, as, according to Thimm's Shake- 
speariana, 542 copies of an impression of 750 
were destroyed by the fire at Bensley's, the 
printer, in 1807. A curious fact in connection 
with it, especially curious to Shakespeareans of 
the present day, is the ill-natured opinion ex- 
pressed in " The Eclectic Review " for Jan- 
uary, 1807, in regard to the homage to Shake- 
speare implied in such an Index. The compiler 
is reprehended for " the misapplication of his 
time and talents to that blind devotion which 
fashion requires to be paid at the shrine of 
Shakespeare by everyone who makes the slight- 
est pretensions to refinement of taste." I have 
never seen a copy of this work, and cannot 
speak of its merits. But it probably does not 
even approach a realization of what is set forth 
in the title. 

In 1845, Mrs. Mary Cowden-Clarke pub- 
lished her " Complete Concordance to Shake- 
speare : being a verbal index to all the passages 
in the dramatic works of the poet." This Con- 
cordance was the result of " sixteen years' as- 
siduous labour," as stated by the author in the 
preface, " the twelve years' writing, and the 
four more bestowed on collating with recent 
editions and correcting the press." This was 
regarded at the time of its publication, and 
long after, as a final work. It was not sup- 
posed that Shakespearian study would ever de- 
mand anything more complete. If there had 
been, when Mrs. Cowden-Clarke entered upon 
her long labor, a standard numbering of the 
lines of scenes, as has since been established 
by the " Globe " Shakespeare, and had she 
given the latter in connection with act and 
scene, very little more could ever have been 
desired in a concordance. The omission of 



194

[Oct. 1, 



certain particles, which the progress of English 
philology has brought into importance, might 
have been supplied ; but it would hardly have 
been necessary to do the whole work over. 

In 1874 was published by J. B. Lippincott 
& Co., of Philadelphia, " A Concordance to 
Shakespeare's Poems : an Index to every word 
therein contained. By Mrs. Horace Howard 
Furness." This is the completest concordance 
ever prepared to any work. Every word, with- 
out a single exception, and every passage in 
which it occurs in the several poems, is given. 
Even the prepositive to of infinitives is re- 
corded as a separate word. That nothing 
may be wanted to the convenience of the stu- 
dent, the Poems themselves are reprinted at 
the end. As a justification of her recording 
every word, and every passage in which it oc- 
curs, the author says in her preface : " As it 
is impossible to limit the purposes for which 
the language of Shakespeare may be studied, 
or to say that the time will not come, if it has 
not already, when his use of every part of 
speech, down to the humblest conjunction, will 
be criticised with as much nicety as has been 
bestowed upon Greek and Latin authors, it 
seems to me that, in the selection of words to 
be recorded, no discretionary powers should be 
granted to the ' harmless drudge ' compiling a 
concordance." 

In 1874-'75 appeared in Berlin, in two vol- 
umes royal octavo, what was at the time, and 
continues to be, the most valuable contribution 
of German scholarship to Shakespearean study : 
namely, Dr. Alexander Schmidt's "Shake- 
speare Lexicon ; a complete dictionary of all 
the English words, phrases, and constructions 
in the works of the poet." No student could 
use this work long without an ever-increasing 
wonder at its thoroughness, at the sagacity of 
the author, at his susceptibility, as a foreigner, 
to the varied forces and colorings of words, the 
definitions of which are as exact as definitions 
can well be ; and the passages cited from the 
Plays, and those simply referred to, abundantly 
illustrate all the varied forces and colorings 
defined.* 

* A letter written me by Dr. Schmidt, nearly eighteen years 
ago (5th October, 1876), so admirably sets forth one impor- 
tant aim of such a work as his, that a passage from the letter 
may well be quoted here : 

" Your kind letter gave me the greatest pleasure, ... as 
it was the first proof of a full and clear perception and appre- 
ciation of what my Shakespeare - Lexicon was intended to 
be, namely, ' an approach toward a science of interpretation 
and emendation.' All the reviews of the book that I have 
seen in English and German periodicals praise it, to be sure, 
for its completeness, but apparently without being aware why 



In 1879 was published " The Shakespeare 
Key : unlocking the treasures of his style, elu- 
cidating the peculiarities of his construction, 
and displaying the beauties of his expression ; 
forming a companion to ' The Complete Con- 
cordance to Shakespeare.' By Charles and 
Mary Cowden - Clarke."* This work aptly 
closed the long and indefatigable Shakespear- 
ean labors of Charles and Mary Cowden- 
Clarke. It forms, as they state in their pre- 
face, the condensed result of these loving- 
labors, " Wherewith, affectionately and grate- 
fully, we take our leave." Charles Cowden- 
Clarke died, at a very advanced age, before 
the work was committed to the press ; and in 
an " Added Preface," by the survivor of the 
author-pair, dated Villa Novello, Genoa, 1879, 
she states that during the suspension imposed 
upon its production in print, by illness and 
death, a comprehensive Lexicon was brought 
out (she alludes to Dr. Schmidt's *" Shake- 
speare Lexicon "), which included many ver- 
bal points discussed in their work ; and she re- 
solved to sacrifice these points, amounting to 
no fewer than 630 pages of the manuscript, 
and to make the Key a work of reference 
strictly to Shakespeare's style. But a hasty 
glance over the book will show that, while it 
presents all the wondrously magnified features 
of Shakespeare's diction, with quite exhaust- 
ive illustrations of each, drawn from the en- 
tire body of his dramas and poems, a diction 

this completeness deserves any praise, and why it is not 
enough, for the purposes of criticism, to know only what is 
Shakespearean, without knowing what is un-Shakespearean. 
Indeed, completeness, absolute completeness, is the highest 
praise that such a work can possibly earn, and if mine should 
really deserve it, I should confidently hope that it would be 
' sere perennius ' in spite of never so many deficiencies of de- 
tail which have been pointed out and complacently dwelled 
on by some critics. 

" A complete and thorough knowledge of all the peculiar- 
ities of an author's language will always afford the best se- 
curity against that spirit of innovation, that practice of ' cut- 
ting and slashing,' in which the editors of Shakespeare have 
hitherto indulged, and which is contrary to all true principles ( 
of criticism. If I am not wholly mistaken, there begin to ap- 
pear some signs indicating that a better state is at hand." 

* The MS. of this work is now in the library of Cornell Uni- 
versity, having been presented to the University by Mrs. 
Cowden-Clarke, when I was on a visit to her, at the Villa 
Novello, in 1889. The presentation inscription reads : 

"This fair copy of our 'Shakespeare Key' (including the 
numerous pages that were cancelled when the Work was 
printed), written by the loved hand of Charles Cowden-Clarke, 
is presented to the Cornell University (through my kind and 
valued friend, Professor Hiram Corson) by Mary Cowden- 
Clarke. 

" Villa Novello : Genoa, October, 1889." 

The MS. consists of several thousand large pages, in the 
beautiful "round hand" of Charles Cowden-Clarke, which 
Lamb described as " the clear, firm, impossible-to-be-mis- 
taken schoolmaster text-hand."

which, in the contriving spirit of its eloquence, 
is without a parallel in the world's literatures, 
it does far more than this ; and the student 
may consult the work and find answers to num- 
berless questions that may arise in his study 
of the plays, outside of its professed scope. 

In 1881 was published, in 1034 octavo pages, 
" The Shakespeare Phrase Book," by John 
Bartlett, author of the new Concordance, an 
admirable piece of work of its kind. As stated 
in the prefa <% " this book is intended to be an 
index of the phraseology of Shakespeare ; a 
concordance of phrases rather than of words." 

We now come, at last, to the magnum opws 
which is destined to supersede all other pre- 
vious works of the kind, and to maintain its 
preeminence in the remote future : Bartlett's 
Concordance. As stated in the prefatory Note, 
"this Concordance, begun in 1876, was pre- 
pared from the text of the ' Globe ' edition of 
Shakespeare (1875) ; but as new readings have 
since been introduced into the text of the later 
issues, the manuscript has been revised and col- 
lated with the latest edition (1891)." As a 
monument of labor, of " patient continuance in 
well doing," it equals, if it does not surpass, the 
great folio " Concordantiffi Bibliorvm vtrivs- 
qve Testamenti, Veteris et Novi, . . . Editio 
Novissima. Lvgdvni, M.DC.XVI." No ac- 
knowledgment of help is made in Mr. Bart- 
lett's prefatory Note, in which he states that 
" the work has been prepared chiefly in the 
leisure taken from active duties, and from 
time to time has been delayed by other avoca- 
tions." But the dedicatory inscription reveals 
a kind of help which every literary man who 
has been blessed with it knows to be the most 
encouraging and sustaining: "Affectionately 
inscribed to my wife, whose ever-ready assist- 
ance in the preparation of this book has made 
my labour a pastime." 

This Concordance is superior to all previous 
works of the kind, in that it gives : (1) Pas- 
sages in which the head- words occur, of such 
length, for the most part, as make them inde- 
pendent of the context. The narrower columns 
of Mrs. Cowden-Clarke's Concordance (they 
being but one-fourth the width of a royal oc- 
tavo page), and the passages being always con- 
fined to one line, do not generally admit of this. 
The passages given in Bartlett often run over 
into the following line of a column almost dou- 
ble the width. (2) Along with act and scene, 
the number of the line in the scene, according 
to that of the " Globe " edition. (3) " Select 
examples of the verbs to be, to do, to have, 



may, and their tenses, and the auxiliary verb 
to let ; of the adjectives, much, many, more, 
most, and many adverbs ; and of pronouns, 
prepositions, interjections, and conjunctions." 
But (and these omissions are somewhat to be 
regretted) " the definite and indefinite articles, 
the, a, an ; the words, a\ ah, an [if~\ , and, . . . 
are not included among the index- words." A 
reference to these words in Dr. Schmidt's 
"Shakespeare Lexicon" will show uses in many 
instances more or less distinct from the present. 
It would have been well, also, to give, as a sep- 
arate index-word, the prepositive to of infini- 
tives, with all the passages wherein its force in 
Shakespeare's English differs from that of the 
present ; e. g., " To fright you thus methinks 
I am too savage " (Macbeth, IV., 2, 70), To 
being the exponent of the direction of sav- 
age. (See its various forces as presented by 
Abbott.) 

There are several uses of as in Shakespeare, 
and in Elizabethan English generally, of which 
it would have been well to give all the exam- 
ples which occur in the Plays and Poems ; to 
note one only, its use before adverbs, and ad- 
verbial phrases, of time, as it is still used be- 
fore yet. Bartlett gives two examples, under 
the word, of this use : " one Lucio as then the 
messenger " (Meas.for Meas., V., 1, 74) ; " I 
writ to Romeo, that he should hither come as 
this dire night " (J?. and J., V., 3, 247). But 
there are numerous others. There is one in 
" The Tempest," where some editors put a 
comma after as, and thus make a non sequitur 
of the expression : " as at that time through 
all the signories it was the first." This use is 
represented as redundant. But it is not re- 
dundant. It imparts a precision to the idea 
of time which it qualifies, and is about equiv- 
alent to " just "; e. g., " as now "=" just now "; 
" as then "=" just then." There are " many 
such -like as'es of great charge " which it would 
have been well to include. (See Schmidt's 
" Shakespeare Lexicon," s. t 1 .) Again, there 
are numerous instances, in Shakespeare, of the 
use of the article a or an, to express definite 
unity, as opposed to the indefinite unity which 
it usually expresses, and all these it would have 
been well to include in such a Concordance ; 
e. g., " An two men ride of a horse one must 
ride behind " (Much Ado, III., 5, 40) ; " For 
in a night the best part of my power, . . . 
Were in the Washes all unwarily Devoured 
by the unexpected flood " (7T. John, V., 7, 61) ; 
" you, or any living man, may be drunk at a 
time, man " ( Othello, II., 3, 310) ; " Hear me

Mrs. Cowden-Clarke's Concordance consists 
of 2,578 columns, containing 309,000 lines and 
the same number of references, one line and 
no more being invariably devoted to each pas- 
sage and a designation of the play, the act, and

not, as in Mrs. Cowden-Clarke's Concordance,

SOME RECENT STUDIES ix ETHICS.* 



It is now many years since Carlyle wrote his 
well-known words : 

" Cease, my much-respected Herr von Voltaire. Suf- 
ficiently hast thou demonstrated this proposition, consid- 
erable or otherwise: That the mythus of the Christian 
religion looks not in the Eighteenth Century as it did 
in the Eighth. But what next ? Wilt thou help us to em- 
body the divine spirit of that Religion in a new mythus, 
that our souls, otherwise too like perishing, may live ? 
Thou hast no faculty in that kind ? Take our thanks 
then and thyself away." 

This appeal has not passed unheeded. Direct at- 
tacks upon existing religious views, after the man- 
ner of " The Age of Reason," are becoming less 
and less frequent, while an increasingly large amount 
of energy is being devoted to the study of the posi- 
tive problem, how to make life richer, nobler, bet- 
ter worth living. It is in such a spirit that Mr. 
Bosanquet's latest work, " The Civilization of Christ-

endom," is conceived ; and both those who sympa- 
thize with his general attitude towards Christianity 
and those who do not will be alike interested in 
hearing what he has to say. The keynote of the 
book is struck in the answer to the question, Are 
we Agnostics ? No, is the emphatic reply. Man 
must be fed upon affirmations, not negations. 
Whatever knowledge may be otherwise denied us,, 
this is certain : the difference between right and 
wrong is fundamental, and. the service of society 
is the highest form of human life. For himself, 
therefore, the author rejects the name Agnostic, 
which calls attention to what we do not know, and 
if he must wear a label, prefers the use of the ad- 
jective ethical, which indicates the nature of his 
practical ideals. These latter are summed up in 
the words which he twice quotes from Tourgue'nieff : 
" My faith is in civilization, and I require no other 
creed." This civilization may properly be called 
Christian, because the essence of Christianity, he 
tells us, is the belief in a divine (i. e., supersensuous) 
element in man, and in the establishment of the fu- 
ture golden age on earth. And these are truths 
that can never perish. Our author holds, with not 
a few good churchmen, that Humanity is sufficient 
unto itself ; that is to say, man has the seeds of 
virtue as well as of vice within himself. For the 
process which the Church calls regeneration, set the 
intelligent and patient culture of the emotions and 
the will; in place of the prayer for grace, "open- 
ness to all influences which help the spiritual frame 
of mind." Above all, never doubt that what is best 
in life can be other than a permanent element in 
human nature, let creeds and systems crumble as 
they will. Evil there undoubtedly is in the world, 
enough of it and to spare ; and more particularly in 
the presence of suffering the " mere moralist " often 
finds himself at a loss for words of comfort which 
would flow readily from Christian lips. But while 
this cannot but be depressing, he looks forward to 
the possibilities of the prevention of most forms of 
evil with a faith unknown to the past. " We look 
to moral prevention rather than to moral cure." 
Man, then, is thrown back upon himself for the 
realization of his ideals. And yet he does not work 
all unaided. Through and under all the phenomena 
of human life Mr. Bosanquet finds traces of the 
workings of " the power, not ourselves, that makes 
for righteousness." " The world is friendly and 
kindred to ourselves . . . and whatever fate may 
be in store for the race, we can yet do, in spite of 
it, something worth doing." In no part of the book 
will be found a set presentation of the author's creed 
as a whole. The very meagre outline just given is 
put together from remarks for the most part dropped 
by the way, in his discussion of various concrete 
problems of practical life. Some of these discus- 
sions are devoted to problems which concern more 
particularly the Ethical Society which he himself 
represents. Other discussions deal with subjects 
we all have to think upon, ranging from the rela- 
tion between liberty and legislation to training in

the art of enjoyment. Whatever the attitude to- 
ward the author's confession of faith, no reader can 
fail to carry away with him a profound impression 
of the intensity of Mr. Bosanquet's moral earnest- 
ness and the depth of his moral insight. Earnest- 
ness and enthusiasm, in fact, form the dominant 
note throughout, and the written word owes much 
of its power to the character it all unconsciously 
reveals. 

The volume entitled " Questions of the Day," by 
the Rev. David James Vaughan, consists of twenty- 
four sermons delivered in Leicester, England. The 
subjects discussed are mainly the old social prob- 
lems which seem to cling to the back of the age 
with the tenacity of Sinbad's Old Man of the Sea. 
The church is gradually losing its " otherworldliness," 
and is learning that the kingdom of God is some- 
thing to be established here on this earth of ours, 
and that the Christian is called upon to work for 
its coming. This view we find clearly enunciated 
by the author in his chapter on the City of God. 
But that is about all that can be said for the book. 
No use is made of this conception in the solution of 
concrete present-day problems. And the reader 
who is only moderately acquainted with the litera- 
ture of social reform will not merely find nothing 
new in this volume, he will even fail to discover 
any traces of the thought and the observation of 
others. For instance, in his discussion of the rela- 
tions of labor and capital, the author does not be- 
tray the slightest acquaintance with the profound 
principle which was enunciated by Comte and might 
be so impressively urged by the representative of 
him who taught " Love thy neighbor as thyself," 
the principle, namely, that every person who lives 
by useful labor should be habituated to regard him- 
self as a public servant, working not merely for 
himself but for the benefit of society. The only 
light our author seems to be able to shed upon these 
vexed problems is that wealth does not necessarily 
imply happiness and honor, nor does work imply 
misery and degradation. Unimpeachable truths 
these. But one does not pay a dollar and a half 
for a book merely to have this sort of information 
ladled out to him. 

"The Ethics of Hegel " is not a new work on the 
famous German philosopher, but a translation into 
English of his most important contributions to the 
theory of morals, accompanied by the necessary in- 
troductory and expository matter. The body of the 
book consists of an abridgment of the " Philosophy 
of Rights," comprising about one-half of the orig- 
inal work, together with a few scattered selections 
from other writings. This work of abridgment has 
been done with excellent judgment. Sometimes 
several successive paragraphs are summarized in a 
few brief sentences, while details which are not 
necessary to an understanding of the general move- 
ment of thought have simply been omitted. The 
former expedient, however, has been resorted to 
with great caution, and for the most part the reader 
has Hegel's own words before him. We can only 



regret that what for the .beginner is the most valu- 
able part of the entire Philosophic des Rechts, 
namely, the Introduction, should have been com- 
pressed into so small a space. Very great difficul- 
ties have of course been experienced in the work of 
translation. The result is worthy of all commenda- 
tion. The number of Germanisms is surprisingly 
small, considering the nature of the original ; and 
while a few sentences come out obscure in the trans- 
lation which are clear in the German, the general 
tendency is decidedly the other way. To such a 
degree is this the case that even the student well- 
trained in reading German will find it advantageous 
to have a copy of this book by his side when work- 
ing through the Philosophic des Rechts for the first 
time. One slight change would have made the book 
far more valuable to the student who does not hap- 
pen to be able to refer to the original. The ex- 
pressions an sich, fur sich, and an und fi'ir sich, 
representing as they do successive phases in the de- 
velopment of the concept, have for Hegel a very 
definite signification. But in translating it has been 
found impossible to find for them any single equiv- 
alent, so that they are translated now by one word, 
now by another. The consequence is that some one 
of these phases is frequently referred to without 
there being any mark by which it could possibly be 
recognized as such. Objectionable as the practice 
ordinarily is, and much as it disfigures the page, 
the student would have been saved a great deal of 
labor if in these cases the German equivalents had 
been placed in brackets in the text. The Introduc- 
tion, which occupies almost a third of the book, is 
not as satisfactory as the other parts. It must be re- 
membered that the volume under review announces 
itself as especially intended for college students, 
and the Introduction, we are told, " has been made 
sufficiently popular for all persons interested in 
ethical thought." And yet, after this noble declara- 
tion of principles, little care seems to have been 
taken to avoid technical terms and formulae. For 
instance, the constantly recurring phrase "universal- 
ization of the will " is unintelligible to anyone but 
a student of Kant or of his successors. Consider 
the state of mind of an average youth of twenty- 
one, who, on making his first bow to the Kantian 
system, should be informed, in order to remove his 
natural feeling of shyness, that " Kant considers the 
will of subjective man in unattainable identity with 
the universal will of the transcendent intelligible 
world." The entire introductory portion seems to 
us to show the most extraordinary ignorance of what 
the college student or, for that matter, the begin- 
ner in ethics, whatever his age is prepared to un- 
derstand. It is therefore in large part useless ; for 
whoever is capable of understanding it does not re- 
quire it, and he who is not well, he can read and 
wonder. There is, however, one oasis in the desert. 
A list is given of the Hegelian key-words that will 
appear in the text, together with the translation 
adopted and an explanation of their significance. 
The student will find this of a great deal of value.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



To have been complete, the list should have con- 
tained an exposition of the meaning of the term 
freedom as used by Hegel. As here found, it is 
sure to mislead the student who is familiar with it 
only as he has met with it in the writings of English 
moralists. 

What has been said in criticism of the introduc- 
tory portion of the "Ethics of Hegel" applies 
only " more so " to Mr. Bryant's " Syllabus of 
Ethics." We have here presented us a brief out- 
line of the Hegelian theory of morals, written ap- 
parently for young people, certainly for beginners. 
The book represents, we are told in the Preface, 
the outgrowth of work done during several years in 
the St. Louis High School. For our part, we should 
say the book represents the period in educational 
practice when the pupil was introduced to the mys- 
teries of the English language under the gentle 
guidance of Gould Brown, and when the study of 
geography was begun by an examination of the 
principal political divisions of the Eastern Conti- 
nent. We do not mean that it is impossible to com- 
municate to young students the fundamental con- 
ceptions of the Hegelian ethics. But in so doing it 
is absolutely necessary to begin with those elements 
of their moral experience which are, so to speak, 
most familiar to them, and which lend themselves 
most easily to analysis. These must be dealt with 
at such length and in such simple language that at 
the conclusion every abstract term stands with the 
student for one or more concrete facts. And where 
space is limited, completeness in treatment must be 
ruthlessly sacrificed to this principle. How much 
is expected from the hapless American youth may 
be gathered from the fact that he is earnestly ad- 
vised to begin by making a careful study of Schweg- 
ler's " History of Philosophy," in order that he may 
become acquainted with the various philosophical 
positions. As well expect a schoolboy just grad- 
uated in algebra to get an understanding of qua- 
ternions by the perusal of a history of mathematics. 
The u Syllabus of Ethics " is chiefly valuable as 
supplying one more proof of the undeniable supe- 
riority of the primary school of to-day, in all that 
concerns methods, over the average department of 
philosophy. 

" Ethics and the New Education," another pam- 
phlet by the same author, is a rather more satisfac- 
tory production. It is the reproduction of an ad- 
dress originally delivered before the St. Louis 
Society of Pedagogy. It may be taken as a state- 
ment of such portions of his creed as the writer 
himself a teacher feels will be of most interest 
and value to those engaged in the work of educa- 
tion. The most important point made is that since 
man is " made perfect through suffering ' ' and through 
suffering alone, it is a great mistake on the part of 
the leaders of the " new education " to suppose that 
all school- work can or should be made wholly pleas- 
urable. This idea seems well worthy of considera- 
tion. In its reaction from the harsh and unsym- 



pathetic regime of the past, the present is in danger 
of rushing to the other extreme. The vast majority 
of people are so situated that they cannot be " car- 
ried to the skies on flowery beds of ease," and if 
the school-boy and school-girl are to be prepared 
for life, their power to endure must not be left wholly 
undeveloped. FRANK CHAPMAN SHARP. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



An admirable Mr - John Fiske has deserved well of 
School History his fellow-countrymen for his contri- 
oftheUniied'states.^ ui ^ ons to sc i en tific investigation in 
several fields, historical and philosophical. His sev- 
eral volumes upon American history have both 
scholarly breadth and charm, and fairly entitle him 
to be ranked with the four or five great American 
historians. But we are inclined to think that he 
has done a still greater service to knowledge, al- 
though a more unobtrusive one, in the preparation 
of two text-books for the common schools the 
" Civil Government" of two or three years ago, and 
the " History of the United States for Schools" now 
published (Houghton). Of the former work we 
may say that it has been everywhere recognized as 
so much the best treatment of its subject for the 
purposes of elementary instruction that it stands 
without a rival in helpfulness. Much the same sort 
of praise must be given to the present " History." 
It is such easy reading that it may seem at first to 
have been equally easy writing, and only a trained 
eye will realize the amount of nice discrimination, 
of careful selection, and of sound generalization 
compressed into its pages. The general reader will 
find it fascinating, and the practiced teacher will 
recognize in it a tool of the finest temper and the 
most perfect adjustment. Aside from this general 
praise, which we cannot make too ungrudging, we 
must give special commendation to some of the spe- 
cial features of the book. The illustrations are of 
such a nature as really to illustrate the text ; adven- 
titious adornment of the page has been as far as pos- 
sible from the aim of the author in their selection. 
The selection and execution of the maps is such as 
to entitle them to a share of this praise. The ap- 
paratus of " Topics and Questions," contributed by 
Dr. Frank A. Hill, at least doubles the value of 
the work to a teacher who has any business to be 
teaching the subject at all. The suggestions for 
collateral reading are judicious, and draw upon a 
collection of books not beyond the reach of any 
modestly-equipped school. Finally, the appendix 
contains just the documents and tables most useful 
in such a book. The list of novels and poems re- 
lating to American history, for example, supplies 
an adjunct for which students and teachers will 
alike be thankful. Our praise of the book in all its 
main features is so cordially intended that we hes- 
itate to mar it by pointing out a few minor defects. 
The following points, however, have occurred to us 



1894.]

as deserving momentary attention. We read ( p. 60 ) 
that " slaves were brought here from Africa until 
the year 1808." This misleading statement is sup- 
plemented later (p. 347), but should not have been 
allowed to stand in the first instance. To say that 
the Pocahontas story is " doubted by some people " 
(p. 68) is hardly adequate, after Dr. Poole's con- 
vincing exposure of the mendacity of the narrator. 
We regret to see that Mr. Fiske gives countenance 
to the San Francisco Vigilants by saying : " Honest 
citizens were obliged to organize vigilance commit- 
tees to deal quickly and sharply with criminals " 
(p. 329). The statement (p. 399) that the Fif- 
teenth Amendment " guaranteed to all adult male 
negroes the right of voting " is of course inaccurate, 
and the statement (p. 406) that in 1884 the Inde- 
pendent Republicans supported Mr. Cleveland " be- 
lieving that the cause of civil service reform would 
not prosper with Elaine " is at least inadequate. 
Last of all, we note the inaccuracy of saying (p. 409) 
that the Sherman Act of 1890 made " the coinage 
of not less than $4,000,000 in silver each month 
compulsory." These matters are trifling, but they 
should be corrected in the next edition.

for Chautauquans. y ear f the Chautauqua Literary and 
Scientific Circle has just been issued 
from the Chautauqua-Century Press (Flood & Vin- 
cent), in a series of five neat volumes. Professor 
W. H. Goodyear is the author of a treatise on " Ren- 
aissance and Modern Art," in which a rapid survey 
is taken of schools and tendencies from the early 
fifteenth century to the present time. This volume 
is printed on smooth paper, and the illustrations are 
many, although their reproduction leaves much to 
be desired. The history is certainly up to date, for 
it includes the art of the Columbian Exposition. 
Science is represented in this series of manuals by 
a new edition, revised by Professor Frederick Starr, 
of Alexander Winchell's " Walks and Talks in the 
Geological Field." Dr. Winchell wrote this book 
for Chautauquans, and their demand for a new edi- 
tion shows that it found an appreciative circle of 
readers. " From Chaucer to Tennyson," by Pro- 
fessor Henry A. Beers, affords a basis for the strictly 
literary study of the year. One can hardly be other 
than conventional within the narrow limits of such 
a volume, made even narrower by devoting a third 
of the space to selections. The author has made a 
compact but readable little book. A history of 
" The Growth of the English Nation " has been un- 
dertaken by Miss Katharine Coman and Miss Eliz- 
abeth Kendall, both of Wellesley College. The re- 
sult is a good compilation, based upon good author- 
ities, although the closing pages are marred by a 
too pronounced radicalism. As for the cuts, we are 
inclined to think the book would have done better 
with no illustrations than with such abortive sketches 
as disfigure its text. The best of these five books, 
on the whole, and the most needed by the general 
reader, is Professor H. P. Judson's " Europe in the 



Nineteenth Century." It covers much the same 
ground as Mr. Mackenzie's admirable book upon 
the same subject, but the new treatment is more up 
to date, and has classifications and differentia of 
its own that quite justify its existence. We might 
question a few minor points, such as the misleading 
statements as to the meaning of Irish Home Rule, 
the tendency to Gladstone-worship, and the assump- 
tion that the sensational view of Russian despotism 
is in all respects valid. We miss also the note of 
indignation which should not be spared in such a 
matter as the Napoleonic usurpation of 1851, or the 
German spoliation of the French provinces twenty 
years later. But for a book which raises nearly all 
the great European "questions of the day" it ex- 
hibits a more than usual degree of judiciousness. 

On the 24th of June, 1794, Bowdoin 

c iie s e received its charter ' si s ned 

by Governor Samuel Adams, from 
the General Court of Massachusetts. The present 
year is consequently the centennial of the institu- 
tion, and the event is commemorated by expansion 
of the catalogue into a portly volume, containing a 
history, full lists of faculties and alumni, and other 
matter of interest to those connected with the insti- 
tution. Librarian George T. Little is the writer of 
the history, and the editor of the volume as a whole. 
Mr. Little's historical sketch makes very interest- 
ing reading. It is curious, in this age of magnifi- 
cent educational foundations, to read of a profes- 
sorship of modern languages being endowed with the 
modest sum of one thousand dollars, and of a mathe- 
matical chair endowed with only three thousand. But 
it was the day of small beginnings, and few colleges 
have shown as clearly as Bowdoin how fruitful small 
endowments may become. The honorable record 
of Bowdoin, together with the many distinguished 
names found in its class and faculty lists, afford elo- 
quent testimony to the usefulness of the small col- 
lege in American life. Of Bowdoin professors may 
be named Alpheus S. Packard, Henry W. Longfel- 
low, and Mark Hopkins, among the dead ; Profes- 
sors E. S. Morse, G. T. Ladd, and C. C. Everett, 
among the living. 

In our issue of September 1 was re- 
viewed at length the opening instal- 
ment of "The Memoirs of the Baron 
de Me'neval " ( Appleton). Volume III., now ready, 
bears out our characterization of the work as "one 
of the fullest, freshest, and, in point of narrative, 
most trustworthy " records of Napoleonic times. 
Opening with an account of the Emperor's visit to 
Dresden, in 1812, and of the Russian campaign, the 
author sketches broadly yet suggestively such lead- 
ing events as the battles of Lutzen. Dresden, Leip- 
sic, and Waterloo, the return from Elba, and the 
attendant diplomatic transactions ; and he closes 
with a touching retrospect of the closing days at St. 
Helena. Summarizing, Me'neval finds two primary 
causes which prevented the consolidation of Napo- 



Addilional

leon's empire : first, the hatred of the old dynasties 
for the French Revolution, after they once clearly 
discerned its propagandist tendencies ; and, second, 
England's victories on the sea. Auxiliary to these 
main causes were : the execution of d'Enghien ; the 
reverses in Spain ; the campaign in Russia ; and, 
finally, treachery at home "treachery, timid and 
underground at first, but hardy in the end, and 
stalking abroad with uplifted head." In the front 
rank of the traitors were Talleyrand and Fouch<^ 
the former, the last representative of the grand 
seigneurs, supple, insinuating, circumspect, always 
master of himself, grown gray in political perfidies ; 
the latter, the once fiery demagogue who had ex- 
changed the Jacobin red cap for a coronet, " a fool- 
hardy marplot who needed intrigue as he needed 
air to breathe." It is especially against these men, 
concludes Me'neval, that Napoleon launched his 
anathema, when, on leaving for the last time the 
shores of France, he cried out : " Farewell thou 
land of heroes . . . farewell thou dear France; a 
few traitors the less and thou wouldst still be the 
great nation, the mistress of the world." The vol- 
ume contains a portrait of Marie Louise, and sev- 
eral interesting letters, in facsimile, are appended. 

The second volume in the pretty 
" Far and Feather" series (Long- 
mans) is devoted to that patrician 
game-bird, " The Grouse." The Rev. H. A. Mac- 
pherson treats of its " Natural History," and the 
chapters on "Shooting " and "Cookery" are done 
by Messrs. A. J. Stuart - Wortley and George 
Saintsbury, respectively. While Mr. Stuart-Wort- 
ley's quota is well written (notably a graphic de- 
scription of a night's trip on the " Scotch Mail "), 
it does not strike us as at all likely to add to the 
repute of the British sportsman who appears 
therein in the light of an arrant pot-hunter, without 
the pot-hunter's excuse for his atrocities. Much of 
the space is given to a peculiarly aggravated form 
of bird-butchery known as " driving." We cannot 
follow the writer into the details of this organized 
mode of slaughtering the innocents, but its essen- 
tials are simple enough : a line or so of " butts " 
( ramparts of stone and turf, breast-high, to conceal 
the shooters), and a gang of "drivers," provided 
with flags, to drive the game, or rather the poultry, 
the birds being preserved and presumably half-tame, 
up to the muzzles of the guns. Snugly ensconced 
in his coign of vantage, and provided with a small 
arsenal of breech-loaders and a lackey to load them, 
our British " sportsman " bangs away ingloriously 
at successive clouds of grouse, "from morn till 
dewy eve," until the heath about him is a shambles 
and the wagon-train arrives to cart away the slain. 
The slaughter of a successful "drive " is something 
tremendous. We learn, for instance, in the chapter 
on Records, that, on Lord Walsingham's " great 
day," 1,056 grouse were killed in 449 minutes. His 
lordship, who seems to be actually proud of the 
bloody performance, certifies that " once I killed 



three birds at one shot, and three times I killed two 
at one shot, each time intentionally." At Mr. Rim- 
ington Wilson's place, near Sheffield, we have a rec- 
ord of 4,251 birds killed in two days ; while on the 
moor of High Force the record of 1872 shows a 
total of 15,484 birds for nineteen days' shooting. 
The book is acceptably illustrated. 

The bits of genre which largely serve 

** ficti n in " The Yeii w B k " 

(Copeland & Day) are not, as a rule, 
very attractive or stimulating. They are often ama- 
teurish in their impressionism, and have too marked 
a flavor of preciosity. But we must make an ex- 
ception (in the case of this second number of the 
book-magazine) of Mr. Kenneth Grahame's alto- 
gether subtle and exquisite sketch entitled " The 
Roman Road." So charming a bit of writing is not 
often met with in a periodical. The seventy-page 
novelette which Mr. Henry James contributes to 
this number is of course the piece de resistance. 
The other prose contents include an essay by Mr. 
Frederick Greenwood on " The Gospel of Content," 
a study of Bizet, by Mr. Charles Willeby, and a de- 
tailed criticism of the first " Yellow Book," requested 
of Mr. Philip Gilbert Hamerton for insertion as a 
special feature of the second. The editors are out 
for novelty, and they are getting it. The poetry of 
the number is quite insignificant, but the art in- 
cludes many striking things, of which we may men- 
tion Mr. Crane's "Renaissance of Venus," Mr. 
Hartrick's " Lamplighter," Mr. Beardsley's " Gar- 
gons de CafeY' and Mr. MacDougall's "Idyll." 
Altogether, this issue seems a distinct advance upon 
its predecessor. 

The " Discourses Biological and Geo- 

. ^ cal " that are incl ^d i" the 
eighth volume of Professor Huxley's 
collected essays (Appleton) are dated all the way 
from 1861 to 1876. Among them are such models 
of popular scientific exposition as the lectures " On a 
Piece of Chalk," " Yeast," and " A Lobster." It is 
not easy to be a popular lecturer and remain strictly 
scientific, but there can be no question of Professor 
Huxley's accomplishment of the two-fold task. But 
success in this field has its perils, as our essayist, 
with a touch of humor, suggests. " The people who 
fail take their revenge, as we have recently had oc- 
casion to observe, by ignoring all the rest of a man's 
work and glibly labelling him a mere popularizer. 
If the falsehood were not too glaring, they would 
say the same of Faraday and Helmholtz and Kelvin." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" The Life and Times of James the First, the Con- 
queror, King of Aragon, Valencia, and Majorca, Count 
of Barcelona, and Urgel Lord of Montpellier" (Mac- 
millan) is the somewhat formidable title of a historical 
monograph by Mr. F. Darwin Swift, an Oxonian. The 
work is a prize essay, enlarged from its original dimen-

sions by the results of two years' labor spent in the ar- 
chives of Aragon at Barcelona and other Spanish libra- 
ries. The book is a piece of unusually thorough and 
painstaking workmanship, copiously annotated, and pro- 
vided with many extracts from unpublished Spanish and 
Latin documents. There is a map, a bibliography, a 
chronological conspectus, and all other needful appa- 
ratus. 

A new edition of " Grimms' Fairy Tales " (Warne) 
and there cannot be too many is translated by Mrs. 
H. B. Paull and Mr. L. A. Wheatley for the popular 
and inexpensive collection of good literature known as 
" The Chandos Classics." The translation is close and 
acceptable, and the collection is, as far as we are aware, 
complete. A brief introduction provides youthful read- 
ers with a few of the elementary facts and principles 
of the science of folk-lore. 

It will probably surprise most readers to learn that 
British India includes, besides the territory of a million 
square miles under the rule of the Queen-Empress, no 
less than 688 native states, with an area of about two- 
thirds of a million square miles, still under the rule of 
their own princes. These states are not strictly auton- 
omous, but they enjoy a large measure of independence. 
In " The Protected Princes of India " (Macmillan) Mr. 
William Lee- Warner discusses this complex subject, and 
gives a fairly clear idea of the status of these Indian 
dependencies. The discussion is philosophical in spirit, 
avoids tiresome details, and is clearly the work of a man 
thoroughly familiar with his theme. 

Volume XXXIX. of the "Dictionary of National 
Biography " (Macmillan) extends from Morehead to 
Myles, completing the letter M. The Morgans, the Mor- 
rises, the Mortons, and the Murrays share the honors, get- 
ting among them nearly a third of the total contents. 
Roger de Mortimer, first Earl of March, is the subject 
of the longest article found in this volume. Few names 
of literary interest occur, and none of any considerable 
importance. 

Mr. R. W. Moore, of Colgate University, publishes in 
pamphlet form a " History of German Literature " 
(Hamilton: Grant), consisting of eight lectures given at 
the Bay View summer school, and first printed in the 
" Bay View Magazine. " The accuracy and critical abil- 
ity of the author may be illustrated by his character- 
ization of Herr Heyse's " Im Paradiese," the title given 
to a collection of short stories, the chief " one of which 
is little more than the justification and glorification of 
adultery." In his treatment of recent German novel- 
ists, the author claims to indicate by an asterisk the 
works that have been translated into English. On a 
single page we notice the titles of half a dozen works, 
unstarred, of which English translations have to our 
knowledge been published. 

Captain Conder has just published (Macmillan) a 
new edition of "Maccabseus and the Jewish War 
of Independence," which first appeared in 1879. Dur- 
ing the past fifteen years, he tells us, " I have revisited 
many of the scenes described; have lived in Moab, and 
have ridden through the oak woods of Gilead." In spite 
of these outings, however, and of later Palestinian dis- 
coveries, he has found little to correct in the earlier edi- 
tions of the work. The chief authorities remain what 
they were in 1879, Josephus and the first Book of Mac- 
cabees. 

" Libraries in the Medieval and Renaissance Periods " 
(Macmillan & Bowes) was delivered as the Rede Lec- 



ture of last June by Professor J. W. Clark. Although 
a small book of only sixty-one pages, it contains a con- 
siderable amount of explanation in detail of old library 
methods and appliances, and, aided by a number of 
copies from old prints, conveys quite a satisfactory idea 
of the surroundings in which our forefathers read and 
wrote, thereby giving us fresh reason to congratulate 
ourselves on our improved facilities and conditions for 
literary labors in these modern days. 

Mrs. Alice B. Gomme has collected, and Miss Win- 
ifred Smith has charmingly illustrated, a series of 
"Children's Singing Games" (Macmillan), giving also 
the traditional tunes to which they are sung. The col- 
lection is interesting as a contribution to folk-lore, and 
may be turned to helpful account by the kindergartner. 
In fact, these traditional games would be a desirable 
substitute for the artificial games devised by teachers 
of the kindergarten system. The publishers promise 
a second series for next Christmas. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, September 25, 1894. 

Many New Yorkers retain pleasant recollections of 
the two visits to this country of the English poet, nov- 
elist, and critic, William Sharp, whose collected poems, 
under the title " Flower o' the Vine," were published 
by an American firm not long after his second trip to 
America. He is also remembered as the collaborator 
of Blanche Willis Howard in the novel " A Fellow and 
His Wife," as the author of fine working biographies of 
Rossetti, Shelley, and Browning, and as the editor of 
the popular " Canterbury Poets " series. For some time 
Mr. Sharp's friends have been observing with interest 
a succession of dramatic sketches in the decadent man- 
ner, which have appeared in one or another esoteric pe- 
riodicals here and in England. Indeed, if I am not 
mistaken, Mr. Sharp was the first writer of English to 
take up this field. It was something of a surprise, there- 
fore, to read a paragraph in a New York literary jour- 
nal to the effect that the announcement of an American 
edition of William Sharp's " Vistas " was the first inti- 
mation that journal had ever had that Mr. Sharp be- 
longs to the decadent movement. " Vistas " was regu- 
larly published last Spring, and was placed on the mar- 
ket in England at that time, receiving a brief notice in 
this correspondence. Its sale in America was reserved 
for the fall season, and this delay has enabled the au- 
thor to add to its contents. I hear also that this Amer- 
ican edition will contain a four-page Dedicatory Intro- 
duction to Mr. Henry M. Alden, the editor of " Har- 
per's Magazine " and author of " God in His World," 
whose fine analysis of " 1'Intruse " I quoted a few months 
ago. Probably there are not many authors in this coun- 
try or England who have " arrived," who do not owe 
something to Mr. Aldeu's helpful sympathy, thorough 
sifter of literary chaff that he may be. 

Mr. Paul Bourget's impressions of American life are 
receiving general commendation here. I am reminded by 
them that there is talk of collecting and publishing in an 
English translation the letters which M. Georges Clemen- 
ceau, the former leader of the Extreme Left in the 
French Chamber of Deputies, sent to the Paris Temps 
during his residence here shortly after our Civil War. 
He sent regular letters on American affairs to the lead- 
ing French daily, and they are said to contain many

curious appreciations of the politics and public men of 
the stormy times succeeding the War. Coming from a 
man of M. Clemenceau's position and parts, they would 
be sure to command attention, aside from the interest in 
comparing them with M. Bourget's impressions. 

Much local interest is felt in regard to Mr. Edward 
Gary's forthcoming biography of George William Cur- 
tis in the " American Men of Letters " series. As one 
of the editorial staff of the New York " Times," Mr. 
Gary has, in addition to his signed articles, for a long 
time performed a large amount of scholarly work, the 
knowledge of whose authorship has been confined to the 
journalistic profession. He was the intimate friend and 
associate of Mr. Curtis, and understood, perhaps better 
than anyone else, the latter's motives and ambitions. 

A striking piece of impudence is about to be carried 
into execution by the publication of what purports to 
be a sequel to Mr. Edward Bellamy's " Looking Back- 
ward " by another hand. The son of the hero of that 
romance is to be carried into the twenty-second cen- 
tury, and a study of its social order is to be made. I 
do not know whether this is to be another " answer " to 
" Looking Backward," or a romance on the same theme ; 
but such literary charlatanism is justly detested by all 
right-minded men. 

There is interest in the announcement that Miss Kath- 
arine Prescott Wormeley, the translator of Balzac, is 
engaged in translating the works of Moliere for Messrs. 
Roberts Brothers. She has, I believe, translated more 
than twenty of Balzac's books alone, and perhaps may 
now be looked upon as the leading translator of this 
country. Miss Wormeley's father was a British ad- 
miral, but he was a Virginian by birth, and she has re- 
sided in this country since before the Civil War, so 
that we may fairly claim her as our own.

JjITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 



" Old European Jewries," by Dr. David Philipson, is 
announced by the Jewish Publication Society of America. 

M. Alexandre Dumas has spent the summer upon his 
comedy, " La Route de Thebes," which is to be brought 
out at the Franc.ais in November. 

The London " Author," beginning with November or 
December, is to have a monthly letter from New York 
on " American literature and literary folk." 

Professor H. Morse Stephens, of Cambridge, En- 
gland, the historian of the French Revolution, has been 
chosen to succeed the late Professor Tuttle at Cornell 
University. 

Herr Bjornstjerne Bjornson, who is at present staying 
in Tyrol with his family, intends to winter in Rome. 
There he hopes to finish " a great social drama " upon 
which he has been for some time at work. 

According to " The Athenaeum," a new volume of let- 
ters by James Russell Lowell will shortly appear under 
the title of " Mr. Lowell in England : a series of Famil- 
iar Letters." The book will be edited by Mr. George 
Washburn Smalley, who will write an introduction. 

Mr. Walter Besant is said to have three books in 
course of preparation: a three-volume novel called " Be- 
yond the Dreams of Avarice"; some essays on social 
subjects entitled "As We Are : As We May Be"; and 
" In Deacon's Orders." The last is a collection of short 
stories. 



The twenty-sixth of September was a gala day for 
the Northwestern University of Evanston, that being 
the date for the formal dedication of the Orrington 
Lunt Library Building, recently built at a cost of over 
one hundred thousand dollars. The exercises, which 
filled both afternoon and evening, were largely attended, 
and included the usual variety of speeches. The spe- 
cial feature of the exercises was an address by Dr. Jus- 
tin Winsor, who was invited from Cambridge for the 
purpose. The University Library contains 25,000 vol- 
umes, and the new building provides space for five times 
that number, besides rooms set aside for seminary work. 

All lovers of Tennyson will be delighted to see and 
such of them as can, to own the splendid etched por- 
trait of him made by the great French etcher Paul Ra- 
jon, whose companion portrait of Darwin is already fa- 
mous. The Tennyson portrait was made from life, and 
represents the poet apparently at his best, although at 
the age of seventy. The hair and beard are but partly 
gray, and the expression is one of great force and dig- 
nity. The likeness is said, by those who knew Tenny- 
son, to be one of wonderful fidelity. The head is about 
half life-size. Impressions from this magnificent plate, 
in several styles and degrees of expensiveness, are pub- 
lished by Messrs. Frederick Keppel & Co., at No. 1 
Van Buren street, Chicago. The establishment here of 
a permanent branch of this house, so long known and 
highly esteemed in art circles in Paris and New York, 
is a matter for congratulation to lovers and patrons of 
art. 

Thousands who attended the Parliament of Religions 
last year will recall, as perhaps the most impressive 
figure among the assembled prelates, the venerable 
Dionysios Latas, Archbishop of the Greek Church, which 
he represented at the Parliament. The Archbishop's 
death, at Zante, occurred early in September. Aside 
from his high position in his church, of which he was 
regarded as one of the brightest ornaments, and from 
his well known philanthropic work such as that in con- 
nection with the earthquake disaster at Zante in 1892, 
he was eminent for his learning and for his contribu- 
tions to theological literature. A writer in the London 
" Academy " says of him: " A greater breadth of thought 
acquired probably from his long studies in Germany 
brought him closer to the intellectual classes in mod- 
ern Greece than most of his brethren. Whenever he 
preached in the Metropolitan Church of Athens, the 
building was closely packed. When it was my privilege 
to hear him, his restrained yet burning eloquence and 
the but half suppressed applause of his hearers brought 
to my remembrance the accounts that are extant of the 
effect of the preaching of the Golden-mouthed at Con- 
stantinople, fifteen centuries ago." 

The difference between an " author's edition " and a 
" privately printed " book is one not always recognized, 
although the distinction seems clear enough the " au- 
thor's book " being understood in the trade as one pub- 
lished at the cost and risk of its author, while the " pri- 
vately printed " volume is really not " published " (made 
public) at all, but is issued by an author or his friends 
for his and their gratification. Mr. James T. Fields, 
himself a veteran publisher, made the distinction very 
neatly by putting on the title-page of his modest vol- 
ume of poems the legend "Printed, not published." 
Not every poet, it is needless to say, can afford this lux- 
ury of private printing, or the greater luxury of reject- 
ing the offers of publishing houses to bring out his works.

Yet there are such fortunate ones. Mr. Harry B. Smith, 
for instance, whose privately printed volumes, " Lyrics 
and Sonnets " and " Will Shakspeare, a Comedy," have 
attracted attention much beyond the circle of friends 
for whom they were issued, has had several offers of 
publication from Eastern firms; but he prefers to grat- 
ify his taste for privacy in the printing of his more 
meritorious writings, and this he is lucky enough to be 
able to do through the substantial income derived from 
his very successful comic opera books. 

WALTER PATER'S MESSAGE. 

A very interesting article in the London " Bookman," 
devoted to Walter Pater, ends in this fashion: 

" And what, after all, was Walter Pater's message to 
his age? He had given it to the world in the early chapters 
of ' Marius the Epicurean '; he uttered it again but a few 
weeks before he died. Someone in his company, with rem- 
nants of ill-digested Positivism yet strong upon him, had 
asserted that men lived by the memory of the great names 
du temps jadis, such names as Csesar and Leonardo, and 
that it was by the study of their deeds and sayings that 
one required strength of character. But Walter Pater 
struck it strongly: ' No, that should not be your ideal. 
Men who lived in times past, however great, cannot be 
to you what those around you can be. You should learn 
to live in the men and women of your own immediate 
surroundings; their words, their looks, their very dress 
should be to you the very thing that really absorbs your 
interest. Learn to live in and with your entourage, so 
that it may become to you vivid and real. To be alive 
to every influence around you is better far than the ex- 
ample of anyone in the past, however great.' This was 
only another way of expressing the ideal that Marius 
set before himself, ' to be perfect with regard to what is 
here and now,' only a re-statement of the conclusion of 
his ' Renaissance.' If Walter Pater possessed anything 
so bourgeois as a mission or a message, assuredly this is 
what it was philosophy interpreted by one's fellow 
men. ' Philosophy without effeminacy,' was the boast 
of Pericles concerning his native city. ' Philosophy by 
and through a love of youth,' was the reply and corollary 
of Plato, and this, or something very near thereto, was 
the conclusion of his loving interpreter of our own day, 
Walter Pater." 

AUGUSTA WEBSTER. 
(In Memoriam, September 7, 1894.) 
Calm after storm, and after pain comes peace : 

By pain, full-purchased peace is now with thee, 

And surely sense of high sei-enity, 
That in Death's kindly arms thou hast release. 
Sweet singer, woman true, who ne'er didst cease, 

In midst of lofty thinking, still to be 

Helpmate of those in suffering, poverty, 
Nor soughtest honors and ignoble ease. 
We were the poorer that thou richer art, 

Did we not know that spirits do not die ; 
But thro' their high aspirings still have part 

In all the world's aspirings, chaste and high. 
Thy genius quick and loving, must impart 

High impulse till all song can be put by. 

Alexander H. Japp in " The Academy." 

THE PROSPECT FOR MINOR POETS. 

Mr. Theodore Watts contributes to " The Athemeum " 
some interesting reflections concerning the present pros- 
pects of minor poets in general, from which we quote 
the following: 

" I confess to being one of those cheery pessimists ' 



who believe that the time has gone by when English 
poets, save a very few, need hope to write for any other 
generation than their own. But surely that is enough: 
there are a good many English-speaking people about, 
and they do not all write verses. An audience scat- 
tered over Great Britain and all the new worlds of the 
entire temperate zone ought to be quite enough for the 
ambitious bard, who must needs, I fear, leave posterity 
to take care of itself. Our English poetic growths, from 
Chaucer downwards, are so rich that even the specialist 
the poetical student is overwhelmed by them. To 
be read for a few years by one's contemporaries is a 
great compliment to any poet at a time when two-thirds 
of the letters of the world are written in English. 
What room will there be when the best literary ener- 
gie?4>f the English-speaking race in North America, the 
Australias, and South Africa shall exercise themselves 
in the production of poetry, as the best literary ener- 
gies of England were exercised in the time of Elizabeth 
and James I.? For, of course, the poetry of the United 
States, good as some of it is, does not in any way rep- 
resent, as yet, the literary endowment of that great peo- 
ple as English poetry represents our own. From the 
latest romantic revival of Rossetti, Mr. W. Morris, and 
Mr. Swinburne, down to the present moment, a mass of 
true poetry has been produced which in quality far sur- 
passes all the poetry that the eighteenth century pro- 
duced between the time of Pope and the time of Words- 
worth and Coleridge; but where is the room for it? 
A poet like Sydney Dobell or Alexander Smith, or a 
poet like Arthur O'Shaughnessy, rises, makes a consid- 
erable reputation, and seems likely to pass into litera- 
ture; he dies, and in a few weeks his very name is for- 
gotten. The infirmity of our contemporary criticism is 
not lack of intelligence far from it but lack of knowl- 
edge of the literature that has gone before. They who 
have to write have no time to read. Nothing is more 
common than to see half a column of generous praise 
given to verses which are taken, both as to substance 
and as to form, from some dead bard over whose grave 
the daisies have scarcely begun to grow. I wonder how 
many of our contemporary critics have read a line of 
that ' poem of the age's hope ' that marvellous drama, 
of which Tennyson expressed his unbounded admiration, 
' Festus ' or that ' greatest poem of the age,' The 
Roman,' or that greater than the greatest poem of the 
age ' A Life Drama.' In order to be forgotten, indeed, 
it is not necessary for a poet to die; let him cease to 
write for five years, and he will pass out of memory, 
while a dozen ' greatest poets of the age ' will have been 
boomed in succession, and in succession forgotten, over 
his head. The names of most of the poets who were 
the contemporaries of Mr. Philip James Bailey, and the 
names of most of the poets who were the contempo- 
raries of Mr. John Payne, so familiar at those two dif- 
ferent periods, are now as entirely forgotten as though 
their songs were sung in Nineveh or Babylon. But it 
cannot be helped. Art is short and life is long. The 
astronomers tell us that a good many years a million ? 
will run before ' heaven's candles are all out ' be- 
fore the sun loses his power of keeping the earth hab- 
itable by the British poet, and ' there's husbandry in 
heaven.' In that time sonnets may have gone out of 
fashion, as ballades and rondeaus have gone; nay, even 
Shakespeare and Milton may be used at the Board 
schools as specimens of the ' latest form of intelligible 
English.' Poetical immortality is, therefore, a relative 
term."

of which the story is still disfigured by passion and prejudice. I believe that you will best see what 
it really was, if you look at it through the eyes of Erasmus."

MEMOIRS OF THE DUCHESSE DE GONTAUT.

With 13 Portraits in photogravure. Gilt top, $5.00 ; half morocco, $10.00. Also a large-paper edition, limited to 175

and signed by the artist. $12.00 net. 

The Duchess personally knew Napoleon I., the Duke of Wellington, and many other English and French celebrities, during the period dating 
from the French Revolution down to the Restoration. Her pages sparkle with vivacity, and are full of heretofore unrecorded anecdotes and 
reminiscences. 



VILLIERS DE L'ISLE ADAM. 

His Life and Works. From the French of Vicomte Robert 
du Pontavice de Heussey. By Lady MARY LOYD. With 
portrait. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $2.50. 
" The history of a great soul. ... I feel convinced that this sketch 

of the life and works of one who is now acclaimed as one of the chief 

glories of modern literary France will be heartily welcomed." From 

the Author's foreword. 



THE EMPRESS EUGENIE. 

The initial volume of ' ' The Secret of an Empire. ' ' By PIERRE 
DE LAND. From the Seventh French Edition. With por- 
trait. 12mo, $1.25. 

" The Secret of an Empire " comprises the tragic and bur- 
lesque events of the reign of Napoleon III. These Memoirs 
are gossipy but not scandalous, and are based upon new facts 
and documents. 

GLIMPSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

Myths, ideals, and realities. By JOHN G. AIXJER, author of " Englishmen in the French Revolution." 12mo, $1.75. 

Like Mr. Alger's previous volume, these "Glimpses " deal with general incidents and phases of the Revolution, more or less novel to most 
people, and introduce much solid historical fact mingled with entertaining gossip, leading us into long neglected but attractive by-paths of French 
history during the Revolution. 

THREE BOOKS OF TRAVEL. 
DOMESTIC MANNERS OF THE AMERICANS. 

By Mrs. TROLLOPE. 2 vols., 12mo. Reprinted from the first edition of 1832, now rare. With 24 Illustrations from contem- 
porary drawings. Introduction by Prof. HARRY THURSTON PECK of Columbia College. $3.50. 

" Everybody has heard of Mrs. Trollope's famous volume, and it is always quoted as a shining example of malicious misrepresentation, but the 
statements which annoyed our ancestors will only amuse us, and Mrs. Trollope's book is likely to find a large audience among Americans of 
to-day." JEANNETTE L. GILDER, in the Critic. 



THE LAND OF THE SPHINX. 

By G. MONTBARD, author of " Among the Moors," etc. With 
nearly 300 illustrations by the author. 8vo, gilt top, $4.00.

pects with vivid power and picturesqueness.

North America, made in 1893. By the Duchess of Buck-

erature, Essays in Literary Interpretation. Each with 3 pho- 
togravures in dainty binding, gilt top. Per vol., $1.50. Per set, boxed, 
$7.50. Issued also by Messrs. Dent & Co., London. 

CORRECTED IMPRESSIONS. 

Essays by GEORGE SAINTSBURY. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
The great writers of the Victorian age are reexamined with the pur- 
pose of estimating anew in the light of. present literary opinion their 
place in English literature. Their literary value, however, lies not only 
in the novelty of the plan, but in the original insight which Mr. Saints- 
bury has contributed to these studies. 



SHYLOCK AND OTHERS. 

Eight studies by G. H. RADFORD. 16mo, gilt top, $1.50. 

Mr. Radf ord is widely known as the author of the last, and considered 
by many the best, essay in the first series of " Obiter Dicta. " These are 
pleasant essays written by one who is not only a lover of good literature, 
but who loves common sense and has a shrewd- wit. 

THE ART OF THOMAS HARDY. 

By LIONEL JOHNSON. With etched portrait. 12mo, $2.00 net. 
Mr. Johnson's little volume is not only reminiscent of classical liter- 
ature, ancient and modern, it is a classic in itself ; it is a fine example 
of dispassionate and humane criticism, emanating from a rich, mature 
mind, well-poised ; and it is so full and painstaking an account of the 
Wessex country and its rural woodlanders as to prove a veritable mine 
of Hardyana. The bibliography by John Lane is a valuable feature. 



New Novels and Stories. 



Mrs. Oliphanfs New Novel. 

A HOUSE IN BLOOMSBURY. By Mrs. OLIPHANT. Second Edi- 
tion. 12mo, $1.25. 

" Far above the fiction of the day. There is in it no sign of failing

the present generation as it did that which preceded it." The Speaker. 

THE HIGHWAY OF SORROW. A Novel. By Miss HESBA STRET- 

TON. With portrait of the author. 12mo, $1.25. 

A noble story of love and faith brought triumphant through suffer- 
ing, across the Russian via dolorosa of Siberia. The persecution of the 
Stundists forms a subject of timely and important interest, and as the 
book has been written in collaboration with the celebrated writer 
Stepniak, much new light has been thrown on the situation. 



KITTY ALONE. A Novel. By S. BARING GOULD. 12mo, $1.25. 

Not only a graphic exhibition of native character and landscape, but 
a drama of life unf oldeded with all the force and pathos and grim humor 
of which the author is capable.

second edition of " A Daughter of this World," by the same author, 
bound uniform with "Mists." 

This promising young writer, whose notable novel, published last 
fall, attracted an attention accorded to few first stories, has followed 
up his success with a new venture which is a study of pessimism as well 
as a delightfully romantic love story. The scene is laid at Bar Har- 
bor, and the society of this fashionable resort is depicted with graphic 
fidelity.

Works on Literature and Civilization 



PERSIAN LITERATURE. 

ANCIENT AND MODERN. By ELIZABETH A. REED, Member 
of the Philosophical Society of Great Britain and of the 
International Congress of Orientalists. 1 vol., cloth, $2.50. 
This volume traces the growth and development of the lit- 
erature of Persia from its origin, 4000 years ago, to the pres- 
ent century. It contains the philosophy, language, literature, 
and religion of the Persians, as found in their poems, histories, 
and laws, in chronological order and attractive form. 
DR. GKOKO EBERS, Professor of Egyptian Language and Archaeology, 
University of Leipsic, says : 

" I took your ' Persian Literature ' at once in hand and read it right 
through. I am much pleased with it. It is a beautiful book, and charm- 
ingly inspiring even for one who is not a specialist in Persian literature. 
Many of your translations are eminently successful." 

" It embodies not alone the cream of all that has been published on 
the subject, but also much of the unpublished results of late research 
which the author has gleaned through correspondence with the foremost 
Oriental scholars of Europe." Public Opinion (Washington, D. C.). 



HINDU LITERATURE; 

OR, THE ANCIENT BOOKS OF INDIA. By ELIZABETH A. 

REED, author of "Persian Literature." 1 vol., $2.00. 

" In this handsomely printed volume we have a full and sympathetic 
conspectus of Hindu literature, and especially of the ancient books of 
India. Mrs. Reed has made herself thoroughly familiar with the work 
done by the original delvers in the mine of Aryan lore. Her pages are 
full of fascination, her comments are clear and pertinent, her diction is 
excellent, and the most important parts of her book have been anno- 
tated or revised by Sanskrit scholars whose names have world-wide 
fame." The Literary World (Boston). 



MANUAL OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE. 

Comprising Biographical and Critical Notices of the Principal 
Greek and Roman authors, with illustrative extracts for 
popular reading. By CHARLES MORRIS. 420 pages, $1.50. 
"The author has been particularly successful in preparing a book for 
readers who, not having had the advantages of a classical course of 
study, would nevertheless gain an intelligent insight into the world's 
most remarkable uninspired ancient thought and speech." The Ad- 
vance (Chicago). 

" The book presents a more complete survey of classical literature 
than can elsewhere be found in the same compass." Scotsman (Edin- 
burgh, Scotland). 

THE ARYAN RACE: 

ITS ORIGIN AND ITS ACHIEVEMENTS. By CHARLES MORRIS, 
author of "A Manual of Classical Literature." 1 vol., 
355 pages. Second Edition. $1.50. 

" A thorough and comprehensive familiarity with the subject, a happy 
faculty of discrimination between important and relatively unimportant 
matter, combined with faultless diction, unite to make this a veritable 
English classic." Public Opinion (Washington, D. C.). 



CIVILIZATION: 

AN HISTORICAL REVIEW OF ITS ELEMENTS. By CHARLES 
MORRIS, author of " The Aryan Race ; Its Origin and Its 
Achievements." 2 vols., 12mo, over 1000 pages. Price, 



"In giving a lucid account of the progress of man and a reasonable 
explanation of his every advance, according to the latest discoveries, 
Mr. Morris's work stands alone." The. Philadelphia Inquirer. 

"Mr. Morris has brought to his task ample knowledge, a clear un- 
derstanding of the great laws governing human development, and he 
has clothed his erudition in a simple and lucid style." The Boston 
Beacon. 



THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENGLISH 
LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE. 

By Prof . A. H. WELSH. 2vols. 8vo, 1100 pages, $4.00. Sev- 
enteenth thousand now selling. 

No work on English Literature ever issued from the Amer- 
ican press has received such unqualified and almost universal 
commendation. 

" This is a work of great ability and importance ; it is a work to be 
trusted as a guide, to be accepted for its comprehensive views, and to 
be turned to for its inspiring conception of what English literature is in 
itself, and as an interpretation of the national life." Unitarian lie- 
view (Boston). 

HISTORY OF THE LITERATURE OF 
THE SCANDINAVIAN NORTH. 

From the most ancient times to the present. By FREDERICK 
WINKEL HORN and Prof. R. B. ANDERSON. With a bibli- 
ography of the important books in the English language re- 
lating to the Scandinavian countries, by THORVALD SOL- 
BERG. 8vo, 520 pages, $3.00. 

" This is a work of great interest to scholars and literary men, like- 
wise a most important and valuable contribution to literary history. 
Between its covers is comprehended the whole field of Scandinavian lit- 
erature, including that of the nineteenth century." Publishers 1 Cir- 
cular (London, England). 



DEMOSTHENES. 

A Study of Political Eloquence in Greece, with extracts from 
his orations and a critical discussion of the Trial on the 
Crown, from the French of Prof. L. BREDIF, of the Uni- 
versity of France. Octavo, cloth, gilt top, $2.50. 
" This work on the illustrious Greek orator ought to be in the hands 
of all preachers, lecturers, actors, and politicians. Mr. McMahon's 
translation of this remarkable book is admirable, and his editing is 
thoughtful and skillful." London (England) Morning Post. 



PREADAMITES ; 

OR, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF MEN BEFORE 
ADAM. By ALEXANDER WINCHELL, LL.D. 1 vol., 8vo, 
553 pages, with Ethnographic Maps and numerous Illustra- 
tions, $3.50. 

Fifth edition, enlarged by the addition of twenty-five pages 
of supplementary notes and citations, representing the move- 
ment of scientific opinion during the past ten years in relation 
to themes discussed in this work. 

" There has been no work published upon the subject which can 
compare with this in importance. It is the fruit of an exhaustive study, 
not of one but of all the sources of information which can be supposed 
to throw light upon the subject. Dr. Winchell deals fairly and honestly 
with facts, and neglects no source of information that is open to him. 
His argument is elaborate and many-sided. The comparative novelty 
of his attempt may be trusted to win for the work the widest attention 
on the one hand, and the most critical scrutiny on the other." New 
York Evening Post. 

PREHISTORIC RACES OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 

By J. W. FOSTER, LL.D. Crown 8vo, illustrated, $3.00. 

" One of the most interesting and important contributions to Ameri- 
can archajology that have yet appeared, and will take rank among the 
leading treatises upon the general subject of European archaeologists ; 
. . . contains just the kind of information, in clear, compressed, and in- 
telligible form, which is adapted to the mass of readers." Popular 
Science Monthly (New York).

THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS 

EDITED BY <DR. ALBERT SHAW. 



TN January, 1890, a new magazine, with a new idea in periodical literature, made its appearance 
1 in England. Its name, the " Review of Reviews," was suggestive of its purpose. Its aim was 
to give each month an epitome of current history and a summary of the world's best thought. In 
a single year it reached a sale of more copies than all the rest of the English reviews combined. 
In April, 1891, an American edition, under the editorial management of Dr. Albert Shaw, 
was brought out. This American edition was not a reprint of the English magazine. On the 
other hand, it dealt largely with American matters and was edited with perfect independence 
in its own office. The success of the American edition has become an event in the history of 
periodical literature in this country. During the first year it surpassed, in circulation, the most 
popular of the old and established reviews and before the close of the second year it was in close 
competition with the leading illustrated magazines. 

The principle on which the " Review of Reviews " has been built, is that a magazine, made 
bright, timely, and comprehensive in text and illustration, and immediately in sympathy with 
every movement of social progress, would be considered indispensable. This theory has been 
vindicated in the splendid success which the " Review of Reviews " has attained.

OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. 

The last of the famous group of New En- 
glanders who made the dream of American lit- 
erature a fact, the last man of letters to survive 
from that annus mirabilis which also gave to 
America Lincoln and Poe, to England Tenny- 
son and Darwin, Oliver Wendell Holmes has 
stolen peacefully to his rest, and we have in- 
deed broken with the past. Few lives have 
meant so much to Americans as that now ended, 
its years so nearly those of the century which 
it adorned. As the intellectual associates of 
the gentle Autocrat went to their own places 
one by one, the affection in which they were 
held seemed to be transferred to the ever-les- 
sening group of those who yet remained, until, 
in concentration of grateful recollection, it was 
all heaped upon one beloved head. Now, there 
remain but memories to which we may cling ; 
the last leaf has fallen from " the old forsaken 
bough," and we smile, as he bade us do, but 
through our tears. 

The love which Americans have felt, and 
always will feel, for the group of our distinc- 
tively national poets, including Bryant and 
Longfellow, Whittier and Lowell, besides the 
one whose loss we now mourn, has had few par- 
allels in other nations for either depth or sin- 
cerity. We knew that they were not great 
poets, as the world measures poetic greatness ; 
we knew that their voices were not of those 
that for all ages speak to all mankind ; but 
they have had for us so many endearing asso- 
ciations, their names have been so indissolubly 
linked with whatever was best and noblest in 
our history and our aspirations, that we could 
not wholly measure them by the cold standards 
of objective criticism. The indigenous nature- 
lyrics of Bryant, Longfellow's delicate treat- 
ment of the romantic aspects of American his- 
tory, the passion that fired Whittier's songs of 
freedom, and the ethical fervor and downright 
manliness to which Lowell gave such varied 
utterance, all these things meant something 
to us, something very precious, very personal, 
and altogether incommunicable to the alien. So 
we did not mind it very much when the amia- 
ble foreign critic told us that most of our poets 
were either mocking-birds or corn-crakes. We 



216 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



knew that it would be useless to explain or to 
remonstrate ; we knew, in fact, that his lan- 
guage and his tests were not ours, nor ours his. 
The work of Holmes, besides having qualities 
peculiarly its own, shares also in the special 
appeals indicated above. There is no lack of 
lyrical or romantic effect, of patriotic or ethical 
passion, in the long series of volumes that be- 
gan with the " Poems " of 1836 and ended with 
" Before the Curfew " in 1888. And how much 
there is that falls without the categories thus 
summarily designated ! 

" What shapes and fancies, grave or gay, 

Before us at his bidding come ! 
The Treadmill tramp, the One-Horse Shay, 
The dumb despair of Elsie's doom ! 

" The tale of Avis and the Maid, 

The plea for lips that cannot speak, 
The holy kiss that Iris laid 
On little Boston's pallid cheek ! " 

And then Holmes was so much more than a 
mere singer. The very fact that we most fre- 
quently call him the Autocrat rather than the 
poet suggests something of his versatile ability. 
With one aspect of his life-work we are not 
here concerned. As a medical practitioner, as 
a teacher of anatomy, and as a writer in the 
special field of his profession, he had a full 
and honorable career, and we may fancy that 
he more than once said to the physician Holmes, 
This is what I really am, the rest is trifling ; just 
as Lamb said of his India House folios, " These 
are my real works." 

But we may put all this aside, and the man 
of letters remains, not sensibly diminished in 
stature. For to his credit stand many entries. 
There are the three novels, and of them we 
must say that they have few equals in our 
American fiction. " A Mortal Antipathy " we 
might perhaps spare, but we would not will- 
ingly lose "Elsie Venner,"even if science frown 
upon its thesis, or " The Guardian Angel," even 
if it do not in all respects fulfil the require- 
ments of the fictive art. We should say that 
no reservations need be made when it is a ques- 
tion of praising the four volumes of Table-Talk, 
which begin with the breakfast-table and end 
with the tea-cups. And besides these gifts, he 
gave us the sympathetic and beautiful memoirs 
of Motley and Emerson, and the many prose 
miscellanies that are only less charming than 
his more famous works. 

As a poet and in the final settlement the 
poet will outweigh the writer of prose Holmes 
preserved for us the spirit of the classical age 
at a time when romanticism was in full cry. 
But, as Mr. Stedman happily suggests, his work 



was a survival rather than a revival. It is 
curious, indeed, as the same acute critic re- 
marks, to note how persistently he remained 
an artificer upon the old-fashioned lines, al- 
though ever alert to seize the new occasion and 
the new theme. We have had no other so ex- 
pert in personal and occasional verse, no other 
who could so distil the very quintessence of 
Yankee humor, or of the other and finer qual- 
ities of the New England intellect, into the 
most limpid of song. And when he was en- 
tirely serious, how exquisite was his touch, how 
pure his pathos, how clear his ethical sense ! 
Let " The Voiceless," " Under the Violets," 
and " The Chambered Nautilus " bear witness. 
And, since no one knew so well as he the word 
most fit to be spoken upon any solemn occa- 
sion, let us write in his own words his epitaph : 

" Say not the Poet dies ! 

Though' in the dust he lies, 
He cannot forfeit his melodious breath, 

Unsphered by envious death ! 
Life drops the voiceless myriads from its roll ; 

Their fate he cannot share, 

Who, in the enchanted air 

Sweet with the lingering strains that Echo stole, 
Has left his dearer self, the music of his soul ! 

' ' He sleeps ; he cannot die ! 

As evening's long-drawn sigh, 
Lifting the rose-leaves on his peaceful mound, 

Spreads all their sweets around, 
So, laden with his song, the breezes blow 

From where the rustling sedge 

Frets our rude ocean's edge 
To the smooth sea beyond the peaks of snow. 
His soul the air enshrines and leaves but dust below ! " 



BIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY. 

Oliver Wendell Holmes was born August 29, 
1809, at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a house just 
across the street from the buildings of Harvard Col- 
lege. He entered Harvard in 1825, and was grad- 
uated in 1829. He studied law for a year, then 
medicine, the latter both at home and abroad. In 
1836, after his return to America, he took his de- 
gree in medicine, and published his first volume of 
" Poems." Some of these pieces had been published 
long before in newspapers and elsewhere, "Old Iron- 
sides " dating from 1830. In 1839 he accepted a 
chair at Dartmouth, remaining two years. He was 
married to Amelia Lee Jackson in 1840. Return- 
ing to Boston, he settled down to the practice of 
medicine until 1847, when he accepted the Harvard 
professorship of anatomy, then offered him, a chair 
which he held actively until 1882, and as professor 
emeritus until his death. In 1842 he published 
" Homoeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions," and vol- 
umes of " Poems " in 1846, 1849, and 1850. " The 
Atlantic Monthly " was started in 1857, and " The 
Autocrat of the Breakfast Table " began with it, 
making the new magazine famous at once. This 
work appeared as a volume in 1858, and was fol-

lowed by the "Professor " in 1860, and the " Poet " 
in 1872. Meanwhile the following volumes were 
published : " Currents and Counter - Currents in 
Medical Science " (1861), " Elsie Venner " (1861), 
" Songs in Many Keys " (1861), " Soundings from 
the Atlantic" (1863), " Humorous Poems " (1865), 
" The Guardian Angel " (1867), and " Mechanism 
in Thought and Morals" (1871). " Songs of Many 
Seasons " (1874), a Memoir of Motley " (1878), 
"The Iron Gate" (1880), "Pages from an Old

(1883), "Ralph Waldo Emerson" (1884), "A 
Mortal Antipathy " (1885), "Our Hundred Days 
in Europe " (1887 ), " Before the Curfew " (1888), 
and "Over the Tea-Cups" (1890), comple'te the 
list of his works, excepting a few ephemeral or 
technical publications. The visit to Europe de- 
scribed in one of these later volumes was made in 
1886. In 1893, he acted as chairman of the East- 
ern Committee of Arrangements for the Chicago 
Congress of Authors, and took much interest in the 
project. He died on the seventh of this month, of 
heart failure, at his home in Boston. 



DA VIP SWING. 

David Swing, who died at his home in Chicago 
on the third of October, was one of the most widely 
known of Chicago preachers, and enjoyed also a 
certain reputation, albeit a slender one, as a man of 
letters. In the latter capacity, he was the author of 
three or four volumes of essays sermons and liter- 
ary club papers which are characterized by grace 
rather than forcefulness, and by a certain languor 
of manner equally characteristic of their author as 
a public speaker. These books exhibit the workings 
of a mind given to much reading of good books, 
one whose mental process remotely suggests that of 
Emerson. As a preacher, David Swing stood for 
the forces that have done so much to liberalize re- 
ligious thought during the past quarter of a century, 
and in his sermons, dogma, which most theologians 
offer to their public in solid lumps, had gone com- 
pletely into solution. Still, it was his instinct rather 
than his logical faculty that thus placed him in the 
van of religious thought, for he was always more of 
a rhetorician than a thinker. He was too good- 
natured to be critical, and he sometimes scattered 
his praise of men and books in a way to make the 
judicious grieve. His great professional reputation 
was due in large measure to the celebrity of his 
trial for heresy about twenty years ago. The result 
of that trial was a technical acquittal, but soon there- 
after he severed his relations with the Presbyterian 
organization, and entered upon the independent ca- 
reer which he has since pursued. Opinion has been 
divided upon the question of his justification in this 
step. Those who stood by him during the trial, and 
labored to secure the verdict that was given in his 
favor, were naturally aggrieved when he afterwards 



abandoned them. But his friends claimed that he 
could not have continued in the church without in- 
justice to himself, and that his sphere of usefulness 
was much widened by the separation. Readers of 
THE DIAL, especially in its earlier years, will re- 
member him as an occasional contributor to its pages. 



INADEQUACY. 

Thy palace walls were founded well, 
And well its courses thou didst lay; 

One tower defied the genie's spell, 
And stands a ruin to this day. 

The Land of Flowers thou didst attain, 
And see the spring's immortal jet; 

Thy staff-worn hand was reached in vaiu 
Thy lips that crystal never wet ! 

With pains the altar thou didst dress, 

And the burnt sacrifice prepare, 
And call upon the God to bless 

All but the Fire from Heaven was there ! 

Thou shak'st thy lance on hard-fought field, 
Thou sleep'st, the tingling stars above ; 

Pity and praise sweet eyes can yield, 
But ne'er vouchsafe the Light of Love ! 

What dost thou lack ? 'T is almost naught 
That parts thee from thy Heart's Desire, 

A step a span an airy thought, 
A pulse-beat more, thou didst require !

ONE STEP SHORT. 

It was remarked of a gentleman who was one of 
the most accomplished flutists of his day, that his 
performance was almost maddening because it was 
so good! His execution was brilliant, his tone 
superb, his interpretation and shadings admirable, 
but alas ! he was always a little out of tune, so very 
little out of tune, that his accompanists, whether or- 
chestral or those of the piano, declared that it would 
have been a positive relief had he but been a little 
more out of tune ! Persons who could listen with 
equanimity to that musical monstrosity, a tune 
played in two different keys at once, felt for this 
gentleman's playing a degree of abhorrence which 
" fairly made the flesh crawl." This provoking qual- 
ity affected the player himself, who seemed con- 
scious of his defect, although unable to correct it ; 
and he finally gave up music in despair. I have 
learned that this failing is by no means an uncom- 
mon one among musicians otherwise able ; and it 
has been my misfortune to hear some of the leading 
soloists of an orchestra play so out of tune that the 
water would come into their own eyes, as well as 
into those of the audience. I also remember that 
the great Julien brought over with his band of Con- 
tinentals an English musician whose business it was 
to " raise the note," as it were ; this Englishman

being possessed of an exquisite ear, though other- 
wise master of no remarkable accomplishments in 
his profession. 

Failure analogous to that of the unfortunate flut- 
ist will be found running through much achievement 
in art. There would seem to be something in the 
near approach to perfection which, while it warns 
one of deficiency, does not so adequately warn as 
to enable him to correct that deficiency. Many of 
the monodies written on half-genius and other forms 
of incomplete fruition owe their motive to a percep- 
tion of this lamentable fact. Familiar, indeed, is 
that despair which must be felt, when all has gone 
well with scheme and devisement, while (though too 
vague for specific analysis ) the execution is so faulty 
as to obscure what must be seen, or we, as artists, 
perish ! Poets have rhymes to help them to a so- 
lution of the difficulty, to bridge the lacuna between 
intention and accomplishment ; and the musician, in 
beginning a phrase, finds himself almost irresistibly 
dragged along entrain^ the French would say 
to a consistent form of resolution. Yet it is just 
at this point that what musicians call the " disap- 
pointed cadence " must make itself known in all the 
arts ; for there are few masters in any that, like 
Chopin, can turn all their discords into reconciling 
dissonances, few that, like Browning, can divert 
their faulty metre to represent purposely a halting 
movement. Such power of conversion may be 
reckoned as among the highest uses of intuition and 
as verging closely upon the pure creative faculty. 

As a boy I was once young enough to enjoy un- 
questionably that youth's frenzy, the poetry of Al- 
exander Smith. But in an evil day my idol became 
the mark of ruthless iconoclasm ; for his volume 
falling into the hands of Mr. Punch, that gentleman 
chanced to allude to the great frequency of stars in 
Smith's poetic firmament ; declaring that the Life 
Drama contained as many stars as did the bosom 
of a Polish refugee ! Hence I became somewhat 
sensitive at the unabated recurrence of the stellar 
apparition ; and, as often as the mood was upon me 
to quote to admiring friends several of the most ap- 
proved passages from this poet, I was fain to leave 
out the stars (silently substituting asterisks there- 
for) ! Now, Alexander Smith presents one of the 
most pathetic instances of failure at the very goal 
of achievement : a fertile fancy is his, and a most 
sonorous diction, yet almost always obscured by 
some defect in execution which spoils the whole, 
some needless repetition which borders on the ab- 
surd, but which seems to escape the consciousness 
of the perpetrator himself. In the presence of such 
embarras de richesse, misapplied or squandered, 
how often does one feel tempted to cry out for plain 
mediocrity, defective mechanism, blurred perceptions 
anything where the result falls obviously short of 
the intention. In this latter accident there is at least 
an absence of profanation ; and we feel almost rec- 
onciled to those fatuous rash ones who gallantly rush 
in where real artists fear to tread ! That which is ex- 
plicitly commonplace we tolerate, for it doubtless 



fulfils its mission. But whether the poet be conscious 
of his shortcoming or otherwise, we, the laity, are 
not unfamiliar with the heart-sinking sensation that 
certain lines in noble verse are worse than unsatisfy- 
ing. Their approximate perfection begets an an- 
guish so keen that we could wish the poem of which 
they are part had never been written. Especially 
does this feeling prevail when the context promises 
an imperial fulfilment not borne out in the final re- 
sult. Take a well-known example Leigh Hunt's 
sonnet on the Nile. What a wide hiatus between 
conception and execution, between the sombre gran- 
deur of the opening verse, 

" It flows through old hushed Egypt and its sands," 
and the concluding lines, which go to sleep as to 
aesthetic perception, but " wake " to the somewhat 
trite moral consideration, 

" how we shall take 
Our own calm journey on for human sake." 

Less well-known, though as pungent in illustra- 
tion, is the following couplet from Edward Coates 
Pinckney : 

" Save where volcanoes send to Heaven their curled 
And solemn smokes, like altars of a world." 

What lines these might have made, had Swinburne 
been the poet's master in prosody ! A beautiful 
idea obscured deadened by inadequate wording, 
lies buried in the lines subjoined: 

" And then I saw that, in my pride bedight, 
I craved from erring man the gift of Heaven." 

Yes, too often it happens that some one of the 
instruments in the orchestra of poetic genius has 
lapsed a semi-tone or so, dragging back the whole 
movement to what the sensitive mind feels to be 
worse than chaos, more intolerable than clamoring 
discord. It does not help us towards resignation to 
reflect that the same accident is constantly recurring 
in many of the great problems of life, that our woo- 
ings, our weddings, our winnings, are too frequently 
beset by the same distressing deficiency so near 
and yet so far from that ultimate perfection which 
in their case seems a necessity. 

But let us consider whether, in the instances noted, 
there be any remedy for this tendency to fail while 
almost at the goal of artistic perfection. And again 
let us refer to Alexander Smith. Possibly he might 
have been saved much of that which gave pretext 
to his critics had he possessed, to any degree, the 
sense of humor ; and, indeed, he was so conscious 
of the absence of that element, as well as of the 
mischief wrought by such absence, that in the prose 
papers written after his retirement from verse he 
seeks to belittle the whole arcana of wit and humor, 
as foreign to sincerity, incompatible with earnest 
purpose ; intimating that such small change is only 
current with those who dwell in cities. He even 
goes so far as to cite these qualities as among the 
effete results of overwrought civilization ! No doubt 
he was stung by such arrows in his day ; but it is 
no part of a worthy vindication to ignore the weapons 
that have brought about one's discomfiture. The 
unfinished is too often funny, or, at least, grotesque ;

and so it is not without reason that the shafts of 
criticism, when directed towards so vulnerable a 
mark, should be not only winged but often enven- 
omed by wit. It is so difficult gravely to note an 
obvious absurdity, when the announcement is so 
much more effectively made by an epigram. 

The work of Alexander Smith, whatever its pleas- 
ing promise, whatever its casual power to surprise 
the reader, is unfinished. He has animation, but 
not that " animated moderation " so highly com- 
mended by an English critic of our own day. Nor 
had he, as it would seem, in any very strongly de- 
veloped degree, the artistic conscience, which com- 
mends the role of patience. He therefore reaped 
the inevitable consequences. With pathetic (may 
we not say prophetic ?) consciousness the poet in the 
following lines alludes to his own shortcomings and 
their tragic lesson : 

" There is a deadlier pang than that which beads 
With chilling death-drops the o'er-tortured brow, 
When one has a big heart and feeble hands, 
A heart to hew his name out upon Time 
As on a rock ; then, in immortalness 
To stand on Time as on a pedestal ! 
When hearts beat to this tune and hands are weak, 
We find our aspirations quenched in tears, 
The tears of impotence and self-contempt. 
That loathsome weed upspringing in the heart, 
Like nightshade 'mid the ruins of a shrine." 

The lesson of deliberation in artistic workmanship 
is suggested in the biographical fact that Pope, the 
most finished and painstaking of the writers of his 
period, never allowed anything of his to be pub- 
lished until it had lain by him a year, subject to re- 
vision and alteration. Probably no man who laughed 
so much and so cynically was ever, so far as his 
work was concerned, so little laughed at. And it 
may be noted that, while the literary world and the 
general public almost universally accorded the palm 
to Dryden as a man of affluent genius, but compara- 
tively little of the work of that master has come 
down to us. On the other hand, the phrasing of 
his rival, the succinct yet ample diction of Pope, 
lends household words to every department of liter- 

ature - S. R. ELLIOTT. 



ENGLISH AT WELLESLEY COLLEGE* 

Is it not time that somebody moved a vote of 
thanks to THE DIAL? Surely the present discus- 
sion, with the procession of professorial testimonies 

*This article concludes THE DIAL'S extended series on 
the Teaching of English at American Colleges and Univer- 
sities, of which the following have previously appeared : En- 
glish at Yale University, by Professor Albert S. Cook (Feb.

fayette College, by Professor F. A. March (May 16) ; English 



marshalled by editorials and accompanied by a brisk 
run of letters, is rendering to teachers of English 
throughout the country a service beyond compute. 
Among the happy results of the discussion must be 
counted this : that more than one lonely stickler for 
the supremacy, even in the classroom, of literature 
as an art has discovered, like Elijah of old, that 
the faith has no lack of prophets. Professor Cor- 
son, for instance, has seemed, at times not far re- 
mote, to stand almost alone in his insistent procla- 
mation that the appeal of literature is not exclusively 
to the intellect, but to the three-fold spirit. Yet the 
aim at Cornell cannot easily go beyond the purpose 
at Yale, as voiced by Professor Cook in the opening 
article of the series, to promote " the acquisition of 
insight and power, taking these terms in the broad- 
est sense, so as to include the emotional and aesthetic 
faculties as well as the purely intellectual, the will 
and the moral nature no less than the reason." But 
Yale, pleading for English as "an unsurpassed ali- 
ment of the spiritual life " and " a most effective in- 
strument of spiritual discipline," hardly outvoices 
the University of Pennsylvania, valuing the study of 
English literature for "its enormous weight against 
utilitarianism," or of Chicago, claiming that " liter- 
ary masterpieces should be studied chiefly for their 
beauty." Truly THE DIAL is marking a new hour. 
America, throwing off the tyranny of the German 
method, in which, nevertheless, her leading profes- 
sors of English have been trained, and facing the 
disapproval of gray-towered Oxford, which, at the 
present writing, has two men enrolled as candidates 
for its brand-new English school, is still the land of 
the free and the home of the brave. But if free- 
dom is to be preserved from anarchy, and bravery 
vindicated from the charge of headlong folly, teach- 
ers of English have yet to find a general method 
proportioned to their aim. Enthusiasts, it is true, 
decry that soulless substantive, method. " When a 
teacher begins to cast about for a method," writes 
a member of the English Faculty of Chicago, " he 
is already lost." And yet Thomas the Rhymer saw, 
between the paths to heaven and hell, a path to fairy- 
land. May there not be 

"a bonny road 

That winds about the ferny brae," 

which teachers of literature, who would fain awaken 
their students to the beautiful, may seek for un- 
ashamed ? 

Indeed, we need a road. It is very well for the 
editors and contributors of THE DIAL to claim on

behalf of the student the delights of the " spiritual 
glow " etherealized heyond the dull concern for "the 
historical and adventitious," and to demand that the 
professor add to the most gracious gifts of nature 
a culture deep as a well and considerably wider 
than a church-door, but by what process, after all, 
shall the essential values of literature be impressed? 
Let the new day dawn. Let the student's lifted 
head, cleared from all suspicion of an ache, be 
haloed with golden lights. Let the ideal professor 
guide him to the heart of poetry, of humanity, and 
the divine ; but how is such supernal guidance to 
be effected? 

"He shall have chariots easier than air, 
That I will have invented ; and ne'er think 
He shall pay any ransom ; and thyself, 
That art the messenger, sha.lt ride before him 
On a horse cut out of an entire diamond. 
That shall be made to go with golden wheels, 
I know not how yet." 

Nothing, then, could be more practically helpful, 
at this stage of the experiment, than these descrip- 
tions of English courses now pursued in American 
colleges, especially where the professors in charge 
are committed to the literary aim. Upon this ac- 
cumulated material of experience, theory will soon 
be at work. THE DIAL has already given judg- 
ment in favor of dividing English, as a university 
subject, into the science of linguistics and the art 
of literature. From the various reports, however, 
it would appear that composition and rhetoric, elo- 
cution, and comparative literature, must also be 
taken into account as candidates for separate de- 
partments. 

At Wellesley, the subject of elocution stands 
alone, and we have at present more 's the pity 
no department of "literature at large." Term 
courses in English translations of Homer and 
Dante, with less extended study of the Cid, the 
Song of Roland, the Nibelungen Lied and the Vol- 
sunga Saga, were originally offered in the English 
literature department. A few years since, this 
department, stricken with humility, handed the re- 
sponsibility on to the professors of Greek and Ger- 
man and the Romance tongues, who undertook a 
composite course of English lectures upon the clas- 
sic and mediaeval epics. This arrangement proved 
unwieldy, and fell, like Poland, for lack of a cen- 
tral control. The Romance department offers En- 
glish courses in Dante and in the French epics of 
the Middle Ages ; but for a comprehensive survey 
of the Aryan literatures in their development and 
relations, Wellesley has still to wait. 

Anglo-Saxon is taught in the department of En- 
glish Language and Rhetoric; and also, by Dr. 
Helen L. Webster, in the department of Compara- 
tive Philology. Three, at least, of our English 
faculty are eager to offer Anglo - Saxon courses ; 
and this year Wellesley, like Yale, has three under- 
graduates electing Anglo-Saxon. In connection 
with the testimony from various universities Illi- 
nois, for example as to the disfavor with which 



English students regard linguistics, and in light of 
the experience of the University of Nebraska, which 
has succeeded, by emphasizing the literary side of 
the study, in making courses in Anglo-Saxon and 
Middle English popular, questions press for discus- 
sion. Is this artful dodging of Anglo-Saxon to the 
discredit of the artful dodger ? Should Anglo - 
Saxon be made a required subject in the English 
group? Should it be taught with full linguistic 
severity, as valuable mental discipline, or should 
the teaching be suited to the tastes and aims of lit- 
erary students? What is the decent minimum of 
philology ? And should the Anglo-Saxon course 
precede or follow the treatment of the more mod- 
ern literature? 

In the department of English Literature at Welles- 
ley, no critical courses are offered on material prior 
to 1300 ; and, from Langland to Browning, the lan- 
guage is taught solely as a means to an end. The 
forty students electing fourteenth century work this 
year, for instance, will study the East Midland dia- 
lect for the sake of Chaucer's poetry, not the poe- 
try for the sake of the dialect. 

The Professor of English Language and Rhet- 
oric, Miss Margaret E. Stratton, of Oberlin, finds 
time for some linguistic work, but the rhetorical 
side of her department secures the lion's share of 
attention. Professor Scott's longed-for Utopia is 
not located at Wellesley. Frequent themes are 
required of Freshmen, Sophomores, and Juniors, 
these classes numbering, in the aggregate, about 
six hundred. Moreover, here, as at Stanford and 
Indiana, classes of conditioned Freshmen are a 
conspicuous feature of the Rhetoric department, the 
training of the secondary schools being grievously 
inadequate. Miss Hart, of Radcliffe, and Miss 
Weaver, trained in England as well as in America, 
bend their united energies to developing in the 
Freshmen the ability to write clear, correct, well- 
constructed English sentences. To have mastered 
the paragraph is to become, so far as the Rhetoric 
department is concerned, a Sophomore ; and to 
proceed, under guidance of Miss Willcox, whose 
preparation was in part received in an editorial 
office, to the structure of the essay. This involves, 
together with the analysis of masterpieces and the 
making of outlines, various studies in the orderly 
and effective arrangement of material. Subjects 
may be drawn from any course of study in which 
the student is interested, and some slight opportu- 
nity is afforded for experiments in story-telling. 
With the second semester comes, to able students, 
the chance of electing, in place of the regular 
work, a course in journalism. This undertakes the 
gathering up and editing of news from far and 
near, the condensing and recasting of "copy," the 
writing of book reviews and editorials. A news- 
paper staff is organized, the members rotating in 
office, and from time to time the class is addressed 
by working journalists. The "Wellesley Maga- 
zine " furnishes an immediate field for such youth-

ful activities ; while, for better or for worse, the 
calls from newspapers, the Union over, for student 
reporters of college life grow more numerous with 
every autumn. 

The Junior year brings the course in argumenta- 
tion, which, making as it does for logical thinking, 
is speedily felt in every line of college work. This 
course, conducted by Mr. George P. Baker of Har- 
vard, and similar to the forensic course given by 
him in that university, is described in Professor 
Wendell's paper in THE DIAL'S series. Mr. Baker 
offers, too, an elective course in debate. The crowded 
Senior elective, however, is the Daily Theme course, 
conducted by Miss Weaver. The purpose of this 
elective is to quicken observation and give as much 
practice as possible in the sifting and grouping facts 
of personal experience, and in the clear, concise, and 
cogent statement of whatever there may be under 
a Senior cap to state. 

These various instructors are united in the per- 
suasion that the laws of rhetoric should be assimi- 
lated, so far as may be, by an informal and almost 
unconscious process, and that there should be no 
unholy divorce between the English of the pen and 
the English of the lip. They stand for graded and 
orderly advance, for the development of the per- 
ceptive and inventive powers, as well as of taste and 
reason, and, in general, for a fuller experience and 
more accurate expression of life. It is unfortunate 
that they are themselves mortal, and have thus far 
been unable to accede to the desire of the other de- 
partments that all students whose technical themes 
and examination papers, while good in substance 
are bad in statement, shall be conditioned in English 
and turned over to the Rhetoric department for 
reformation. 

The limits of my space necessitate brief mention 
of the work in English Literature. In this subject 
there is no requirement. It is elected this year by 
more than half the undergraduates, while some ten 
or twelve graduate students pursue courses in res- 
idence and others are working at a distance by cor- 
respondence. The corps of instruction consists, in 
addition to myself, of Miss Vida D. Scudder, asso- 
ciate professor, and three instructors, Miss Jewett, 
Miss Sherwood, and Miss Eastman. Vassar, Smith, 
and Wellesley are our nursing mothers, although 
Oxford, Florence, and Berlin have somewhat tem- 
pered our aboriginal mood. Miss Scudder's espe- 
cial interest is in nineteenth century literature, Miss 
Jewett's in Spenser and in lyric poetry, Miss Sher- 
wood's in the analysis of prose, and my own in 
drama. Miss Eastman is bowed beneath the weight 
of the introductory course such a pre-requisite as 
is given at California and Wisconsin, presenting 
a bird's-eye view of the field of English literature. 
This accomplished, the student is advised to elect 
one of three courses which have for their peculiar 
end and aim the cultivation of the literary sense. 
These courses draw their material from the pre- 
Victorian prose, and from the early poetry, epic and 



lyric; the emphasis in one of the poetical courses 
being put on Spenser, and in the other on Milton. 
The student's third choice is made from a group of 
courses dealing with the literature of various great 
epochs : a fourteenth century course, a Shakespeare 
course, and nineteenth century courses. But to the 
student who proposes at the outset to specialize in 
English we recommend a different sequence : a 
course in Anglo-Saxon for the Freshman year, fol- 
lowed in turn by the Chaucer course, the Shake- 
speare course, and a course either in Georgian and 
Victorian poetry or in Victorian prose, with a con- 
cluding course in the development of English liter- 
ature. There are one-hour lecture courses, alternat- 
ing, year by year, in American literature and in 
Poetics. Miss Scudder conducts a seminary in 
Wordsworth or Shelley or Browning, as the spirit 
moves ; while my own seminary deals with some 
period of the English drama. No text-books are 
used in any of our class-rooms save editions of the 
masterpieces under consideration, and save such in- 
nocuous pamphlets outlines of the courses, with 
bibliography as we individually prepare for our 
own classes. For a young college, Wellesley is ex- 
ceptionally fortunate in her library, and the stu- 
dents of literature and history flock to it as flies to 
honey. Informal addresses by one or another mem- 
ber of the force are fortnightly given before the 
students of the department on current topics of lit- 
erary note ; and frequently an unwary poet strays 
into our parlor, or a famous scholar mounts our 
lecture-platform. The literary societies of the col- 
lege further the aim we have in view ; and, in gen- 
eral, the responsiveness and earnestness of our stu- 
dents are such as often to shame our own inadequacy. 

" The hungry sheep look up and are not fed." 
We do what we can, but are beset by many puz- 
zles. What is the function of the lecture in the 
teaching of literature ? At what point in her career 
shall the susceptible undergraduate encounter the 
standard critic? Can a student be conditioned on 
coldness of heart and on native apathy in the pres- 
ence of beauty? But our chief problem is the cru- 
cial one of the modern experiment. If, indeed, as 
was claimed by a contributor to "School and Col- 
lege " two or three years ago, the constituents of a 
sound education are character, culture, insight, and 
the disciplined working power of the brain, can the 
study of literature be made to promote the final 
end as effectively as it certainly subserves the other 
three? KATHARINE LEE BATES.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE PUBLIC APPRECIATION OF BOOKS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In turning over the leaves of a current review, my 
attention was caught by a curious outbreak from Mr. 
Andrew Lang who seems to have, like the city of his 
residence, a sort of recurring " silly season." Like the 
bandolining young ladies at "Mugby Junction," Mr. 
Lang harbors, as it appears in the review cited, a fine 
contempt for the public. He doesn't go so far as to call 
it " a great beast," as our Alexander Hamilton did, 
but he rates it pretty cheaply, nevertheless. " The pub- 
lic," he says, " does not read books, that is the plain 
truth. The public reads newspapers, and, in very earn- 
est moods, magazines. . . . There never was an age 
that read less, or cackled more about what it does not 
read." Indeed ! The public doesn't read books, and 
it will read newspapers and magazines. Does this mean 
that it isn't doing its duty lately by Mr. Lang's books 
that it grudges its crowns and half-crowns for his re- 
prints, on the paltry ground that it has already had the 
originals for sixpence or a penny ? There seems, on 
the whole, to be some method in this form of popular 
madness. Or is Mr. Lang, after all, only rattling on in 
his old airy way, trying to startle us with a paradox, and 
not meaning anything in particular ? Surely the asser- 
tion that the public "does not read books," and that "there 
never was an age that read less," is, literally taken, the 
veriest nonsense. Can Mr. Lang point to an age that 
read more books, or even half as many, or that was a hun- 
dredth part as liberal say as just to the makers of 
good books, as the present one ? Is literary genius now- 
adays driven to live in a garret and dine off a shin-bone 
of beef, and to write cringing dedications and lying 
odes to pay for its garret and its dinner ? Publishers 
may be presumed to be pretty good judges of their own 
business, and to know, even better than Mr. Lang, how 
many and what sort of books the public is willing to 
pay for. Do their yearly announcements show a falling- 
off in the demand for good literature ? Even in this 
year of commercial depression, we learn in THE DIAL 
that " more than the usual number of important and 
expensive works " are announced, " with at least the 
usual number of books of serious and unquestionable 
interest." Touching our lack of seriousness, at which 
Mr. Lang sneers, well, perhaps this charge would be 
better worth noticing if it came from a writer who 
could himself remain serious for a half-dozen pages to- 
gether. One thing is certain: nine-tenths of us (with 
all our frivolity) greatly prefer just those writings of 
Mr. Lang's own in which the fun of Mr. Merryman is 
least obtrusive. Finally, Mr. Lang complains not 
over-civilly that the public is given to "cackling" 
(that 's his elegant word) about what it has not read. 
Perhaps the public may reply, by may of reprisal, that 
certain authors cackle so much, directly or allusively, 
about what they have read as to breed the suspicion that 
they never stray out of their libraries. Reading, we 
know, " maketh a full man," and, within bounds, is an 
excellent thing; but isn't over-reading pretty apt to 
make a man, what a political opponent once styled Mr. 
Mill, a mere " book in breeches "? Of course neglected 
authors have a prescriptive and indefeasible right to 
scold at the public, and to affect to regard it as a sort 
of philistine Goliath of Gath at whom the smallest liter- 
ary David may have his fling. It does them good, and 



we are not going to grudge them so cheap a lenitive to- 
their smarts. But Mr. Lang, certainly, has not the neg- 
lected author's excuse for his ill-humor with the public.

THE HEBREW AS A SAILOR. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I was not a little amazed to find in a recent number 
of THE DIAL the statement that "a son of Abraham 
. . . having anything to do with a ship " was "almost 
contra naturam." Being a Frenchman by birth, I hap- 
pen to know that nearly every year some Jewish boy 
enters the French Naval Academy, and that at the 
present time quite a number of " sons of Abraham " 
have reached distinguished rank in the navy of France. 
This is one sure proof that when not ostracized the He- 
brew engages in as many varieties of occupations as the 
Gentile, no matter how hazardous they may be, no mat- 
ter what an amount of bodily fatigue and danger they 
may entail. ADOLPHE COHN. 

Columbia College, New York, Oct. 4, 1894- 

[Our correspondent rather overstates the point 
made by the reviewer which was that one would 
not easily imagine " a son of Abraham bestriding a 
yard-arm, or having anything whatever to do with 
a ship except, indeed, in the way of a bottomry 
bond," and that " hitherto," i. e., before reading the 
hook under review, " a Jewish sailor had appeared 
in the light of a roc or hippogriff the rarest kind 
of a. rara avis and almost contra naturam." In- 
stances in disproof of the prepossession were then 
given from the book in question ; and we thank our 
correspondent for having added to them. EDR.

THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN PREPARATORY 

SCHOOLS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In connection with your timely series of articles on 
the teaching of English at our colleges and universities, 
which have been to me and doubtless to many others of 
the greatest interest and value, I venture to suggest the 
importance of a discussion of the work done in this 
branch of teaching at secondary schools. My experience 
is that very many of the students who come to college 
from weak preparatory schools are almost hopeless, so 
far as appreciating literature is concerned. Too often 
they have become bewildered or disgusted with the sub- 
ject; or, worse, they have learned a trick of superficial 
vaporing about literature which is very hard to unlearn. 
In many cases, perhaps in most cases, the college teacher 
is compelled to direct his efforts toward correcting the 
blunders of incompetent fitting schools, to the neglect 
of his own aims and methods. A series of papers set- 
ting forth the work done in teaching English at repre- 
sentative fitting-schools and high schools would perhaps 
do an even greater service for teachers of English than 
the admirable series referred to. JOHN M. CLAPP.

THE "EMINENT SCOUNDREL" IN 
LITERATURE.* 



The monotonous regularity with which writ- 
ers of the lives of eminent people have hitherto 
devoted their pens to celebrating virtue and 
good works is agreeably broken in " The Lives 
of Twelve Bad Men : Original Studies of Em- 
inent Scoundrels." The title has an attract- 
ive ring. Here is a biographer who not only 
frankly owns that his heroes are no better than 
they should be, but estops himself at the out- 
set from the tedious and altogether too common 
practice of whitewashing them. Indeed, as we 
shall show further on, to rob one of these wor- 
thies of a single jewel in the crown of his 
knavery would be to weaken his title to figure 
in the company in which the editor's judgment 
has placed him. It may seem at first glance 
as if Mr. Seccombe, in selecting his names, 
must have been sorely perplexed by an embar- 
rassment of riches ; for bad men, in the usual 
sense, have always been as plenty as blackber- 
ries. What the reader may possibly ask 
is one dozen among so many ? History fur- 
nishes a long roll of what we are used to call 
bad men relatively bad, that is, and sufficient- 
ly so to illustrate the otherwise obscurer vir- 
tues of their better contemporaries ; while the 
most casual glance at existing society shows 
that the rascally tribe, so far from decaying, 
gives every sign of indefinite and triumphant 
survival. Mr. Seccombe, however, as we gather 
from his preface, has really been limited by a 
narrow principle of selection. Preeminence 
in ill-doing, absolute and unqualified badness, 
is the price of a niche in his pantheon. 

Turning to his list of " eminent scoundrels," 
we find that it embraces the following wor- 
thies a careful consideration of whose names 
reveals little to cavil at on the score of insuf- 
ficient rascality: James Hepburn, Earl of Both- 
well (1536-1578) ; Sir Edward Kelley, nec- 
romancer (1555-1595) ; Matthew Hopkins, 
witchfinder (died 1647); Judge Jeffreys (1648 
-1689) ; Titus Gates (1649-1705) ; Simon 
Fraser, Lord Lovat (1667-1747) ; Col. Char- 
teris, libertine (1675-1732) ; Jonathan Wild 
(1682-1725) ; James Maclaine, " gentleman- 
highwayman " (1724-1750); George Robert 
Fitzgerald, "Fighting Fitzgerald" (1748-

1786) ; Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, pois- 
oner (1794-1852) ; Edward Kelley, bushran- 
ger (1855-1880). 

In this " galaxy of stars," literature is ably 
represented by that pseudo - Italianate scoun- 
drel and practical toxicologist, Thomas Grif- 
fiths Wainewright ; and as he was really a man 
of some note, outside his criminality, and a 
friend of the leading literary and artistic lights 
of his day, some account of him here may not 
be amiss. In point of cool-blooded, subtly- 
contri ved villainy, and utter callousness to the 
sufferings of the victims of his cowardly crimes, 
Thomas Griffiths, to our thinking, easily bears 
away the palm. Wainewright was born in 
1794, at Chiswick, where his father was a 
practising solicitor. His parents dying during 
his infancy^ he went to live with his grand- 
father, Dr. Ralph Griffiths, proprietor of the 
"Monthly Review," at Linden House, Turn- 
ham Green, a fine mansion with a rent value 
of four hundred a year. In 1803 Dr. Griffiths 
died, leaving X5,200 in trust for our hero ; 
and his son, George Edward Griffiths, reigned 
at Linden House in his stead. On his grand- 
father's death, Thomas went to school at Charles 
Burney's academy at Hammersmith, and here 
evinced for the first time his love for art, his 
drawing-book showing, as his gratified master 
testified, "great talent and natural feeling." 
After leaving school, while still a mere boy, 
he was " placed frequently in literary society" 
(not very much to his profit, however), and 
for a short time devoted as much attention to 
painting as his naturally " giddy, flighty dis- 
position " allowed him to devote to any one 
subject. This pursuit proving tame, he pres- 
ently drifted into the army, where he served 
successively as an orderly officer in the Guards, 
and a cornet in a yeomanry regiment. About 
this period he seems to have fallen a victim to 
the wiles of Bacchus or, vulgarly speaking, 
to have taken to drink ; for we have his own 
statement that he habitually drank ten tum- 
blers of punch of a morning, which modicum, 
he adds very credibly, had the effect of " ob- 
scuring his recollections of Michael Angelo as 
in a dun fog." The military ardor did not 
last long ; in fact, nothing ever lasted long 
with Thomas Griffiths, except his inveterate 
yearning to leave off what he was doing, and 
set about doing something else. " My blessed 
art," he wrote, in his usual high-sailing style, 
" touched her renegade ; by her pure and high 
influences the noisome mists [bred largely by 
the matutinal " ten tumblers," we presume]

were purged ; ray feelings, parched, hot, and 
tarnished, were renovated with a cool, fresh 
bloom, childly simple, beautiful to the simple- 
hearted." Naturally, in this chastened mood, 
Wordsworth's poems, breathing sweet natural- 
ness and tender piety, touched his regenerate 
heart ; and to testify conclusively to his change 
of spirit, he left the army, and liberally re- 
duced his morning's allowance of punch. About 
this date (1820), " The London Magazine " 
was started, and it soon had a brilliant staff 
of contributors : Charles Lamb, Hood, Hart- 
ley Coleridge, Hazlitt, De Quincey, Procter, 
etc., and Wainewright. The latter wrote 
pretty frequently, under the pseudonyms of 
"Janus Weathercock," "Egomet Bonmot,"and 
" Cornelius Vinkbooms," usually affecting fan- 
tastic titles. That Wainewright's prose had 
merit, is undeniable ; while his love of art, his 
usual topic, was genuine, and his knowledge of 
it considerable. 

But besides art, there was another subject 
on which Wainewright never tired of speak- 
ing ; and that was his precious self. Once 
launched on this engaging theme, he rambles 
on with a sickening self-complacency, and an 
affected, mincing euphuism that prepares one 
to believe the worst of him. A thorough cad, 
he is forever proclaiming himself " a gentle- 
man." Even when, a triple murderer and a 
condemned forger, he was in Newgate await- 
ing transportation for his crime, he still gloried 
in the one imperishable fact that he was " a 
gentleman." Nothing not the dock, nor the 
gyves, nor Botany Bay could erase that in- 
bred distinction ; and when a visitor asked him 
if he did not look back with shame on his past 
life, he briskly answered, quite in the old 
" Weathercock " vein : 

" Not a bit. I have always been a gentleman, always 
lived like a gentleman, and I am a gentleman still. Yes, 
sir, even in Newgate I am a gentleman. The prison reg- 
ulations are that we should each in turn sweep the yard. 
There are a baker and a sweep here besides myself. 
They sweep the yard; but, sir, they have never offered 
me the broom." 

Having married, Waineright found himself 
with an income of about 200 an altogether 
insignificant sum for one who, in the words of 
Oscar Wilde, was " an amateur of beautiful 
things, and a dilettante of things delightful." 
He lived well, dressed well, loved good wines, 
hot -house plants, majolica, rare books (he 
boasted some especially choice ones on poisons), 
etc., and like all respectable Englishmen he 
" kept his gig." He also entertained a good deal 
such guests as Macready, Wilkie, Westall, 



Lamb, Barry Cornwall, Forster, and Sergeant 
Talfourd, dining pretty often at his table. It is 
not surprising that, living at this gentlemanly 
rate on a beggarly two hundred a year, he soon 
found himself ruinously in debt ; and he was 
gradually forced from one shady method of 
" raising the wind " to another still shadier, 
until he committed his first crime (outside of 
literature) forgery. Unable, by the terms of 
the will, to touch the capital of the fund left 
him by his grandfather, he forged a trustees' 
order for 2,259 of it, secured the money, and 
was, for a brief space, relieved from pecuniary 
pressure. This first coup had, of course, the 
ultimate effect of lessening his regular income ; 
and things were again rapidly drifting from 
bad to worse, when the wind was once more 
unexpectedly tempered to the shorn lamb. In 
1828, a fortunate invitation opened Linden 
House to the married couple, and they accord- 
ingly took up their abode with their bachelor 
uncle, George Edward. The pecuniary possi- 
bilities of the situation at once flashed upon 
Wainewright. Here was a fine mansion which, 
on the demise of its owner, must pass by nat- 
ural descent to his nephew in fact, to him, 
Wainewright ; and, what was still more import- 
ant, a round sum of money must pass with it. 
The owner of the house was an old man 
a disappointingly healthy one, it is true ; but 
there is nothing so very remarkable, still less 
suspicious, in old men, however healthy, dying 
suddenly. Could not his demise be arranged 
to take place rather earlier than Nature de- 
manded almost immediately, in short ? He 
would only be cheated of a few years at best ; 
and his loss would be really inconsiderable 
compared with the handsome gain accruing 
from it to others. Convinced by his devil's 
logic, Wainewright at once proceeded to apply 
theory to practice. He had a curious knowl- 
edge of poisons far in advance, it is said, of 
most medical men of his time ; and here, at last, 
was a chance of testing this knowledge in a 
practical way. Unfortunately, the details of 
Wainewright's first experiment in toxicology 
are lost to science ; but it is enough for us to 
know that it was perfectly successful. The 
venerable uncle died, a little in advance of his 
time, and Linden House passed quietly into 
the possession of its new owner. 

But once again the relief brought to our in- 
satiate " amateur of beautiful things " proved 
transitory. In the interim, moreover, his bur- 
dens had increased ; for a son was born to 
him, and a now destitute mother-in-law, with

her two daughters, had come to live under his 
roof. Clearly, something must be done to 
stave off the creditors now growing more and 
more vulgarly importunate, after the manner 
of their tribe ; and Wainewright, in his dire 
extremity, naturally thought of his last brilliant 
operation. To quietly and unsuspiciously "re- 
move " any or all of his household was quite 
within the bounds of practical science. He 
had proved that. But here the logical difficulty 
arose that none of these relatives had " expect- 
ations." To make away with the impecunious 
mother-in-law, or her still more impecunious 
daughters, only meant risk of detection, be- 
sides the expense of a funeral. Plainly, that 
wouldn't do. But the devil again inspired 
him. He had heard of the life insurance offices 
whose business it was to provide large pay- 
ments in the event of premature death, in re- 
turn for a small premium down. The problem 
was solved. In casting about for a victim for 
this new enterprise, Wainewright hit upon his 
sister-in-law, Helen Abercromby, as almost 
ideally suited to his purpose ; and the diabol- 
ical sang-froid with which the reptile lured 
this charming and innocent girl into blindly 
furthering a plan that essentially involved her 
own destruction seems without a parallel in the 
annals of crime. Provided in advance with a 
trumped-up story with which to parry awkward 
inquiries, she was sent about from office to 
office, making, in her own name, proposals for 
short periods and for amounts in no case large 
enough to give rise to special investigation. 
Suspecting nothing, and swallowing her scru- 
ples as to the fictions imposed upon her, she 
put herself completely into her future murder- 
er's hands. Finally two proposals, each for 
.3,000, were accepted. Then a new difficulty 
arose in completing the transaction. The 
scheme was opposed by the girl's mother, who 
not unreasonably urged the folly of insuring 
for short periods the life of a penniless and 
very healthy girl who was almost certain to 
outlive the policies. Wainewright was equal 
to the emergency ; he saw an opportunity to 
rid himself of a provoking obstacle to his 
plans, and of a mother-in-law also, at one stroke, 
and he did not hesitate. Recourse was again 
had to science, with the natural result. Mrs. 
Abercromby, too, was prematurely gathered to 
her fathers. 

After a decent interval of mourning, the 
assurance scheme was revived. Miss Aber- 
cromby made proposals to seven offices for an 
aggregate of over 20,000, of which 12,000 



was accepted ; and the promoter of the enter- 
prise, satisfied with the total amount in view, 
concluded that things were ripe for the denoue- 
ment. At his instance, the girl put the final 
touch to the preparations for her own murder 
by making a will in favor of her sister Made- 
leine. The latter, it is needless to say, was 
also to be " removed " as soon as her pecuniary 
condition warranted it. Everything ready, 
Wainewright suddenly grew unusually kind, 
unremitting, in fact, in his delicate attentions 
to the sisters. One evening, after taking them 
to the play, the party had a supper of lobsters 
and porter. During the meal she began to feel 
strangely ill, " and in the night had a bad, rest- 
less headache and was very sick." She grew 
rapidly worse. 

" Dr. Locock, whom Mr. Forster describes as a distin- 
guished physician, was called in. ... She said, < Doc- 
tor, I am dying; I feel I am; I am sure so.' He said, 
' You will be better by and by.' The family nurse said 
that Mrs. Abercromby had died in the same way, and 
Helen cried out, ' Yes, my mother ! oh, iny poor mother ! ' 
The doctor left, but the convulsions returned, and an 
hour or so later she died. A grim figure in the sick 
chamber was the old nurse who from the first expected 
a fatal result, and who uttered gloomy and despairing 
cries to the effect that Helen's mother and Dr. Griffiths 
had died in exactly the same manner." 

This was the vilest and probably the last 
(though others are charged) of Wainewright's 
murders. Incredible as it may seem, he was 
never brought to trial for them, being trans- 
ported for his first crime, forgery, in 1837. 
The damning facts we have outlined only came 
to light indirectly during the trial of the suit 
brought for the recovery of Helen Abercrom- 
by's insurance which suits, by the way, were 
won by the defendants on the ground of the 
girl's misrepresentations. Forster, who, with 
Macready, Dickens, and Hablot Browne, vis- 
ited Newgate just before Wainewright's de- 
parture, gives a last glimpse of this unpar- 
alleled scoundrel. The party were suddenly 
startled by a tragic cry from Macready of " My 
God ! there's Wainewright." 

" In the shabby genteel creature, with sandy, disor- 
dered hair, and dirty moustache, who had turned quickly 
round with a defiant stare at our entrance, looking at 
once mean and fierce, and quite capable of the cowardly 
murders he had committed, Macready had been horri- 
fied to recognize a man familiarly known to him in for- 
mer years, and at whose table he had dined." 

The volume is a handsomely appointed one, 
and it is altogether likely to attract at least 
its due share of attention. The illustrations, 
mostly portraits and cuts after curious paint- 
ings, call for special mention. E. G. J.

THE SHERMAN 



The letters of General Sherman and Senator 
Sherman will interest different readers in differ- 
ent ways. Some will value them most as a direct 
contribution to our knowledge of their distin- 
guished writers considered as biography. Some 
will regard them most highly as an addition to 
the history of the country in the long and inter- 
esting period which they cover. Others, our- 
selves included, will find the centre of interest in 
the materials that the book presents for the study 
of character. Here are two men of nearly the 
same age, brothers growing up under the same 
conditions and trained in their earliest years 
in the same way, who attain, not by adventi- 
tious means, but by sheer ability and force of 
character, the one the foremost place in the 
military service of his country, the other a place 
next below the highest in its political service, 
and excluded from the highest only by that 
logic of our later American politics which keeps 
those of highest ability and character and of 
greatest prominence from attaining the highest 
position ; these men we have telling each other 
their acts, thoughts, and feelings, for more than 
fifty years, in the most unconscious fraternal 
correspondence. It is impossible for the reader 
who looks at the Sherman Letters from this 
point of view, not to see that General Sherman 
was by nature a soldier, while Senator Sherman 
was a statesman ; and it is hard for him to re- 
sist for the moment the conviction that in such 
matters inheritance stands for more, and edu- 
cation and environment for less, than our cur- 
rent philosophy leads us to suppose. For us, 
the principal interest of the book lies in the 
opportunity that it furnishes to follow these 
two men as they move along their divergent 
paths from youth to age. 

The story opens in 1837, with W. T. Sher- 
man, then in his seventeenth year, just enter- 
ing on his studies at West Point, and John 
Sherman, three years younger, serving as junior 
rodman in an engineer's corps on the Mus- 
kingum River Improvement ; it closes in 1891, 
with General Sherman in retirement at New 
York, and Senator Sherman still in active 
duty at Washington. The reader suffers no 
loss because the senior brother wrote the larger 
number of letters, for the soldier was distinctly 
a better letter-writer than the politician. In 
part this was no doubt due to his more change-

ful life, but not wholly so. It is about as un- 
profitable to compare men of such different 
talents and careers as it is to discuss the rel- 
ative ability of men and women ; but one gets 
from the letters the distinct impression that 
the General, in quickness of insight, in frank- 
ness of character, in mobility of mind, in a word, 
in real genius, was the superior man. In the 
first period, 1837-1846, the letters are all from 
his hand. In the beginning his style is heavy 
and stiff, as well as frequently ungrammatical, 
but he soon begins to show that command of 
nervous and happily-phrased English which is 
characteristic of his later life, and which, while 
by no means always correct according to the 
rules laid down by the critics, is nevertheless 
always interesting. Still, when all is said, the 
remark that the editor makes of the General's 
boyish letters, that they are interesting only 
because they are his, has a wider application 
both to him and to the Senator. 

For some years the older brother seems to 
have acted as a sort of fatherly monitor for the 
younger one. In January, 1840, he discussed 
the outlook of the engineer, concluding that a 
man in that profession could not look for con- 
stant employment, and therefore could not ex- 
pect a sure and constant reward for his labor. 
He thought the States were likely to expend 
less money for public works than they had been 
doing, and he caught no glimpse of the coming 
wonderful expansion of private enterprise in 
that field. He had no vision of his brother's 
future career, and cherished no high ambition 
for him. His letter concludes : 

" I have mentioned these things to you that you may 
reflect, while there is still time, of the propriety of se- 
lecting means to be resorted to in case of necessity. 
What more naturally suggests itself than a farm ? Who 
can be more iudependent, more honest and honorable, 
who more sure of a full reward for his labor, who can 
bestow more benefits on his fellow-beings, and conse- 
quently be more happy, than an American farmer ? If 
by any means you may be able to get some land in Ohio, 
Iowa, or Wisconsin, you should do so by all means, and 
more especially if it is partially improved. I do not 
mean for the purpose of speculation, but to make use of 
yourself." 

Learning two months later that John is to study 
law, he says it would be impertinent for him 
to object, but the law would be his last choice 
of a profession. For himself, he intends to en- 
ter the army, although it is doubtful whether 
he shall remain in it for life. " Should I re- 
sign," he says, " it would be to turn farmer, if 
ever I can raise money enough to buy a good 
farm in Iowa.'' However it may be now, it was 
quite the fashion before the Civil War for offi- 



1894.]

cers of the regular army to depreciate or de- 
spise politics and politicians ; and General Sher- 
man was no exception. A string of piquant 
passages expressive of that sentiment could be 
selected from his early letters. He did not 
take kindly to John's becoming a politician ; 
on the other hand, he wrote him in October, 
1844, as follows : 

" What in the devil are you doing ? Stump-speaking ! 
I really thought you were too decent for that, or at least 
had sufficient pride not to humble and cringe to beg 
party or popular favor. However, the coming election 
will sufficient ly prove the intelligence and patriotic spirit 
of the American people, and may deter you from com- 
mitting a like sin again. . . . For my part, I wish Henry 
Clay to be elected, and should rejoice in his success, 
for various reasons; but I do not permit myself to in- 
dulge in sanguine feelings when dependence has to be 
placed on the pitch-and-toss game of party elections." 

But the politician learned something in his 
school that he commended to the soldier's at- 
tention at a later day. For example, he told 
him, in August, 1862, that " the general popu- 
lar sentiment is sometimes passionate, hasty, 
and intemperate, but after a little fluctuation 
it settles very near the true line." Again he 
tells him : " Take my advice, be helpful, cheer- 
ful, polite to everybody, even a newspaper re- 
porter. They are in the main clever, intelli- 
gent men, a little too pressing in their vocation." 
Still, the General, to the end of his life, never 
took kindly to the ways of politics or to the 
arts of popularity. After the War was over 
and his reputation was firmly established, he 
shrank from life at the National Capital. In 
December, 1866, he wrote from St. Louis: 
" I do not want to come to Washington, but to 
stay away as long as possible. When Grant 
goes to Europe, then I shall be forced to come. 
The longer that is deferred, the better for me." 
And a few days later, in reference to the same 
subject : " There can be no satisfaction to me 
in being drawn into the vortex of confusion in 
which public affairs seem to be." President 
Johnson strove to thrust Sherman into his quar- 
rel with Stanton and Grant, seeking first to 
make him Secretary of War, and later Brevet 
General of the Army. The honest soldier wrote 
him, in January, 1868, a manly letter of ex- 
postulation, declaring that Washington was ob- 
jectionable to him because "it is the political 
capital of the country, a focus of intrigue, gos- 
sip, and slander." He spoke of the fate that 
had there befallen Generals Scott and Taylor, 
and pointed out the baneful influence of the 
Capital on the Army of the Potomac from the 
beginning of the War. He recounted the trials 



that he had seen Grant pass through in the 
War, and declared : 

" And yet I have never seen him more troubled than 
when he has been in Washington, and has been com- 
pelled to read himself a ' sneak and deceiver,' based on 
reports of four of the Cabinet and apparently with your 
[the President's] knowledge. If this political atmosphere 
can disturb the equanimity of one so guarded and pru- 
dent as he, what will be the result with one so careless 
and outspoken as I am ? Therefore, with my consent, 
Washington never." 

His removal to St. Louis in 1874 was prima- 
rily due to the strained relations between him- 
self on the one hand and the War Department 
and the President on the other ; but the old 
feeling of aversion had its influence. General 
Sherman saw that General Grant suffered in 
peace of mind and reputation by accepting the 
Presidency, and stoutly repressed all attempts 
to " bring him out " as a presidential candidate. 
He wrote in 1874 : 

" Dear Brother: Do n't ever give any person the least 
encouragement to think I can be used for political ends. 
I have seen it poison so many otherwise good charac- 
ters, that I am really more obstinate than ever. I think 
Grant will be made miserable to the end of his life by 
his eight years' experiences. Let those who are trained 
to it keep the office, and keep the army and navy as free 
from politics as possible, for emergencies that may arise 
at any time. Think of the reputations wrecked in pol- 
itics since 1865." 

We are not surprised to find the General say- 
ing in 1872 : " Grant, who never was a Repub- 
lican, is your candidate, and Greeley, who never 
was a Democrat, but quite the contrary, is the 
Democratic candidate." But we are surprised 
to find the Senator assenting to the statement, 
and, what is more, adding that there was no es- 
sential difference in the platforms of the two 
parties. 

General Sherman's letters show how much 
better he understood the political situation in 
the South previous to the Civil War than his 
brother and the Northern politicians generally ; 
also how completely he grasped the military 
problem at the opening of the great strife. His 
famous saying, in 1861, that two hundred thou- 
sand men were necessary to defend Kentucky, 
which was then considered proof of his insan- 
ity, is now considered proof of his genius. His 
letters bearing on the mistaken ideas of men at 
the North in both periods are very interesting 
reading. 

Previous to reentering the army in 1861, 
General Sherman's career had been broken and 
on the whole discouraging. He had served a 
few years as a soldier in Florida and in Cali- 
fornia, and had been disappointed in his desire

to go to Mexico ; he had been a banker in San 
Francisco and New York, and then for a year 
or two had taken up the law, despite his old 
jibes at his brother ; he had acted as the head 
of a military school in Louisiana, and finally, 
just as the War was opening, drifted into the 
presidency of a street railway company in St. 
Louis. He was forty-one years of age, but 
nothing that he had done gave promise of a 
great career, although he had done well what- 
ever he had undertaken. One or two letters 
breathe a note of discouragement. The War 
gave him his opportunity, and one of the pleas- 
ing features of the book is the sanguine confi- 
dence with which Senator Sherman, before the 
General had reentered the army, marked out a 
great military future for him. 

The volume abounds in quotable passages. 
We give two more, one written from Kansas, 
in May, 1859 ; the other from Paris, in June 
of the same year. 

" Of course we are all expectation here to read news 
of the war in Italy. Our latest accounts are simply that 
the Austrians, after entering Piedmont, have manoeuvred 
without any definite plan, giving full time for the Sar- 
dinians to organize, and for France to pour into Italy 
her well-equipped armies by every avenue of approach. 
We know, too, that the Emperor of Austria has gone 
to control the operations of his army, that the King of 
Sardinia is also his own generalissimo, and that Napo- 
leon had sailed from Marseilles for Genoa, whence, I 
take it, he promptly crossed to Turin, and that he, too, 
will command in person. ... If Napoleon can drive 
the Austrians out of all Italy, even from Venice and 
Triest, and from thence north of the Styrian Alps, and 
then gradually surrender the power thus acquired to a 
federation of states, retiring to France, he would be the 
most celebrated man of this or any age. He can do so. 
The elder Bonaparte could not, as he was never cor- 
dially recognized by other governments; but Napoleon 
III. is so firmly fixed, to all appearance, in France, that 
he can moderate his plans, and cease conquest the mo- 
ment his aim is accomplished. So few ambitious men, 
however, have been able to stop at the right place that 
fortune seems to tempt them beyond human depth into 
ruin; still, so wilful, silent, and determined has he shown 
himself that I expect that he will force the Austrians 
back from Italy, and then allow some form of govern- 
ment to control the Italian kingdoms, states, and re- 
publics. Austria, however, will not relinquish Triest, 
Dalmatia, and Venice without a death-struggle, and it 
may be that the war now begun may spread and make 
as many dynastic changes as those wars which followed 
the French Revolution. I wish I were there to watch 
the operations and changes; but alas ! I am in Kansas." 

If the above extract shows clearly how the 
soldier misread the foremost man in Europe in 
1859, the following shows no less clearly how 
the politician misread the history and genius 
of two foremost European peoples. 

" My conclusions are all against the British govern- 
ment. . . . When Englishmen hereafter talk about 



their rights, I will know what they mean. They do en- 
joy a limited liberty of speech and of the press, and 
then you have said all. It is a government of the 
aristocracy, more exclusive, repelling, and narrow than 
I conceived of. The House of Commons is the only pre- 
tended representation of the people, and that is but a 
mere pretense. The representation is so glaringly un- 
equal that it is a surprise to me that the people will 
submit to it. As the members are not paid, and none 
can vote without property, it is a mere representation 
of money and not of men. Every regulation of the gov- 
ernment, the rules of caste, the combined insolence and 
obsequiousness of all classes with whom I came in con- 
tact, were so unpleasant to me that, while my visit there 
was a constant enjoyment and a school, I would not 
live under the British Government for any consideration. 
" The French government is much more tolerable. 
Louis Napoleon is emperor by usurpation, but I really 
think that the government is not only for the good, but 
is the choice of the people and others. There is the 
greatest personal liberty and equality here, and the in- 
stitutions tend to advance equality and give a fair chance 
to merit. It is true that through the press people can- 
not discuss politics except on one side. In private life, 
and indeed in the saloons and public places, there seems 
no restraint. The administration of the law seems well 
conducted. Taxes, as compared with England, are light, 
and the Frenchman has no restraint, either by caste or 
law, from doing what he wishes, except that he must 
not write against the government. His equality with 
his neighbor is recognized. There is more freedom, if 
I might say so, more mixing of all classes of people 
here, and on terms of kindliness and equality, than you 
will find even in America. The blouses, the uniforms, 
and the black coats all sit and eat and chat together. 
On the whole, they have much more claim to be a ' free 
people ' than the English, and hereafter I will know how 
to appreciate an English account of French tyranny." 

The volume is admirable in mechanical ex- 
ecution, and is furnished with a good index. 
The most serious misprint that we have noticed 
is " Ladslen " for " Gadsden," page 54. If we 
have given the General more prominence than 
the Senator, we have also suggested the rea- 

son - B. A. HINSDALE. 



THOKEAU'S TJETTERS. * 



In one respect at least, Thoreau has been a 
singularly fortunate man. He won for himself 
during his lifetime a devoted friendship which 
after his death made it a labor of love to see 
that his writings were adequately presented to 
a public that had not received them entirely 
with gratitude. Mr. Blake has done for his 
friend Thoreau what most men would think a 
heavy task if required by their own original 
work. Ellery Channing, the Concord recluse, 
has written a life of Thoreau which, in spite

of some vagaries and considerable irrelevant 
matter, is a genuine contribution to American 
biographical literature. Alcott, in a letter given 
in the volume which occasions this brief article, 
says of Thoreau : " There has been none such 
since Pliny, and it will be long before there 
comes his like ; the most sagacious and wonder- 
ful Worthy of his time, and a marvel to com- 
ing ones." One cannot forbear quoting a few 
lines from Emerson's splendid tribute : 

" Through the green tents by eldest nature drest 
He roamed, content alike with man and beast. 
Where darkness found him, he lay glad at night ; 
There the red morning touched him with its light. 

******* 
Go where he will, the wise man is at home, 
His hearth the earth, his hall the azure dome." 

To these eulogists must be added Mr. F. B. 
Sanborn, who brings to his labors his simple 
and refined style, his tact, his wide knowledge, 
his devotion to the subject. Mr. Sanborn 
shows again in this volume the qualities which 
make his biography of Thoreau a model of its 
kind. Surely the Concord group is not lack- 
ing in pietat. 

Mr. Sanborn's book is what one must expect 
from the experienced hand that put it together. 
The introduction has the unusual fault that it 
is altogether too brief for the reader's profit 
and pleasure. The book is divided into three 
parts " Years of Discipline," " The Golden 
Age of Achievement," " Friends and Follow- 
ers "; and the division is certainly a happy one. 
The editor's passages in connection with or elu- 
cidation of the letters are always adequate and 
luminous ; the volume becomes a familiar auto- 
biography of Thoreau, fresh, thoroughly uncon- 
ventional, and sufficiently complete. The ac- 
knowledgment of another debt to Mr. Sanborn 
gains strength from the many which he has 
already required from his readers. 

The following paragraph from Mr. Sanborn's 
introduction is worth reproducing here, as it 
tells briefly how the establishment of Thoreau 
as a permanent figure in American literature 
has been gaining firmness ever since his too 
early death : 

" The fortune of Henry Thoreau as an author of 
books has been peculiar, and such as to indicate more 
permanence of his name and fame than could be pre- 
dicted of many of his contemporaries. In the years of 
his literary activity (twenty-five in all), from 1837 to 
1862 when he died, not quite forty-five years old, 
he published but two volumes, and those with much de- 
lay and difficulty in finding a publisher. But in the 
thirty-two years since his death, nine volumes have been 
published from his manuscripts and fugitive pieces, 
the present being the tenth. Besides these, two biog- 
raphies of Thoreau have appeared in America, and two 



others in England, with numerous reviews and sketches 
of the man and his writings, enough to make several 
volumes more. At the present the sale of his books and 
the interest in his life are greater than ever; and he 
seems to have grown early into an American classic, 
like his Concord neighbors, Emerson and Hawthorne. 
Pilgrimages are made to his grave and his daily haunts, as 
to theirs, and those who come find it to be true, as was 
said by an accomplished woman (Miss Elizabeth Hoar) 
soon after his death, that ' Concord is Henry's monument, 
adorned with suitable inscriptions by his own hand.' " 

The struggling writer of to-day may take this 
to his heart, and ponder on it ; he must remem- 
ber, however, that, like all authors who have 
had a similar destiny, Thoreau had something 
to say which was above all limitations of time 
and space, and will be as worth thinking and 
believing in the days to come as it was when 
he uttered it. He was a realist in the best sense 
of that term ; he had his eye fixed upon the 
object ; he certainly endeavored to see it as it 
was ; but he made no effort to reproduce it in 
its crude isolation, or in the aspect which it as- 
sumed in some momentary relation between it 
and his own mind. He had a sufficient store of 
belief in himself, but he was not egotist enough 
to suppose that a transcription of his fleeting 
moods was of much importance to mankind at 
large. His representation of the object was 
always plentifully mixed with thought, and so 
we have a living landscape, filled with clear 
air and light. And then he had the transcen- 
dentalist's unfailing resource, high meditations, 
which were the reality in reality itself. 

The letters presented in this selection show 
Thoreau from his gentlest and most familiar 
side. They are domestic and gossipy, they dis- 
play his simple likes and dislikes, they will 
bring him closer to those who have long ad- 
mired him, and will win for him friends who 
have been somewhat repelled by his satire and 
austerity. They are as characteristic as any- 
thing which he has left, and are permeated 
with the flavor which is his and no other man's. 
They also disclose his limitations, some of which 
he shared with his contemporaries, and some of 
which were his own peculiar property, and rather 
unduly estimated for that wholly unsatisfactory 
reason. It is possible here to give only a few 
extracts, but they will indicate what is to be 
expected by the reader who takes up Thoreau 
for the first time, and they will recall to the 
reader of many years the things and thoughts 
which he has found pleasant before. 

Here is part of a letter to his sister Helen ; 
it was written in 1837, when Thoreau was 
twenty years old. The child is, indeed, father 
of the man.

[Oct. 16, 



" Please you, let the defendant say a few words in 
defense of his long silence. You know we have hardly 
done our own deeds, thought our own thoughts, or lived 
our own lives hitherto. For a man to act himself, he 
must be perfectly free; otherwise he is in danger of 
losing all sense of responsibility or of self-respect. . . . 
Further, letter-writing too often degenerates into a 
communicating of facts, not truths ; of other men's 
deeds and not our thoughts. What are the convulsions 
of a planet, compared with the emotions of a soul ? or 
the rising of a thousand suns, if that is not enlightened 
by a ray ? " 

The longer and more important letters are 
written to Mr. Blake. Thoreau apparently 
opened his heart to the latter, and to his En- 
glish friend Cholmondeley. Here is a passage 
with the authentic savor : 

" Shall, then, the maple yield sugar, and not man ? 
Shall a farmer be thus active, and surely have so much 
sugar to show for it, before this very March is gone, 
while I read the newspapers ? . . . Am I not a sugar- 
maple man, then ? Boil down the sweet sap which the 
spring causes to flow within you. Stop not at syrup, 
go on to sugar, though you present thy world with but 
a single crystal, a crystal not made from trees in your 
yard, but from the new life that stirs in your pores. 
Cheerfully skim your kettle, and watch it set and crys- 
tallize, making a holiday of it if you will. Heaven will 
be propitious to you as to him. 

" Say to the farmer, There is your crop; here is mine. 
Mine is a sugar to sweeten sugar with. If you will 
listen to me, I will sweeten your whole load, your 
whole life." 

All the familiar figures cross the pages in 
some way Emerson, Alcott, Margaret Fuller, 
Parker, the Channings, Hawthorne, and the 
rest. We are back again in that enthusiasm 
and kindling faith which have yielded those 
products which best deserve the name of liter- 
ature of any yet fashioned on this side of the 
Atlantic. The interest of it all appears as 
fresh as ever, and demands our attention as 
much as ever. The men and women of that 
time did not work in material wholly ephem- 
eral ; they searched for what was lasting, and 
they found it ; they tried to learn what life 
and progress meant ; they had no time to waste 
in empty complainings or sickly coddlings of 
the emotions ; they labored hard and seriously, 
and what they left belongs to the most import- 
ant contributions made to man's pleasure and 
wisdom by the planet in this century.

WEALTH AGAINST COMMONWEALTH.* 

Mr. Henry D. Lloyd has rendered a patriotic 
service to his country by writing the history of the 
rise and growth of the great monopolies whose ex- 
istence is a menace to republican government. He 
marshalls his facts with the skill of a journalist 
trained in dialectics. These, gathered from offi- 
cial records, from decisions of courts and of special 
tribunals, from the verdicts of juries in criminal 
cases, oath-sworn testimony subjected to the rules 
of evidence, and reports of legislative committees, 
become real, possessing all of the power of living 
truth. His narrative is intense, revealing at times 
a restrained feeling of indignation, at others an ap- 
preciation of the humorous phase of the social con- 
test ; but it is always dignified and sincere. We 
are confronted with a problem that must needs be 
speedily solved. 

" There are no solitary truths, Goethe says, and mo- 
nopoly as the greatest business fact of our civilization, 
which gives to business what other ages gave to war 
and religion is our greatest social, political, and moral 
fact." 

It is rapidly transforming our Republic. How ? 
By placing in the hands of a few the power that of 
right belongs to all. These have seized upon what 
they possess. Pursuing a career of robbery at first 
under the forms of law, they have come to be su- 
perior to law, defying all popular tribunals. 

Science prepared the way for the practical use 
of petroleum, which was found in unlimited quan- 
tities after Colonel Drake's discovery in 1860. It 
was obtainable at a nominal price, so that 
" Poor men, building little stills, could year by year 
add on to their work, increase their capital, and acquire 
the self-confidence and independence of successful men. 
There was a free market for the oil as it came out of 
the wells and out of the refineries, and free competition 
between buyers and sellers, producers and consumers, 
manufacturers and traders. Industries auxiliary to the 
main ones flourished. Everywhere the scene was of 
expanding prosperity, with, of course, the inevitable 
percentage of ill-luck and miscalculation; but with the 
balance, on the whole, of such happy growth as freedom 
and the bounty of nature have always yielded when in 
partnership. The valleys of Pennsylvania changed into 
busy towns and oil-fields. The highways were crowded, 
labor was well employed at good wages, new industries 
were starting up on all sides, and everything betokened 
the permanent creation of a new prosperity for the whole 
community, like that which came to California and the 
world with the discovery of gold." 

In ten years the net product had grown to be 
6,000,000 barrels of oil a year, employing a capital 
of $200,000,000 and supporting a population of 
60,000 people, who were provided with schools, 
churches, lyceums, theatres, libraries, newspapers, 
and boards of trade. 

A shadow fell upon this scene of human activity. 
Its great promise was struck with a blight. There

were panics in oil speculation, bank failures, defal- 
cations, followed by distress and the violent acts of 
despair. The year 1872 marked the beginning of 
a new order of things. Ten years before " a man 
of brains and energy, without money," had appeared 
in Cleveland and started a small refinery. He as- 
sociated others with him, and prosecuted his busi- 
ness with such marked success that when disaster 
overtook others he was in a position to profit by it. 
His prosperity was in the ratio of the bankruptcy, 
the ruin of competition. The public agitation was 
great. Investigations by State legislatures and by 
Congress followed, only to be suppressed by some in- 
visible power. But it was revealed to the people that 
" They, and the production, refining, and transporta- 
tion of their oil, had been made the subject of a secret 
' contract ' between certain citizens. The high contract- 
ing parties to this treaty for the disposal of an industrial 
province were, on one side, all the great railroad com- 
panies, without whose services the oil, crude or refined, 
could not be moved to refineries, markets, or ports of 
shipment on river, lake, or ocean. On the other side 
was a body of thirteen men, ' not one of whom lived in 
the oil regions, or was an owner of oil wells or oil lands,' 
who had associated themselves for the control of the 
oil business under the winning name of the South Im- 
provement Company." 

Ten of these thirteen proprietors of the South 
Improvement Company were members of the oil 
trust, known and feared the world over. With them 
the railroads had contracted to increase the freight 
rates on oil so as to destroy their competition ; to 
give them the advance collected from these compet- 
itors, and to rebate to them on their own business 
all above the old rates. Thus the company of thir- 
teen, and not the railroad companies, was to get the 
benefit of the additional charge made to the people. 
This was estimated to amount to eighteen thousand 
dollars a day in the year the contract was made. 

Having succeeded in effecting this powerful com- 
bination, the trust proceeded to the conquest of the 
world. This was not accomplished in a season. To 
absorb the properties of competition on their own 
terms was the first step, the ingenuity and boldness 
of which mark the master-mind in control. When 
the competitors were convinced that they were shut 
out from their markets, that they could not afford to 
pay the double rates the transportation companies 
prescribed, and that even if they could cars would 
be denied them, they were in a frame of mind to 
accept the terms the enemy offered. The capacity 
of their refineries was reduced one-half, which en- 
abled the trust to advance the rates five hundred 
per cent to the public, and to pocket profits that in 
five years amounted to a fabulous sum. Embold- 
ened by this success, the next step was the absorp- 
tion of the independent refineries. The sales which 
were forced were kept secret, and the victimized 
proprietors became the salaried employees of the 
trust. 

In a city not a hundred miles from Cincinnati, 
two brothers had inherited a business of forty thou- 



sand dollars a year, which had been built up by the 
energy and ability of their father. They were happy 
and contented in their business associations, and 
were esteemed as among the most useful and solid 
members of the community. In time they were 
invited by an agent of the trust to sell their busi- 
ness. " We do not want to sell," they replied. 
" Then we shall have to compel you to," was the 
parting warning. Through the aid given by the 
railroad companies, the trust obtained the names of 
their customers, to whom goods were offered at 
rates they could not meet. When their business 
was taken away, the trust succeeded in buying their 
property at a nominal valuation, and in securing the 
services of the unfortunate brothers as employees. 

In Cleveland a widow was conducting a business 
left by her husband, at a profit of $25,000 a year. 
She refused an invitation to sell, and was warned 
that if she did not sell she would be ruined. Then 
in time the head of the trust called on her. The 
result of this visit was afterwards revealed in court. 
The widow told the great man that she realized that 
her company was entirely in his power. 

" 'All I can do is to appeal to your honor as a gentle- 
man, and to your sympathy, to do the best with me that 
you can. I beg of you to consider your wife in my po- 
sition, left with this business and with fatherless chil- 
dren, and with a large indebtedness that my husband 
had just contracted for the first time in his life. I felt 
that I could not do without the income arising from 
this business, and I have taken it up and gone on, and 
been successful in the hardest year since my husband 
commenced.' He promised, with tears in his eyes, that 
be would stand by her. ' He agreed that I might retain 
whatever amount of stock I desired. He seemed to 
want only the control. I thought his feelings were such 
that I could trust him, and that he would deal honor- 
ably by me.' " 

She appraised her property at $200,000, and the 
directory of her company approved the sale at that 
figure. But the sale was made without her volition, 
at $71,000 ; and she was required to sign a bond 
not to go into the refining business for ten years. 
This was caring for the widow and the fatherless 
in a manner worthy a robber baron of other days. 

These cases illustrate the method usually pursued 
to obtain possession of the refining business. But 
when this failed, property was destroyed and life 
placed in jeopardy. The end justified the means, 
in the opinion of these gamblers for wealth. 

There has not been wanting resistance on the 
part of the people interested in the oil fields ; and 
enterprising competition has appeared again and 
again. Shut out from railroad transportation, 
American ingenuity suggested a pipe line reaching 
to a lower level ; then invented a power pump to 
force the crude oil to any level ; and finally dis- 
covered that refined oil could be forced through a 
tube for hundreds of miles without loss of quality. 
But every improvement was resisted by the great 
combination. At one point in Northern Pennsyl- 
vania an armed force and a Gatling gun checked 



232 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



the construction of a pipe line. The aid of courts, 
and aggravating suits, were means employed to 
harass and break down opposition. When at last 
the independents succeeded in getting their oil to 
the seaboard, the shipping docks of the several 
trunk lines were found to be in possession of the 
trust. At one time the Pennsylvania Railroad 
Company broke up the combination and went into 
opposition. Backed by the other trunk lines, the 
trust waged the war with such vigor as to bring the 
Pennsylvania Company to terms and compel it to 
enter into a new contract in 1885 " a contract so 
vicious and illegal," said the counsel of the inde- 
pendent refiners before the Interstate Commerce 
Commission, " that the Pennsylvania Railroad re- 
fuses to bring it into court for fear a disclosure of 
its terms might subject it to a criminal prosecution." 

Thus the oil sea of the American continent has 
produced its octopus as well as the salt sea, but of 
a size commensurate with the magnitude of its prey, 
its all-powerful arms furnished with a thousand 
times 960 pairs of suckers. But we may not dwell 
on this absorbing phase of our subject. 

The history of the oil trust illustrates, says our 
author, 

" Nearly every phase of the story of our great mo - 
nopoly : dearness instead of cheapness ; willingness of 
the managers of transportation to deny transportation 
to whole trades and sections ; administration of great 
railroad properties in direct opposition to the interests 
of the owners to their great loss for the benefit of 
favorites of the officials; great wealth thereby procured 
by destruction, as if by physical force, of wealth of oth- 
ers, not at all by creation of new wealth to be added to 
the general store ; impossibility of survival in modern 
business of men who are merely honest, hard-working, 
competent, even though they have skill, capital and cus- 
tomers ; subjection of the majority of citizens and dol- 
lars to a small minority in numbers and riches ; subser- 
vience of rulers of the people to a faction ; last, and 
most disheartening, the impotence of the special tribu- 
nal [Interstate Commerce Commission] created to en- 
force the rights of the people on their highways. . . . 

" The smokeless rebate makes the secret of success 
in business to be, not manufacture, but manufracture 
breaking down with a strong hand the true makers of 
things. To those who can get the rebate, it makes no 
difference who does the digging, building, mining, mak- 
ing, producing the million forms of the wealth they 
covet for themselves. They need only get control of 
the roads. All that they want of the wealth of others 
can be switched off the highways into their hands. 

" From using railroad power to give better rates to 
the larger man, it was an easy step to using it to make 
a favorite first a larger man, then the largest man, and 
finally the only man in the business. In meat and cat- 
tle we see men rising from poverty to great wealth. 
From being competitors, like other men, in the scram- 
ble, they get into the comfortable seat of control of the 
prices at which the farmer must sell cattle, and at which 
the people must buy meat. Many other men had thrift, 
sobriety, industry, but only these had the rebate, and 
so only these are the ' fittest in the struggle for exist- 
ence.' " 

Our author observes that in the United States 



the processes of business feudalization are moving 
more rapidly to the end than in any other country. 
The middle classes, the keepers of small retail stores, 
small manufacturers, are being crowded out, and a 
few men in each trade are rising to supreme wealth. 
The independence of the old order is rapidly giving 
way to dependence on the power of wealth, before 
which skill, ability, industry, with limited means, 
stand helpless. The success of the men who have 
formed the great trusts is tempting the ambitious 
in other lines of trade to bring about combinations 
that shall concentrate power in a few hands. An 
examination of prices of fourteen staple products 
during the depression of 1893 shows that granu- 
lated sugar, petroleum, steel rails, and anthracite 
coal all controlled by strong trusts declined not 
quite ten per cent, whereas the prices of the other ten 
staple products, subject to the natural laws of trade, 
declined twenty-four per cent. As the cost of pro- 
duction can be lowered faster in factory than in 
farm products, it is clear that the natural order is 
reversed under the influence of trusts. Where does 
this tend? When we shall have further extended 
this policy of concentration, what will be the status 
of the American people ? The shred of republican 
government remaining will not be worth preserving. 
Already the courts and executive departments are 
laughed to scorn. The law for the protection of 
the people is dead. As, in the days of the old East 
India Company, the sign-manual of the manager, 
Mr. Child, was held in greater favor in Bombay or 
Calcutta than an act of Parliament, so in the model 
Republic at the close of the nineteenth century, the 
expressed wish of our monopoly is the law. 

Independent America was the first great protest 
of a united people against monopoly. In the early 
days of the mother country no market could be 
opened without authority of the King, and no 
ship could unload in any bay or estuary which he 
had not declared to be a port. This principle, ex- 
tended to commerce, made the industries of the 
American Colonies dependent wholly on the kingly 
will expressed through the British Board of Trade. 
We rebelled, and set human industry and commerce 
free. The individual secured liberty for develop- 
ment. America became great ; her people intelli- 
gent and happy. But these very conditions have 
invited an enemy to enter and set up a tyranny. 
Our highways, our seaports, are subject to his will. 
Thus we have returned to subjection without the 
saving grace of obedience to lawful authority. The 
sacrifices of revolution and of civil war to extirpate 
a slave oligarchy had better have been spared, if 
we are to fail in self-government at last. But we 
shall not fail. The outlook is dark, but we shall 
find the narrow path of duty leading to the true, 
the imperishable light, and, as a people, be endowed 
with the courage to follow it. 

Many questions are suggested by Mr. Lloyd's 
story of the trusts, which cannot be considered in 
limited space. The great danger at present con- 
fronting us is the tendency to extreme measures of 



1894.]

redress. If, in dealing with the railroad question, 
we are governed by the broad spirit pervading 
the great opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan, recently 
delivered, we shall find out what is just for all 
parties. It is certain that if the managers of the 
railroads of the country have made great mis- 
takes, as they surely have, the investors in railroad 
securities have already suffered to an extent that 
entitles them to special consideration. Upon high 
authority it is shown that during the past decade 
74,348 miles of railway operated by 311 independ- 
ent corporations, and capitalized at $3,853,371,000, 
passed from the control of stockholders into that of 
receivers appointed by the courts on account of in- 
sufficient revenue to meet the expenses of operation, 
taxes, and interest. In 1871 the dividends paid 
averaged $1,265 per mile of line ; in 1882 the av- 
erage was $952 ; in 1893 only $572.* 

Let it not be said that we are incapable of ad- 
justing the railroad complications confronting labor 
and capital, on an equitable basis. We are at the 
threshold of a settlement. And these once ad- 
justed, we shall have leisure for dealing with other 
questions that seriously affect the political, social, 
and moral well-being of the American people. I 
very much doubt whether we shall witness a repe- 
tition of the humiliating spectacle of the legislative 
branch of government obeying the behests of the 
sugar trust. The public conscience will make itself 
felt. It will be quickened and strengthened by read- 
ing the last two chapters of Mr. Lloyd's book, which 
deal with the moral phase of the questions at issue. 
" If all will sacrifice themselves, none need be sac- 
rificed. But if one may sacrifice another, all are 
sacrificed." That is the spirit. " In industry we 
have been substituting all the mean passions that 
can set man against man in place of the irresistible 
power of brotherhood. To tell us of the progress- 
ive sway of brotherhood in all human affairs is the 
sole message of history." Our author is optimistic. 
He believes that democracy is not a lie ; that there 
" live in the body of the commonalty the unex- 
hausted virtue and the ever-refreshened strength 
which can rise equal to any problems of progress." 
Happy shall we be as a people if we do not mistake 
the true road for that which leads back to barbarism.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Professor John Maccunn's small vol- 
ume "P<> n "The Ethics of Citizen- 
ship " (Macmillan) is one of the most 
remarkable books of political philosophy that have 
been published for years. It deserves a place by 
the side of such works as Mill's " Liberty " and Mr. 
John Morley's " Compromise." This praise is due, 
not to anything startling or even novel in the con- 
tents, but simply to the ripeness of its thought and 



the unfailing soundness of view displayed. It dis- 
cusses such subjects as equality, fraternity, natural 
rights, the rule of the majority, political consistency, 
the effects of democracy upon character, and the 
economic and ethical aspects of luxury. It would 
seem as if nothing new could possibly be said upon 
these subjects, and, as has already been suggested, 
the weight of Professor Maccunn's treatment comes 
from its manner rather than from its matter. The 
treatment is highly abstract, but the author knows 
how to clothe abstractions with the charm of a care- 
fully-considered, dignified, and even noble, style. 
Particularly noticeable is the use that he makes of 
what is evidently a wide range of reading. He does 
not quote in blocks, as is so often done, but has a 
positive genius for the selection and use of the tell- 
ing phrase of Burke, or of Carlyle, or of Mazzini. 
Nor are the poets neglected, a fact which we may 
illustrate by the extremely effective use of Burns 
at the close of a chapter on " The Rights of Man," 
as well as by many another apposite bit from Words- 
worth, or Shelley, or Arnold. As an example of 
the author's style, let us take a passage from the 
discussion of political consistency. After eloquently 
setting forth the evils that flow from the ignorance, 
the haste, and the self-interest of the politician, he 
goes on as follows : " There is no direct remedy. 
For it is not by wishes or resolves, not by warnings 
or exhortations, that men are ever likely to be kept 
consistent. They must learn to take that longer 
way round which is the shortest way home. They 
must first do their part to secure the conditions of 
the thing they covet. To Knowledge they must add 
Deliberation, and to Deliberation, Disinterestedness, 
in well-grounded confidence that, though these great 
elements of character can only blend into effective 
union through time and experience, the man who 
has them has at least the stuff out of which consist- 
ency is made. Most of all must they learn from 
earliest years to love their country with that deep and 
settled affection which, above all other influences, 
can redeem men's public lives from the most fatal 
forms of inconsistency. If one were asked what 
was the secret of the consistency of Mazzini, it would 
not be enough to answer that he had an ideal. It 
would be needful to add that it was an ideal on 
which he had set not only mind but heart, and to 
point out that, through all defeats, disillusionments, 
and disgusts, his affections never swerved from that 
vision that upheld him of an Italy free, united, and 
republican." The tone of Professor Maccunn's book 
is that of the sobered optimism that comes to all 
deeply reflective souls, rather than of the pessimism 
that we find, for example, in the late Mr. Pearson's 
" National Life and Character." He is not despond- 
ent for democracy, like the late Sir Henry Maine, 
but hopeful, like our own Lowell. Democracy, in 
our day, is growing tolerant ; since Bentham's time, 
it has gone to school. " It has given ear to the tales 
of the travellers, and to the researches of the eth- 
nologist, who have made even the popular mind fa- 
miliar with customs, morals, laws, which are not its

own. It has listened to the student of other coun- 
tries and other civilizations, to which perhaps De- 
mocracy has never come. The historian has told 
his story of men greater even than modern reform- 
ers, and of events more momentous even than re- 
form bills. The magic of historical romance has 
shown how lives, heroic, gentle, saintly, could be 
lived under old Feudalism as well as under new 
Radicalism. And the political philosopher, even the 
political reformer, has ceased to wish to fashion 
men and things anew. For he has come to see that 
not only for the sake of the hoarded wisdom of past 
experience, but in obedience to Evolution and the 
very laws of life, the Radical who would look for- 
ward to posterity must also, in a deeper sense than 
Burke imagined when he used the words, look back- 
wards to his ancestors."

Domestic life drawn with unrelenting realism in

Mrs. Orsemus Bronson Boyd s " Cav- 
alry Life in Tent and Field " (Tait & Sons). The 
writer, an officer's wife, started for the Far West 
to join her husband in 1867 ; and from that time 
to 1885, when she was left a widow, the breaks in 
the monotony of her career as an " army lady " 
seem to have been about on a par with Mrs. Prim- 
rose's migrations from the blue bed to the brown. 
Military life, in the piping times of peace, is a poor 
one at best ; and Mrs. Boyd does not idealize it. 
Not that her book is a dull one. A faithful trans- 
cript of personal experiences, it is to our thinking 
much more interesting, and certainly more edifying, 
than the familiar brass-button novel, with its wire- 
drawn expansions of garrison gossip and flirtation, 
and its sentimentalized view of garrison life. To 
the delusions bred of these airy productions, Mrs. 
Boyd furnishes a wholesome corrective. Take, for 
instance, the picture of her first " home " in the 
West a cheerful abode, " formed of two wall tents 
pitched together so the inner one could be used as 
a sleeping and the outer as a sitting room. A cal- 
ico curtain divided them, and a carpet made of bar- 
ley sacks covered the floor. The wall tents were 
only eight feet square, and when windowless and 
doorless, except for one entrance, as were those, they 
seemed from the inside much like a prison." Such 
was Mrs. Boyd's home for the first year of her mar- 
ried life. Love, of course, laughs at more danger- 
ous foes than locksmiths ; but one fancies that a 
year in a wall tent would put him to a rather se- 
rious test. Some of Mrs. Boyd's experiences are 
amusing enough, notably those with her soldier 
cooks. One of these worthies (evidently a " pam- 
pered menial," as the old verse has it) used to 
strongly object to " cooking for company." On one 
occasion, when in his cups, he distinguished himself 
and extinguished his mistress " by reeling in before 
a whole party of friends who were awaiting lunch- 
eon, and declaring that he was no slave, nor had he 
engaged himself as a hotel cook." "His freedom 
of manner," adds the good-natured narrator, " was 



so natural among frontier people, that everyone 
laughed, and all sallied out in the dining room, 
where we passed around bowls of bread and milk." 
This frontier " freedom of manner," by-the-bye, was 
early brought to Mrs. Boyd's notice at Ruby, a 
halting-place on the first journey overland to Ne- 
vada, where she overheard a station-lounger ask 
her husband, with a show of polite interest, " How 
did the old woman stand the trip ? " the " old wo- 
man " being then a bride of a few months' standing. 
The book is readable and informing, in its way, and 
it contains a portrait of Captain Boyd, with some 
account of his career and character. 

A surprising Miss Mildred Rutherford has com- 

coiiection of piled a work upon " American Au- 

American authors. t h ors " (Atlanta: The Author), 
which we have examined with considerable interest, 
not unmixed with amusement. It includes writers 
known and unknown to fame, in about equal pro- 
portions. That it might have included still more 
of the latter class is hinted at in a prefatory note 
which informs us that " in the South alone there 
are over 3500 writers." We are spared many of 
these, and might have been spared more, Mrs. 
Lollie Belle Wylie, for instance, some of whose 
poems, we are informed, "are quite striking." Even 
the " Sweet Rose of Florida," who gets five pages 
of this book, is, we blush to confess it, unknown to 
us. The quality of Miss Rutherford's work may 
best be shown by a few brief extracts. Of George 
Ripley we are told that " he possessed valuable 
books in German and French." Walt Whitman 
" can never reach the refined circle of humanity." 
'Cos why ? " He appeals to the worst part of our 
nature, not the best." F. S. Saltus "had no rev- 
erence for the Bible, and often gave strange ver- 
sions of the records there." As for Colonel Inger- 
soll, we suppose that he must be beyond hope; for 
does not this writer, after relating some choice an- 
ecdotes of obviously journalistic origin, piously ex- 
claim : " Alas ! morality cannot save ! " After this, 
we are not surprised to read that " Ben Hur " is 
" truly a great book," and that the productions of 
the late E. P. Roe " are safe books to place in the 
hands of our young people." Apropos of the latter 
ingenious writer, this remark is made : " Matthew 
Arnold's unjust criticism of Roe may have been 
caused from mistaking another Roe's works for his." 
According to the best of our recollection, Mr. Ar- 
nold simply said that the inhabitants of the Missis- 
sippi Valley were reported to derive a large share 
of their intellectual sustenance from the writings 
of a native author called Roe. But this was an 
" unjust criticism " of the Mississippi Valley, not of 
Roe. A description of one of the productions of 
Mrs. Amelie Rives Chanler tells us that the book 
" is filled with passion, deep intrigue, wild jealousy, 
hatred, murder, and terrible revenge." After this, 
it is somewhat tame to come upon so simple a state- 
ment as that the conversations of Mr. Howells " while 
flippant are natural." The book may be described,

on the whole, as an uncritical hodge-podge, sea- 
soned with mythical anecdotes, of which an excel- 
lent example is the yarn about Professor Boyesen 
and the lady who became his wife. It is needless 
to say that the story is a baseless fabrication, prob- 
ably due to the imagination of some newspaper 
writer hard-pressed for " copy." 



University 
Extension 
addresses. 



University Extension has been made 
the target of many jibes and shafts 
of more or less ill-tempered criticism 
from those who judge all educational movements 
from the standpoint of a narrow scholasticism, and 
who condemn the Extension movement because it 
modestly helps within its own sphere and does not 
attempt the impracticable. But in spite of the hu- 
morous pictures of blacksmiths wrestling with the 
intricacies of Browning's poetry, and the pathetic de- 
scriptions of housemaids perplexed by the choruses 
of Greek tragedy, the movement has gone on its 
way, has reached the respectable age of twenty-one, 
and is now more firmly than ever before fixed in the 
educational machinery of England and the United 
States. How seriously it has been taken in England, 
at least, is made sufficiently clear by the names of 
the men who have identified themselves with it to 
the extent of addressing the students of the London 
Society at the annual meetings of that body. These 
meetings were started in 1886 with an address by 
Mr. G. J. Goschen, and the speakers for the sub- 
sequent years have been Mr. John Morley, Sir 
James Paget, Professor Max Miiller, the Duke of 
Argyll, the Bishop of Durham, Canon Browne, Pro- 
fessor Jebb, and Lord Playfair. Although the ad- 
dresses of some of these men have already seen the 
light elsewhere, it was an excellent idea to collect 
the nine in a single volume, as has now been done, 
the volume being appropriately entitled " Aspects of 
Modern Study" (Macmillan). That all of the men 
thus represented are convinced of the value of Ex- 
tension work is sufficiently evident from the tenor 
of their utterances. Aside from their special bear- 
ings, these nine essays constitute a volume of edu- 
cational discussion of the most suggestive sort, and 
deserve to be widely read. Where all are good, it 
is invidious to single out a few for special praise, 
but we may perhaps be permitted to call particular 
attention to Mr. Morley 's address on "The Study 
of Literature," and to Professor Jebb's beautiful 
study of "The Influence of the Greek Mind on 
Modern Life." 



Outlines of 

American 

Literature. 



Mr. Seldon L. Whitcomb's " Chrono- 
logical Outlines of American Liter- 
ature (Macmillan) is a companion 
volume to Mr. Frederick Ryland's similar treat- 
ment of English literature on the other side of the 
Atlantic. To the usefulness of that work, published 
in 1890, we can testify from much experience, and 
it is with great satisfaction that we place Mr. Whit- 
comb's compilation by the side of the other upon 
the shelf. The same general plan is followed : the 



parallel columns being headed as in Mr. Ryland's 
book, excepting that we have here a new column of 
" British Literature " (which was of course neces- 
sary), and that the annotations are given by Mr. 
Whitcomb at the foot of the page. It goes without 
saying, also, that the treatment is much fuller in 
the present case, which none will esteem a fault, 
although the wish may emerge that Mr. Ryland's 
book might be extended to relatively comparable 
dimensions. The column headed " Foreign Liter- 
ature " is also much elaborated, and the historical 
column strengthened. We may add that a most 
important feature, although not a new one the 
beginnings of the most important American period- 
icals are chronicled under their respective dates. 
The first entry is John Smith's "True Relation" 
(1608); the last is "The Standard Dictionary" 
(1894). The entries up to 1640 ("The Bay Psalm 
Book ") are, of course, of books printed in England. 
The following list of the veterans among our living 
writers has been gleaned from the index of "Au- 
thors and Their Works," and is not without inter- 
est. The venerable Judge Gayarre* (1805) heads 
the list. Then comes Mr. Robert C. Winthrop 
(1809), Mrs. Stowe (1812), Mr. Parke Godwin 
(1816), Mr. William E. Channing (1818), Mrs. 
Julia Ward Howe and Mr. W. W. Story (1819), 
Dr. E. E. Hale and Mr. D. G. Mitchell (1822), 
Colonel T. W. Higginson (1823), Mr. C. G. Leland 
(1824), Mr. R. H. Stoddard, Mr. Henry C. Lea, 
and Professor F. J. Child (1825). These fourteen 
survive from the first quarter of our century. Per 
contra, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt (1858) is the latest 
comer in the ranks. 

A series of papers by Thomas A. 
Early New Janvier on early New York history

and topography, collected under the 
title of "In Old New York" (Harper), forms a 
volume of much local and fair general interest. Mr. 
Janvier writes entertainingly, and his pages are 
brimful of forgotten fact and curious reminiscence. 
Notably good are the pictures of old New Amster- 
dam days, when the placid Dutchmen, as yet un- 
ruffled by the forays of their New England neigh- 
bors, smoked their pipes and contemplated their 
cabbages on the banks of the odorous canal in Broad 
Street. Since Irving, historians have felt rather 
bound to gird pleasantly at these multi-breeched 
ancestors of Gotham's Brahmins ; and Mr. Janvier 
follows the irreverent rule. In point of morals, 
New Yorkers of two hundred years ago would seem 
if we are to believe the Reverend John Miller, 
resident Chaplain to the King's forces a pretty 
bad lot. The reverend gentleman, after roundly 
scoring the Province at large, berates the citizens 
of New York in particular as " drunkards and gam- 
blers," and adds : " This, joined to their profane, 
atheistical, and scoffing methods of discourse, makes 
their company extremely uneasy to sober and relig- 
ious men." In the paper on " Greenwich Village " we 
are afforded a glimpse of Thomas Paine, who, about

1809, lived in a house in Herring street (now 293 
Bleecker) where Mr. Janvier's informant often saw 
him at his window : " The sash was raised, and a 
small table or stand was placed before him with an 
open book upon it which he appeared to be read- 
ing. He had his spectacles on, his left elbow rested 
upon the table or stand, and his chin rested between 
the thumb and fingers of his hand ; his right hand 
lay upon his book, and a decanter containing liquor 
of the color of rum or brandy was standing next 
his book or beyond it." Touching the contents of 
this decanter, it would perhaps be more charitable 
to guess that the ex-staymaker (who was an admirer 
of Berkeley) was assisting his meditations and solac- 
ing his labors with tar-water. We refer the point 
to Mr. M. D. Conway. Mr. Janvier's book is beau- 
tifully illustrated, and it contains several useful maps 
and charts. _

a vacant place and supplies a real need. The old 
Bosworth is badly out of date, and the new Bos- 
worth is still far from completion. Dr. Hall's work 
consequently provides the student with just what he 
wants pending the complete revision of Bosworth, 
and will, indeed, provide most students with as full 
a dictionary as they will need at all. The original 
plan of the author was " to collect into one volume 
the information contained in the numerous glos- 
saries to Anglo-Saxon text-books, readers, etc., which 
have appeared in England, America, and Germany 
within the last fifteen years or so such books, for 
instance, as Sweet's Reader, Harrison and Sharp's 
Beowulf, and Kluge's Lesebuch." But as the work 
progressed, the original plan suffered several ex- 
pansions, and now includes the Wright- Wtilker Vo- 
cabularies, Harrison and Baskerville's translation of 
Grosschopp, Leo's Angelsachsisches Glossar, a con- 
cordance to the MSS. of Alfred prepared by the 
author for separate publication, the new Bosworth 
as far as published, and a number of unglossaried 
texts. Among matters of detail we note the strictly 
alphabetical arrangement, the reduction of spelling 
to the Early West Saxon standard (provided the 
forms actually occur), the use of the macron as the 
only diacritical mark, the reference of many words 
to the MSS. in which they occur, the grammatical 
references to Sweet's Reader and to Cook's Sievers, 
and the large number of cross-references. The work 
is a square octavo of 369 three-columned pages. 

Pasquier's third volume of Memoirs 
( Scribner), opening with the first 
Bourbon restoration and closing with 
the earlier events of the second, will prove of ab- 
sorbing interest to serious readers. The story of 
the Hundred Days is luminously treated, chiefly 
from the political standpoint ; and the book through- 
out is rich in incidents that fell under Pasquier's 
immediate notice. Commenting on Waterloo, he 
describes the dissatisfaction of the marshals over

Grouchy's appointment, at the previous council at 
Charleroi, to the very important command of the 
army corps constituting the right flank. After the 
council, it seems, Soult, as spokesman for his col- 
leagues, returned, and informed the Emperor that 
the marshals considered it their duty to say that 
they believed Grouchy had received a command 
altogether disproportionate to his talents. Capable 
of executing in the field, with brilliancy and effect, 
orders immediately given him, he was incapable of 
an initiative, and lacked the perspicacity needed ta 
modify orders in obedience to new and unforeseen 
conditions. Grouchy, in short, was a serviceable 
tool but only a tool. Napoleon, continues Pas- 
quier, strode up and down for a few moments, as 
was his custom, without answering, and then said: 
"You are right, sir; Marshal Grouchy is not en- 
dowed with any great ability ; but what am I ta 
do? I have just given him his baton, and I can- 
not refuse him a command. Moreover, I have 
placed by his side two of the army's best lieutenant- 
generals; they will guide him, and, besides, I will 
constantly have my eye on him." "After this, Sire, 
our responsibility ceases," said Soult, as he with- 
drew. Whether or no the loss of the battle of 
Waterloo is rightly laid at Grouchy's door, is a 
question ; but it is certain his appointment was a 
disastrous one. All in all, the Pasquier Memoirs 
may be regarded as the weightiest and most critical 
of recent contributions to Napoleonic history. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



From the special publication department of Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. we have received an edition of the Tacitean 
" Dialogus de Oratoribus," prepared by Mr. Alfred 
Gudeman of the University of Pennsylvania. This edi- 
tion, including, as the title-page adds, " prolegomena, 
critical apparatus, exegetical and critical notes, bibli- 
ography, and indexes," is upon a scale that may fairly 
be termed monumental, for the fifty slight pages of the 
Latin text are imbedded in over five hundred pages of 
erudite comment. This is indeed the thoroughness which 
we are accustomed to style Germanic. It represents 
over five years of steady work on the part of the editor. 
The same publishers send us a college edition of the 
" Dialogus," edited for their " Series of Latin Authors " 
by Mr. Charles E. Bennett, and based in part upon the 
manuscript notes of the late Lucius Heritage. 

First among the new German text-books upon our 
table must be named Dr. Sylvester Primer's very at- 
tractive and complete edition of " Nathan der Weise " 
(Heath). Introduction, notes, and bibliography are all 
good. For younger students, Professor Charles F. Brusie 
has edited three of Theodor Storm's charming " Ges- 
chichten aus der Tonne." Still younger students are 
aimed at by Mr. R. J. Morich, who edits a tale entitled 
" Fritz auf dem Lande " (Maynard), by Herr Hans Ar- 
nold, unknown, we should say, to any extended fame. 

It is not often that a new writer finds himself, after 
not more than four or five years of vogue, put among 
the classics, but some such fate has now befallen Dr. 
A. Conan Doyle, in the selection of his " Micah Clarke "

for use as a school reading-book (Longmans). The text 
is of course much condensed, and the chapters are pro- 
vided with explanatory vocabularies. After all, school- 
children often have put before them matter of far less 
value, to say nothing of interest. In this connection we 
note the publication (Harper) of a handsome library 
edition, with good illustrations by Mr. G. W. Bardwell, 
of this really great novel of Monmouth and his Rebellion. 

The maximum condensation not incompatible with 
interest and readability seems to be the aim of the " Co- 
lumbian Knowledge " series (Roberts), edited by Pro- 
fessor David P. Todd. We have had occasion to praise 
highly Mr. Fletcher's " Public Libraries in America," 
written for this series, and similar praise is deserved by 
Mrs. Mabel Loomis Todd's " Total Eclipses of the Sun." 
The amount of accurate information collected within 
the covers of this little volume is very great, and the 
setting-forth thereof, with the aid of maps, diagrams, 
and cuts, leaves little to be desired. Mrs. Todd has 
chosen for her subject one of the most fascinating chap- 
ters of astronomical science, and even the specialist in 
eclipses, unless his reading is close up to date, may find 
matters of interest in this excellent little treatise. 

Some time ago we noted the appearance of the first 
volume of " A Laboratory Manual of Physics and Ap- 
plied Electricity " (Macmillan), edited by Professor 
Edward L. Nichols. The second and final volume, 
containing " Senior Courses and Outlines of Advanced 
Work," is now at hand. In the preparation of this vol- 
ume the editor has had the collaboration of Messrs. G. 
S. Moler, F. Bedell, H. J. Hotchkiss, and C. P. Mat- 
thews. The electrical courses given are in direct and 
alternating current work, the others in photometry, heat, 
spectroscopy, physiological optics, and magnetism. The 
treatise is one of the best of its class that we have seen. 

The third volume of Larned's " History for Ready 
Reference," Gree Nibe (C. A. Nichols Co., Spring- 
field, Mass.), amply fulfils the promise made by the first 
two volumes, reviewed in THE DIAL for September 16. 
The important papers are upon Greece, History, Hun- 
gary, India, Ireland, Italy, Jews, Law, Libraries, Ma- 
hometan Conquest and Empire, Massachusetts, Medical 
Science, Mexico, Money and Banking, Netherlands, 
New England, and New York. These take up over 500 
pages of the 793 contained in the volume. The histor- 
ical sketch of Law was prepared by Austin Abbott, 
Dean of the New York University Law School, but upon 
the same general plan as the other papers. 

Recent text-books of the French language are Mile. 
Rosine Mell^'s " The Contemporary French Writers " 
(Ginn), including selections which we cannot say are 
always happy for their purpose; a volume of "Extraits 
Ohoisis des CEuvres de Paul Bourget " (Ginn), author- 
ized by M. Bourget, and edited by Mr. Alphonse N. Van 
Daell; " Meletoi de Ton Me"tier" (Maynard), a child's 
story by Mile. L. Bruneau, edited by Mr. W. S. Lyon; 
and the "Preparatory French Reader" (Allyn) which 
Mr. George W. Rollins has just put forth. The selec- 
tions in this volume range from Baron Marbot to La- 
biche, from La Fontaine to Gautier. There is a full 
vocabulary and a table of irregular conjugations. 

A useful handbook for persons practically connected 
with the art of printing is Mr. W. J. Kelly's short treat- 
ise on " Presswork " (The Inland Printer Co., Chicago). 
It is made up of information and directions on a mul- 
titude of technical subjects, such as " making ready " a 
form on the press, " overlaying " and " underlaying," 



the qualities and proper treatment of inks, etc. Printers 
of the older school will look in vain for any but a casual 
reference to dampened paper the disuse of which, con- 
sequent upon the introduction of swift cylinder presses, 
the " old-timers " will probably never quite cease to de- 
plore. Their reverence for old times and methods will, 
however, find satisfaction in Mr. Kelly's admission that 
after an investigation of all the systems of " make- 
ready " of the present time, he is unable to discover a 
single effective one which is not traceable to those used 
in hand-press printing. Even Mr. Ruskin could not 
ask a better tribute than this. 

" The Surgeon's Daughter " and " Castle Dangerous " 
are the contents of the volume which completes the 
" Dryburgh " edition of the " Waverley Novels " (Mac- 
millan) . The illustrations to this volume are by Messrs. 
Paul Hardy and Walter Paget. One may now have the 
pleasure of contemplating all twenty-five of these " Dry- 
burgh " books in a row, and few book-shelves will be as 
well furnished as that on which they rest. We have 
so frequently praised this edition of the great romancer, 
as it has come to us in instalments, that anything we 
might now say would be mere superfluous repetition. A 
note must be made, however, of the general index to the 
set which comes at the end of this last volume. 

That classic of mountaineering, Mr. Edward Whym- 
per's " Travels amongst the Great Andes of the Equa- 
tor," reviewed by us at the time of its publication in 
1892, has just been reissued by the Scribners at a 
noticeable reduction in price, although the form is sub- 
stantially that of the expensive first edition. From the 
same publishers we have a reissue, in a single stout vol- 
ume, with slightly reduced text and greatly reduced 
price, of General A. W. Greely's " Three Years of Arc- 
tic Service," with its graphic and intensely interesting 
story of the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition of 1881-84. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, October 10, 1894. 

The death of Dr. Holmes is the event chiefly spoken 
of in literary circles in New York. I may be permitted 
to recall here nay last glimpse of the poet (which was 
also my first). It was at his home on Beacon street, 
and no earlier than the Spring of the present year. I 
had previously called to see him during the winter, with 
proper credentials, and was informed that he was " out," 
not learning until two or three days after that he was 
seriously ill and in charge of a nurse. Of late years, it 
seems, a system had been perfected for concealing any 
illness, even the slightest, from public knowledge; for 
no sooner would such a rumor get abroad than all Bos- 
ton would flock to Beacon street to make inquiries. I 
was received by the Doctor in the well-known study 
overlooking the Back Bay, and we chatted of my busi- 
ness for some ten minutes. He complained slightly of 
the after effects of his illness, but he was so bright and 
chatty and well-looking that I set him down mentally 
for from five to ten years more of life at least. What 
seemed to worry him more than anything else was the 
constant flow of letters which poured in on him every 
day; and yet I could not help fancying that he would 
have greatly missed them if they had ceased to come. 
The death of the Autocrat seems to have been com- 
mented on in print less than might have been expected. 
Coining without warning, it threw the daily papers en- 



238 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16 y 



tirely upon obituaries already at hand in their files. 
His family, also, suppressed all efforts to make his fu- 
neral an affair of public demonstration, and it took 
place during a severe storm, with King's Chapel only 
half filled. Dr. Holmes's last appearance in this city 
was at a medical dinner given him here some years ago. 
He did not often visit the metropolis. 

The death of Professor Vincenzo Botta, which re- 
sulted from the effects of a fall from his window, re- 
moves about the last survivor of the old New York lit- 
erary group. He married Miss Anne Lynch in 1855. 
It was at one of Miss Lynch's receptions that Poe first 
acknowledged and recited " The Raven," and after her 
marriage Mrs. Botta continued to hold these receptions 
until her death two years ago. Since that event Pro- 
fessor Botta has been busy with Mrs. Botta's " Me- 
moirs," recently published. 

The visit of the rector of Shakespeare's church in 
Stratford-on-Avon to this country, in search of the grave 
of that Virginia settler who attended Shakespeare's fu- 
neral, is a matter of some amusement to those who re- 
member Mr. Moncure D. Conway's similar search some 
years ago. Whence Frederick Wadsworth Loring, or 
the residents of Fredericksburg, derived the legend on 
which Loring's poem is based, I know not, as the poem 
appeared in " The Atlantic Monthly " in 1870, and Lor- 
ing was killed by Arizona Indians the following year. 
The first stanza reads: 

" In the old churchyard at Fredericksburg 

A gravestone stands to-day, 
Marking the place where a grave has been, 
Though many and many a year has it seen 
Since its tenant mouldered away. 
And that quaintly carved old stone 
Tells its simple tale to all : 
' Here lies a bearer of the pall 
At the funeral of Shakespeare.' " 

It is a fine poem throughout, and it led Mr. Conway a 
fine chase after the aforesaid tombstone. He found it 
at last, I believe, and also found that it belonged to 
another man, and that no pall-bearer of Shakespeare 
could have died at Fredericksburg anyhow. All this 
was told in a merry fashion by Mr. Conway himself at 
the time. The " Springfield Republican " animadverts 
rather severely upon Dr. Arbuthnot for his " restora- 
tions " in the Stratford church, but says that his action 
in suppressing the noisy tourists who visit it is com- 
mendable. 

Another traveller from England, Dr. A. Conan Doyle, 
has been the object of a great deal of attention from 
New York editors and publishers. After three or four 
days of entertainment on the part of these friends, Dr. 
Doyle and his brother left for the Adirondacks for a 
week's shooting. He stood the usual fire of questioning 
from reporters on his arrival, and came off very well, 
doubtless being prepared to meet this ordeal. He lec- 
tured here once before leaving for Chicago. 

Mr. S. R. Crockett's new book, " The Lilac Sunbon- 
net," which Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. are about to 
publish, is said to be a more poetic and tender romance 
than those which have preceded it. There is perhaps 
more of delicacy and charm than is shown in the others. 
This firm is just bringing out the poems of Frank L. 
Stanton, of the " Atlanta Constitution," with the title, 
" Songs of the Soil." Mr. Stanton is a working jour- 
nalist, and his verse has been written at odd moments, 
but it has been taken up and copied all over the coun- 
try. The book will include poems both of sentiment 
and dialect. 



" lola, the Senator's Daughter " is a story of ancient 
Rome, soon to be brought out by Messrs. G. P. Put- 
nam's Sons. It is intended to be a life picture of the 
business classes of that city nineteen centuries ago, the 
author's theory being that the Romans did not always- 
wear the toga, but were often modern in their ways. 
Another volume of special interest on this firm's list is 
the " Napoleon " of Alexandre Dumas, translated by 
Mr. John B. Larner, a Washington lawyer, who is 
said to have preserved the very forceful style of the 
French original. The Putnams will publish in Janu- 
ary the first volume of M. Jusserand's " Literary His- 
tory of the English People," which has attracted a great 
deal of attention in England. M. Jusserand is thought 
" to have been influenced by Taine and John Richard 
Green, but the scale of his book gives him the liberty 
of indulging in detail where Green could only work 
through a few broad strokes, while the thirty years that 
have elapsed since Taine's book saw the light, not to 
mention the idiosyncrasies of the two writers, have 
shown him that if a literary history is to be true the 
historian must not ride theories to death."

TjITERARY NOTES. 



One of the most important books promised for the 
near future is the late Professor Jowett's " Conversa- 
tions." 

Dr. Alice B. Stockham's " Koradine," issued as a sub- 
scription book, is now offered through the trade, and at 
a much reduced price. 

Mr. Alma Tadema is said to be preparing a volume 
of reminiscences which will include his impressions of 
many men of celebrity with whom he has been associated. 

Mrs. Minerva B. Norton, author of " In and Around 
Berlin " and other books, as well as an occasional con- 
tributor to THE DIAL, died at her home at Beloit, Wis., 
early in the present month. 

Dr. Heinrich Hoffman, author of " Struwelpeter," 
died at Frankfort, towards the close of last month. 
The " Saturday Review " calls him one of the greatest 
benefactors of his race in the last half-century. 

The " History of the Thousand," by no less a person- 
age than Signor Crispi, is an interesting announcement 
from Italy. It will be remembered that the author, 
himself a Sicilian, took a prominent part in the expedi- 
tion. 

Professor B. A. Hinsdale, of Ann Arbor, has printed 
a " Teacher's Professional Book List " leaflet, giving 
the titles of some thirty books believed by him to be 
among the most useful for the foundation of a profes- 
sional library. 

Professor William Cranston Lawton publishes a syl- 
labus of a course of lectures on the New England poets. 
The lives of the six poets are tabulated in parallel col- 
umns, and the facts are thus helpfully displayed for 
ready reference. 

The literary remains of Helmholtz are to be edited 
by Professor A. Konig, of Berlin, a former pupil and 
collaborateur of the great physiologist, and editor of the 
" Zeitschrift fiir Psychologie " and of the " Verhand- 
lungen der Physikalischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin." 

Professor William M. Ramsay, A.M., professor of 
humanity at the University of Aberdeen, is announced 
to lecture at the Johns Hopkins University on the Lev-

ering lectureship foundation on October 19, 20, 21, and 
22. Professor Ramsay formerly occupied the chair of 
classical archaeology at Exeter College, Oxford. 

Among the new and forthcoming books of Messrs. A. 
C. McClurg & Co., Chicago, are "The Crucifixion of 
Philip Strong," a novel by Mr. Charles M. Sheldon; " My 
Lady," a story by Miss Marguerite Bouvet, illustrated 
by Miss Helen M. Armstrong; "Polar Gleams, an Ac- 
count of a Voyage on the Yacht ' Blencathra,' " by Miss 
Helen Peel; and four volumes of reprints of Green, 
Spenser, Jonson, and Greville. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. will publish imme- 
diately " Philip and his Wife," by Mrs. Margaret De- 
land; a cheaper edition, reduced in size, of the Vedder- 
FitzGerald "Rubaiyat"; Mr. Aldrich's " The Story of 
a Bad Boy," illustrated by Mr. A. B. Frost; the "Life, 
Letters, and Diary of Lucy Larcom," by the Rev. D. D. 
Addison; "In the Dozy Hours," by Miss Agnes Rep- 
plier; and "Three Boys on an Electrical Boat," by 
Professor John Trowbridge. 

Professor Vineenzo Botta, of New York, died on the 
fifth of this month, at the age of seventy-five. A Pied- 
montese by birth, he was a professor in the University 
of Turin, a member of the Sardinian legislature, and a 
special commissioner of the government for the study 
of foreign educational systems. He came to this coun- 
try in 1853, became naturalized, married Anne C. Lynch, 
and occupied for many years a professorship in Italian in 
the University of the City of New York. Among his 
books are a memorial volume to his wife, and works upon 
Dante, Cavour, and modern Italian philosophy. 

A suit now pending in the United States Circuit Court 
at Philadelphia las for its object the testing of the 
Copyright Act of 1890. The complainants are Mr. H. 
Rider Haggard and Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co., 
represented by Mr. Daniel Greenleaf Thompson. The 
point at issue is the power of Congress to delegate de- 
clarative power to the President, and consequently the 
constitutionality of the law itself. Since other such 
delegations of power have already been fully sustained 
by the courts, there is no reasonable doubt of their find- 
ing in the present case, and it will be well to have the 
question settled forever. 

In concluding a series of selections from the corre- 
spondence of Poe, in " The Century Magazine " for Oc- 
tober, Mr. G. E. Woodberry says: "It is a gratification 
to find that American men of letters who were contem- 
porary with Poe are so fully freed from the charge, 
brought against them by English admirers of the poet, of 
lack of aid and appreciation toward him. Few men have 
received such cordial encouragement, praise, and wel- 
come, material and moral, as Poe received from nearly 
all who were brought into relations with him, and the 
number of these was many Irving, Kennedy, Paulding, 
Hawthorne, Willis, Lowell, Simms, and others less dis- 
tinguished, but then of note. Yet Mr. Andrew Lang 
says that Poe was < a gentleman among canaille.' " 

The London correspondent of " The Critic " has the 
following interesting note about a biography that we 
are all waiting for: "Lord Tennyson has been occupied 
upon the life of his father continuously during the past 
few months, and has made considerable progress with 
it, but the work will certainly not be completed during 
the present year, and it is doubtful whether it will even 
see the light during 1895. When it comes, it will be 
genuinely welcome. It is announced that Lord Tenny- 
son has had the personal assistance of several eminent 



men of letters, foremost among whom one would place 
conjecturally the names of Mr. Frederick Locker-Lamp- 
son and Mr. Theodore Watts. But no detail of the 
probable character of the volume has been allowed to 
escape from Farringford, nor is it likely that anything 
will be known until the biography makes its public ap- 
pearance." 

President J. N. Larned of the American Library As- 
sociation made an address at the Lake Placid meeting 
of that organization, which is summarized as " a mas- 
terly setting-forth of the relation of public libraries to 
the social movement of the time, claiming for them an 
exact fitness to the needs of the age. The education of 
the schools and universities fails to carry more than a 
select few beyond the rudiments, giving to the masses 
only that little knowledge ' which is dangerous. The 
newspaper press, valuable as it is, is to a large extent 
mercenary and partisan, and, as generally read, culti- 
vates prejudice and disseminates narrow views. To the 
public library, distributing to the homes of the people 
good literature, and welcoming to its halls all students 
of any subject without question as to their previous at- 
tainments, we look for that generosity and breadth of 
popular culture which alone can save our democratic 
commonwealth from destruction." 

A monument to Shelley was unveiled at Viareggio 
on the morning of September 30. The press dispatches 
thus describe the work and the occasion: " The monu- 
ment, which is fifteen feet high, faces the sea in Paolina 
square. The bust is the work of the sculptor Sig. Ur- 
bano Lucchesi. It represents the poet at the age of 29 
years, in a meditative attitude. The pedestal is simple, 
but elegant. On the side away from the sea a design 
of intertwined branches of oak and olive encircles a 
book bearing on its cover the word ' Prometeo.' Above 
this is an inscription written by Sig. Bovio, reading thus : 

To PERCY BYSHE SHELLEY, 

Heart of Hearts : 

Drowned in this sea ; cremated on this spot, where he 

composed " Prometheus Unbound." A posthumous 

page wherein every generation will have a 

token of its struggles, its tears, 

its redemption. 

The weather was bad, but despite this drawback there 
was a great gathering of English residents and eminent 
Italians, including Signori Panzacchi, Cavallotti, Villari, 
Coppino, and Martini. Representatives of the Univer- 
sities of Rome and Pisa were also present. Lady Shel- 
ley was represented by Col. Leigh Hunt. Sig. Riccioni 
delivered an address, after which he formally trans- 
ferred the monument to the keeping of the mayor of 
Viarreggio amid the cheering of the assemblage."

rui Lldll rdlllLCI. paintings by Mr. HEALY. 12mo, 221 pages, $1.50. 
Lovers of contemporary history cannot but enjoy these reminiscences. Mr. Healy, certainly the leading portrait painter of his day, was 
brought into contact with many of the most illustrious men and women both of Europe and America, and the magnetic force of his genial nature 
retained them as his intimate friends. He tells us, in charmingly easy style, of his gradual rise as a portrait painter, from the time when, as he 
says, he made a likeness of " Our Butcher," until commissions were sent to him for portraits of Henry Clay, John Quincy Adams, Lincoln, Grant, 
Sherman, Louis Philippe, Bismarck, Guizot, Pius IX., and other rulers, statesmen and soldiers. To meet such persons outside of politics and 
strife, in the studio and at table, is a rich treat for the reader.

By the Piev. THOMAS C. HALL. 12mo, 190 pages, $1.00. 

The sermons which comprise this book are a warm-hearted, eloquent appeal to the spiritual life. They are eminently practical, non-sectarian 
and catholic in their teaching, and commend Christ, rather than any one of the "forms of godliness " in the Christian church, to the reader. 

\lvr I f\(\\T By MARGUERITE BOUVET, author of "Sweet William," etc. With illustrations and cover design by 
L T l^ L.dvl^y MARGARET and HELEN ARMSTRONG. IGmo, $1.25. 

This is a delightful story for adults from the same author who has already charmed the thousands who have read her favorite children's 
stories, " Sweet William," " Prince Tiptop," etc. It is a fine example of the power to tell a tale of tender love in pure Saxon English. Recount- 
ing the fortunes of French refugees to England in the days of the Revolution of '93 and of Bonaparte, it affords glimpses of life both in England 
and France. The book is sure to increase its author's fame, both by its fascination as a story and by its simple unaffected style.

M. Bikelas is, perhaps, the most popular living author in his own land, and his name is a household word among all who take an interest in 
the modern Greeks. Of these eight tales some are sad, some imbued with a gentle humor, and all are pure and refined in sentiment. Their 
especial value lies in the realistic pictures they paint of Greek life in our own times.

These highly entertaining prose idylls racy, piquant, spirited, have already attained great popularity in France, and their realistic pictures 
of Jewish life in the good old times, both in its comic and serious aspects, will assure them a warm welcome here.

Mr. Keyser spends much of his time among the birds because he loves them. The feathered folk of this land are his friends and acquaint-

their language. In all the varied information it affords, it is exact and reliable. The lover of Nature will not fail to carry this work in his excur- 



^ Story of the Times of Ahab, King of Israel. By A. W. ACKERMAN. 12mo, 390 

This book will be found intensely interesting because of the light it throws upon an eventful period in the history of the people of Israel. 
Dealing with the times of the weak-minded King Ahab and his idolatrous wife, Jezebel, it sets before the reader, in the attractive form of a tale, 
something of the domestic as well as the military life of those troublous times. The interest is greatly enhanced by the exquisitely pure lore 
story that is interwoven with the stirring historical events.

fine picture of Siberia and its future possibilities.

By arrangement with the French publishers, Messrs. D. Appleton

Dumas's immortal romance which has been published. The illustra-

"M. Camille Flammarion is the most popular scientific writer in 
France. Of the present work, no fewer than one hundred thousand 
copies were sold in a few years. It was considered of such merit that 
the Montyon Prize of the French Academy was awarded to it ; it has 
also been selected by the Minister of Education for use in the public 
libraries, a distinction which proves that it is well suited to the gen- 
eral reader. The subject is treated in a very popular style, and the work 
is at the same time interesting and reliable." Extract from Transla- 
tor's Preface.

OTIS TUFTON MASON, A.M., Curator of the De-

Museum. With numerous Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, 

$1.75. 

This is the first volume in the Anthropological Series, edited by Prof. 
Frederick Starr, of the University of Chicago. The series is undertaken 
in the hope that anthropology the science of man may become better 
known to intelligent readers. While the books are intended to be of 
general interest, they will in every case be written by authorities who 
will not sacrifice scientific accuracy to popularity. In the present vol- 
ume is traced the interesting period when with fire-making began the 
first division of labor, a division of labor based upon sex, the man 
going to the field or forest for game, while the woman at the fireside 
became the burden-bearer, basket-maker, weaver, potter, agriculturist, 
and domesticator of animals.

sleep ; and here is Life made beautiful again." JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS. 



Treatise on American Football. 

By A. A. STAGG and H. L. WILLIAMS. With Diagrams 
illustrating over 100 plays. 16mo, cloth, $1.25. 

" The most elaborate and practical pocket manual that beginners in 
the game have yet had their attention called to. Stagg and Williams 
are both well known, the former as Yale's end rusher in '88-'89, and 
one of the closest and most thorough students of the game ; and Will- 
iams as the Yale half-back in '90, and a player who thought out and 
brought many new plays to practical success. There are chapters for 
beginners and spectators, on team-play, tactics, training, and on the 
several positions. It is an extremely useful book." CASPER W. WHIT- 
NEY, in Harper's Weekly.

COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ENGLISH. 
A SUMMARY. 

With the article upon " English at Wellesley 
College," printed in the last issue of THE DIAL, 
we closed our series of reports upon the work 
done in English at our colleges and univer- 
sities. These reports, contributed in every case 
by someone closely identified with the English 
department of the institution concerned, and in 
the majority of cases by the head of the de- 
partment, have provided the most elaborate 
comparative showing ever made of the methods 
pursued in this important branch of the higher 
instruction. There have been eighteen arti- 
cles altogether, representing as many centres 
of light and leading ; and while the subject 
might have been continued for some months 
more without loss of interest, enough facts have 
been furnished to provide a safe basis for gen- 
eralization, and to illustrate every important 
phase of the teaching of English as it is now 
understood by those among us who are fore- 
most in its profession. 

The colleges and universities represented in 
this series fall into certain natural groups which 
it may be well to indicate. First of all, we 
have such venerable Eastern institutions as 
Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and the University 
of Pennsylvania. With these we may group 
Amherst and Lafayette, standing for the class 
of small colleges to which American education 
owes a debt far from measurable by their size, 
and the University of Virginia, representing 
the earlier type of Southern education so well 
justified of its children during the long ante- 
bellum period. A second and fairly compact 
group is formed of the state-supported institu- 
tions of the New West the Universities of 
Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa, 
Nebraska, and California. The third and last 
group includes those later foundations of pri- 
vate philanthropy which, with their suddenly 
acquired wealth and mushroom-like rate of de- 
velopment, already threaten to overshadow the 
ancient fame of the New England institutions. 
To this category belong Cornell and Stanford 
Universities, and the University of Chicago, 
Here we may also include, as representing both 
the new philanthropy and the new spirit that

does not seek to exclude woman from the ben- 
efits of the higher culture, the excellent college 
to which special attention was called in our last 
issue Wellesley. 

Although this grouping is but one of several 
that might be chosen, it seems, on the whole, 
the most natural and the most suggestive. It 
very nearly amounts to a geographical group- 
ing of the East and the West, or to a chrono- 
logical grouping of the old and the new. And 
perhaps the first idea suggested by this anti- 
thesis of East and West, of old and new, is 
that the former class stands for a conservative 
adherence to well-tried methods and aims, while 
the latter class stands for experiment, fertility 
of invention, and the broadening of standards. 
Certainly, the new ideas and the novel methods 
reported come rather from the West than the 
East, rather from the youthful than from the 
ancient foundations. It is undoubtedly true 
that the newer communities of the West sup- 
ply the educator with a cruder material than 
comes into the hands of a New England fac- 
ulty, and possibly this is the very thing that 
stimulates him to new departures and novel 
activities. It makes a vast difference whether 
the average student comes from a home in which 
books are among the most essential of furnish- 
ings and from a family in which culture is a 
traditional inheritance, or from the environ- 
ment of the pioneer settlement, which has not 
yet forgotten or outlived the hard struggle for 
subsistence and a foothold. And, while we are 
not disposed to say that the new universities 
are doing more than the old ones for the study 
of our common speech and literary inheritance, 
we cannot refrain from commendation of the 
alertness, the keenness of scent, and the adapt- 
ability with which they are shaping their work 
to their special conditions. 

Viewing our collection of reports as a whole, 
it is clear that they supply the material for a 
considerable number of fairly trustworthy in- 
ductions. A few of these we will endeavor 
briefly to set forth. The statistics given to 
show the numbers of students pursuing English 
courses at the respective colleges show that 
these courses are nearly everywhere very pop- 
ular. They run the classical courses closely, 
and in some cases seem to attract a larger num- 
ber of students, although the figures are lack- 
ing for any exact comparative statement on this 
subject. In a recent review article Professor 
Woodrow Wilson contends that the twin bases 
of the new liberal education ought to be the 
study of literature and the study of institu- 



tions. As far as the study of literature is 
concerned, it would seem that the contention 
is already justified, or nearly so, by the fact. 
The thousand odd students at Yale (and Shef- 
field), at Harvard, at the Universities of Mich- 
igan, and even of Nebraska, give eloquent tes- 
timony to the popularity of English teaching, 
to say nothing of the 873 reported by Cali- 
fornia, the 629 by Chicago, and the 450 by 
Stanford. Equally eloquent, from another 
point of view, are such English faculties as that 
of Harvard, with twenty men, and of Chicago, 
with fifteen. Courses are reported in so many 
different ways that comparison is not easy ; but 
Chicago, with upwards of sixty hours a week, 
seems to head the list, while Harvard, Stanford, 
and California are not far behind. 

The important subject of entrance require- 
ments is not discussed in the majority of our 
reports, but the few allusions made to it are of 
the greatest interest. During the present year, 
Yale has for the first time required an entrance 
qualification in English. From Pennsylvania 
comes the vague report that " English litera- 
ture" is required for entrance. As we go West, 
we do better and better. Indiana has relegated 
the bugbear of " Freshman English " to the 
preparatory schools, and Nebraska has accom- 
plished a similar reform. The most interesting 
reports upon this subject come from the Pacific 
Coast. The University of California requires 
" a high-school course of at least three years, 
at the rate of five hours a week ; and it advo- 
cates, and from some schools secures, a four 
years' course." This requirement is further 
said to be fifty per cent more extensive and 
stringent than that made by the New England 
Association of Colleges. Stanford University 
started out with what was substantially the New 
England requirement, but has since raised that 
standard upon the side of composition. " This 
year," it is said, " we have absolutely refused 
to admit to our courses students unprepared to 
do real collegiate work. The Freshman En- 
glish course in theme-writing has been elimin- 
ated from our programme, and has been turned 
over to approved teachers and to the various 
secondary schools. Had this salutary innova- 
tion not been accomplished, all the literary 
courses would have been swept away by the rap- 
idly growing inundation of Freshman themes, 
and all our strength and courage would have 
been dissipated in preparing our students to do 
respectable work at more happily equipped uni- 
versities." 

The study of these reports shows the exist-

ence, in most of our colleges, of a well-marked 
differentiation of literature from linguistics. 
In many of the cases, indeed, there is an equally 
distinct differentiation of rhetoric from the 
other two departments. We have, of course, 
no quarrel with either the science of linguistics 
or the art of rhetoric, but we have always con- 
tended that neither of the two should be per- 
mitted to masquerade as the study of literature. 
It is gratifying to find that the distinction is 
both made and observed in nearly all of the in- 
stitutions under consideration. " Mere litera- 
ture " seems to have its full share of attention 
and teaching strength ; it appears to be cor- 
dially recognized as a true university subject, 
with its own methods and aims, and with its 
own tests of the culture which it has to impart. 
That university teaching in literature may be 
made something more than the " chatter about 
Shelley " which one of its most famous oppo- 
nents delighted to call it, should be sufficiently 
evident from a careful study of these eighteen 
reports. The question may be raised whether 
it would not be well to set an official seal upon 
the separation of literature from its allied sub- 
jects by making of it a separate department of 
university work, just as some of our more pro- 
gressive institutions have erected sociology into 
a distinct department, thus definitely marking 
it off from the allied departments of political 
and economic science. If literature, linguistics, 
and rhetoric are grouped together as consti- 
tuting a single department, it becomes almost 
impossible to provide that department with a 
suitable head. One can no longer be a specialist 
in so many fields ; the head of a modern En- 
glish department is not likely to be both an 
accomplished student of literature and a philo- 
logical expert ; and since his real distinction is 
pretty sure to be in one of these subjects alone, 
there is always the danger that the subject of 
which he is master will be given a preponder- 
ant place in the work of his department. 

Space fails us for the discussion of the many 
remaining subjects of interest offered by a 
comparative examination of these reports. We 
should like to speak of the growing impor- 
tance of graduate work in English, of the ten- 
dency to give a larger place to Seminar inves- 
tigation, of the historical aspect of literary 
study, of the extent to which American litera- 
ture should receive special treatment, of the 
importance of introducing courses which bring 
into comparison the literatures of culture, of 
the inexhaustible subject of special methods 
of instruction, and the equally inexhaustible 



subject of the general aims to be kept in view 
by the teacher of literature. To some or all 
of these subjects we shall doubtless recur as 
occasion arises, and in connection with the dis- 
cussion that is likely to follow the republication 
of these reports in their more serviceable per- 
manent shape. Our closing word shall be one 
of gratification at the admirable variety, vital- 
ity, and individuality of the presentment as a 
whole. Whatever may be the shortcomings of 
our present higher instruction in English, it 
has not fallen into the stagnation of a pedantic 
routine. It is alert, progressive, and eager in 
its outlook for higher things than have as yet 
been attained, however far it may yet be from 
the fulfilment of its whole ambition. 



JAMES ANTHONY FROUDE. 

However diverse may be the judgments passed 
upon the work of Professor Froude, friends and 
foes must unite to recognize in him one of the giants 
of his age. His impress upon the spiritual de- 
velopment of the last half-century has been very 
deep, and would have been deeper had he stood by 
himself, not overshadowed by his friend and mas- 
ter, Carlyle. His originality, combined with his 
aggressive energy, was bound to stir up contention, 
into whatever field of thought he might make excur- 
sions ; and few men have lived so continuously as 
he in an atmosphere of acrimonious disputation. 
His abandonment of the priestly profession, coupled 
with the outspoken propositions of " The Nemesis 
of Faith," aroused the first bitterness against him, 
and his famous defense of Henry the Eighth set all 
the dogs of controversy upon his heels. The deliv- 
ery and subsequent publication of his American lec- 
tures exposed him to reprisals from vindictive Irish- 
men all over the world, and all sorts of colonial 
doctrinaires felt themselves outraged by his two 
books upon the outlying provinces of the English 
Empire. Then came the Carlyle publications, with 
their unnecessarily truthful revelations ; and there 
were none so poor, after that, to do reverence to 
an editor who had thus ruthlessly (although in all 
unconsciousness) played the iconoclast. 

We think that the general effect of the many at- 
tacks made upon the great historian has been to 
create a distinctly unfair and prejudiced opinion 
concerning the value of his work, and that his repu- 
tation is one that will grow rather than diminish 
with the lapse of years. Let us allow to the full 
for the exaggerated hero-worship of many of his 
books, and for his constitutional inability to see 
things from any other than his own intensely indi- 
vidual standpoint ; let us also allow for the charges 
of inaccuracy and the unscholarly use of material, 
not only brought against him, but amply substan- 
tiated, by such men as Professor Freeman and Pro-

f essor Charles Eliot Norton ; yet when all these 
allowances have been made, there still remains the 
great corpus of his work, magnificent as literature, 
masterly in its power of holding the attention, and, 
after all, consistent with itself and with the method 
deliberately chosen by the author to fit with his nat- 
ural predispositions. It is the ethical method, not 
the scientific, and must be judged by its own stan- 
dards, unless, indeed, the possibility of an ethical 
method of writing history be denied altogether. His- 
tory, he said, " is a voice forever sounding across 
the centuries the laws of right and wrong. . . . 
Justice and truth alone endure and live. Injustice 
and falsehood may be long-lived, but doomsday comes 
at last to them, in French revolutions and other ter- 
rible ways." And he remarks in another passage 
that " the most perfect English history which exists 
is to be found in the historical plays of Shakespeare. 
. . Shakespeare's object was to exhibit as faith- 
fully as he could the exact character of the great 
actors in the national drama the circumstances 
which surround them, and the motives, internal and 
external, by which they were influenced. To know 
this is to know all. . . . No such directness of 
insight, no such breadth of sympathy, has since been 
applied to the writing of English history." Now 
Professor Freeman, for example, did not write his- 
tory upon this theory, and consequently his stric- 
tures altogether miss the essential point at issue. 
Time, which sets most matters right, will justify 
Professor Froude's method by preserving his mem- 
ory and by sparing his books from oblivion. They 
will remain, we doubt not, as lasting monuments of 
our literature, and minister not only to the delight 
but also to the instruction (in the higher sense) of 
generations yet unborn. 

BIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY. 

James Anthony Froude was born on the 23d of April 
(Shakespeare's birthday), 1818, at Totnes, in Devon- 
shire. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where 
he took his degree in 1840. In 1842 he took the Chan- 
cellor's prize for an essay on " The Influence of the Sci- 
ence of Political Economy on the Moral and Social 
Welfare of the Nation," and in the same year became 
a fellow of Exeter College. While a student he had 
come under the influence of the Tractarians, and deter- 
mined to follow the clerical life. He received deacon's 
orders in 1844, but during the years immediately fol- 
lowing his ideas became so modified that he found it 
impossible to remain identified with a church that was 
wedded to what he called the "Hebrew mythology." 
His " Nemesis of Faith " (1848) gave expression to his 
changed views and marked his separation from the cler- 
ical calling. He says of this step: "I found myself 
unfitted for a clergyman's position and I abandoned it. 
I did not leave the church. I withdrew into the posi- 
tion of a lay member, in which I have ever since re- 
mained. I gave up my fellowship and I gave up my 
profession with the loss of my existing means of main- 
tenance, and with the sacrifice of my future prospects." 
The next year (1849) marked the beginning of his ac- 
quaintance with Carlyle. During the next few years, 
he contributed much to the reviews, and began the 



studies for his famous " History of England from the 
Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Armada." The 
first volumes of this work appeared in 1856, the last in 
1869. In the latter year he was chosen Rector of St. 
Andrews, and received an LL.D. from that university. 
In 1872 he made a visit to the United States, and lec- 
tured upon the Irish question. These lectures formed 
the basis of " The English in Ireland in the Eighteenth 
Century" (1871-1874). In 1874, he was sent to Cape 
Colony to investigate the Kaffir insurrection. He also 
travelled extensively among the English colonies, from 
Australia to the West Indies. " Oceana " (1886) and 
" The English in the West Indies " (1888) contained 
the fruits of his many observations of Greater England. 
In 1892 he was appointed by Lord Salisbury as Regius 
Professor of History at Oxford, to succeed his old-time 
combatant, Professor Freeman. His " Short Studies on 
Great Subjects " were collected into volumes at various 
dates, the first series appearing in 1867. His sketch 
of "Julius Caesar " appeared in 1876. He edited Car- 
lyle's "Reminiscences" in 1881, and published the bi- 
ography and letters of Carlyle in 1882 and 1884. He 
also edited the " Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh 
Carlyle." His other publications include the " Bunyan " 
in the " English Men of Letters " series, " Reminis- 
cences of an Irish Journey in 1849," "The Two Chiefs 
of Dunboy," an historical romance of the last century 
(1889), a life of Lord Beaconsfield (1890), "The Di- 
vorce of Catherine of Aragon " (1892), " The Spanish 
Story of the Armada, and Other Essays" (1892), and, 
this very year of his death, a volume of Oxford lectures 
on " The Life and Letters of Erasmus." He died on 
the morning of October 20, after a protracted period of 
illness. 



ENGLISH TRIBUTES TO HOLMES. 

The English literary press is substantially unani- 
mous in just appreciation of the late Dr. Holmes, 
and the tone of its comment is well illustrated by 
the following selection of extracts. The first is from 
" The Saturday Review." 

" The copious and generous tributes which have been 
paid by the English press to the memory of Dr. Holmes 
would greatly have gratified that genial autocrat. There 
are Americans who really desire to be neglected by En- 
gland, and there are a great many more who are fond 
of pretending to desire it. Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes 
was none of these. While preserving that preference 
for the institutions of his own country to which every 
reasonable man clings, no one was more conscious than 
he of the prestige and weight of the Old World, and no 
one, within the bounds of self-respect, was more anxious 
to come within its orbit. Dr. Holmes was by the very 
constitution of his mind and the nature of his talent a 
conservative. ' It is a great happiness,' he says some- 
where, ' to have been born in an old house haunted by 
recollections ' ; and to him Europe and its literature, and 
its philosophy, were venerable and stately mansions in 
which, if he was not actually born, he still had been a 
constant and a happy lodger. He who would search for 
the wild aboriginal American poet, with a mind arrayed 
in boots and buckskin, had never any chance of finding 
him in Beacon Street, Boston. What he found there 
was a little, brilliant old gentleman, with something of 
Horace Walpole about him and something of Chaulieu, a

touch of Gay, a suspicion of Rogers, a hint of the 
abbe's who had known Voltaire, an old gentleman who 
appeared to have stepped straight out of the eighteenth 
century, and to be trying by the exercise of consummate 
tact and intelligence, to seem to belong to the nineteenth. 
An exquisite old-fashioned sense of fitness marked all 
that Dr. Holmes excelled in. ... We shall now learn 
more about him than needs be told, and there will cer- 
tainly be a reaction against his present excess of celeb- 
rity. But this also will pass, and Oliver Wendell 
Holmes will live in the literary history of the nineteenth 
century as a fellow of infinite jest, who knew mankind 
and the human heart, who was the enemy of all bombast, 
and bigotry, and assumption, and who exercised in what 
was sometimes a very crude and fanatical generation an 
influence unwaveringly on the side of urbanity and 
reason." 

" The Academy " makes the following remarks, 
among others in similar strain : 

" An attempt not particularly happy has been 
made to ' place ' Dr. Holmes by linking his genius with 
that of Charles Lamb. The resemblance between them, 
if any, is quite superficial, but their difference is marked. 
As Mr. George William Curtis said of Dr. Holmes's 
early poems, so we might say of Lamb's most charac- 
teristic work: 'The high spirits of a frolicsome fancy 
effervesce and sparkle '; but, while Lamb was essentially 
whimsical and often capricious, Dr. Holmes, even in his 
most daring moods, was wary. He was exceedingly 
sensitive on the subject of his good breeding, and felt 
he could not afford to forget his manners. If bold, he 
was not too bold; judicious always, without being false. 
He was much bound by social usage a Boston man, 
having the fear of eminently respectable Boston always 
before his eyes and it would have horrified him to have 
been responsible for those little outrages on the conven- 
tionalities in which Lamb took an exquisite delight. 
Moreover, Lamb's taste was more literary than that of 
Dr. Holmes, and not in the least scientific ; and his touch, 
like Irving's, was more delicate. It is, in truth, difficult 
to classify Dr. Holmes at all. He was somewhat of a 
man apart. He followed no model, and has had no suc- 
cessful imitators." 

And "The Athenaeum" thus passes restrained 
and thoughtful judgment : 

" When the time shall come for assigning their proper 
place in literature to the writings of Dr. Holmes, we 
think it probable that neither his lively verse nor genial 
essays will be placed in the front rank. His artistic 
talent is chiefly displayed in the small works wherein 
the lives of his friends Motley and Emerson are depicted. 
He tells the story of both in a condensed and effective 
fashion. He enables the reader to understand them 
within the compass of a few pages. His countrymen 
should study both works when they contemplate writing 
a biography. He had the skill to select and dwell upon 
the important points, and the self-command to suffer 
the others to remain in the background. More than one 
New Englander of note who is entombed in a heavy bi- 
ography would have defied oblivion if Dr. Holmes had 
been entrusted with writing his life. 

" The closing years of Dr. Holmes were saddened by 
friend after friend dropping off and by the terrible mal- 
ady of asthma. Yet he retained his sweet temper to 
the end, and his pen was never idle. There is no trace 
of senility in the last verses or prose which he wrote, 
and the perfect preservation of his faculties is quite as 



remarkable as the prolongation of his life. He has left 
none behind him in America who can wield the pen with 
greater witchery. He was as little of a public speaker 
as his friend Longfellow; indeed, a slight physical im- 
pediment marred his utterance. But a cheerier com- 
panion could not be found; a man of larger sympathies 
and wider cultivation has never adorned New England; 
and his death is not mourned more sincerely there than 
in the old Motherland which in his heart he loved." 



"MERE LITERATURE." 

Is there any justification for the phrase "mere 
literature " which one often hears nowadays ? There 
is no doubt a serious sneer in it, as Professor 
Wilson, in a recent " Atlantic " essay, avers ; but I 
think the sneer is not aimed so much at literature 
in itself as at certain phases of literature. Mr. 
Lowell has recently been quoted as saying that 
" mere scholarship is as useless as the collecting of 
old postage stamps " ; yet at vital scholarship 
scholarship that is wielded as a weapon, and that 
results in power Lowell would be the last man to 
sneer. In all time's of high literary culture and crit- 
icism, a great deal is produced that may well be called 
mere literature the result of assiduous training 
and stimulation of the literary faculties, just as a 
great deal of art is produced that may be called 
mere art. Literature that is the result of the fric- 
tion upon the mind of other literatures, is usually 
mere literature. That which is the result of the 
contact of the mind with reality, is of another order. 

Or we may say " mere literature " as we say " mere 
gentleman." Now gentlemanly qualities refine- 
ment, good breeding, etc. are not to be sneered 
at unless they stand alone, with no man behind them ; 
and literary qualities style, learning, fancy, etc. 
are not to be sneered at unless they stand alone, 
which is not infrequently the case. We would not 
apply the phrase " mere gentleman " to Washing- 
ton, or Lincoln, or Wellington, though these men 
may have been the most thorough of gentlemen ; 
neither would we apply the phrase " mere litera- 
ture " to the works of Bacon, or Shakespeare, or Car- 
lyle, or Dante, or Plato. The Bible is literature, 
but it is not mere literature. We apply the latter 
term to writings that have little to recommend them 
but their technical and artistic excellence, like the 
mass of current poetry and fiction. The men who 
have nothing to say and say it extremely well pro- 
duce mere literature. 

Both England and France have at the present 
time many excellent writers, men who possess every 
grace of style and charm of expression, who still 
give us only a momentary pleasure. They do not 
move us, they do not lay strong hands upon us, their 
works do not take hold of any great reality ; they 
produce mere literature. Literary seriousness, lit- 
erary earnestness, cannot atone for a want of manly 
seriousness and earnestness. A sensitive artistic 
conscience cannot make us content with a dull or 



254 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



obtuse moral conscience. The literary worker is 
to confront reality in just as serious a mood as does 
the man of science, if he hopes to produce anything 
that rises above mere literature. The picnickers, the 
excursionists, the flower gatherers of literature do 
not produce lasting works. The seriousness of 
Hawthorne was much more than a literary serious- 
ness ; the emotion of Whittier at his best is funda- 
mental and human. 

There is a passage in Amiel's Journal that well 
expresses the distinction I am aiming at. " I have 
been thinking a great deal of Victor Cherbuliez," 
he says, under date of December 4, 1876. " Perhaps 
his novels make up the most disputable part of his 
work, they are so much wanting in simplicity, 
feeling, reality. And yet what knowledge, style, 
wit, and subtlety, how much thought everywhere, 
and what mastery of language ! He astonishes one ; 
I cannot but admire-him. Cherbuliez's mind is of 
immense range, clear-sighted, keen, full of resources ; 
he is an Alexandrian exquisite, substituting for the 
feeling which makes men earnest the irony which 
leaves them free. Pascal would say of him, ' He 
has never risen from the order oJE thought to the 
order of charity.' But we must not be ungrateful. 
A Lucian is not worth an Augustine, but still he is 
a Lucian. . . . The positive element in Victor 
Cherbuliez's work is beauty, not goodness, nor moral 
or religious life." 

The positive element in the enduring works is 
always something more than the beautiful ; it is the 
true, the vital, the real, as well. The beautiful is 
there, but the not-beautiful is there also. The world 
is held together, life is nourished and made strong, 
and power begotten, by the neutral or negatively 
beautiful. Works are everywhere produced that 
are artistically serious, but morally trifling and in- 
sincere ; faultless in form, but tame and barren 
in spirit. We could not say this of the works of 
Froude or Ruskin, Huxley or Tyndall ; we cannot 
say it of the works of Matthew Arnold, because he 
had a higher purpose than to produce mere literary 
effects ; but we can say it of most of the produc- 
tions of the younger British essayists and poets. In 
Swinburne, for instance, there is a mere lust of ver- 
bal forms and rhythmic lilt. In reading his poems, 
I soon find myself fairly gasping for breath ; I seem 
to be trying to breathe in a vacuum an effect 
which one does not experience at all in reading 
Tennyson, or Browning, or Arnold. One is apt to 
have serious qualms in reading the prose of Walter 
Pater, the lust of mere style so pervades his work. 
Faultless workmanship, one says ; and yet the best 
qualities of style freshness, naturalness, simplicity 
are not here. What in Victor Hugo goes far 
towards atoning for all his sins against art, against 
sanity and proportion, are his terrible moral earnest- 
ness and psychic power. Whatever we may think of 
his work, we are not likely to call it " mere litera- 
ture." That masterly ubiquitous sporting and toy- 
ing with the elements of life which we find in Shake- 



speare we shall probably never again see in letters. 
The stress and burden of later times do not favor 
it. The great soul is now too earnest, too self-con- 
scious ; life is too serious. Only light men now 
essay it. Art for art's sake is now the stamp of 
third or fourth rate men. With so much criticism, 
so much knowledge, so much science, another Shake- 
speare is impossible. Renan says : " In order to estab- 
lish those literary authorities called classic, something 
especially healthy and solid is necessary. Common 
household bread is of more value here than pastry." 
There can be little doubt that our best literary 
workers are intent upon producing something anal- 
agous to pastry, or even confectionery, something 
fine, complex, highly seasoned, that tickles the 
taste. It is always in order to urge a return to the 
simple and serious, a return to nature, to works 
that have the wholesome and sustaining qualities of 
natural products, grain, fruits, nuts, air, water.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE "ROYAL ROAD" TO LEARNING. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of October 1 my booklet on " Ethics 
and the New Education " is approved as emphasizing 
the significance of pain as a necessary factor of all true 
spiritual growth and refinement. If I may have your 
permission, I would be glad to cry a further note on the 
same theme through the speaking-tube of THE DIAL. 

The note is this: Growth is possible only through 
reasonable exercise of power. But mind as an indivis- 
ible unit of energy still presents in its individual char- 
acter two radically distinct modes. The one of these 
modes is the sensuous; the other, the reflective. In its 
sensuous mode, mind is appealed to by (or rather through) 
physical " facts," pictorial forms. In its reflective mode, 
mind is exercised in the discovery and estimate of the 
relations of " fact " to " fact," and in the tracing of such 
relations to the ultimate principles of which they are 
only special phases. No mind can be truly educated 
save through the constant interplay of these two thor- 
oughly complementary modes. 

With this distinction clearly in view, it is easy to 
see that as a rule the cry to the effect that education 
must be " made easy," and that the work of the school- 
room must be made " interesting," practically amounts 
to nothing more than a demand for endless multiplica- 
tion of illustrative matter that is, matter that appeals 
directly to the sensuous aspect of consciousness. It is 
ordinarily synonymous with the catch-phrase, " Facts 
first and theory after "; and this practically is much the 
same as " facts " always and " theory " never. Though 
what a " fact " is, apart from a theory, might easily 
prove an embarrassing question. 

Nevertheless, natural-science teaching, with its bril- 
liant experiments and its astonishing array of speci- 
mens, has led irresistibly in the direction of multiplying 
" illustrations," until too often that which was to be 
illustrated has been fairly lost from view. And the 
work has proved so intensely " interesting " that the 
conspicuously " successful " teacher has for the most 
part gone victoriously forward with the absolutely inno-

cent assurance that lie has at last actually discovered 
the true Royal Road in which Learning is once for all 
made easy, and that all painful struggle in the educa- 
tional field must henceforth prove an inexcusable an- 
achronism. How far this brilliant superficiality has ex- 
tended, few seem as yet to be clearly aware. In truth, 
the whole educational world is to-day dealing largely 
in " watered stock," and the next generation must inev- 
itably pay the penalty in serious "shrinkage of values." 

Nor is this by any means confined to work done in 
the natural sciences. So convincingly brilliant have been 
the results in this field that the now rapidly reviving in- 
terest in the science of mind, both on the side of Psy- 
chology and on the side of ethics, seems destined, for 
a while at least, to come under the same spell. Nerve- 
ends, nerve-fibre, ganglia, white matter and gray mat- 
ter, cerebral convolutions, mapping the cerebral cortex 
how nearly tangible the mind is becoming ! Shall we 
not be able presently to photograph an emotion, to catch 
the color of a thought, to touch a motive with the tips 
of our fingers ? How much more real the " mind " would 
seem to " us " if only " we " could roll " it " about on 
the palm of " our " hand ! And then there is Hypnotism 
wonderful, splendidly mysterious Hypnotism ! Why, 
we are just awaking to the really "interesting " aspects 
of the science of mind ! And " interesting " all this un- 
questionably is interesting to consciousness in its sen- 
suous mode first of all. It is, indeed, interesting also 
to consciousness in its reflective mode, because mind re- 
quires a form through which to express itself, through 
which to unfold itself. Nevertheless, interesting though 
this psychological aspect of physiology may be, import- 
ant though it may be that the student of psychology 
should note the special parts of the one whole organ 
through which the one whole mind gives expression to 
the various phases of its one continuous whole activity 
interesting and important though all this may be in 
its place, even to the reflective aspect of consciousness, 
it is still a fatal mistake to suppose it to constitute psy- 
chology in any proper sense of the term. Physiological 
Psychology ? Strange combination of terms ! No nerve- 
change, however subtle, can constitute any phase of con- 
sciousness properly speaking. At most such nerve-change 
is only a precondition of one or another specialized mode 
of consciousness. 

Meanwhile, the " method of the natural sciences " is 
here seized upon, with more or less unreflecting zeal, as 
being already proven a " successful " method, and is 
now confidently applied in a field where it cannot but 
prove the more disastrous the less carefully the workers 
in this field note the distinction between mind as agent 
and body as instrument or organ. Such distinction, ade- 
quately made and maintained, necessarily implies ma- 
turity of mind in its reflective mode. With this mode 
imperfectly developed, it is but inevitable that the 
" facts " of the nervous system, so unequivocally there 
to the sensuous consciousness, should seem to constitute 
the whole reality of man, and that materialism should 
appear as furnishing the only rational account of life 
and " mind." 

An antidote to all this is the crying need of the time. 
Or if not yet vocal, it must soon become vocal. We have 
been led widely astray by the luring phantom of a Royal 
Road to Learning. No such road exists save the truly 
kingly road of work. And work, like chastisement, is for 
the present not "joyous but grievous"; though in the 
end it is the one way that has in it any real promise of 
" eternal life." Doubtless this subordination of the sen- 



suous aspect of consciousness, in the form of mere pres- 
ent enjoyment, to the reflective aspect of consciousness 
in the form of steadfast adherence to an infinitely out- 
reaching ideal purpose, is the way of " crucifying the 
flesh"; and that must always be something altogether 
frightful and even insane to the man " in his senses " ; 
but also it must ever prove to be something necessary 
and desirable and wholly sane to the man " in his right 
reason." 

Whatever may be said, then, respecting my " Sylla- 
bus of Ethics " that will live if it deserves to live, and 
die if it deserves to die, whatever friendly or unfriendly 
critics may say of it I still insist that for the purposes 
of the class-room the first requisite for a text-book is, 
not that it shall be " interesting " to or easily manage- 
able by the student, but that it shall present in as con- 
cise and rigidly logical form as possible a really ade- 
quate outline of the subject. It is an utter prostitution 
of educational appliances to turn the school into an in- 
formation-mill or a variety-show. The true school is a 
medium the most efficient of all media for the awak- 
ening of youth to a clear, adequate, genuinely reflective 
consciousness of the fundamental principles constituting 
the inner substance of the world both as mind and as 
" matter." It is for the living teacher to stimulate the 
pupil to such living interest in the theme that he comes 
to comprehend experiment and text-book alike in their 
proper significance as mere instruments devised solely 
for his own self-development. 

And, after all, precise technical language, so far from 
being the language of obscurity, is just that medium 
which realizes the very perfection of clearness. It is 
simply the exact form of exact thought, and there is in 
it nothing dreadful certainly nothing more so for ethics 
than for, say, chemistry or electricity. Neither is it less 
indispensable in the one science than in the other. And 
if ethics is really to be taken seriously as seriously, 
for instance, as biology then whatever of technical 
language is necessary to the full and clear expression of 
the complex thought involved must frankly be faced 
and mastered. Education, let us repeat, is not merely, 
nor even chiefly, a matter of pleasure. It is, above all, 
a process of self-realization. Hence, what precisely the 
character of the education is to be is in sober truth a 
matter of mental, of spiritual, life and death. When 
dilettantism shall have once gained permanent posses- 
sion of the school-room, the end of the world will be near 
at hand. WILLIAM M. BRYANT.

In your issue of October 1, page 199, why do you ad- 
versely criticise the historian Mr. John Fiske in the fol- 
lowing particular: "We regret to see that Mr. Fiske 
gives countenance to the San Francisco Vigilants by say- 
ing: 'Honest citizens were obliged to organize vigilance 
committees to deal quickly and sharply with criminals.' "

in the particular stated? Does he think Mr. Fiske 
above criticism, or does he expect us to approve of

AN AMERICAN STAGE FAVORITE. * 



Mr. Winter's title, " The Life and Art of 
Joseph Jefferson," is a little misleading, since 
it covers, strictly speaking, only about half the 
volume. The remaining space is devoted to 
the other Thespian members of the Jefferson 
family Thomas (1728-1807), Joseph (1774- 
1832), Elizabeth (1810-90), Joseph (1804- 
42), and Charles Burke (1822-54), to each 
of whom a separate chapter is given. The Me- 
moir is a revision, " rectified, augmented, re- 
arranged, and in part re-written," of Mr. Win- 
ter's " The Jeffersons," published in 1881, and 
it is therefore virtually a new work. In its 
present shape it forms a collection of American 
stage anecdotes and memorabilia second only 
to Mr. Hutton's ; while its delightful style and 
delicate appreciations of the player's and the 
playwright's art lend it a charm and value dis- 
tinctively its own. The sketch of the present 
Jefferson, though rather desultory in form, is 
graphic and warmly sympathetic, and it con- 
veys a clear impression of Mr. Jefferson's tal- 
ent and personality. Mr. Winter is a good 
narrator, and he is of the order of critics who, 
like Lamb and Hazlitt, do us the substantial 
service of bringing to light, and making us feel, 
the finer and more recondite beauties that es- 
cape the untrained and the heedless eye. Few 
will read the chapters in which Mr. Jefferson's 
leading impersonations are severally reviewed 
without wishing to again see that finished actor 
on the stage, in order to appreciate and enjoy 
his art more fully in the light of Mr. Winter's 
exposition. 

Joseph Jefferson, of " Rip Van Winkle " 
fame, was born at Philadelphia, February 20, 
1829. Both of his parents were actors, and 
the boy made his own debut in a very comical 
way at the age of four, when he was carried 
upon the stage by James D. Rice, the founder 
of negro minstrelsy, and originator of the im- 
mortal " Jim Crow." 

" The comedian, on a benefit occasion, introduced the 
child, blackened and dressed like himself, into the per- 
formance of Jim Crow. Little Joe was taken upon the 
scene in a bag, and emptied from it, with the couplet, 

' Ladies and gentlemen, I 'd have you for to know 
I've got a little darkey here to jump Jim Crow.' 
A witness of that scene says that the boy promptly as- 
sumed the attitude of Jim Crow Rice, and sang and

Winter, author of " The Life and Art of Edwin Booth." Il-

danced in imitation of his sable companion, and was a 
miniature likeness of that grotesque person." 

In 1837, Jefferson, then a boy of eight, ap- 
peared at the Franklin Theatre, New York, 
where he did a broadsword-combat with a Mas- 
ter Titus after the manner of the brothers 
Crummies, doubtless ; and at the close of the 
season the family left for the far West. There 
for twelve years they led the life of the stroll- 
ing player, roaming from town to town in ox- 
carts, flatboats, etc., and often enough on foot 
(there were no smoothly-gravelled ties in those 
days, be it remembered, to ease the steps of 
the crushed tragedian), and playing at times 
in barns and hotel dining-rooms, with scenery 
not much more elaborate than Quince the car- 
penter's. At that date the term " barn-storm- 
ing " had a very literal sound and was no mere 
playful metaphor for a tour in the provinces. 
Once the Jefferson company, adrift in a region 
far from any settlement, lighted on an unusually 
spacious barn owned by an unusually benevo- 
lent-looking farmer, and they resolved forth- 
with to give a performance. 

" There was a cordial response. The farmers and 
their wives and children, from far and near, came to 
see the play. The receipts were twenty dollars, and 
that treasure was viewed as a godsend by the poor 
players, who saw in it the means of food, and of a ride 
to the next town. But no adequate allowance had been 
made for the frugality of the genial owner of the barn. 
' I guess that pays my bill,' he said, as he put the money 
into his pocket; and so the venture was settled, and the 
rueful comedians walked away." 

Amid scenes of this kind, says the author, 
young Jefferson learned to be an actor ; and, 
except barely three months at school which he 
once enjoyed, that was the only kind of train- 
ing he ever received. 

" In Mexico, when the war occurred, in 1846, he was 
among the followers of the American army, and gave 
performances in tents. He saw General Taylor on the 
banks of the Rio Grande; he heard the thunder of the 
guns at Palo Alto; he stood beside the tent in which 
the gallant Major Ringgold lay dying; he witnessed 
the bombardment of Matamoras, and, two nights after 
the capture of that city, he acted in its Spanish theatre." 

Jefferson returned to New York in 1849, 
and filled successive engagements at Chanf rau's 
New National Theatre, at Mitchell's Olympic, 
Brougham's Lyceum, Niblo's Garden, and, 
after a Southern tour and a non-professional 
trip to Europe, at Laura Keene's new play- 
house on Broadway, where, in 1857, he scored 
a hit as " Dr. Pangloss," making the charac- 
ter, says Mr. Winter, exceedingly comical, yet 
" human, natural, probable, real, and even es- 
tablishing him in a kindly regard." While at

this theatre an incident occurred which shows 
Jefferson in an agreeable light. One of the 
troupe, Blake a good actor, but with a ten- 
dency to coarseness resenting Jefferson's 
habit of expunging indelicate lines from the 
old comedies, ridiculed him as " the Sunday- 
school comedian." 

" There was a scene in the green-room and Blake was 
discomfited. ' You take an unfair and unmanly advan- 
tage of people,' said Jefferson, ' when you force them 
to listen to your coarseness. They are, for the time, 
imprisoned, and have no choice but to hear and see your 
ill-breeding. You have no better right to be offensive 
on the stage than in the drawing-room.'" 

The production, on October 18, 1858, of 
" Our American Cousin " marked the decisive 
turn of the tide in Jefferson's professional for- 
tunes. He acted " Asa Trenchard," and he was 
famous. 

" Seldom has an actor found a medium for the ex- 
pression of his spirit so ample and so congenial as that 
part proved to be for Jefferson. Rustic grace, simple 
manliness, unconscious drollery, and unaffected pathos, 
expressed with artistic control, and in an atmosphere of 
repose, could not have been more truthfully and beau- 
tifully combined." 

It was then also that Sothern his future 
greatness thrust upon him, as it were, in the 
trivial, reluctantly-accepted part of " Lord Dun- 
dreary " laid the foundation of his fame and 
fortune. " Our American Cousin " ran for 
one hundred and forty consecutive nights a 
prodigious run at that time, and it proved 
the success of the year and of the theatre. 

In 1861 Jefferson sailed for Australia, where 
he remained four years, winning golden opin- 
ions and hosts of friends by his acting of " Asa 
Trenchard," "Caleb Plummer," "Bob Bri- 
erly," and other characters. His performance 
of "Bob Brierly" (in "The Ticket-of-leave 
Man ") on one occasion at Hobart Town drew 
an audience including over six hundred ticket- 
of-leave men ; and, " though at first they re- 
garded him with looks of implacable ferocity, 
they ended by giving him their hearts, in a 
hurricane of acclamation." 

After leaving Australia, Jefferson spent a lit- 
tle time in South America and at Panama, and 
sailed thence for England. Arriving at Lon- 
don he commissioned Boucicault to recast and 
rewrite the old play of " Rip Van Winkle " for 
production in the English capital. There were 
already several stage versions of Irving's story, 
and Jefferson had no less than seven predeces- 
sors in the part with which his name is now 
inseparably linked. The first recorded drama- 
tization of " Rip Van Winkle " was produced 



at Albany, May 26, 1828, and the first " Rip " 
was Thomas Flynn (1804-49). The second 
" Rip," Charles B. Parsons, played at Cincin- 
nati in 1828-29, using a version bought in New 
York by the manager, N. M. Ludlow. Still 
another version, probably by an English dra- 
matist named Kerr, was presented at Phila- 
delphia, October 30, 1829, with William Chap- 
man in the leading role ; and in 1830 James 
H. Hackett, the famous " Falstaff," and Jef- 
ferson's ablest predecessor, produced the play 
in New York, using a version written probably 
by himself. Hackett went to England in 1832, 
and had a new draft of the piece made by Ber- 
nard Bayle, in which he appeared in London, 
and which he continued to present for several 
years after his return to America. Charles 
Burke, Jefferson's half-brother, made a play for 
himself on the subject in 1849, and amended 
and improved it in 1850 ; and this was the 
piece put in Boucicault's hands for recasting 
in 1865. Boucicault finished the revision in a 
week, but had no faith in the practical success 
of his work, telling Jefferson that it could not 
possibly hold the stage for more than a month. 
Many of the new features were due to Jeffer- 
son, particularly the happy suggestion that 
the spectres, in the midnight encounter on the 
mountain, should maintain an awful silence, 
and that only the bewildered man should speak. 
Boucicault contributed the scheme of " Gretch- 
en's " second marriage ; and to him also is due 
the powerful climax of the third act, "Meenie's" 
recognition of her father a touch suggested 
by the recognition of " Cordelia " in " King 
Lear." With this new version Jefferson sought 
the favor of the London public, on September 
4, 1865 ; and his success was great enough to 
herald his future renown. A laughable inci- 
dent preceded the first performance. On the 
approach of the fateful hour, Jefferson, nervous 
and apprehensive, and as absent-minded as 
" Dominie Sampson," retired to his room in 
Regent Street, and abstractedly proceeded to 
" make up " for the third act. 

" The window-curtains happened to be raised, and the 
room was brightly lighted, so that the view from with- 
out was unobscured. Not many minutes passed before 
it began to be utilized, and a London crowd is quick 
to assemble. Inside, the absorbed comedian uncon- 
cernedly went on acting Rip Van Winkle: outside, the 
curious multitude, thinking him a comic lunatic, thronged 
the street till it became impassable. The police fought 
their way to the spot. The landlady was finally alarmed ; 
and the astonished actor, brought back to the world by 
the clamor at his door, inquiring if he were ill, at length 
comprehended the situation, and suspended his re- 
hearsal."

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



Jefferson left England July 30, 1866. and 
on September 3 he appeared at the Olympic 
Theatre, New York. His performance of " Rip " 
took the house by storm ; and we need trace 
no further the history of a part that for nearly 
thirty years has held perhaps the chief place 
in the hearts of American play-goers. To can- 
cel from our stage memories the masterful fig- 
ure of Joseph Jefferson as " Rip Van Winkle " 
would leave a hiatus indeed. 

On September 13, 1880, Mr. Jefferson pro- 
duced " The Rivals " at the Arch Street Thea- 
tre, Philadelphia, and made a pronounced hit 
as " Bob Acres," a part in which he had 
shone in his youth, and which he revived prob- 
ably as the most effective answer to the charge 
that he was a one-part actor. Apropos of this 
widely erroneous impression, Mr. Winter tells 
a story of Charles Matthews. 

" ' I am glad to see you making your fortune,' he said, 
' but I do n't like to see you doing it with one part and 
a carpet-bag.' . . . The comment of Matthews, how- 
ever, was meant to glance at the one-part policy; and 
Jefferson's reply to that ebullition was alike significant 
and good-humored. ' It is perhaps better,' he said, ' to 
play one part in different ways than to play many parts 
all in one way.' That sentence explains his artistic vic- 
tory." 

Since 1880, the story of Mr. Jefferson's pro- 
fessional life is mainly the record of his pleas- 
ant wanderings with "Rip," "Acres," and "Dr. 
Pangloss." Living mostly at home, and act- 
ing but a part of each season, he has devoted 
himself to painting an art in which he has 
achieved some substantial success. 

" Several of his works have been exhibited. Some 
of them have been circulated in etchings. The charm 
of his pictures, like that of his acting, is tenderness of 
feeling, combined with a touch of mystery, an imagin- 
ative quality, kindred with the freedom and the wild- 
ness that are seen in the paintings of Corot." 

Following the biographical essay, and essen- 
tially part of it, are four excellent chapters, de- 
scriptive and critical of Mr. Jefferson's leading 
characters. In this special field Mr. Winter 
is at his best. He conjures back for us with a 
few vivid touches the familiar figures the joy- 
ous, drunken, wholly disreputable and wholly 
lovable " Rip "; the debonair " Golightly "; the 
vaporing " Acres "; and, to our thinking best of 
all, quaint old " Caleb " with his sackcloth coat 
and his quavering song about the Sparkling 
Bowl. Not to have seen Joseph Jefferson as 
" Caleb Plummer " is to have missed perhaps 
the best exemplification on the modern stage of 
the ability of the actor to achieve humor not 
humor in the popular sense, but that subtle 
blending of things merry and things sad which 



is at once the rarest of arts and the commonest 
of facts. It will certainly be a satisfaction to 
Mr. Jefferson to have found so sympathetic a 
biographer and so sound and eloquent a critic 
as Mr. Winter. 

As already intimated, the book is rich in the 
materials of theatrical history old play-bills, 
casts, press-notices, press-extracts, and the va- 
rious odds and ends of forgotten stage fact and 
anecdote. There are a number of illustrations, 
including portraits of Mr. Jefferson in favorite 
roles. E. G. J. 



THE HEAL, JAP AX OF OLD.* 



A year or so ago, Henry Norman, a London 
newspaper man, published a book entitled "The 
Real Japan," which gave a remarkably thor- 
ough and accurate study of contemporary New 
Japan. Within the past few years others have 
been trying to penetrate beneath the surface, 
and to find out the secrets and mysteries of the 
inner life of the Japanese. Sir Edwin Arnold 
found many beauties, but did not get far below 
the surface. Percival Lowell carried his in- 
vestigations yet farther, and ascertained many 
interesting motives of life among the Japanese. 
But it has been left for Lafcadio Hearn to 
find " the hidden springs of their life " as no 
other foreigner has been able to see them ; and 
to describe the real Japan as it has been un- 
affected by Occidental influences. 

Mr. Hearn had unusual opportunities for his 
work. He tried to adopt native manners and 
customs ; was " wonderfully sensitive to Japan- 
ese influences," and thus came into perfect sym- 
pathy with all "things Japanese." His home was 
in Matsue, chief city of Izumo, " the Province 
of the Gods," where divinity first condescended 
from heaven to earth, or (as iconoclastic his- 
torical critics express it) where emigrants from 
Korea landed in Japan. His two volumes 
are modestly entitled : they are more than 
" glimpses " they are long searching exam- 
inations, microscopical investigations, careful 
studies. They give the minute facts and fan- 
cies of Japanese life for the philosopher to use 
in ascertaining the meaning of that life. 

Mr. Hearn was the first European to enter 
the inner shrine of the Kitzuki temple, the old- 
est Shinto temple in Japan. " To see Kitzuki 
is to see the living centre of Shinto and to feel 
the life-pulse of the ancient faith." What 
Shinto is, with " no philosophy, no code of

ethics, no metaphysics," is still a difficult ques- 
tion to answer. Mr. Hearn thinks that the 
explanation is to be sought " not in books, nor 
in rites, nor in commandments, but in the 
national heart, of which it is the highest emo- 
tional expression." His own explanation is as 
follows : 

" Shinto signifies character in the highest sense, 
courage, courtesy, honor, and, above all things, loyalty. 
The spirit of Shinto is the spirit of filial piety, the zest 
of duty, the readiness to surrender life for a principle 
without a thought of wherefore. It is the docility of 
the child; it is the sweetness of the Japanese woman. 
... It is religion, but religion transformed into he- 
reditary moral impulse, religion transmuted into eth- 
ical instinct. It is the whole emotional life of the race, 
the Soul of Japan." 

It is readily noticeable that the meaning of 
Yamato-damashii (" the Japanese spirit ") is 
practically the sdlme as the meaning of the 
Latin word pietas. 

The personal experiences of Mr. Hearn while 
he was holding the position of teacher of En- 
glish in the Middle School and the Normal 
School at Matsue are very interesting. He 
evidently explored with great care the country 
roundabout. He went to Kaka, where it is for- 
bidden to go if there is wind enough " to move 
three hairs," and examined the Cave of the 
Children's Ghosts ; to Mionoseki, the god of 
which hates hen's eggs, hens and chickens, and 
*' the cock above all living creatures "; to Hi- 
nomisaki, where " no European has ever been," 
and where is a far-famed double temple of the 
Sun-Goddess ; to Oki, where " not even a mis- 
sionary had ever been," and where he found 
*' fine strong men and vigorous women " more 
numerous than on the mainland ; and to several 
out-of-the-way places. 

The two volumes are rich in folk-lore, le- 
gends, superstitions, proverbs, and poems. 
They tell of the magical and beautiful writing 
of Kobo Daishi, the inventor of the Japanese 
syllabary ; of the jolly worship of Jizo, the 
sweet-faced God of Children ; of the wonderful 
sights of Enoshima ; of the market at which 
are purchased the articles used in the Feast of 
Lanterns in honor of the dead, and the weird 
dance of that festival ; of the pathetic custom 
of double suicide on the part of two lovers, sep- 
arated in life, but united in death ; of the un- 
canny foxes and badgers, and the worship of 
Inari Sama, the rice-god ; and of many other 
festivals, manners, and customs, too numerous 
to mention. 

" But these strange beliefs are swiftly passing away. 
Year by year more shrines of Inari crumble down, never 
to be rebuilt. Year by year the statuaries make fewer 



images of foxes. Year by year fewer victims of fox- 
possession are taken to the hospitals to be treated ac- 
cording to the best scientific methods by Japanese phy- 
sicians who speak German. The cause is not to be 
found in the decadence of the old faiths; a superstition 
outlives a religion. Much less is it to be sought for in 
the efforts of proselytizing missionaries from the West 
most of whom profess an earnest belief in devils. It 
is purely educational. The omnipotent enemy of super- 
stition is the public school. . . . The little hands that 
break the Fox-god's nose in mischievous play can also 
write essays upon the evolution of plants and about the 
geology of Izumo. There is no place for ghostly foxes 
in the beautiful nature-world revealed by new studies 
to the new generation. The omnipotent exerciser and 
reformer is the Kodomo [Child]." 

Mr. Hearn's style is simple and picturesque, 
eminently befitting the Oriental life which he 
describes. He writes pathetically and sympa- 
thetically of the life of a dancing-girl, but gives 
an entirely wrong impression that the geisha 
is spotless. He vividly describes a Japanese 
garden as absolutely realistic, " at once a pic- 
ture and a poem perhaps even more a poem 
than a picture "; and shows how the trees and 
stones have " character," " tones and values." 
The Japanese certainly succeed in finding " ser- 
mons in stones, books in the running brooks, 
tongues in the trees." 

" Why should the trees be so lovely in Japan ? With 
us a plum or cherry tree in flower is not an astonish- 
ing sight ; but here it is a miracle of beauty so bewilder- 
ing that, however much you may have previously read 
about it, the real spectacle strikes you dumb. You see 
no leaves, only one great filmy mist of petals. Is it 
that the trees have been so long domesticated and ca- 
ressed by man in this land of the Gods, that they have 
acquired souls, and strive to show their gratitude, like 
women loved, by making themselves more beautiful for 
man's sake ? Assuredly they have mastered men's hearts 
by their loveliness, like beautiful slaves. That is to say, 
Japanese hearts. Apparently there have been some for- 
eign tourists of the brutal class in this place, since it 
has been deemed necessary to set up inscriptions in En- 
glish announcing that 'It is forbidden to injure the 
trees.' " 

Mr. Hearn tells stories of ghosts and goblins 
in a way to charm young America ; discourses 
of souls in a way to interest spiritualists ; and 
masterfully analyzes the Japanese smile as a 
matter of etiquette that demands a stoical man- 
ifestation of joy even in adversity or affliction. 

" It is the native custom that whenever a painful or 
shocking fact must be told, the announcement should 
be made, by the sufferer, with a smile. The graver the 
subject, the more accentuated the smile; and when the 
matter is very unpleasant to the person speaking of it, 
the smile often changes to a low, soft laugh. However 
bitterly the mother who has lost her first-born may have 
wept at the funeral, it is probable that, if in your ser- 
vice, she will tell of her bereavement with a smile : like 
the Preacher, she holds that there is a time to weep and 
a time to laugh. . . . Yet the laugh was politeness

carried to the utmost point of self-abnegation. It sig- 
nified : This you might honorably think to be an un- 
happy event; pray do not suffer your superiority to feel 
concern about so inferior a matter, and pardon the ne- 
cessity which causes us to outrage politeness by speak- 
ing about such an affair at all.' " 

Some of the sketches in this volume have ap- 
peared in the " Japan Mail " and other news- 
papers, and some in the " Atlantic Monthly "; 
but almost two-thirds are entirely new. 

The great fault of the work is that it is one- 
sided. The preface merely acknowledges the 
existence of a " darker side," but calls even 
this " brightness compared with the darker side 
of Western existence." Throughout the entire 
book one rarely meets even a hint that sin ex- 
ists in Japan ; the beauty of the work must not 
be marred by stains. Japanese life " has its 
foibles, its follies, its vices, its cruelties," but 
they don't amount to anything ! Kaempfer is 
quoted with approval : " In the practice of vir- 
tue, in purity of life and outward devotion, they 
far outdo the Christians." Mr. Hearn's " own 
conviction " that " Japan has nothing to gain 
by conversion to Christianity " is the usual 
opinion of "us agnostics," who can scarcely 
be called " impartial." But it is the calm 
judgment of many " experienced observers of 
Japanese life," that true Christianity, with its 
lofty moral standards, its great spiritual power 
and personal inspiration, is much needed in 
New Japan. ERNEST W. CLEMENT. 



THE CANTERBURY TALES "AS POETRY. * 

At last we have an edition of Chaucer's Can- 
terbury Tales adapted to the wants of those 
who would read them as poetry rather than as 
a monument of fourteenth century English. 
Accordingly, there is not obtruded upon the 
reader's attention, in the editorial matter, a 
great mass of mere scholarship, which it is very 
easy in these days to collect. Mr. Pollard has 
strictly observed, as an editor, the ne quid 
nimis ; and that is not an easy thing to do. 

This edition, as stated in the Preface, is the 
result of an engagement entered into, as far 
back as 1888, by Dr. Furnivall and Mr. Pollard, 
that they should cooperate in the preparation 
of a complete Library edition of Chaucer, for 
Messrs. Macmillan & Co. On this arrangement 
a beginning was made ; but Dr. Furnivall's 
many engagements compelled him to with- 

* CHAUCER'S CANTERBURY TALES. Edited, with notes and 
introduction, by Alfred W. Pollard. In two volumes. New 
York : Macmillan & Co. 



draw from the work soon after it was under- 
taken. In the meantime, Professor Skeat, who, 
in his Chaucer studies and editing, had been 
for years collating texts and collecting notes 
and elucidations of various kinds, planned an 
edition on a large scale (now in course of pub- 
lication by Messrs. Macmillan & Co.). Says 
Mr. Pollard : 

" I gladly abandoned, in favor of an editor of so much 
greater width of reading, the Library edition which had 
been arranged for in the original agreement of Dr. Fur- 
nivall and myself with Messrs. Macmillan. I thought, 
however, that the work which I had done might fairly 
be used for an edition on a less extensive plan and in- 
tended for a less stalwart class of readers, and of this 
the present issue of the Canterbury Tales is an instal- 
ment." 

The London Chaucer Society's Six -Text 
Edition of the Canterbury Tales revealed the 
great superiority of the Ellesmere MS. Upon 
this the text of the edition before us is based, 
the Six Texts and the Harleian MS. 7334 hav- 
ing been carefully collated, and all variations 
from the Ellesmere being stated in the foot- 
notes. These variations are not numerous 
enough to make the page dreary ; and the text 
is not disfigured by marks calling attention to 
them. There is great certainty now, especially 
in the case of the Canterbury Tales, as to what 
Chaucer actually wrote, far greater certainty 
than there is as to what Shakespeare wrote ; 
and it is to be hoped that the text of this edi- 
tion, and of Professor Skeat's edition, will be 
accepted by the learned world as final. It is 
hard to see what more could be done. Of course 
there are many scholars who don't like to have 
things settled. Othello's occupation would be 
gone. 

To notice the chief editorial features of Mr. 
Pollard's edition, as presented in his Preface : 

The glossing of obsolete words in the foot- 
notes is kept within the smallest limits possible, 
a glossary of the commoner words being ap- 
pended to the second volume, to avoid explain- 
ing them whenever they occur. " To interrupt 
one's enjoyment of poetry," says the editor, 
" by looking up words in a glossary appears to 
me an intolerable penance, and I have there- 
fore put explanations of the obsolete words in 
foot-notes to the pages where they first occur." 

It is truly refreshing in these days of engulf- 
ing scholarship, to meet with an editor of 
Chaucer (or any other poet, indeed), who, re- 
garding annotations and other editorial things 
as necessary evils, makes it a special object to 
reduce these evils as far as he can consistently 
with the real wants of the general reader. 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



261 



Where the final e (the common residual of 
various earlier inflections) has a syllabic value 
in the verse, a single small dot is placed over 
it, which is scarcely noticeable when the eye 
is cast over the page. 

Acephalous verses, which occur occasionally, 
are indicated by an accent over the vowel of the 
syllable of which an initial foot consists ; e. g., 

" Twenty bookes clad in blak or reed." 

The spelling of the Ellesmere MS. has been 
followed, without regard to uniformity ; the 
modern use of u and -y, i andj, being, however, 
adopted ; and in a few words very few 
where y in the MS. stands for the Semi-Saxon 
<7, it is represented by the g in present use. In 
regard to uniformity of spelling, the editor 
quotes what Dr. Furnivall wrote on the sub- 
ject, six-and-twenty years ago : 

" To force a uniform spelling on Chaucer by what- 
ever process arrived at would be to force a lie on him 
and on the history of the English language; an evil for 
which no fancied gain in convenience of teaching boys 
could compensate. Before him for hundreds of years 
is no uniformity; after him for centuries, none; why in 
the works of him the free and playful above all 
others, are letters to lose their power of wandering at 
their own sweet will; why are words to be debarred 
their rightful inheritance of varying their forms ? This 
notion of a uniform spelling, as applied to Chaucer's 
words, is to me a Monster, bred by Artificialness out of 
False Analogy." 

To this the editor adds : 

" The variations of spelling which can safely be elim- 
inated never really disguise a word, and the attempt to 
introduce into Chaucer's English a modified system of 
phonetic spelling (phonetic as applied to vowels, if not 
to consonants) seems to me to involve an assumption of 
knowledge as to the poet's individual pronunciation con- 
siderably beyond what we can lay claim to." 

It would have been well if the editor had 
introduced into his Preface, to make the work 
quite complete in itself, the results arrived at 
by Alexander J. Ellis, in his " Early English 
Pronunciation," as to the powers of the letters 
in Chaucer results which are generally ac- 
cepted by Chaucer scholars. There is not a 
full agreement among them ; but anyone who 
would train his voice (and it requires much 
training) to read Chaucer fluently according to 
Ellis, and with due expression, would get at 
much of the flavor of the poet's language, not 
to be otherwise got at. A fluent reading of his 
verse is the most effectual way of assimilating 
its moulding spirit. Chaucer continues to be 
one of the great masters of verse in the litera- 
ture, Dryden's monstrous chatter about the 
progress of English verse to the contrary not- 
withstanding : 

" We must be children before we grow men. There 



was an Ennius, and in process of time a Lucilius, and a 
Lucretius, before Virgil and Horace; even after Chau- 
cer there was a Spenser, a Harrington, a Fairfax, before 
Waller and Denham were in being; and our numbers 
were in their nonage till these last appeared." 

What rhetorical nonsense ! Even in the use 
of the rhyming couplet, Chaucer surpasses 
immeasurably both Dryden and Pope. His 
thought is not so paddocked therein. In his 
hands it is not the " rocking horse," as Keats 
characterizes it, which it is in the hands of 
Dryden and Pope. Of Waller, Dryden says 
that " he first made writing easily an art, first 
showed us to conclude the sense, most com- 
monly in distichs," etc. One great merit of 
Chaucer's use of the couplet is, that he does 
not conclude the sense most commonly in dis- 
tichs. His sensitiveness as to melody did not 
allow him to run into a mechanical uniformity. 
All who read Chaucer as a poet rather than 
as a writer of fourteenth century English must 
give this edition of the poet's masterpiece a 
hearty welcome. HIRAM CORSON. 



CURIOSITIES or AFRICAN FOLK-LORE.* 

For some time past the American Folk-Lore 
Society has been engaged in raising an espe- 
cial publication fund for publishing a series of 
Memoirs. The first volume resulting from its 
efforts is Chatelain's " Folk-Tales of Angola." 
Angola is certainly one of the most important 
political divisions of Africa. A possession of 
Portugal, it lies on the west coast, between 
4 40 ' and 17 20 ' south latitude. With great 
and varied natural resources, with considerable 
diversity in climate and topography, the coun- 
try is quite naturally divided into several great 
" districts," each with its own capital and its 
own population. The four great districts are 
called Kongo, Loanda, Benguella, and Mos- 
samedes. The capital city of Kongo is Ka- 
binda ; the capitals of the other districts bear 
the same names as these. The people of Kongo 
are called Kongo; those of Loanda are the 
Angola proper, or A-mbundu ; those of Ben- 
guella are the Ovi-mbundu ; those of Mossam- 
edes do not form a well-marked group, but are 
much like the Ovi-mbundu but with affinities 
with the Ova-fferero and Ova-Ndonga of Ger- 
man Africa. Our author gives detailed lists 
of the tribes in each of these groups, and states 
their geographical location. The stories he pre-

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



sents to us are in the Ki-mbundu language of 
Angola proper. They represent two dialects 
the Loanda and the Mbaka. 

Having thus located his field, geographical 
and linguistic, our author gives valuable eth- 
nological data concerning those who speak 
Ki-nibundu. Their government is tribal : there 
is a chief, with two standing officers, and a 
council. The organization of the family, as 
among the Bantu generally, is based upon ma- 
ternal kinship and inheritance ; the mother 
and child are the nearest relations ; the mother's 
brother owns nephews and nieces, and can sell 
them, although they are also his heirs, both of 
property and position. We shall pass the rest 
of our author's ethnological notes, but must 
quote one important statement : 

" The ever-repeated assertion that Africans are f etich- 
ists, that is, worshippers of inanimate objects, is utterly 
false, or else all superstitious people are fetichists. . . . 
[The Angolans] are not idolaters in the strict sense, nor 
atheists, nor fetichists, nor polytheists, but superstitious 
deists. . . . True fetichism I have found in Africa, 
among ignorant Portuguese, who do assert and believe 
that this or that image is God, does work miracles and 
must be worshipped, not as a mere symbol of its spirit- 
ual prototype, but as the actual incarnation or embod- 
iment of it, equal in all respects to the original." 

After this consideration of country and peo- 
ple, Mr. Chatelain discusses African folk-lore 
in general and Angolan folk-lore in particular. 
Having traced the study of folk-lore in other 
parts of Africa, he says : 

" Proceeding to West Africa, we look at the great 
province of Angola, where Europeans have been settled 
for about four centuries, and we search in vain, through 
a pile of colonial publications, for a single native folk- 
tale. When intelligent Europeans have been four hun- 
dred years living and mixing with a native population 
and never recorded a single sample of the natives' oral 
literature, is that not superabundant proof of its non- 
existence ? . . . Yet as soon as we intelligently and 
persistently searched for it, that literature revealed it- 
self to us in amazing luxuriance. One of the dullest 
native boys was able, unaided, to dictate to us, from 
the book of his memory, over sixty tales and fables, a 
material equal to that of the largest collection of Afri- 
can tales ever yet published." 

Of real Negro folk-lore there are but a few 
collections. Those of Callaway, Theal, Koelle, 
Schon, and Chatelain, are about all. From a 
study of the whole material our author deduces 
several propositions, among them the follow- 
ing: 

(a) African folk-lore is not a tree of itself, but a 
branch from one universal tree: many myths, favorite 
types or characters, and incidents, of frequent recur- 
rence elsewhere, are also found in Africa. 

(&) Portuguese and Arab stories may be recognized 
but they are entirely worked over and localized. 



(c) African folk-lore abounds in animal stories. 

(J) The folk-lore of the Bantu is remarkably homo- 
geneous and compact. 

(e) In the animal stories, each animal, while true to 
its real nature, shows the same character and plays the 
same role everywhere. 

(_/) Many of the stories are etiologic, attempting to 
assign a cause or origin for natural phenomena or for 
individual characteristics. 

Our author finds among the Angolans a ver- 
itable native classification of oral literature. 
This classification he follows. It seems that 
they recognize : 

(1 ) Fictitious tales containing a miraculous element ; 
beginning and ending usually with a set formula : mi-soso. 

(2) Narratives supposedly true ; sometimes in- 
structive: maka. 

(3) Historical traditions chronicles of the tribes 
handed down by the jealous care of the headmen and 
elders : ma-lunda or mi-sendu. 

(4) Proverbs closely connected with the maka, 
which are often but an illustration of a proverb; (a 
proverb is frequently a narrative in a nutshell) : ji-sabu. 

(5) Poetry and music extemporization is very com- 
mon; songs are called: mi-imbu. 

(6) Riddles for pastime and amusement; often with 
set formula preceding and following: ji-nongonongo. 

In the present volume we have samples of 
but two of these classes the mihoso and the 
maka. Fifty of these samples are given. The 
first story, which is very long, is printed in the 
original Loanda, with a literal interlinear trans- 
lation. The remaining stories are printed in 
the original language, with a careful English 
translation on the opposite page. In these 
translations the author aims to preserve the 
simple and direct form of the original and to 
depict the mode of thought of the narrator. 
Notes historical, linguistic, ethnographic, com- 
parative, and critical, follow the stories. The 
whole work is scholarly, and will be of great 
value to linguists and ethnographers. 

Some of the stories are long and elaborately 
detailed ; others are brief, summarized ; some 
show keenness of perception, delicacy of ex- 
pression, beauty of thought ; many convey les- 
sons of importance. The first story, no better 
than many of the others, shows several points 
of interest. It begins with the usual formula, 
Erne ngateletele = " I often tell of," correspond- 
ing to our " Once upon a time." It ends with, 
" I have told my little story ; whether good or 
bad, I have finished." Self-depreciation by a 
performer appears to be world-wide ! Fenda 
Maria is a young girl, locked up by her mother, 
who is jealous of her beauty. Escaping, she 
searches for a lover, even more beautiful than 
herself, who is bound by a magic sleep ; by 
helping an old woman, she is instructed as to 



1894.]

how she may find and release the young man ; 
when found, he must be awakened by the weep- 
ing of twelve jars full of tears : wearied in this 
labor, she calls her slave to relieve her ; this 
one plays her false, gains the prince, and poor 
Fenda Maria is reduced to slavery. Of course, 
in the end, she gains the victory by magic 
means. The conclusion is tragic: "Pele Mi- 
landa [the husband] called young men two. 
They lift JZamasoxi [the traitor slave] and they 
put her into the barrel of coal-tar, and they 
set it on fire. Kamasoxi then burns, gets 
charred ; a little bone flies up, alights on Fenda 
Maria. Fenda Maria then rubs herself with 
it." This is common custom in Africa : anoint- 
ing one's self with charcoal of burnt bone or 
flesh protects against enemies, material and 
spiritual. 

Very commonly the whole story is summar- 
ized, in a single paragraph, just before it ends. 
These summaries are really models. Thus, a 
two-page story is summarized as follows : " A 
young man married his wife. The man had 
four brothers. The woman whom he married 
knew not their names. When she went to 
pound, a little bird told her the names of her 
brothers-in-law." Angolan stories are often 
etiologic. At times the etiological idea re- 
mains in suspense, quite unsuspected, until the 
close of the tale. Thus, a story of three girls 
and a little child, who visit the makishi (can- 
nibals) is quite excitingly told through nearly 
five pages ; the girls barely escape with their 
lives and only with the aid of Hawk, to whom 
they promise payment. When he arrives to 
claim his reward, " he says : ye pay me now '; 
they said: 'we cannot pay thee into hands ; thou 
thyself, the fowls are here, help thyself.' The 
Hawk assented. And thus it remained : the 
Hawk, who is wont to catch fowls, of old he 
did not catch them ; he was eating locusts and 
small birds only." 

The folk-lore student will make many inter- 
esting comparisons between these Angola tales 
and the lore of other peoples. The author 
makes many such in the notes. Of course 
there are frequent resemblances to " Uncle Re- 
mus's " stories of our Southern negroes. We 
meet both parts of the tar-baby story. In the 
story of Leopard, Monkey, and Hare, we have 
the sticky figures used as a trap to catch the 
two latter creatures. In the story of the Man 
and the Turtle, we have the balance of our old 
favorite. A man caught a turtle ; the neigh- 
bors said, " Let us kill it ! " They propose 
using hatchets ; the turtle replies, 



" Turtle of Koka, 
And hatchet of Koka, 
Hatchet not hurt me a bit." 

Stones, fire, knives, are suggested, and, on ac- 
count of his indifference, rejected. At last they 
said, " Let us cast him into the depth of the 
water." The turtle replying, " Woe ! I shall 
die there! how shall I do? " he is thrown into 
the river. After diving, he rises, and sings as 
he swims : 

" In water, in my home, 
In water, in my home." 

But we must stop. The collection is an ex- 
cellent one, admirably presented and annotated. 
It is rare that so important and scholarly a con- 
tribution is made at once to folk-lore, ethnog- 
raphy, and linguistics. Mr. Chatelain is to be 
congratulated upon producing so good a work, 
and the American Folk-lore Society upon se- 
curing it as its first volume of Memoirs.

RECENT ENGLISH NOVELS.* 

With whatever anticipatory pleasure one may 
take up a new novel by Mr. George Meredith, there 
is some admixture (to the reviewer, at least) of the 
sense of duty of a duty whose aspect is less gra- 
cious than forbidding and stern. For through what 
thickets of verbiage, what devious paths of involved 
construction, what thorny jungles of half-realized 
expression, he must pursue the characters and the 
plot, he knows but too well from his recollection of 
former forays in Mr. Meredith's preserves. He 
finds it extremely discouraging, for example, when 
at the outset of his task, to come upon such a pas- 
sage as the following, all for the purpose of explain-

ing that the heroine is a " brune," and that it would 
never have done for her to be anything else : 

" Some of the boys regretted her not being fair. But, 
as they felt, and sought to explain, in the manner of 
the wag of a tail, with elbows and eyebrows to one an- 
other's understanding, fair girls could never have let 
fly such a look; fair girls are softer, woollier, and when 
they mean to look serious, overdo it by craping solemn, 
or they pinafore a jigging eagerness, or hoist propriety 
on a chubby flaxen grin; or else they dart an eye, or 
they mince and prim and pout, and are sigh-away and 
dying-ducky, given to girls' tricks." 

This is surely English in delirium tremens, and the 
disease is too frequently recurrent in this and in 
milder forms. Yet the reader who, undeterred, ac- 
cepts it as inevitable, and has the heart to perse- 
vere, is not without his reward. There is character, 
there is passion, there is even simple strength at 
times ; there is, moreover, an ideal of robust hu- 
manity, vigorous enough to sweep aside petty con- 
ventions (although in the process those conventions, 
which, so far from being petty, are the very base 
of the social fabric, sometimes go by the board as 
well), and to view life sub specie ceternitatis. We 
are again impressed (as so often before) with the 
analogy between Mr. Meredith's genius and that of 
the late Robert Browning an analogy based upon 
a fundamental theory of life no less than upon per- 
versity of expression. And of the latter, we may 
make for Mr. Meredith the defence made for 
Browning by Mr. Swinburne when he says that the 
poet " is something too much the reverse of obscure ; 
he is too brilliant and subtle for the ready reader 
of a ready writer to follow with any certainty the 
track of an intelligence which moves with such in- 
cessant rapidity." Such a defence, justifiable to a 
certain point, may of course easily be read as grant- 
ing too much. After all, it does not excuse; it 
only palliates. And it does not make a Tennyson 
( or an artist equal in rank) of Browning any more 
than it makes a Thackeray of Mr. George Meredith. 
The prompt success scored by Mr. Du Maurier's 
" Trilby " is one of those things that restore confi- 
dence, often sadly shaken, in the public taste. For 
the success is richly deserved, even when we judge 
the book by an exacting standard and it does not 
seem accountable for otherwise than as following 
from a true appreciation of the artistic quality of 
Mr. Du Maurier's genial transcript of life. The 
drawings count for something, to be sure ; but one 
would suppose the book handicapped for the aver- 
age reader by its lack of a plot, as the term is com- 
monly understood. And it must be admitted that 
the book is very imperfect from the standpoint of 
construction. The nice theorists who formulate and 
lay down the laws of the novel will not easily fit 
this one into any of their schemes, and it may well 
prove the despair of the student of literary archi- 
tectonics. The hypnotism business, for example, is 
unjustifiable both in science and in art, and seriously 
mars the work. But this stricture, as well as the 
many others that might be made, only illustrates 



anew the fact that genius may do almost anything 
and yet be forgiven. And genius Mr. Du Maurier 
certainly has, if deep insight into character, rich 
criticism of life, delicate artistic perceptions, and a 
shrewd and wholesome humor, are enough to con- 
stitute that not easily definable quality. In the first 
half of the book, every page is a delight ; the latter 
half only is a little disappointing. The na'ive way 
in which the author takes you into his confidence 
from the start is irresistibly winning ; the descrip- 
tions of student life in the Latin Quarter are as in- 
imitable as those of Thackeray or Murger; the 
pathos of Trilby's life and fate is exquisite ; and 
the unconventional diction with which all these mat- 
ters are set forth is most refreshing. The omniv- 
orous reader, a little tired of writers so intent upon 
the manner of their saying things that they have no 
time to find things worth saying, will eagerly wel- 
come a man who has viewed life with tenderness and 
a sane outlook, and who has so much to report that 
he occasionally forgets to polish his paragraphs, if 
indeed, he do not deliberately eschew the ways of 
the stylist. 

Mr. Hall Caine, after certain literary wanderings 
into strange foreign parts, has returned to the scene 
in which his first conspicuous success as a novelist 
was made, and produced, in " The Manxman," a 
work which must sensibly increase his reputation. 
The outline of this new novel is comparatively sim- 
ple, and it culminates in an episode which is, mu- 
tatis mutandis, essentially that of " The Scarlet Let- 
ter." The narrative, which exhibits great elabora- 
tion of detail, displays a mastery of tragic irony, 
and has passages of singular power ; but yet, when 
we think for a moment of the art of Hawthorne, 
we see that far greater power is possible with far 
less of elaboration, and wonder whether Mr. Caine 
would not have been better advised had he worked 
along simpler lines. As a minute and faithful study 
of a locality and a variety of the human species, 
this Manx romance is entitled to the highest praise. 
We are made to know the people as if we had lived 
with them for years, and doubtless they are inter- 
esting enough to be made the subject of so thorough 
a treatment. Mr. Caine's genius, moreover, weighted 
as it is upon the emotional side of the balance, fits 
him to deal with people under such primitive con- 
ditions as obtain in the Isle of Man. He would 
hardly be at home in the world of Thackeray or 
George Eliot. 

Right into the midst of the Thirty Years War, 
into the most hideous and meaningless chapter in 
the annals of all modern warfare, we are plunged 
by the new romance of Mr. Stanley Weyman. The 
scene is focussed upon the summer of 1832, the 
period between Breitenfeld and Liitzen, the weeks 
when the Swedish king confronted Wallenstein be- 
fore Niirnberg and made of the peaceful valley of 
the Pegnitz an armed camp. With these scenes for 
a background, Mr. Weyman has told the story of 
a noble lady, driven from her home, exposed to all

the perils of travel in that lawless time, and to the 
greater peril of the love of a brutal soldier of for- 
tune whose protection she unwittingly seeks, until, 
after many vicissitudes, she emerges from her dif- 
ficulties as every well-conducted heroine of romance 
is bound to emerge, and once more finds peace and 
happiness and all the other things that have to come 
at the end of the story. The book is, of course, one 
of the most stirring sort of adventure, and the au- 
thor has " got up " his period and his accessories 
well enough. But the action is more confused and 
the incidents upon a scale of greater monotony than, 
say, in " A Gentleman of France," and we are in- 
clined to think that Mr. Weyman has done better 
work on at least two, and possibly on three or four, 



occasions. 



To write a whole novel in dialogue, or after the 
manner of Mr. Howells's farces, was a somewhat 
daring undertaking, especially on the part of a writer 
who was to forego dramatic incident almost alto- 
gether, and rely upon the sparkle of conversation 
to sustain the interest. "The Maiden's Progress" 
is unquestionably clever, and abounds in little 
touches that show delicate observation and sympathy. 
Taken a few pages at a time, it is extremely read- 
able ; run through at a sitting, it palls. Nor is the 
story remarkable for coherency either of character 
or plot. Whipped cream is excellent in its way, but 
there should be some sort of pudding beneath. 

One does not nowadays expect a new novel by 
Mr. Black to furnish very substantial nutriment, 
but there are limits to the permissible dilution even 
of gruel, and it must be said that " Highland Cous- 
ins " exceeds those limits. The book offers us the 
old Highland background, the old and badly worn 
stage-sets, the old Gaelic talk, and absolutely noth- 
ing to relieve the monotony of these too familiar 
adjuncts. We suppose that there are persons who 
have never read a novel by Mr. Black, and to such 
it may be imagined that this latest of the long line 
might have a message and a charm ; but it is not 
easy for the jaded reviewer to assume the suggested 
standpoint, and we must be content to note that the 
present work is more exclusively provincial than 
most of its predecessors, that it tells a pretty and 
pathetic story, and that it contains nothing likely 
to haunt the memory long after the closing page 
has been read. But the simple and unpretending 
plan of the narrative should disarm criticism ; and 
then, the author is by no means the only modern 
novelist who has repeated himself. Besides, few 
have the grace to repeat themselves in so frank and 
unblushing a way. 

Mrs. Margaret L. Woods made her first appear- 
ance in literature with " A Village Tragedy," pub- 
lished nearly six years ago. A year or two later 
she published " Esther Vanhomrigh." The first of 
these books was a masterpiece of the tragic idyll ; 
the other was as unquestionably a masterpiece of 
historical fiction. So undoubted a success in two 
so distinct fields of the art of fiction naturally at- 



tracted much attention to the hitherto unknown 
writer, and the most discerning critics were lavish 
in their appreciation of the rare qualities displayed 
by Mrs. Woods in her work. We hardly need, 
then, to bespeak a welcome for " The Vagabonds," 
her third novel, now just appeared. It must be 
classed with " A Village Tragedy " rather than with 
her brilliant study of the life and times of Swift, 
and is at least the equal of its predecessor. The 
characters are very humble folk indeed, merely the 
members of a strolling show, circus performers and 
menagerie attendants. Nothing is spared us of 
their illiteracy, their vulgarity, or their vice ; yet 
the art of the writer is such that our thought does 
not dwell upon these things overmuch, but is rather 
led to contemplate the common humanity which is 
ours no less than theirs. Pathos we may expect in 
such a story, and maudlin pathos is too frequent an 
element in tales of the lowly, intended to arouse a 
cheap sentimentality in readers belonging to a higher 
social stratum. But the aim of the present writer 
is a far higher one, and her pathos, so far from be- 
ing cheap, is of the noble sort that levels all social 
distinctions, and sets us face to face with the funda- 
mental verities of life. How often we are forced 
to exclaim, " This is truth," and not merely truth 
in the barren sense of the photographic realist, but 
truth as it exists for the artist, truth sublimated and 
significant. The art of Mrs. Woods is the art of 
the true realists, the art of " George Eliot," for ex- 
ample, in her scenes of village or provincial life. 
To make of the clown of an itinerant circus the hero 
of a novel was a daring task indeed, and it is a true 
spiritual triumph that we should be forced to accept 
him as a man and a brother, which we clearly must 
do in the present instance. The author of " The 
Manxman " has done something akin to this ; but 
his method, when compared with that of Mrs. Woods, 
shows obvious traces of the melodramatic. In this 
special achievement, the woman is at once a sim- 
pler and a subtler artist than the man. 

Under the modest disguise of the initials " Z. Z.," 
a new writer, seemingly emulous of " Maarten Maar- 
tens," bids for our interest in a little group of Dutch 
settlers in London. This " Drama in Dutch " is a 
very simple story, and the people with whom it 
deals are merely transplanted Dutchmen, preserv- 
ing intact, in their new colony, their national char- 
acteristics. Before the end is reached, we feel 
pretty well acquainted with them, both in their in- 
dustrious money-getting and in their domestic sur- 
roundings, and this is a great effect for any writer 
to achieve. The author can hardly be other than a 
Dutchman himself his knowledge and sympathy 
are too evident to be otherwise explained but he 
writes an irreproachable English, and his manner 
is engaging. Most readers will feel themselves dis- 
tinctly defrauded in the outcome of this " drama," 
for the long-lost son is not discovered, or the re- 
verse, by the long-lost father, although both are 
upon the scene, thus furnishing the conditions of a

climax which, according to all the traditions of good 
story-telling, we have a right to expect. The ele- 
ment of pathos in the story becomes it well, and is 
distinctly marked. 

The master of an English public school is respon- 
sible for as unliterary and curiously dull a piece of 
story-telling as is often seen. His taste as a stylist 
may be seen in the title, " The Thing that Hath 
Been ; or, A Young Man's Mistakes," a formula 
which would have handicapped "Vanity Fair" 
itself. The book deals with the inner life of an 
English school, and no details are too petty and 
insignificant to find a place in its pages. The chief 
character is a young man destitute of breeding, but 
endowed with a certain intellectual force, who for 
a time occupies a master's place. He is distinguished 
by a bluntness in saying what he thinks and an un- 
comfortably logical way in putting things, which 
characteristics seem intended to deserve our sym- 
pathy, but utterly fail in their purpose. If we are 
to accept the graceless realism of this book, the En- 
glish public school is a place without tone or manly 
feeling, a place where the masters are given over 
to bickering and to devices for shirking their duties, 
to say nothing of being brutal in their relations to 
one another, and where the boys are dull, idle, and 
unambitious. But this picture is probably as far 
away from the average truth as is, in the other di- 
rection, the picture of Arnold's Rugby, made famil- 
iar to us all by the classic account of Judge Hughes. 

The heroine of " Dr. Janet of Harley Street " is 
a young woman who, at the age of seventeen, is en- 
gaged to marry a French marquis of some fifty 
summers. All goes well until the wedding morn- 
ing, when the elderly wooer does violence to the 
maidenly susceptibilities of his betrothed by kissing 
her in the garden of her mother's house. Still, the 
marriage ceremony is permitted to take place, but 
it is no sooner over than the bride takes flight from 
her country home, goes up to London, and walks 
the streets in search of employment. Being penni- 
less, she passes the first night h la belle etoile ; a 
repetition of this dismal experience is spared her 
by the accident of finding a grimly good-natured 
physician of her own sex, who takes her into the 
household, and sets her to studying medicine. In 
the course of time an attractive professor of chem- 
istry appears upon the scene, and the usual entangle- 
ment ensues. A second wedding follows upon a false 
report of the death of the marquis ; the discovery 
that he still lives places the heroine in the uncom- 
fortable position of a bigamist. Whereupon the re- 
doubtable Dr. Janet seeks out the marquis, and 
urges him to commit suicide as the best way of clear- 
ing the atmosphere. This he obligingly does, with 
the accompaniment of an interesting attack of de- 
lirium tremens, and the story ends. Everything 
about it is, of course, in the highest degree absurd, 
while a hysterical method and the introduction of 
much dismally irrelevant matter deprive the book 



of its last hope of arousing the interest, as even a 
very absurd story may possibly do, when told by a 
writer having some share of the novelist's instinct. 

Mr. Anthony Hope's new story is so different 
from " The Prisoner of Zenda " that the reviewer 
finds a complete readjustment of focus necessary. 
Instead of intrigue, adventure, and the atmosphere 
of romance, we have a simple story of an English 
country town, told in the best of taste, and distinctly 
novel in plot. The hero is a poet who has become 
famous by his audacious denunciations of kings, 
priests, and tyrants in general, to say nothing of 
the social order in which it is possible for them to 
exist. He takes up residence in a quiet village, and 
his presence, reinforced by his lurid reputation, con- 
siderably flutters the rural dovecotes. Falling in love 
with the daughter of a local magnate, his views un- 
dergo a remarkable modification, and he even pens an 
ode to a visiting prince. These relapses secure for 
him the deadly hatred of a radical physician of the 
neighborhood, who has taken the poet's rhetoric far 
too seriously, and who now treats him as a " lost 
leader." For a time, the situation grows almost 
tragic, but the story ends happily for most of those 
concerned. It is impossible to help discerning in 
the hero's career a sort of travesty of Mr. Swin- 
burne's progress from his early radicalism to the 
conservatism of his later years. But suggestions of 
this sort need not, of course, be applied too literally. 

Readers of Mr. Mallock's " New Republic " dur- 
ing recent years must often have thought that the 
Mr. Rose of the satire, obviously a caricature as 
far as Walter Pater is concerned, was far from be- 
ing a bad likeness of Mr. Oscar Wilde, whose me- 
teoric career was a thing of the future at the time 
when Mr. Mallock wrote. The hero of " The Green 
Carnation " is Mr. Rose over again, much exagger- 
ated, with a neat taste for paradox superadded to 
his old insistence upon the value of the moment 
and the mood, thus reminding us still more dis- 
tinctly of the author of a certain pleasant essay on 
" The Decay of Lying." The new book, like the 
old one which it suggests, aims to satirize some of 
the men and movements most prominent to-day in 
English life and literature. It, too, has for its ma- 
chinery a house party and the incidents and discus- 
sions thereto appertaining, but in the present case 
the names of those at whom its shafts are aimed are 
not disguised. Here is a typical example : 

" ' Dear Lady! ' said Esme", getting up out of his chair 
slowly, 'intelligence is the demon of our age. Mine 
bores me horribly. I am always trying to find a rem- 
edy for it. I have experimented with absinthe, but 
gained no result. I have read the collected works of 
Walter Besant. They are said to sap the mental pow- 
ers. They did not sap mine. Opium has proved use- 
less, and green tea cigarettes leave me positively bril- 
liant. What am I to do ? I so long for the lethargy, 
the sweet peace of stupidity. If only I were Lewis 
Morris ! ' " 

There is a certain cleverness, although of a cheap

sort, in this kind of writing, but a whole volume of 
it grows wearisome. Here is another and rather 
taking bit : 

" ' I will stay at home and read the last number of 
" The Yellow Disaster." I want to see Mr. Aubrey 
Beardsley's idea of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He 
has drawn him sitting in a wheelbarrow in the gardens 
of Lambeth Palace, with underneath him the motto, 
" J'y suis, j'y reste." I believe he has on a black mask. 
Perhaps that is to conceal the likeness.' ' I have seen 
it,' Mrs. Windsor said; 'it is very clever. There are 
only three lines in the whole picture, two for the wheel- 
barrow and one for the Archbishop.' " 

Such a book as this calls for sampling rather than 
for comment, and we select the following for our 
final extract. The hero, as before, is the speaker. 
" ' What shall I give you for a wedding present, Reg- 
gie ? I think I will give you the Book of Common 
Prayer in the vulgar tongue. One would think it was 
something written by a realist. The adjectives would 
apply to the productions of George Moore, which are 
boycotted by Smith on account of their want of style or 
something of the sort. If George Moore could only 
learn the subtle art of indecency he might be toler- 
able. As it is, he is, like Miss Yonge, merely tedious 
and domesticated. He ought to associate more with 
educated people, instead of going perpetually to the de- 
pendent performances of the Independent Theatre, whose 
motto seems to be, " If I don't shock you, I'm a Dutch- 
man ! " How curiously archaic it must feel to be a 
Dutchman. It must be like having been born in Ice- 
land, or educated in a grammar school. I would give 
almost anything to feel really Dutch for half-an-hour.' " 

We are not surprised to hear that " The Green Car- 
nation " has made something of a flutter in London. 
But we shall be greatly surprised if anyone is found 
to read it ten years from now.

Healy's "Reminiscences of a Portrait Painter" 
(McClurg). Mr. Healy, as the world knows, was 
a master of the brush, and his book shows that he 
could wield the pen with a fluent neatness that might 
put many a professed writer to the blush. In Part 
I., he sketches rapidly and deftly the story of his 
life and of his progress as a painter, of his child- 
ish dabblings with the toy colors ; his first portrait, 
first sale, and first patron ; his journey to Europe 
and taste of bohemianism in Paris and London; 
his marriage, early struggles, and final success ; his 
return home, and his experiences in Chicago, then 
a chaotic, rude town, where squalor elbowed inci- 
pient finery ; where the Dives of to-day was the La- 
zarus of yesterday ; where the calico, pork, and gro- 
cery millionaires were yet in the bud, thrifty, and sus- 
picious of art, yet, as potential ancestors, not unwilling 
to have their portraits done in " ile "; and where " un- 



couth shanties reared their shabby heads close to fine 
new mansions." Chicago has not, perhaps, lost all 
her old characteristics. In Part II., the author writes 
of his friends and his sitters ; and among the latter, 
we need scarcely say, were many of the most distin- 
guished people of the old and the new worlds. Thiers, 
Gambetta, Guizot, Louis Philippe, the Abbe* Liszt, 
Lincoln, Grant, Jackson, Clay, Webster, Pope Pius 
IX., and William B. Ogden of Chicago, have sat before 
his easel ; and for each he has a page or so of graphic 
anecdote and comment. There is a glimpse of Queen 
Victoria, and it is not a pleasant one. Mr. Healy 
was at Windsor, copying a Lawrence portrait, when 
the Queen and Prince Albert, crossing the gallery, 
stopped to glance at his work. " As she wished for 
some details as to the order the King of France had 
given me, she turned to her husband, saying, ' Ask 
Mr. Healy if,' etc.; and Prince Albert put the ques- 
tions to me, as though he had been translating from 
a foreign tongue. Then she exclaimed, looking at 
my copy, ' It is extremely like,' and, with the slight- 
est possible bend of the head, passed on. I own 
that my American blood rather boiled in my veins." 
Not much more courteous was Mr. Healy's treat- 
ment at the hands of " Old Hickory " though the 
outcome of his visit to the veteran was successful. 
He had been commissioned to paint Jackson's por- 
trait by Louis Philippe, and found the old hero at 
the Hermitage, suffering from dropsy, propped in 
his great arm-chair, and in a thoroughly Jackson- 
ian temper. " Can't sit, sir, can't sit," he an- 
swered curtly, on learning Mr. Healy's errand. 
" But, General," urged the painter, " the King of 
France, who has sent me all this way on purpose to 
paint you, will be greatly disappointed." " Can't 
sit, sir, not for all the Kings in Christendom," 
still growled the veteran; and Mr. Healy beat a 
retreat, discomfited. The sitting was afterwards 
granted at the instance of Mrs. Jackson, wife of the 
General's adopted son, and a prime favorite. "Mrs. 
Jackson told me afterwards," says Mr. Healy, "that 
her task had not been an easy one. At her first 
words he exclaimed, ' Can't sit, child. Let me die 
in peace.' She insisted, used her best arguments 
all in vain. Finally, she said, < Father, I should so 
much like you to sit.' He hesitated, much moved 
by her earnestness, and, with tears in his eyes, an- 
swered, 'My child, I will sit.'" The portrait 
proved satisfactory, and it led to other commissions. 
The book is prettily gotten up, and the many por- 
traits after originals by Mr. Healy form an element 
of decided interest. 

The two handsome volumes contain-

soul, the brother and biographer of the poet whose 
name is so dear to all. This younger brother was 
also poet as well as preacher ; and though his poetic 
genius was of narrow range, yet it was true and del- 
icate in quality, and to it we owe some of the finest

modern hymns. They are hymns of universal re- 
ligion, tender, catholic, thoughtful. In these he 
made his chief contribution to the world ; by them 
he will be remembered and honored. He was a 
preacher of a very inclusive and progressive Chris- 
tianity, rational and yet spiritual, free and yet de- 
vout, radical and yet both appreciative and affirma- 
tive. As a pastor, he was the delight of children, 
the inspirer of youth, the teacher of mature men 
and women, the guide to peace for troubled souls, 
the comforter of those who mourn. He was not a 
pulpit orator, nor was he a church organizer ; but 
wherever he ministered, in Fall River, Brooklyn, 
or Germantown, he made himself felt in every good 
work and for every good cause. All lives that he 
touched he blessed and beautified ; his memory is 
treasured by all who knew him for the gracious and 
gentle spirit which he diffused wherever he went. 
The book of hymns, the joint work of himself and 
his intimate friend Samuel Johnson, was his main 
literary venture in early life. Later he contributed 
many articles to reviews and magazines on religious 
topics. His last years were devoted to the prepa- 
ration of the biography of his distinguished brother, 
which he completed to the satisfaction of all. His 
sweet and quiet spirit shows through all his pages, 
as it did in the man himself. Still, he was a man 
of courage and force who could act as well as write 
and preach. He was a brave reformer in his way, 
an early enemy of the institution of slavery, always 
nobly aggressive against all forms of sin. Mr. Jos- 
eph May, a worthy son of a distinguished father, 
Samuel J. May, has done his editorial work in these 
volumes with fine taste and with good judgment. 
In the first volume the life-story is presented largely 
in the words of Mr. Longfellow, taken from his 
correspondence with Samuel Johnson, Edward Ev- 
erett Hale, and a few others, whom we here meet 
in ways of pleasantness. The second volume con- 
tains the " Essays and Sermons." There is nothing 
very startling or luminous here, but the reader will 
find great themes treated in an instructive and help- 
ful manner. The spirit is broad, the thought is 
clear and strong, the language is chaste, the tone is 
reverent, the teaching is human and spiritual. 

Our candid friend " Max O'Rell," in 
his "John Bull & Co." (Webster), 
takes a wider geographical flight than 
usual. Having described, to the satisfaction of every- 
one but his victims, the senior member of this en- 
terprising firm, he further avenges Waterloo by 
" showing up the colonial branches in Canada, Aus- 
tralia, New Zealand, South Africa." " Max O'Rell " 
writes with all his old verve and shrewdness. Que- 
bec, Montreal, Toronto, Honolulu, Sydney, Mel- 
bourne, Adelaide, Cape Town, Kimberley, etc., are 
"written up" or written down in turn, and the 
local humors and foibles are hit off with characteristic 
point and good temper. Entertainment is not un- 
mingled with instruction. Writing, for instance, of 
the natives of Queensland, the author testifies, we

are glad to note, not only to the actual existence 
but to the imputed miraculous properties of our old 
friend the boomerang. Certain abortive experi- 
ments of our own with this instrument had weak- 
ened our faith in the current accounts of it ; but 
" Max O'Rell " has seen it, and seen it perform. The 
boomerang, he says, is a flat piece of wood about 
two and a half feet long, arched somewhat like a 
triangle. " The Queenslander spies an object at some 
distance from him. The boomerang, after having 
hit this object (if it is a living thing its end has 
come), mounts into the air like a bird, with a whirr- 
ing as of wings, to a height of sixty to eighty yards, 
describes immense circles, and, if cleverly thrown, 
comes back in its fall to the feet of the thrower." 
The most exacting could ask no more of it. The 
volume is generously illustrated with photographic 

prints. 

A guide-book bearing the name of 
Baedeker naturally supersedes all 
others, and it is with no little satis- 
faction that we place the new " Canada " on the 
shelf with all the rest. " The Dominion of Can- 
ada, with Newfoundland and an Excursion to Alas- 
ka " (imported by Scribner) is the full title of the 
book, and Mr. J. F. Muirhead, who did the "United 
States " so well for the same series, is the author. 
All the familiar features are here, the condensa- 
tion, the wealth of exact information, the supply of 
just those facts that travellers want to know, the 
convenient arrangement of routes, and the beautiful 
maps which so put to shame the best American ef- 
forts in this direction. The special features of the 
work are Dr. J. G. Bourinot's essay on "The Con- 
stitution of Canada," Dr. G. M. Dawson's " Geo- 
graphical and Geological Sketch," and the article 
on " Sports and Pastimes " contributed by Messrs. 
W. H. Fuller and E. T. D. Chambers. The article on 
Newfoundland is mainly the work of the Rev. Moses 
Harvey. Since the book is designed largely for En- 
glish tourists, it includes the transatlantic routes, as 
well as those from New York and Boston to Mon- 
treal and Quebec. A book like this does not offer 
much room for the personality of a writer, but 
touches are not wanting, as for example, in the de- 
scription of Cape Trinity on the Saguenay, in which 
we read : " The front of the cliffs is defaced by the 
staring advertisement of a Quebec tradesman, whom, 
it is hoped, all right-minded tourists will on this ac- 
count religiously boycott." This hope we are only 
too happy to echo. 

An engaging little work, and a choice 
piece of book-making withal, is the 
" Diary of Anna Green Winslow " 
(Hough ton), edited, with introduction and copious 
notes, by Mrs. Alice Morse Earle. The diarist 
was a bright little scion of sound Puritan stock, who 
in 1770 was sent, at the age of ten, from Nova 
Scotia to Boston, her parents' birthplace, to be duly 
" finished " at Boston schools by Boston teachers. 
Recording with delightful naivete her own small

experiences, and quietly regardful, like all sharp 
"little pitchers," of her unwary elders, she has left 
us a really capital silhouette of the domestic man-

need scarcely say to THE DIAL'S readers, is schol- 
arly and graceful ; and the notes evince her usual 
curious and accurate knowledge of things Colonial. 
There are several illustrations, including a portrait

prove a real godsend to artists, whether 
in words or in colors, who incline to Colonial motifs 
and wish to keep their works free from the anach- 
ronisms in matters of dress that mar too many 
portrayals of Colonial life. The book is a glos- 
sary, and it is something more, for the author sets 
forth her facts entertainingly as well as conveniently, 
and she has prefaced the glossary proper with an 
instructive " History of Colonial Dress." The work 
is based on facts drawn from old letters, newspa- 
pers, wills, court-records, etc., and while the New En- 
gland references predominate, the scarcer sources 
of the southern Colonies have been carefully ex- 
plored. While Mrs. Earle has done Dryasdust's 
work, she certainly has not, save in point of thor- 
oughness, done it in Dryasdust's way. The book is 
an exceedingly tasteful one outwardly. 

There is a limit to the license in point 
A superfluous book of details perm i t ted to those who at- 

about Napoleon. r , 

tempt to paint the characters of great 
men ; and we think M. Frederic Masson has passed 
it in his "Napoleon, Lover and Husband" (The 
Merriam Co.). Much of the book is indelicate, more 
of it is trivial, and some of its "revelations" are 
broad enough to explain the otherwise inexplicable 
fact that it has reached a fourteenth edition in 
France. The marital experiences of Josephine and 
Marie Louise have already been told ad nauseam ; 
and we see no good reason for dragging the vul- 
gar liaisons of Napoleon to light. The publishers 
have given the work a more respectable setting than 
it deserves. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Those who prefer tried old fiction to experimental 
new will find their account in some reprints that have 
just appeared. " Quits," by the Baroness Tautphceus, is 
published by the Putnams in two neat volumes, boxed, 
and styled the " Leonora " edition. The immortal 
" Three Musketeers " of Dumas appears in two very 
attractive volumes, illustrated by M. Leloir, from the 
press of Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. In two volumes, 
likewise, is Henry Kingsley's " Ravenshoe," issued by 
the Scribners, and to be followed by " Austin Elliot " 
and " Geoffrey Harnlin." The author was well worthy 
of this new edition, which will, we doubt not, find a 
hearty welcome. 

Reversing the title of her sprightly little book of 
three years ago on " Adopting an Abandoned Farm," 



Miss Kate Sanborn continues the tale of her rural ex- 
periences in the pretty volume entitled " Abandoning 
an Adopted Farm " (Appleton). The point of the book 
is expressed in its title. Like its predecessor, it is chatty 
and unconventional to a degree, and brimful of the 
humors of rustic life as seen through urban spectacles. 
Volume II. of "The Writings of Thomas Paine" 
(Putnam), edited by Mr. Moncure D. Conway, has just 
been published. It is a straight reprint, with but little 
in the way of introduction and annotation, of the books 
and tracts that date from 1779 to 1792. The Rights 
of Man," dating, complete, from 1792, fills the latter 
half of the volume. Of the other papers the most im- 
portant are the " Letter to the Abbe* Raynal," the tract 
on " Public Good," and the letters, from the Pennsyl- 
vania " Gazette," on " Peace, and the Newfoundland 
Fisheries." 

Dr. Paul Carus has collected into a volume of the 
" Religion of Science " library a large number of his 
fugitive papers upon philosophical subjects, and the col- 
lection, entitled " Fundamental Problems," is sent forth 
by the Open Court Publishing Co. The contents of this 
book are of an exceedingly varied character, and there 
is no unity of plan except that which comes from the 
unity of the underlying thought. The papers make sug- 
gestive popular reading upon the most serious problems 
that engage the human intellect, and there is doubtless 
somewhere a large audience of persons who will find 
them helpful. 

Tbe third and latest volume of the " Studies in Clas- 
sical Philology " (Ginn), issued from time to time by 
Cornell University, is a monograph upon " The Cult of 
Asklepios," by Dr. Alice Walton. Miss Walton briefly 
treats of the subject as a whole, and appends to the 
chapters which make up the work proper a number of 
very valuable indices, particularly one of " Literature 
and Inscriptions " and one (nearly thirty pages in length) 
of " Localities of Cults." In the latter index, the clas- 
sification is geographical, and authorities are given. 

The "Ariel Shakespeare" (Putnam), of which we 
have already noticed four instalments of seven volumes 
each, is now completed by the publication of a final 
batch of twelve volumes. Three of these are devoted, 
respectively, to the " Poems," the " Sonnets," and a 
" Glossary," thus eking out the full number of forty, of 
which the set consists. The set costs $16.00 in cloth, 
and $30.00 in full leather. It may also be had in sets 
of twenty double volumes, also in two styles, cloth and 
half-bound. In either of these forms, the edition is very 
neat and serviceable. We note also in this connection, 
" The Merchant of Venice " and " A Midsummer Night's 
Dream," in the " Temple Shakespeare " (Macmillan) . 
The bridge of the Rialto and the room in which Shake- 
speare was born are the etchings which serve as frontis- 
pieces. 

Recently published classical texts include Professor 
B. Perrin's edition (Ginn) of Books V.-VIII. of the 
" Odyssey," based upon Hentze's text in the Teubner 
series; a little book of exercises, called "The Gate to 
the Anabasis" (Ginn), by Mr. Clarence W. Gleason; 
Dr. John C. Rolfe's attractive edition (Allyn) of " Cor- 
nelii Nepotis Vitse," with many notes and exercises for 
translation into Latin ; an edition of the " Alcestis " (Mac- 
millan), supplied with much excellent apparatus by Dr. 
Mortimer Lamson Earle ; and a very small book of 
scenes from the " Persse " (Longmans), edited by the 
Rev. F. S. Ramsbotham.

[Nov. 1, 



LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 

The long-expected Whittier's Letters are to appear 
immediately. 

The letters of Matthew Arnold, we learn, are not 
likely to be published for some months. 

Mr. W. L. Courtney has succeeded Mr. Frank Harris 
as editor of " The Fortnightly Review." 

The author of " The Green Carnation," reviewed else- 
where in this issue, is said to be Mr. R. S. Hitchens. 

" The Jewish Library," a series of monographs by em- 
inent scholars, is to bear the imprint of Messrs. Mac- 
millan & Co. 

" The Calumet," a new inter-university magazine, 
edited by Mr. John Seymour Wood, will begin publica- 
tion in December. 

The Robert Clarke Co. of Cincinnati have in hand a 
reprint of Withers's " Chronicles of Border Warfare," 
to be edited by Mr. Reuben G. Thwaites. 

Dr. A. Conan Doyle gave a public lecture in Chicago, 
at the Central Music Hall, on the evening of October 
26. He was greeted by a very large audience. The 
lecture dealt with his own literary experiences, and a 
few brief readings from his books were interspersed. 

A new translation of " Paul and Virginia " is to be 
published soon by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. The 
translation is by Professor Melville B. Anderson, head 
of the English department at Stanford University, whose 
previous achievements as a translator justify the belief 
that this work will now become an English classic. 

Miss Harriet Monroe has been awarded damages to 
the extent of $5000 in her suit against the New York 
" World " for its unauthorized publication (from a stolen 
copy) of her " Ode " written for the opening of the Co- 
lumbian Exposition. We do not know whether or not 
the case is to be appealed, but if it is we trust that the 
higher courts will sustain so righteous a verdict. 

The " Hans Sachs Feier " will be held at Munich on 
the fourth, fifth, and sixth of this month. The celebra- 
tion will open on the fourth with a new play by Herr 
Martin Grief. On the fifth, being the poet's four hun- 
dredth birthday, several of his " Fastnachtsspiele " will 
be performed in the same manner as they were four 
hundred years ago, but supplemented by preludes, in- 
terludes, and epilogues. The performance of Wagner's 
" Meistersjnger," on the sixth, will conclude the national 
festival. 

Professor James Darmesteter, of the College de 
France, died on the twentieth of October, at the age of 
forty-five. He was a distinguished Orientalist, and for 
nearly ten years past has held the chair of Persian lit- 
erature and language at the College de France. He 
married, a few years ago, Miss A. Mary F. Robinson, 
the English poet. Early in the present year he added 
to his other duties the editorial conduct of the new 
" Revue de Paris." 

Professor John Nichol died on the twelfth of October, 
at the age of sixty-one. He was particularly inter- 
ested in American subjects, and was one of our warm- 
est defenders at the time of the Civil War. He pub- 
lished a " Sketch of American Literature " some years 
ago, and also wrote the " Encyclopaedia Britannica " 
article upon that subject. He held the chair of En- 
glish literature at the University of Glasgow for twenty- 
eight years. He also wrote the volumes on Byron and 
Carlyle in the " English Men of Letters " series. 



Mr. Theodore Watts has been making some very in- 
teresting inquiries into Shakespeare's connection with 
Gloucestershire, and is satisfied that the poet's evident 
familiarity with that county is owing to his having staid 
at Dursley with one of the Shakespeares who was living 
there during his lifetime. The Gloucestershire names 
of people mentioned by him are still largely represented 
in Dursley, and the descriptions of the neighborhood 
are so singularly accurate as to be easily identified. 

The Associated Press dispatches have recently sup- 
plied the newspapers with the following anecdote: " All 
London has been laughing this week over the published 
correspondence between Mr. W. S. Gilbert and an Amer- 
ican lady. The latter wrote asking for an interview. Gil- 
bert replied that his charge therefor would be twenty 
guineas. The lady replied that, while she could not go 
to that expense, she cheerfully looked forward to writ- 
ing his obituary for nothing. Thereupon the irascible 
humorist sent the correspondence to the ' Times ' with 
a very petulant letter, and the lady threatens to sue for 
libel." 

The widow of Leconte de Lisle is preparing her late 
husband's manuscripts for the press. She is working 
in collaboration with De He"redia, and they hope to col- 
lect sufficient material for a volume of poems, which 
shall add to the reputation of the author of " Poemes 
Barbares." The task is a difficult one, as the late poet 
was very critical about his own work, and they are 
anxious not to print anything which he would have re- 
fused to publish. Leconte de Lisle destroyed more than 
four thousand lines of verse which he deemed unsatis- 
factory, and what he published had been revised and 
revised again. 

The London " Bookman," in its monthly reports of 
publications having the largest sale in England, often 
affords interesting indications of the drift of public 
taste. According to the October lists, East London is 
still finding its favorite reading in " If Christ came to 
Chicago," but the title has disappeared from all the 
other lists, although it occupied the first place in many 
of them a few weeks ago. Novels are just now the fav- 
orites, even in pious Scotland; and "The Manxman" 
heads eight lists out of fifteen. " Perlycross " is the 
next in favor (although Glasgow does sandwich it in be- 
tween " Helps for Common Days " and a " Bible Dic- 
tionary ") ; while " Lourdes " and " Under the Red 
Robe " follow at no great distance. 

We learn that the trustees of the Newberry Library 
have called Mr. John Vance Cheney, of San Francisco, 
to the vacant librarianship. They are to be congratulated 
upon their choice. Mr. Cheney is a trained librarian 
and an accomplished man of letters, and Chicago will 
give him a cordial welcome. The following extract 
from the San Francisco " Argonaut " expresses the es- 
teem in which Mr. Cheney is held upon the Pacific 
Coast. We notice a slight inaccuracy concerning the 
relations of the late Dr. Poole to THE DIAL. While 
Dr. Poole was second to none in our affections as a con- 
tributor, he was never editorially connected with the 
review. Says "The Argonaut": 

" It is stated, on apparently good authority, that the 
trustees of the great Newberry Library, in Chicago, 
have decided to come to San Francisco for a successor 
to the late librarian, Dr. William Frederick Poole. The 
man whom they are said to have chosen is Mr. John Vance 
Cheney, now at the head of the San Francisco Free Pub- 
lic Library. It is a great compliment to Mr. Cheney. 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



271 



The Newberry Library, although not an old one, is al- 
ready a notable institution, and is so liberally endowed 
that it is destined to be the largest library in this coun- 
try, if not one of the largest in the world. Dr. Poole, 
its late librarian, was a scholar of ripe erudition, and a 
man of much experience in managing libraries. He was 
the compiler of the famous " Poole's Index to Period- 
ical Literature," an invaluable aid to writers and editors. 
He was also one of the editors of THE DIAL, a literary 
journal of which Chicago may well be proud, something 
which cannot be said of all her publications. It is Dr. 
Poole's place which Mr. Cheney is called upon to fill. 
We think he will fill it worthily. Mr. Cheney is a gen- 
tleman of New England ancestry, of liberal education, 
with the tastes of a scholar, and the temperament of a 
poet. That he can retain this last in the prosaic envir- 
onment of San Francisco shows that it is ingrained. His 
love of letters is strong. He has made an excellent official 
in charge of our small library here on the Pacific Coast, 
and he will make a better one in the larger sphere to 
which he is called. He will be more appreciated in 
Chicago than in San Francisco. When some San Fran- 
cisco millionaire leaves to the people such a magnificent 
endowment for a library as the late James Newberry 
left to Chicago, men like Mr. Cheney will doubtless 
think twice before they leave us, and the people will 
think twice before they let them go." 

IN MEMORIAM, EDWARD AUGUSTUS FREEMAN. 

Died at Alicante, Spain, March 16, 1892. 
Called to his rest, though not on that loved strand 
That claimed his last life-labor, now denied 
Its high fulfilment, yet he sleeps beside 
Blue Mediterranean waters, in a land 
Of palms and columns, over-towered of old 
By that white rock whose sunlit bastions brought 
Light to his darkening eyes. For there, too, rolled 
Th' " eternal strife " whose island-fields he sought 
From Mongibello to the wind-swept crest 
Of Julian and Astarte. East and West, 
Thraldom and freedom, were to him no theme 
Scholastic, but that mighty human heart, 
Outpouring words of thunder, still took part 
In each uprising, were it but a dream. 

(From Volume IV. of Freeman's "History of Sicily," 
by the editor of the volume, Mr. Arthur J. Evans.)

THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS 



EDITED BY <DR. ALBERT SHAW. 



TN January, 1890, a new magazine, with a new idea in periodical literature, made its appearance 
* in England. Its name, the " Review of Reviews," was suggestive of its purpose. Its aim was 
to give each month an epitome of current history and a summary of the world's best thought. In 
a single year it reached a sale of more copies than all the rest of the English reviews combined. 

In April, 1891, an American edition, under the editorial management of Dr. Albert Shaw, 
was brought out. This American edition was not a reprint of the English magazine. On the 
other hand, it dealt largely with American matters and was edited with perfect independence 
in its own office. The success of the American edition has become an event in the history of 
periodical literature in this country. During the first year it surpassed, in circulation, the most 
popular of the old and established reviews and before the close of the second year it was in close 
competition with the leading illustrated magazines. 

The principle on which the " Review of Reviews " has been edited, is that a magazine, made 
bright, timely, and comprehensive in text and illustration, and immediately in sympathy with 
every movement of social progress, would be considered indispensable. This theory has been 
vindicated in the career of the " Review of Reviews." The leaders in the religious and educa- 
tional worlds, the most prominent literary and professional men and women, have written to 
express their sense of the extraordinary ability and awakening power of this magazine.

A new work on Switzerland in two volumes, the first vol- 
ume covering the French and Italian Switzerland and the sec- 
ond the German-speaking cantons. It has been the aim of 
the author, who by long residence in the country is well fitted 
to write about it, to picture the real Switzerland and its peo- 
ple as they are, divested of the glamour of romance. His 
book will neither be a guide book, nor the old-fashioned rou- 
tine book of travel made up of transcripts from diaries or 
hastily written letters to indulgent friends. It will rather be 
a series of individual sketches, covering not only the salient 
points of attraction, but many places of interest out of the 
beaten track of the average tourist.

This somewhat unique volume of collected verse is the re- 
sult of many years' gleaning, from a great variety of sources, 
of all the best verse devoted to praise of the weed. It will 
be a matter of surprise to most readers to find how much has 
been written that is clever and bright on the theme of smok- 
ing. From the time of Raleigh and Spenser to the present 
day, not only the writers of lighter verse, but the more dig- 
nified of the poets have turned aside to sing of what one of 
the oldest of them called " The Plant of Great Renown."

PHILIP GILBERT HAMERTON. 

It was the fortune of the late Mr. Hamerton 
to achieve equal distinction in the art of liter- 
ature and the arts of design. Although his 
work as painter and etcher is not so well known 
in this country as his written work, it has re- 
ceived the warmest recognition in Europe, and 
given him honorable rank among the followers 
of the graphic arts. Carefully eschewing the 
methods by which artists of the baser sort seek 
for fame, and get at least notoriety, he quietly 
went his way, studied nature with loving assid- 
uity, mastered a great variety of technical pro- 
cesses, and produced in various mediums a long 
series of masterly works. His paintings were 
exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere ; 
his delightful etchings have served to illustrate 
many volumes of no less delightful text. The 
thoroughness and sincerity of his methods are 
well shown by his accounts of "A Painter's 
Camp in the Highlands " and of his canoe- 
voyage upon " The Unknown River," while the 
evidence for these qualities is strengthened by 
the fact of his deliberate choice, after much 
reflection, of a permanent residence in one of 
the most picturesque regions of Central France. 

Mr. Hamerton's literary activity was ex- 
tremely varied ; so varied, indeed, and so un- 
tiring, that it caused a certain suspicion of the 
seriousness of his work as painter and etcher. 
In spite of the long line of witnesses to the 
contrary, from Michel Angelo to Rossetti, or 
even to Mr. Du Maurier and Mr. Hopkinson 
Smith, there are some who will have it that the 
practitioner of both the graphic and the liter- 
ary art must be an amateur in at least one of 
the two. Undoubtedly, Mr. Hamerton's great 
reputation as a writer has, with many, caused 
his reputation as a painter to be overshadowed, 
and, with some, subjected it to contemptuous 
attack. But those who have known him best 
are the most cordial in their recognition of his 
dual distinction. His published work falls into 
two groups that of the books directly con- 
nected with his study and practise of the fine 
arts, and that of the books addressed to the 
larger public which is made up of all cultivated 
persons. Let us glance briefly at the two lists. 

In the first category come the two books 
already mentioned, and about a dozen others. 



284 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



The sumptuous works entitled " Etching and 
Etchers," " Landscape," " Man in Art," and 
" The Saone " will first occur to the reader. 
And besides these there are the " Thoughts 
about Art," " Painting in France after the De- 
cline of Classicism," " Contemporary French 
Art," "The Etcher's Hand -Book," "The 
Graphic Arts," " Imagination in Landscape 
Painting," "Portfolio Papers," and a life of 
Turner. It is difficult to overestimate the 
value of the polished, scholarly, and sane art- 
criticism contained within this body of writings. 
It has not the startling quality of such work 
as Mr. Ruskin's, and it sometimes approaches 
the commonplace ; but it is, as a whole, sym- 
pathetic, stimulating, and grateful. In this 
connection, we should note Mr. Hamerton's 
work in periodical literature. He was for a 
time art-critic of " The Saturday Review," he 
contributed much to " The Fine Arts Quar- 
terly Review," and was for many years the edi- 
tor of " The Portfolio." 

As a producer of literature addressed to the 
general public, Mr. Hamerton made his first 
bid for fame with a volume of verse, "The 
Isles of Loch Awe," published at the age of 
twenty-one. We owe to him three novels 
" Wenderholme," "Harry Blount," and " Mar- 
morne " and a long series of volumes wherein 
we find description, reflection, and wise comment 
on man and nature, and a genial and catholic 
outlook upon life. The most widely popular 
of these volumes is " The Intellectual Life," 
which was published a score of years ago, and 
has gone into numberless editions since. " The 
Sylvan Year " is science, art, and literature all 
combined ; it is one of the best of outdoor books. 
" Chapters on Animals " charmingly exhibits 
one aspect of his wide sympathies, and " Hu- 
man Intercourse " illustrates his many-sided 
nature. " Modern Frenchmen " is a series of 
five biographies, that of Henri Regnault being 
perhaps the best. " Paris in Old and Present 
Time " is a semi-historical study, contrasting 
the past and the new with a fine sense of ar- 
tistic effect and significant social changes. 
" Round My House " is a description of rural 
life in the part of France chosen by the author 
for his home some thirty years ago, and is one 
of the most intimate studies of the sort in ex- 
istence. The latest of the miscellaneous vol- 
umes contains the series of papers entitled 
" French and English." " Max O'Rell "to 
take his authority for whatever it is worth 
has declared Mr. Hamerton to be the only for- 
eigner who has written intelligently of the con- 



ditions of French life. At all events, it would 
be difficult to surpass the minute observation, 
the delicate discrimination, and the real insight 
displayed by this volume. Any book that 
makes for the comity of nations deserves praise, 
and we should be particularly grateful for a 
book which, like this, helps to break down the 
prejudices and misunderstandings that give rise 
to an imperfectly veiled antagonism between 
the two races that seem destined to preserve 
their long-held leadership of the civilization of 
the world. 

The chief facts of Mr. Hamerton's life may 
be briefly related. He was born September 10, 
1834, in Lancashire. Orphaned when a child, 
he was taken care of by an aunt who bestowed 
great pains upon his education. He fitted for 
Oxford, but, in the process, discovered a voca- 
tion for landscape painting, and, instead of go- 
ing to the University, went to London, and 
entered the studio of Mr. Pettill. In 1855, 
after publishing his volume of youthful verse, 
he went to Paris for further study. Here he 
remained for some years, then returned to En- 
gland, and started the " Painter's Camp " of 
which he has written so charmingly. At the age 
of twenty-four he married a French lady, Mad- 
emoiselle Gindriez, the daughter of a well- 
known Republican statesman. After his mar- 
riage, he spent some time in Scotland, then 
lived for three years at Sens, painting indus- 
triously, then fixed his permanent residence at 
Pre Charmoy, near Autun. Here, with occa- 
sional outings, he has since lived, and here he 
died on the sixth of November, 1894, at the 
age of sixty. Those who would like a fuller 
account of his life are referred to THE DIAL 
for December, 1884. To that issue, the late 
Horatio Nelson Powers, who knew him inti- 
mately, contributed a biographical sketch and 
study of character, based upon a full acquaint- 
ance with the facts, and inspired by the closest 
sympathy. We cannot better bring this article 
to an end than by extracting from the study 
above mentioned some of its most interesting 
passages. 

" Whatever science, observation, and actual practice 
can afford for an accurate judgment is at his command. 
He has lived with nature in the closest intimacy. He 
is familiar with the history of art, and with the methods 
of the great masters, so far as they are known. His 
mind is happily balanced and admirably constituted 
for the function of criticism. His sense of the beauti- 
ful is keen and cultivated, and the mood in which he 
lives is hospitable to truth of every kind. . . . 
He wisely directs his efforts in lines of production for 
which he has special aptitude, and he has the inde- 
pendence and courage that are inseparable from gifted

minds and influential utterance. His freedom from any- 
thing merely provincial, his delicate moral sensibility, 
the large and candid way in which he treats his subjects, 
are exceedingly agreeable to just-minded persons; while 
the value of his matter, the rare beauty of his style, and 
the delightful spirit that pervades his work, enhance 
the enjoyment and deepen the gratitude of the reader. 
He has made solid and admirable contributions to our 
literature, and can rest assured that he has stimulated 
and nourished our better natures by his appeal to our 
nobler faculties and susceptibilities." 



THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH 
LITERATURE. 

The ideal History of English Literature, like the 
great American novel, is always to be written. Never 
until the Elizabethan age had vanished into the tur- 
moil and smoke of the Civil War did there exist 
materials for the writing of such a history. Shake- 
speare's performance alone, however, was enough 
to make the thing possible and desirable, and con- 
sequently a large part of the chronicling and sifting 
of documents which in every case must precede the 
writing of a true history has been concerned with 
Shakespeare's name and works. The eighteenth 
century would have been a fitting time for the ac- 
complishment of this labor, were it not that the 
point of view of eighteenth century England, in re- 
spect of literature at least, was essentially provincial. 
Toward the end of the century a group of critics 
arose who began to have an understanding of what 
literature means ; and Dr. Hurd, the Wartons, and 
Gray began to turn the attention of scholars and 
readers to the greater literature which lay beyond 
the confines of England in the " Augustan " age. 
Gray, as we learn from his prose remains, long en- 
tertained the idea of writing a history of English 
poetry, and had gathered considerable material for 
that purpose ; but hearing that Thomas Warton had 
undertaken the task, he gave his notes into War- 
ton's hands. For some purposes and for a certain 
period Warton's history, especially in its modern 
form as edited and revised by a committee of schol- 
ars, still remains one of the best works that we have. 
But perhaps on the whole it was fortunate that no 
comprehensive and complete attempt at a history of 
English Literature was made during the eighteenth 
century. 

During the present century, and especially in this 
latter half of it, numerous flying shots at the mark 
have been tried. The skirmishing line has been 
sent farther out and the unexplored regions have 
been pretty well reconnoitred. The result is a con- 
siderable library of monographs, critical disquisi- 
tions, and short sketches, covering the entire field. 
One livre de fond Taine's History has appeared. 
Professor Henry Morley compiled an extensive 
chronicle of English Writers ; and an accomplished 
critic Mr. Stopf ord Brooke has put forth the first 
volume of an ambitious and hopeful history. Mr. 



Brooke's work is to be welcomed as an attempt to 
deal with the subject in a large and systematic way. 
It is a misfortune a misfortune not without some 
compensating advantages that with the exception 
of Taine's volumes we have practically no thorough 
and rationalized treatment of the literature of our 
mother tongue considered as an organic whole. 
There has been theorizing in abundance, but no his- 
tory in the proper sense of the word. No writer of 
the calibre or accomplishment of Gibbon, or Grote, 
or Motley, or Prescott, or Parkman has appeared 
in the field. It is true that the task is more diffi- 
cult in many ways, and less attractive, than the writ- 
ing of political history. It is one thing to write the 
history of great men in the midst of great events : 
it is quite another to trace the history of the human 
mind as expressed in literature. Moreover, few ex- 
cept historians care to study the documents of po- 
litical history, while the documents of literary his- 
tory are in everybody's hands. The historian of 
literature consequently is subjected to a much more 
variable criticism, and to the more vexatious in- 
quisition of subjective taste. 

Taine's great work exemplified with peculiar bril- 
liancy a certain theory of the writing of literary his- 
tory. It was a study of literature as a document 
for history, and an interpretation of the mind of a 
race from its milieu and its essential tendencies. 
The theory seems to have gained few followers. 
Recent German and English writers, of whom Mr. 
Brooke is in some sense a representative, while fixing 
their attention, like M. Taine, on the fundamental 
characteristics and on the growth of the national 
mind, have not neglected the study of literature for 
its intrinsic value. A third method, which was 
hinted at by the late Professor Minto in his u Manual 
of English Prose " and in the " Characteristics of 
English Poets," is to centre the interest upon the 
greatest writers in the national literature, studied 
not so much for what they have in common with 
one another and with the host of minor producers, 
but for what is characteristically theirs, the gift of 
genius and dower of fortune, for what they con- 
tribute to the world's store of that 

" Heavenly quintessence they still 
From their immortal flowers of poesy, 
Wherein, as in a mirror, we perceive 
The highest reaches of a human wit." 

The danger of a method like that of Taine is to 
neglect in literature precisely that which gives to it 
its fundamental value for mankind. The danger of 
the German method is lack of method, the dissi- 
pation of attention over insignificant men and pe- 
riods (insignificant, that is, for the final compte rendu 
of literature). Still, the antiquarian and scholar will 
not consent to forego much of such dissipation. The 
difficulty of the last method is to find among his- 
torians a wit of sufficient reach to compass it. But 
for the permanent uses of mankind a history at- 
tempted after this method is what is always needed, 
but seldom obtained.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE SAN FRANCISCO VIGILANTES AGAIN. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Touching your recent criticism of Mr. John Fiske's 
approval of the San Francisco Vigilantes, permit me to 
suggest that the stigma ordinarily attaching to lynch 
law does not fairly attach to the measures of that fa- 
mous committee. Lynch law is reprehensible in that 
it needlessly supersedes established law and usurps the 
office of regular tribunals, thus sanctioning the law- 
lessness it assumes to repress. In the absence of such 
law and tribunals the community resorts to summary 
methods of self-protection, for the same reason and 
with the same right that the individual knocks down 
the footpad in the absence of the police. It is the 
dernier ressort. Anyone who knows anything of the 
early history of California knows that, at the period 
alluded to by Mr. Fiske, there were no regular and ef- 
ficient means for the administration of justice. It was 
the primitive regime of the strong hand ; and whether 
the hand of the outlaw or that of the bona fide settler 
were the stronger, had to be decided by the young so- 
ciety, and that quickly. On the appearance of the 
" gold fever," desperadoes from all parts of the Union, 
and from Australia, had swelled the tide of emigration 
to the coast; and quiet citizens were literally at the 
mercy of thugs and cut-throats until the swift reprisals 
of the Vigilantes brought about inchoate law and order. 
Doctrinaire professors of absolute social ethics, who 
censure the rough-and-ready expedients to which the 
early Californians were driven in defence of their lives 
and homes, should remember that these expedients were 
born of grim and pressing necessity. Action not cogi- 
tation, speed not ceremony, was the essential order of 
the day in stormy '49. If revolutions, as Mirabeau said, 
" are not made with rose-water," neither, one may add, 
are crude and turbulent communities controlled with it. 

W. R. K. 

Pittsfield, Mass., Nov. 8, 1894. 

[Our correspondent's illustration of an individual 
knocking down a footpad in the absence of the po- 
lice is a very good one. Nobody questions such 
right of self-protection, which is as strictly a legal 
as it is a natural right. But the individual, if he 
be also a good citizen, having knocked down his as- 
sailant, turns him over to the first policeman he can 
find, and if necessary aids the officer in making the 
arrest, instead of calling a party of friends to over- 
power the officer and hang his prisoner to the near- 
est lamp-post. The San Francisco Vigilantes began 
operations, not by knocking down footpads, but by 
breaking into the county jail and taking out pris- 
oners who were awaiting trial, and hanging them. 
The police power of the city, the sheriff and his 
posse, the governor and the judiciary, and even the 
state militia, all the regularly constituted author- 
ities of the city, county, and state, were forcibly 
resisted and defied. The answer of the Vigilantes 
that these officials were inefficient or corrupt, and 
the only way to get rid of them was to overthrow 
them vi et armis can hardly be accepted as suffi- 
cient. It is hard to understand why, if the good 
citizens of San Francisco were able to so outnumber 



and overwhelm the bad citizens by physical force, 
they should have thought themselves unable to de- 
feat them at the polls ; why the great zeal and 
energy expended by the Vigilantes in the " summary 
methods of self -protection " should not have been 
directed to the work of upholding and improving 
the machinery of the law. San Francisco in 1856 
was by no means an unorganized community, des- 
titute of established law or regular tribunals, as our 
correspondent assumes ; and one smiles to think of 
his distrusted " doctrinaire professor " in the per- 
son, say, of General Sherman, who occupied an offi- 
cial position in California at that time, and whose 
very explicit testimony and very clearly expressed 
opinions on the Vigilantes and their work may be 
found in the recently-published Letters of General 
and Senator Sherman. We would not judge the 
Vigilantes harshly ; they were confronted by pecu- 
liar conditions and exasperations, and no doubt 
worked, as they believed, for the good of the com- 
munity. But we see no escape from the conclusion 
that they worked by wrong and extremely danger- 
ous methods, the evil effects of which have not yet 
wholly disappeared ; and no good can come from the 
glossing of their errors by historians like Mr. Fiske 
and our correspondent who defends him. EDR.

THE WORK OF PREPARATORY SCHOOLS 

IN ENGLISH. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In THE DIAL of October 16, Professor Clapp, of Illi- 
nois College, suggests " a series of papers setting forth 
the work done in teaching English at representative 
fitting-schools," as a possible explanation why " very 
many of the students who come to college from prepar- 
atory schools are almost hopeless, so far as appreciating 
literature is concerned." I have no disposition to con- 
tribute to this presentation, or even to claim eligibility 
therefor ; but I wish to divert this invitation into a 
ground for reiterating some of the peculiar difficulties 
to which secondary schools must adjust themselves as 
the conditions of their existence, while colleges persist 
in evading the difficulties they are better situated for 
controlling: in this way I shall endeavor to emphasize 
the selfishness of the college attitude towards secondary 
schools and society at large. These difficulties of sec- 
ondary schools are less likely than ever to be compre- 
hended by the college instructor or the general critic, 
now that the very existence of any difficulties in the 
conduct of schools has been so successfully disguised by 
the great decemvirate; and it is a public duty, as well 
as an honorable self-protection, for conscientious school- 
masters to present their side of the question. 

The proposed series would not give the explanation 
that Professor Clapp seeks, because the inadequacies of 
these students in literary appreciation depend not so 
much on lack or poverty of methods as on lack and pov- 
erty of interesta lack fatal in any original or second- 
ary form of creative effort, under which head falls the 
instinctive criticism that begets appreciation. Such ap- 
preciation belongs to the maturity of college life and 
the sphere of electives : its proper atmosphere is not the 
school, already overburdened with graduated measures 
of Latin, Greek, mathematics, and the other weighed in-

gradients of entrance-requisites, all of them (except the 
new English, vaguely and inconsistently apotheosized) 
enumerated in detail and ganged by the vagaries of ex- 
aminational convenience and vicissitude. Such appre- 
ciation might in a degree be prepared for in the home; 
but a practical business and a practical scientific age, a 
society leisurely only for luxurious amusement, for vi- 
carious thought or vicarious sport, a generation with no 
sentiment but sensation, afford few such homes. On 
the other hand, if colleges are still dissatisfied with the 
tribute of helpless schools, quousque tandem ? Surely, 
appreciation is the one reservation a college profes- 
sor might be expected to demand for his own, for him- 
self and his specialty. Schools have long ago real- 
ized that all the teaching a boy gets is at school: must 
we now, while the friction of training still burns, expect 
him to exult in the discipline of coercion or restraint ? 
It is after the castigation that mothers teach they have 
been cruel to be kind : do colleges expect schools to de- 
range the steps of the process, when the college reserves 
to itself the name of Alma Mater ? The school can do 
no better than the lightning-rod man who sells to peo- 
ple that do not want to buy: the college must reconcile 
purchasers to their bargains, and lead them to detect 
unsuspected glories in their possessions. 

To secure appreciation of any study is given only to 
exceptional teachers and pupils in exceptional relations: 
even in the exact sciences, beginning with arithmetic, 
the theoretical discussion is always neglected in the 
hurry towards the " answer " ; in literature, whose aim 
as a study is not the organization and manipulation of 
enumerated details, but identity with a sense and a 
spirit, the lack of a practical nucleus is an almost over- 
powering difficulty, especially in an age that, in the face 
of library statistics, reads only for information, or diver- 
sion, or relief from thought. In teaching literature, the 
methods are few and old; and the work of appreciation 
is not furthered by methods so much as by sympathy, 
to which few are susceptible. Interest cannot be man- 
ufactured, and no way of inoculating pupils with gen- 
uine interest has yet been discovered: certainly, college 
professors have made no such discovery, for no class of 
instructors has had smaller influence on their pupils, as 
the pupils themselves testify. 

Moreover, in teaching English to English-speaking 
boys there is one special difficulty. Original work, in- 
volving grammatical and rhetorical facility, is hard work 
in any language; in his own, as the boy already enjoys 
the practical advantage of speech, which appears to him 
the culmination of linguistic mastery, and as he does not 
find himself impelled towards written expression, he 
looks on required composition as arbitrary, and refuses 
his interest. Composition without interest, under such 
disciplinary conditions as the present age does not favor, 
can indeed be taught, but is not worth teaching. 

THE DIAL'S recent series on the teaching of English 
at our colleges and universities has its value; but it 
does not prove that, in this department more than in 
others, colleges hold themselves responsible for teach- 
ing as distinguished from furnishing opportunities for 
learning, which is a very different thing indeed. At 
this moment, the colleges, having suffered many things 
in dreams, because of English are going through various 
types of penitential spasms with the characteristic fervor 
of devotees. But if English is just now so all-important 
a matter, why have they been so long finding it out ? 
and, now that they have satisfied themselves of its im- 
portance, why do they not aid the schools toward de- 



termining the best practical procedure for attaining its 
proper position and proportions ? 

To follow Cornell, and exclude all candidates who do 
not come up to their standard in English alone, is illog- 
ical, so long as not all college presidents can spell, and 
reports to college boards on English need not conform 
to the college's own resident authority. To assign for 
compositions such subjects as Columbia has of late been 
giving shows absolute ignorance of the youth of to-day, 
their environment and the atmosphere they breathe, and 
what schools can make of them. Harvard's examina- 
tions in English are perfunctory for a " pass " and almost 
exclusive for a " credit." Yale's examinations are rather 
in literature than in English. To make the writing of 
English an excluding condition for entrance is, in view 
of the lottery of examinations, a questionable strain of 
deglutition: to make the English examination a test of 
memory as to the contents of a few books is to lay the 
stress wrongly. To know, however well, the contents 
of a few books implies no sympathy with literature, 
which, in the wide access to electives, is more than likely 
to be ignored or pursued as a " snap "; and, for a mere 
draft on the memory, history would be better from 
every point of view. 

If colleges would help the work that schools confess 
their inability to perform without projecting the gen- 
eral difficulties into the vantage-ground of the college, 
and if college professors would learn the duties and the 
functions of teaching and examining, then the situation 
would be somewhat improved. But it will not be en- 
tirely corrected until the times alter; these are evil 
times for the work of education: the pound of flesh is 
hard enough to get, and the blood is almost certain to 
be all spilled before we get the weight.

THE PROPOSED SOCIETY OF COMPARATIVE 

LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Whenever a new undertaking is proposed, it is well 
to have set before us its comical aspect. Rarely does 
a new idea, a new project, a new voyage of discovery 
offer itself for consideration without calling down the 
facetious disparagement of the conservers. The pro- 
posed Society of Comparative Literature is to be con- 
gratulated on having this almost ritualistic service 
performed for it by such a high priest of literature as 
Professor Albert S. Cook of Yale University (THE DIAL, 
Sept. 1, p. 110). But, now that we have had our smile 
upon the seeming incongruities pointed out by Professor 
Cook, is the project to be laid aside as unworthy of se- 
rious consideration ? Is the field of literature to be re- 
garded as essentially limited ; as " a product of culture "; 
as an almost exclusively race affair; as a " corpus " set 
off by itself and regulated by laws or " canons of criti- 
cism " which refuse to reveal themselves more clearly 
or to take on new and richer meanings when considered 
in their relations to more primitive modes of human 
expression ? However we may answer for ourselves 
such questions as these, however college policies may 
legislate, the fact remains that there are pioneers, " spe- 
cialists " if you like, who, acting in its deepest meaning 
Bacon's well-worn apothegm, " I take all knowledge to 
be my province," push out through the tangled wilder- 
ness, if need be into the very heart of savagedom, and 
at least register its pulsations. To establish communi-

cations with these individual workers; to stimulate re- 
newed investigations; to correlate the results; to make 
these results common property; to trace the evolution, 
to discover the laws of various literary types, with the 
end in view of putting the existing standards of literary 
judgment on a more secure and rational basis, these 
are some of the aims, as I understand them, suggested 
by Professor Gayley in his advocacy of a Society of 
Comparative Literature. 

Such an organization as this demands no defense or 
apology, but rather hearty welcome, and lively interest 
to know more of its purposes and plans. It is hardly 
fair to require that it demonstrate at the outset how its 
researches are going to affect favorably existing " canons 
of literary criticism." That science works by faith and 
not by sight is, I presume, a trite idea. In the case 
before us the faith seems to be, that if these precious 
" canons of criticism " are to be kept from hardening 
into barren military rules, or from mouldering into form- 
less sentiment, they must be played upon, remodelled, 
reformed, and builded anew by intelligence working in 
the light of an ever-broadening outlook, in the light 
of the ideal university spirit. If the Dahomeans have 
an epic, by all means let us have it; nor can we do with- 
out the lyrics of the South Sea Islanders; least of all 
can we spare the rich heritage of Persia, China, and 
Japan. Perhaps, after all the material is collected, 
sorted, sifted, and set in order, so that its meaning can 
be plainly read, there will be some of the learned folk, 
who, sated for a time with the rich " products of culture " 
on exhibition in the white temples of reconstructed 
Greece and Rome, will not count as wasted a few mo- 
ments spent in the Midway Plaisance of the World's 
Literature. WILLARD C. GORE.

ETHICS IN JOURNALISM. A WARNING FOR 

THE UNINITIATED. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A personal experience has sometimes a lesson which 
requires us to share it with the brethren. Hinc illce la- 
crimce. 

To an acquaintance, editor of a great orthodox reli- 
gious weekly, I sent last January, by invitation, an essay, 
the result of several weeks' labor. Under the circum- 
stances the retention of a fair copy seemed needless. A 
prompt reply from the reverend editor expressed doubts 
as to certain veiled allusions to certain ancient vices, 
which might disturb his innocent circle of readers. Upon 
this, unlimited use of the shears was straightway granted. 

After this, a great silence. At intervals of about a 
month, five or six inquiries were made. Stamps enough 
to send the paper around the world were forwarded. A 
" reply postal card " was tried, with a request pathetic 
as Catullus's for " Paulum quid libet allocutionis." I 
appealed, also, to the same high morality which had led 
the editor to protect his readers from any hint of an- 
tique wickedness. All in vain. No echo came back. 

Finally, in the present month, a metropolitan critic, 
who is also a professional " protector of the poor " au- 
thor, was retained, and moderately feed. He, among 
other efforts, made a personal appeal to the proprietor 
of the weekly. Finally, October 20, came the thrice- 
prayed-for long-despaired-of essay, stript of its covers 
and quite forlorn. The accompanying letter was clever, 
considering all things: "I neglected to answer your in- 
quiries, in constant expectation of coming across the 



article. ... I have at last found it, after I had sup- 
posed that it was irrecoverably lost." 

And the moral ? Always keep your best copy ; and 
" go into literature," especially in the direction here in- 
dicated, for amusement, if you choose, or from a sense 
of duty, or to cultivate the Christian virtues, but not 
in quest of cash or courtesy. WM. C. LAWTON.

CARCASSONNE. 

A NEW VERSION OF AN OLD FAVORITE. 
(From the French of Gustave Nadaud.) 

"I'm an old man; I'm sixty years; 

I 've worked hard all my life, 
Yet never have gained my heart's desire, 

With all my toil and strife. 
Ah, well I see that here below 

There is perfect joy for none; 
My dearest wish is unfulfilled, 

I have never seen Carcassonne ! 

" The city lies almost in sight, 

Beyond the mountains blue; 
But yet to reach it one must needs 

Five weary leagues pursue, 
And then, alas, the journey back ! 

I know not how 'twere done: 
The ripening vintage fears the frost, 

I shall never see Carcassonne ! 

" 'T is said that in that favored place 

All days are holidays, 
With happy folks in robes of white 

Passing along the ways; 
'T is said there are castles there as grand 

As those of Babylon, 
And a Bishop and two Generals there, 

I shall never know Carcassonne ! 

" The Vicar a hundred times is right, 

We are weak and foolish all; 
And in his sermon he teaches us 

That ambition makes men fall. . . . 
But yet if I could somehow find 

Two days under Autumn's sun, 
My God ! but I would die content 

After having seen Carcassonne ! 

" I ask thy pardon, gracious God, 

If my prayer offendeth Thee ! 
We strive to peer beyond our sight, 

In age as in infancy. . . . 
My wife and son, they both have been 

As far as to Narbonne; 
My godson has seen Perpignan, 

And I 've never seen Carcassonne ! " 



An aged peasant thus complained, 

Bowed down with toil and care; 
I said to him, " Arise, my friend, 

Together we '11 go there." 
We set out on the morrow morn; 

But our journey was scarce begun 
When the old man died upon the road, 

He had never seen Carcassonne !

THE IJIFE AND WORK OF EDISON.* 

Mr. Thomas A. Edison is so unique a figure 
in modern scientific and industrial affairs that 
the public is naturally eager for details of his 
wonderful career and character. The latest 
contribution to this store of information is made 
by Mr. W. K. L. Dickson and Mr. Antonia 
Dickson, in a large and handsome volume, with 
liberal illustrations. Barring a certain inflation 
of style, the work is a very satisfactory one 
full, graphic, and lucid in its technical descrip- 
tions. The authors, who have been for some 
years attaches of the Edison works at Orange, 
N. J., have had unusual facilities for securing 
full and accurate data, Mr. Edison having him- 
self partly supervised the biographical portion 
of the work, besides aiding in the history and 
description of his chief inventions. The book 
is therefore to a certain extent autobiograph- 
ical, and it is likely to remain for some time 
the standard " Life " of the great inventor. 

Mr. Edison's turn for invention and experi- 
ment showed itself early, his maiden essay in 
the line of telegraphy being made while he was 
still a newsboy on the Port Huron Railway. 
It cannot be said that the issue of this venture, 
in which he was joined by his friend James 
Ward, was premonitory of the later Edisonian 
marvels. 

"A line was constructed between the boys' homes, 
consisting of an ordinary stovepipe wire, insulated with 
bottles, and crossed under a busy thoroughfare by means 
of an old cable rescued from the bed of the Detroit 
river. The first magnets were wound with wire, swathed 
in ancient rags, and a piece of spring brass formed the 
key. With a view to generating a current, and with a 
mind somewhat hazy on the score of static and dynamic 
electricity, Edison secured two Brobdingnaggian cats, 
with volcanic tempers, attached a wire to their legs, 
administered a violent amount of friction to their backs, 
and breathlessly awaited developments. . . . The fe- 
line mind, concentrated on personal grievances, refused 
to lend itself to science, and the test resulted in a frantic 
stampede, enlivened by whoops and splutters." 

Edison received his first regular lessons in 
telegraphy from Mr. J. U. Mackenzie, a grate- 
ful station agent at Mt. Clemens, Michigan, 
whose child's life he had saved at the risk of 
his own. Touching his pupil's progress, Mr. 
Mackenzie testifies that " at the expiration of 
three months he could teach me, and was quite 
eligible for the appointment (at Port Huron)

which I secured for him at that time." The 
Port Huron position was held for just three 
months. The future " Wizard of Menlo " was, 
in fact, naturally something of a rolling stone ; 
and this trait, coupled with a marked talent 
for mischief, kept him revolving pretty rapidly 
from post to post, until his real abilities came 
to light. Leaving Port Huron, he drifted to 
Stratford, Canada, whence (after a brief and 
erratic career) he returned to Port Huron, and 
soon distinguished himself by bringing his pro- 
fessional knowledge to bear on a novel set of 
conditions. The winter had been a hard one, 
and the enormous masses of ice which had 
formed in the river between Port Huron and 
Sarnia had made it impassable, besides cutting 
off telegraphic communication. The situation 
was serious, but Edison was equal to it. 

" Jumping on a locomotive he sent the incisive whistle 
over the ice-bound waters to the rhythmic cadences of 
the Morse alphabet Hello, Sarnia; Sarnia, do you get 
what I say ? ' No response from the Sarnian operator. 
Again and again the short and long toots shaped them- 
selves into the dots and dashes of telegraphy, until at 
last, while the spectators on the river bank quivered 
with pent-up excitement, the answer came, clear, cheery, 
and intelligible, and the connection between the two 
cities was resumed." 

Mr. Edison had now become an expert oper- 
ator, and had thenceforth little difficulty in get- 
ting employment, but a good deal of difficulty 
in keeping it, his love of fun and experiment 
(especially the latter) usually getting him, 
sooner or later, into hot water with his chiefs. 
His conge from one office (the appointments 
of which he had partly ruined with sulphuric 
acid) was accompanied with the curt explana- 
tion that " what they wanted was operators, 
and not experimenters." After the Sarnia ex- 
ploit, he filled in rapid succession positions 
at Adrian, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Memphis, 
Louisville, and again at Cincinnati, signaliz- 
ing his sojourns and hastening his hegiras in 
the usual way ; and in 1868 he returned to 
Port Huron for a period of eighteen months, 
which brought him to his twenty-first year. At 
this time an ingenious telegraphic device of his 
was adopted by the Grand Trunk Company, 
which (with the proverbial munificence of cor- 
porations) rewarded him with a free pass to 
Boston, where he found employment in the 
Franklin telegraph office. Mr. Edison de- 
scribes his Boston advent with characteristic 
humor : 

" My peculiar appearance caused much mirth, and, 
as I afterwards learnt, the night operators consulted to- 
gether how they might put up a job on the jay from 
the woolly West.' I was given a pen and assigned the

New York No. 1 wire . . . the conspirators having 
arranged to have one of the fastest senders in New York 
send the despatch and ' salt ' the new man. ... I had 
long since perfected myself in a simple and very rapid 
style of handwriting susceptible of being increased from 
forty-five to fifty-four words a minute. This was sev- 
eral words faster than any operator in the United States. 
Soon the New York man increased his speed, to which 
I easily adapted my pace. This put my rival on his 
mettle, and he put on his best powers, which, however, 
were soon reached. At this point I happened to look 
up, and saw the operators all looking over my shoulder, 
with their faces shining with fun and excitement. I knew 
then that they were trying to ' put up a job ' on me, but 
kept my own counsel and went on placidly with my work, 
even sharpening my pencil at intervals, by way of extra 
aggravation. The New York man then commenced to 
slur over his words, running them together and sticking 
the signals; but I had been used to this style of tel- 
egraphy and was not in the least discomfited. Finally, 
when I thought the fun had gone far enough, I quietly 
opened the key and remarked, Say, young man, change 
off and send with your other foot ! ' This broke the New 
York man all up, and he turned the job over to another 
man to finish." 

It is needless to say that " the jay from the 
woolly West " at once took his place as an es- 
teemed member of the Franklin fraternity. 
Mr. Edison's first patented invention was a 
vote recorder, exclusive rights on which were 
obtained in 1869 ; and from that time on his 
marvels have followed each other as regularly 
and surprisingly as the objects fall from the 
juggler's hat. Capital, once aware of his tal- 
ents, was not slow to exploit them. In 1872 
a committee of the Gold and Stock Telegraph 
Company waited on him to negotiate for the 
rights to his numerous stock printers and kin- 
dred appliances. His dealings with this body 
are best told in his own words: 

" I had made up my mind that five thousand dollars 
would be about right, but rather than not sell the in- 
ventions, I would take anything, no matter what, as I 
needed money sorely for my further experiments. With 
these dazzling expectations I received the committee. 
' Well, Mr. Edison,' said one of the members, ' how much 
do you want for your devices ? ' ' I do not know what 
they are worth,' I replied, make me an offer.' < Well, 
continued the speaker, ' how would forty thousand dol- 
lars strike you ? ' I believe I could have been knocked 
down with the traditional feather, so astonished was I 
at the sum." 

In 1873 Mr. Edison's services were formally 
retained by the Western Union and Gold Stock 
Companies, and the Edison Laboratory and 
Factory, the precursor of the great plants at 
Menlo Park and Orange, was opened. The 
fiscal regime of the new establishment was, to 
say the least, peculiar, though quite character- 
istic of the director. Says Mr. Edison : 

"I kept only pay-roll accounts, no other kind; pre- 
served the bills and generally gave notes in payment. 



The first intimation that a note was due was the protest, 
after which I had to hustle around and raise the money. 
This saved the humbuggery of bookkeeping, which I 
never understood, and the arrangement had besides the 
advantage of being cheaper, as the protest fees were 
only one dollar and fifty cents." 

The workshop methods were as irregular as 
the fiscal ones, and must have resulted in hope- 
less anarchy but for the spirit of good-fellow- 
ship and cooperation that prevailed. Mr. Edi- 
son was the friend of his men and their co- 
worker, and they appreciated the fact as men 
always do. A strike at the works was a moral 
impossibility, and the only " labor question " 
was the normal one how to make labor arrive 
quickest at the best results. " We had," says 
Mr. Edison, " no fixed hours, but the men, so 
far from objecting to the irregularity, often 
begged to be allowed to return and complete 
certain experiments upon which they knew my 
heart was set." His boyish love of fun was not 
quenched by his growing fame and responsibil- 
ities. There were times when his joyous nature 
fairly bubbled over, sweeping all decorum be- 
fore it in a tide of hilarity. 

The great plant at Menlo Park was the re- 
sult partly of the demand for increased manu- 
facturing facilities, partly of the modest inven- 
tor's desire to escape the visitors who thronged 
the Newark laboratory. " When the public 
tracks me out here," remarked Mr. Edison, " I 
shall simply have to take to the woods." The 
new establishment was equipped to the point 
of luxury, its appointments including a costly 
scientific library and a pipe organ, the latter 
being brought into play "whenever, in Mr. 
Edison's opinion, music's magic strains were 
needed to soothe the savage breasts of his em- 
ployees." The report of the " Wizard of Menlo 
Park " soon overran the world ; the wildest 
tales of his achievements, habits, business re- 
lations, finding ready credence. An article in 
the Paris "Figaro," in 1878, headed "Cet 
etonnant Eddison" is worth quoting. " M. 
Eddison's " latest invention, the a5rophone, is 
thus lucidly outlined, and the inventor himself 
described as he appears to the imagination of 
a Frenchman : 

" It is a steam machine which carries the voice a dis- 
tance of eight kilometres. You speak in the jet of va- 
por ; a friend previously warned understands readily 
words at a distance of two leagues. Let us add that 
the friend can answer you by the same method. . . . 
It should be understood that M. Eddison does not be- 
long to himself; he is the property of the telegraph 
company, which lodges him in New York at a superb 
hotel, keeps him on a luxurious footing and pays him a 
formidable salary, so as to be the one to know of and

profit by his discoveries. The company has, in the dwell- 
ing of Eddison, men in its employ who do not quit him 
for a moment, at the table, in the street, in the labora- 
tory. So that this wretched man, watched as never was 
a malefactor, cannot give a second's thought to his per- 
sonal affairs without one of his guards saying : ' M. 
Eddison, a quoi pensez-vous ? ' >: 

That most fascinating of Edisonian wonders, 
the phonograph, owed its inception partly to ac- 
cident ; and it is interesting to note how slight 
a spark could fire the train of the inventor's 
constructive fancy. Says Mr. Edison : 

" I discovered the principle by the merest accident. 
I was singing to the mouth-piece of a telephone, when 
the vibrations of the voice sent the fine steel point into 
my finger. That set me to thinking. If I could record 
the actions of the point and send the point over the same 
surface afterward, I saw no reason why the thing would 
not talk. I tried the experiment first on a strip of tel- 
egraph paper, and found that the point made an alpha- 
bet. I shouted the words < Halloo ! Halloo ! ' into the 
mouth-piece, ran the paper back over the steel point, 
and heard a faint ' Halloo ! Halloo ! ' in return. I de- 
termined to make a machine that would work accurately, 
and gave my assistants instructions, telling them what 
I had discovered. They laughed at me. That's the 
whole story. The phonograph is the result of the prick- 
ing of a finger." 

The phonograph took the Old World by 
storm. At the French Exposition of 1889, 
30,000 people daily visited the phonograph de- 
partment no nationality, from the impassive 
Turk to the excitable Gaul, resisting the temp- 
tation of hearing its tones reproduced. " Never 
before was such a collection of the languages 
of the whole world made. It was the first lin- 
guistic concourse since Babel times." During 
the Handel Festival of the same year, the most 
striking phonographic results were achieved 
a gigantic horn placed in the concert room 
gathering to the ear of the instrument the com- 
poser's harmonies, in the several vocal and in- 
strumental settings. 

" Four thousand voices, a thunderous organ, and a 
mammoth orchestra, combined in the exposition of Han- 
del's ' Israel in Egypt,' and this Titanic volume of sound, 
with its finer contrasts of light and shade, was reproduced 
by the phonograph in a manner little short of the mirac- 
ulous." 

The name of Mr. Edison's inventions is le- 
gion. He has wrought in a year more marvels 
than were feigned or dreamed of in the Rosi- 
crucian philosophy ; but he might, one would 
think, safely rest his fame on this instrument 
alone, which stores for all time all accents, 
from the notes of " Music's golden tongue " to 
the drone of the curtain lecture, out-Boswelling 
Boswell's literalness, and conjuring back at our 
bidding from the undiscovered country " the 
sound of a voice that is still." ^ Q, m j.

at last be coming into their right of recogni- 
tion, judging from the books about them which 
are accumulating. We have at once four earn- 
est writers, men of gifts and culture, giving 
their loving thought and the fruit of their care- 
fully-gained knowledge to the portrayal of the 
character and charms of the " winged-folk in 
feathers," " our little brothers in the air," who 
have shared our planet with us for many ages 
and received little or no appreciative attention. 
In this stage of the earth's existence, three 
groups of animals are in the ascendant : human 
beings, birds, and insects. It is the period of 
their culmination, all other races having passed 
their noontide in a previous aeon, and now be- 
ing in a condition of decline the afternoon 
or evening of their span of life. 

We have a number of admirable text-books 
upon ornithology, suited to the student's needs, 
but they are too costly and technical for the 
popular reader. Just what to recommend to 
such, as a manual that will help him best to an 
acquaintance with our common birds, has been 
a puzzle. Among the books in the quartet now 
before us is one which goes far toward supply- 
ing the long-felt want. It is entitled "The 
Birds About Us," and is written by Dr. Charles 
Conrad Abbott. The author is widely known 
as a faithful investigator in various fields of 
natural science, and as a contributor of acknowl- 
edged value to the department of ornithology. 
His present work is a compend of the history of 
the different families of North American birds, 
a brief review of their respective distinguishing 
traits, with plentiful illustrations of individual 
characteristics. The style is pleasing, the in- 
formation very considerable and systematically 
presented. The plates and wood-cuts with which 
the book abounds deserve especial commenda- 
tion. The plates are all remarkably truthful, 
as though taken by a " snap shot." The en- 
gravings in the text are equally excellent, the 
whole together lending much worth to the book, 
and not, as is generally the fact, forcing it above 
a moderate price. A great deal of thoroughly 
good work has been expended upon every por-

tion of the treatise, and whoever owns it will 
be glad of his possession. 

An essay by Mr. Bradford Torrey is always 
a piece of fine art. The writer has something 
to say when he takes pen in hand, and he says it 
in the most exquisite manner. The ten papers 
included in " A Florida Sketch Book " con- 
tain the observations which this enchanting 
scientist and philosopher gathered up during a 
few weeks' sojourn in our south-eastern penin- 
sula. It was in the season when our migrating 
birds are preparing for their annual flight north- 
ward, and all animal and vegetable life feels 
the quickening influence of Spring. Mr. Tor- 
rey wandered from point to point in the same 
quiet, easy fashion in which he writes, appar- 
ently aimless and indifferent, really eager and 
intent, and in every contact with man and bird 
and beast, in every scene and event in nature, 
reaping a harvest of impressive reflections. One 
cares not for the sum of positive knowledge Mr. 
Torrey communicates, be it much or little. It 
is his quaint method of selecting and vivify- 
ing it that proves the charm and renders him 
an ever engaging and exhilarating companion. 
One passage, the farewell of the volume, so per- 
fectly represents the man, and his style, which 
is an integral part of him, that we give it as bet- 
ter than any possible words of critical analysis : 
" My holiday was done. For the last time, perhaps, 
I listened to the mocking-bird and the cardinal, as by 
and by, when the grand holiday is over, I shall listen to 
my last wood-thrush and my last bluebird. But what 
then ? Florida fields are still bright, and neither mock- 
ing-bird nor cardinal knows aught of my absence. And 
so it will be, 

' When you and I behind the veil are past, 
Oh, but the long, long while the World shall last.' 

None the less, it is good to have lived one day and 
taken our peep at the mighty show. Ten thousand 
things we may have fretted ourselves about, uselessly 
or worse. But to have lived in the sun, to have loved 
natural beauty, to have felt the majesty of trees, to have 
enjoyed the sweetness of flowers and the music of birds, 
so much, at least, is not vanity nor vexation of spirit." 

We take regretful leave of one of the prom- 
ising band of young American ornithologists 
in the posthumous volume " From Blomidon 
to Smoky," by Mr. Frank Bolles. It is a col- 
lection of thirteen sketches outlining the work 
of the naturalist in Nova Scotia, among the 
White Mountains, and at the author's home in 
Cambridge. It is an honorable monument to 
his memory ; none can view it without respect 
for the honest and painstaking and persistent 
qualities it commemorates. The articles on the 
woodpeckers and the owls are particularly im- 
portant, containing as they do a large number 



of original and interesting notes on curious and 
striking members of the bird family. Mr. 
Bolles made prolonged studies of these species 
under peculiarly favorable conditions, both in 
their native haunts and in captivity. While 
so doing he made use of the capital traits of a 
naturalist ingenuity, fidelity, and patience. 
The capacity for apprehending the great in the 
little, for bestowing upon minute and weari- 
some detail the care necessary for the achieve- 
ment of serviceable results, commands admir- 
ing respect. To watch in vigilant stillness, hour 
after hour and day by day, the rnano3uvres of 
a bird, for the sake of establishing some new 
faculty or habitude interesting to science, is to 
evince abilities of a high order. It was by such 
steadfast perseverance that Audubon won his 
fame, and it is for the same that Mr. Bolles 
will be gratefully remembered. In all his ob- 
servations he recorded the significant incidents, 
however trivial, and thus was enabled to add 
to our previous knowledge a mass of novel cer- 
tified facts regarding humming-birds, swifts, 
and a bevy of species besides the various ham- 
merers and hunters wrapped in the feathers of 
the woodpecker and the owl. 

The special region included in "Bird Land," 
by Mr. Leander S. Keyser, lies in and around 
Springfield, Ohio. It offers a populous hunt- 
ing-ground for the bird-lover, and was dili- 
gently searched in all times and seasons by this 
representative of an odd but most attractive 
genus. Carlyle says, " We are all poets when 
we read a poem well." So we are all touched 
with a fine enthusiasm which turns our speech 
straightway to song when we have opened our 
hearts to the beauty of the birds. Mr. Keyser 
is one of the transported ones, and the sweetness 
and gentleness of human nature come forth in 
his talks about the wonder and the enchant- 
ment of the creatures which walk as well as we 
do, and fly as we never can, and sing with a 
wild ecstatic rapture we cannot hope to rival. 
If only the great world could know what hap- 
piness the naturalist gains from a quiet ramble 
along country roadways, through the fields and 
over the hills, at how little expense his heart is 
set throbbing with delight, in what simple, in- 
nocent ways he is able to gather hordes of bliss- 
ful memories with which to solace a lifetime, 
and meanwhile, what a store of health and 
strength he amasses, without care or afore- 
thought, all men and women would hasten to 
learn of him the secret charm of his pastime 
which gives so liberally and exacts so little.

THE IJAKE POETS.* 

English poetry is nowhere so closely asso- 
ciated with English geography as in the phrase, 
The Lake School of English Poetry." Nor 
is there in the world, perhaps, any bit of ground 
twenty miles in diameter so crowded with lofty 
memories of men who lived and loved, and 
helped their own times, and added for all time 
to the world's store of thought and beauty, as 
that small section where the three northern 
counties of England meet at their shire stones 
on Wraynose Pass, known as the Lake Dis- 
trict. Whoever here surrenders himself to his 
imagination can never be alone or unsolaced. 
He is in company not only with mountains but 
with men. Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, 
Lamb, Lloyd, Wilson, these are the names 
and figures that, rather than those of any present 
or future inhabitants, will ever be indissolubly 
connected with this region. Clever Lord Jef- 
frey, with his knack at naming things and his 
reluctance to recognize new merit, first bestowed 
the name " Lake Poets," and a less-known epi- 
grammist explained it : 

" They lived in the Lakes : an appropriate quarter 
For poems diluted with plenty of water." 

The world long since rebelled against the 
judgments of the critical autocrats of the " Edin- 
burgh Review," but the name has proved suffi- 
ciently convenient for perpetuation as a distinc- 
tive and distinguished title. Now we have a work 
by the Rev. H. D. Rawnsley, written for the ex- 
press purpose of embalming the " Literary As- 
sociations of the English Lakes," and of adding 
facts to our fancies of how these men lived and 
labored amid these chosen scenes. There are 
two volumes. In the first we are in Cumberland 
and Keswick, with Southey and Coleridge as 
the central figures ; in the second we dwell in 
Westmoreland and Windermere, with Words- 
worth as the chief character. Wordsworth was 
the only one of this group of poets native to the 
country ; the circumstances which drew the 
others make a pleasing story, and show how 
here, as often, a very humble instrument served 
to consummate great events. A certain Cum- 
berland yeoman, William Jackson by name 
Wordsworth's "Waggoner " having plied his 
trade of carrier for a number of years and 
accumulated a little capital, determined to seek 
such otium cum dignitate as an income of two 
hundred pounds a year might give, and to spend 
the last years of his life in study of his Bible,

his Shakespeare, and his Hume, and in the en- 
joyment of a not inconsiderable library of books 
which he had collected. For this purpose, he 
built, in the year 1800, a kind of double man- 
sion, known in the Keswick Vale as Greta 
Hall, occupying a portion of it only. To him 
Wordsworth mentioned a friend of his, a man 
of great learning and a poet, with whom he had 
travelled in Germany, and who was now anx- 
ious to settle down for study in the Keswick 
Vale. Jackson, with his love of " beuk lam- 
ing," was glad to accept the stranger as tenant, 
or part tenant. Although he had had another 
offer at double the amount that Wordsworth's 
friend could afford to pay, brains won the day 
with Jackson, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge 
came to share the double house with its builder, 
and to be told, when the first half year's rent 
was due, " No, no, Mr. Coleridge ; I love your 
children, and I like your friendship ; the house 
is only part finished in the plastering. I shall 
take no rent from you, sir, this time at all." 
Thus was Coleridge brought again within reach 
of Wordsworth, with whom in his annus mira- 
bilis of production, 1797, he had planned the 
" Lyrical Ballads," and had written " The Re- 
morse," " The Ancient Mariner," " The Dark 
Ladie," and " Christabel." The exceeding 
beauty of Greta Hall and its surroundings had 
much to do with his brief reawakening, when, 
" with his poetic powers no longer in a state of 
suspended animation," he determined to dedi- 
cate himself anew to writing verse and helping 
his fellow-men. 

Three years later, on Coleridge's repeated 
invitations, came Robert Southey with his wife, 
Edith, a sister of Mrs. Coleridge, to share the 
roomy house. An interesting household it was 
in that first season (1803), at what Southey 
called jocularly " The Ant Hill." Besides the 
Coleridges and Southeys and Aunt Lowell and 
the Jacksons, there was Southey's beloved dog 
Dapper, Jackson's dog Cupid, a " noble jack- 
ass " which the children rode, cats galore 
Bianchi, Pulcheria, Othello, the Zombi, and 
the humble retainers, Nurse Wilsey and Betty 
Thompson, whose affection and long service 
to her master are inscribed on the Laureate's 
tombstone. But the ever-restless Coleridge soon 
disappeared from the scene. Full of imaginary 
aches and pains, and some real ones his mind 
as restless as if it had St. Vitus's dance, eter- 
nal activity without action, miserable about 
trifles and a prey to hypochondria, poor pro- 
crastinating Coleridge in the following year 
packed off to Malta for his health, returning

after two years to England, but never again to 
Keswick except for a short time. Henceforth 
Southey cared not only for his own family, but 
he took upon himself also the charge of Cole- 
ridge's deserted wife and three fatherless chil- 
dren. Coleridge's curious bewilderment of the 
moral sense was as puzzling to his friends and 
relatives as it is to posterity ; and there is some- 
thing very touching in the way in which 
Southey, with all his regret for Coleridge's 
failings, never failed to fulfil the trust those 
failings imposed on him. 

In these early days of acquaintance, Words- 
worth and Southey did not take to each other 
as much as one would have expected. But in 
later years, when sorrow had come to both, 
common experience and agreement on matters 
social and political drew them together. In the 
end, each came to admire the other's powers 
greatly. " A greater poet than Wordsworth 
there never has been, nor ever will be," wrote 
Southey ; and it was Wordsworth who was se- 
lected to write the fitting epitaph for Southey's 
tomb when he was buried in Crosthwaite church 
among the scenes which he had loved so well. 

Of the four homes of Wordsworth in these 
dales, Rydal Mount was the last and most be- 
loved. Hither he came, driven forth by domes- 
tic sorrow from the old Grasmere Rectory in 
the year 1813, and here he continued to live 
until his death, thirty-seven years later. Little 
understood by his neighbors as a poet, he was 
yet a figure-head among men, honored for his 
uprightness and integrity, his simplicity, kind- 
ness, and piety, and was looked upon as a man 
of practical judgment in all that concerned 
home affairs in the dale. A worthy " volunteer," 
a trusted justice of the peace, the pattern of 
high thinking and plain living, he set a kind 
of moral tonic for the whole district. As for 
his poetry, it was " aw reet eneuf, but queer 
stuff, varra," to these simple folk ; and they 
hardly believed that when the fit of making it 
was on, Wordsworth was in his right mind. 
They heard him " bummin' away," they saw 
his " jaws agoain t' whoale time," they thought 
of him as possessed, and would say, " Aw yes, 
I darsay he 's quite sensible, whiles, if ya nobbut 
catch him reet he '11 talk as plaain as oyder you 
or me "; and they were to be pardoned if they 
looked on his periodical poetry-making on the 
public highway as periodical fits of mania. It 
was " Mr. Wordsworth stamp-maister, him o' 
Rydal," not Wordsworth Poet-Laureate, whom 
they knew. Indeed, one yeoman, who went 
some miles out of his way to attend a political 



gathering, attracted by the announcement that 
the Poet-Laureate would address the meeting, 
was heard to say, " Schaff on it, it 's nobbut old 
Wordsworth o' Rydal efter aw ! " and he left 
the meeting in high dudgeon. 

Mr. Rawnsley's volumes are full of interest- 
ing materials, gathered with much diligence 
from original sources, with footnotes of refer- 
ence thereto; and there is an excellent map of 
the whole region at the close of Volume I. 
Beside the notable figures of the Lake Poets 
themselves, many others scarcely less distin- 
guished appear who at one time or another 
have had some associations with the country. 
Among these are the modern names of Tenny- 
son, Ruskin, Rossetti, and Matthew Arnold. 
The chief defect of the work is that it leaves an 
impression of scrappiness, owing partly to the 
somewhat obscure and rambling style of the 
author's expression and partly to his disjointed 
arrangement of subjects. There is in it a lack 
of that unity and wholeness which should char- 
acterize a work of such length, importance, and 
intrinsic charm. ANNA B> McMAHAN. 



THE ENLARGEMENT OF FAITH.* 



There is nothing more striking, in our group of 
recent books on religious themes, than the manifold 
forms faith assumes in them. With one, it is a mys- 
tical impulse ; with another, an historic force ; with 
a third, a philosophical development ; but in them 
all it declares itself as a primary power among men, 
in whose just apprehension the highest wisdom of 
the world is to be found. 

The Parliament of Religions was chiefly indebted 
for its notable success to its President, C. C. Bonney, 
Esq., and to the extraordinarily efficient chairman 
of the General Committee, the Rev. J. H. Barrows, 
D.D. The inception of the Parliament lay largely 
with President Bonney, and so with the New Church

of which he is a member. The New Church was 
the first to organize its subordinate congress. The 
volume entitled "The New Jerusalem in the World's 
Religious Congresses," edited by the Rev. L. P. 
Mercer, is chiefly made up of the papers prepared 
for this special congress. These papers discuss at 
length the origin and nature of the New Church, 
its doctrines, its planting, its future, and the work 
of women in it. The special feature of the New 
Church is its belief in the second coming of Christ ; 
not in person, but as an "unfolding of the spiritual 
sense of his Holy Word," whose literal sense was 
given in his first coming. This second coming, or 
new unfolding, has been achieved in the works of 
Emanuel Swedenborg. This starting-point gives oc- 
casion for high spirituality united to much mysticism. 
The ruling conception and force are of a transcen- 
dental character. There is in the New Church a 
segregation of spiritual power that simply laughs at 
naturalism and secularism. Among the forces at 
work in the human mind this is by no means least 
significant. It offers itself as a sporadic, but not 
an antiquated, impulse. 

" The Scheme of Christianity " is an earnest and 
scriptural discussion of the dogmas of faith. It ad- 
heres very closely to historic orthodoxy, attaching 
implicit faith to the sacred narrative. In its inter- 
pretation of the Scriptures, however, it is ethical 
and rational rather than conventional, and carries 
on an independent and earnest inquiry into their 
spirit and force. The point of most prominence, 
and of present interest, is that of discipleship. The 
author holds that the searching commands of Christ 
in reference to self-denial were directed to the dis- 
ciples ; were a regimen for the training of lead- 
ers, and were not laid upon the average believer. 
This view the author enforces extendedly and thor- 
oughly. The discussion touches a point of much 
practical moment the tendency to accept theoret- 
ically the words of Christ, and still, in the use we 
make of them, to rob them of practical significance. 
The book, by virtue of its earnest temper, its as- 
sumed faith, its intelligibility and independence, will 
be found interesting and instructive to those who 
are travelling, with diligent inquiry and without 
much digression, the road of Biblical belief. 

"The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ" is a brief 
volume of four nearly equal parts : the Introduc- 
tion, by Virchand R. Gandhi ; " The Journey to 
Thibet, by M. Notovitch ; a translation of the An- 
cient Manuscript narrating the life of Christ ; and 
a Summary. The manuscript on which the other 
parts hinge opens with a general sketch of the his- 
tory of the People of Israel and of the birth of 
Christ; his journey in the East between the ages of 
fourteen and twenty-nine years; his preaching in 
India, and his crucifixion. The narrative of the 
events which lead to his crucifixion is quite differ- 
ent from that of the New Testament. The words 
of Christ which the manuscript contains are chiefly 
his instructions in the East. They are elevated in 



tone, but lack almost wholly the simplicity of his 
precepts as given in the Gospels, and the close asso- 
ciation of his teachings with the events of life. 
There is very little in the volume to call out belief. 

" The Life and Teachings of Jesus " is a work 
aiming at a purpose which occupies many earnest 
minds, and is the predominant religious impulse of 
not a few. One of the objects of the work is "to 
show that, after all that an unsparing criticism can 
say, the religious value of the Bible still remains, 
and that it speaks to the present generation with a 
power which, under the old conceptions, it could 
never hope to have " (page 6). " What I have had 
in mind particularly to do was to bring the results 
of a careful criticism of the Gospels to bear upon 
the words attributed to Jesus, and to bring together 
into a consistent picture whatever this test may 
have left untouched" (p. 14). The method in which 
this end is pursued is sufficiently indicated by the 
fact that the author does not accept miracles, and 
" insists that the statements of the Bible are to be 
accepted or rejected on just the same degree of 
probability or improbability which would govern us 
anywhere else" (p. 7). The work is able, and 
evinces an admirable and a spiritual temper. The 
first half of the book is occupied with the Gospel 
narrative, and the last half with the life and teach- 
ings of Jesus. The earlier half is historically crit- 
ical ; the later constructive. As the author wholly 
rejects miracles, his criticism is necessarily very ag- 
gressive and destructive, but it is penetrating and 
candid. We find ourselves slow to accept the con- 
clusions of a process so essentially a priori and 
whose clues of guidance are often so slight. It has, 
however, this one most important result : it pulls 
down that scaffolding of dogma and of ready appeal 
to supernaturalism which has so long obscured the 
beauty and symmetry of the true spiritual building 
which has slowly gone up within them. We are 
best pleased with the second part, which goes very 
far to show how little has been really lost, and how 
much has been truly gained, by the sifting and 
waste of the earlier portion. The book is not un- 
like in temper to the " Natural History of the Chris- 
tian Religion," by Dr. William Mackintosh, which 
was lately noticed in THE DIAL (Sept. 16, p. 157). 
The two works are quite diverse in method and de- 
tail ; but the general drift of their conclusions, and 
the motive which prompts them, are the same. Both 
are thoroughly instructive. The supernatural cer- 
tainly needs correction as an idea, and in the serv- 
ice we assign it ; but those who hunt it down so vig- 
orously hardly seem to understand whither they are 
going. If the miracle is incredible, so is the answer 
to prayer. If prayer fail us, the crowning words 
of Christian Revelation fail us also, " Our Father 
who art in Heaven." 

" The Johannine Theology " is a book carefully 
wrought out within the limits of liberal orthodoxy. 
It discusses, in a dozen directions, the phases of 
doctrine which belong to the Gospel and to the 



296 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Epistles of John. The work is done in a scholarly, 
penetrative, and thorough method. Some of the 
topics are : " The Idea of God in the Writings of 
John, the Doctrine of the Logos "; " The Union 
of the Son and Father "; " The Doctrine of Sin "; 
The Work of Salvation "; " The Doctrine of the 
Holy Spirit, of Love, of Prayer, of Eternal Life." 
An inquiry of this sort, which accepts the full weight 
of Scriptural authority, has its advantages and its 
disadvantages. It tends to thorough and minute 
investigation. Nothing is to be passed lightly. But 
it is also liable to feel too strongly the need of rec- 
onciling all discrepancies, and to embarrass itself 
unnecessarily by any refractory material. Truth as 
truth loves scope and wide rendering. The author 
is not only liberal in his creed, he lays the founda- 
tion of his exegesis in ethical doctrinal construction. 
The writings of St. John yield themselves fully to 
this tendency. Under the doctrine of Love the au- 
thor finds in the statements of John that which pre- 
cludes any other than a redemptive, a spiritually 
constructive, administration of the world. The feel- 
ing that justice is supreme with God, that the exer- 
cise of his love is optional, that he may well enough 
hate the sinner, arises from a technical definition 
and idea of sin formed with the general intention 
of making it more dreadful that do not at all 
correspond with the facts of life. Man is interpreted 
by theology, not theology by man. 

" The Claims of Christianity " is a book like a 
sally from a beseiged fort thrust boldly forth from 
a body of believers thoroughly self-centred and ag- 
gressive, but also widely beleaguered by unsympa- 
thetic and hostile sentiment. Its author is a clear 
and vigorous writer who knows what he wants to 
say and says it without hesitation. It is a pleasure 
to come in contact with such a mind, and pleasant 
to meet it in the defense of old things the history 
of the world as so far achieved. The claims of the 
work are that Christianity is " the sole and sufficient 
oracle of divine truth," and that it forms a "polity 
perfect and complete in itself." This polity is of 
course the Catholic Church. These claims are first 
enforced chiefly on the external side against 
Buddhism and Islam, and then as against the Ren- 
aissance and Reformation. The Middle Ages are 
dwelt on as laying securely the foundations of this 
universal polity. How little soever one may accept 
the final conclusions of the author, it is well, espe- 
cially in our day when we so much magnify the 
things that are nearest us, to listen to one who 
stands within the shadow of events which contain 
the significance of millenniums. When one comes 
in contact with Newman, Ward, Lilly, the question 
is, what the fulfilling of the law and the prophets 
means. Is it a literal or a spiritual fulfilment ? 

The two volumes of " The Philosophy and De- 
velopment of Religion " are in every way inviting 
books. The form and print are excellent. The 
author's style is vigorous and clear ; the subject is 
comprehensively and thoroughly discussed. The 



topic, being treated in lectures, has none of the dry- 
ness of details. The first volume rests chiefly 
on philosophical principles, and some will find it 
peculiarly acceptable. It considers the nature of 
religion in its relation to the world and man. " Re- 
ligion, as well as science and art, morals and law, 
is a constitutive element of human nature, and there- 
fore may pass through the most manifold develop- 
ments, but can never cease as long as there are men " 
(p. 99). It strives to frame a conception which 
shall overcome the constant collision between the 
natural and the supernatural, an effort which we 
desire especially to commend. While it does not 
complete itself in a just recognition of the supernat- 
ural, it does a good deal of work in preparation for 
it. The second volume discusses Christian faith as 
it offers itself in the New Testament and in the 
phases it has since passed through. The author, in 
this discussion, gives free range to historical criti- 
cism, but he unites with it an eager insight into 
spiritual truth. If the letter is somewhat rudely 
scattered, the spirit is carefully sought after and 
diligently gathered up. JOHN BASCOM .

Ammalt' rights. .> > 

discusses the question of "Animals 
Rights " (Macmillan) from the humanitarian stand- 
point. Mr. Salt undertakes in his essay to set the 
principles of the jus animalium on a plain and log- 
ical footing, and to expose the fallacies of the apol- 
ogists of the present system. No one is likely to 
gainsay his fundamental rule condemning "all prac- 
tices which inflict unnecessary pain on sentient be- 
ings." When he comes, however, to the considera- 
tion of special cases, to the question whether this or 
that current practice falls under the rule, his path 
is beset with the old polemical difficulties. First in 
importance is the time-honored food question ; and 
here the author calls on humanitarians of the more 
timid sort to stand by their colors and cease palter- 
ing for, as he reasonably argues, it is not very con- 
sistent to sentimentalize over the rights of an animal 
on whom you propose to dine. On the question of 
flesh-eating, the balance of authority is still rather 
against Mr. Salt, though vegetarians have latterly 
made some logical advances toward establishing 
their case. Shall we agree with Paley, who (appeal- 
ing, as usual, to Scripture to justify eighteenth cen- 
tury practice) maintained our " right to the flesh of 
animals "; and with Bentham, who naively argues, 
"We deprive animals of life, and this is justifiable, 
since their pains do not equal our pleasures"? Or 
shall we side with Thoreau, who wrote : " I have 
no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human 
race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating 
animals, as surely as the savage tribes have left off 
eating each other " ? Mr. Salt is of the latter opin-

ion ; and he bases his belief on the facts that man 
is structurally frugiverous, and that, when he tries 
it, he gets along perfectly well without flesh-foods, 
as well as on the growing popular tendency to look 
with abhorrence on flesh-eating and its concomi- 
tants. On the latter point Mr. Salt seems to us a 
little over-sanguine. In a day when the magnitude 
of stock-yards and slaughtering establishments is 
made a matter of civic pride and rejoicing, it is cer- 
tainly going too far to say that butchers and slaught- 
ermen form " a pariah class." Nor is the era as yet 
in sight when a great fortune is regarded as seriously 
tainted by the stains of the abattoir. On the ques- 
tion of " Murderous Millinery," Mr. Salt has com- 
paratively plain sailing ; and we cheerfully subscribe 
to his axiom, touching the slaughter of birds and 
mammals for purposes of human adornment, that 
it is not the man who does the killing, but the woman 
who wears the trophies, that is the true offender. 
She is the principal, he the tool. For the behoof and 
possible amendment of those fashionable gentlemen 
and ladies who deck themselves (like the ass and 
the jackdaw in the fables) in borrowed skins and 
feathers, we subjoin a few facts from the trade in 
those commodities, which ought to touch the most 
rudimentary conscience. "One dealer in London 
is said to have received as a single consignment 32,- 
000 dead humming-birds, 80,000 aquatic birds, and 
800,000 pairs of wings. A Parisian dealer had a 
contract for 40,000 birds, and an army of murderers 
were turned out to supply the order. ... At one 
auction alone in London there were sold 404,389 
West Indian and Brazilian bird-skins, and 356,389 
East Indian, besides thousands of pheasants and 
birds-of-paradise." These, be it remembered, are 
but scattered instances of a continuous and growing 
traffic. We heartily commend Mr. Salt's treatise to 
all who desire a clear idea of the humanitarian 
theory and arguments. There is a bibliography, 
and an interesting essay on vivisection by Dr. Albert 
Leffingwell. 

Another volume Perhaps the illustrations are the best 
of Dr. Liddon's part of the new volume the third 
We of Pusey. of Liddon's " Life of Pusey " (Long- 
mans), lately reviewed in our pages. It is pleasant 
to see the face of Charles Marriott, that man of 
wide learning and rare sweetness of character, who 
took the lowest place, content to toil obscurely, in 
the early days of the Oxford Movement. There is 
a singularly attractive portrait of the author of " The 
Christian Year," with a fine brow, large, deep, 
thoughtful eyes, and a frank, smiling, almost rogu- 
ish mouth. As for the letter-press, if anyone de- 
sires to know from a very one-sided view-point more 
of the inner history of " the Anglican claim to the 
doctrine of Regeneration, of Absolution, of the Real 
Presence, of the Eucharistic Sacrifice," than he has 
derived in livelier form from the writings of Church 
and Ward and Mozley ; if he is still eager about 
the Jerusalem Bishopric, the Hampden Controversy, 
the Gorham Case, the departure to Rome of New- 



man and Manning and Archdeacon Wilberforce ; if 
he is looking for a list of the " Tracts for the Times " 
and their writers ; if he enjoys five hundred pages 
of ecclesiastical controversy lighted by no single 
gleam of imagination or humor, without a revealing 
anecdote or vivid sketch of character ; if he cares 
for copious assurance of how weary and heavy- 
hearted under the burden of his own sins and those 
of others a good and devout man can be, how an 
anxious temperament, a scrupulous conscience, and 
a superstitious system can overcloud a Christian's 
joy and peace ; if he would note how a prosperous 
Englishman, a scholar and divine, a leader among 
his fellows, in the middle of the nineteenth century of 
the Christian era can turn his back upon his age and 
adjust himself to mediaeval ideas and usages, can 
wear a hair-shirt always by day unless ill, can find 
virtue in a hard chair by day and a hard bed by 
night, in wearing no gloves, in keeping his eyes 
downcast and looking at nothing out of curiosity, in 
refraining from smiles and in stern repression of 
humor, a task easier, perhaps, for Dr. Pusey and 
Dr. Liddon than for Dr. Holmes, or that earlier 
canon of St. Paul's, Sidney Smith ; if one is in 
search of any of these things he will find a mine of 
interest in this third volume of Liddon's Pusey. To 
all others it will be a measureless waste, where the 
air is heavy and the prospect dreary. 

John Brown's Mr. Hinton'saccountof "John Brown 
story, as told and his Men" (Funk & Wagnalls) 

by a follower. ig ft work that cannot jj e overlooked 

by the student of American history. Its literary 
merit is but slight ; it is written in a clumsy sort of 
style, with little skill in the sifting or the orderly 
arrangement of material. But the material is there, 
and it makes the book in a way invaluable. The 
author is himself one of John Brown's men one 
of the few present survivors of the group; he was 
with them in Kansas, and wrote accounts of events 
there for Boston and Chicago papers. His account 
is therefore that of an eye-witness, whose recollec- 
tions are supplemented by a careful study of mate- 
rial gathered in many years of industrious research. 
The book is a storehouse of information, and as such 
it is, as we have said, invaluable. The author is an 
unqualified defender of John Brown, and in this 
earnestly written book he shows the courage of his 
convictions unabated by the nearly forty years that 
have passed since the stirring events of which he 
treats. The so-called " Pottawatomie massacre," for 
example, which has been regarded as the darkest 
stain on John Brown's career in Kansas, is boldly 
admitted and defended. " The men were slain, and 
the act was deliberately done. There never was 
any doubt of that. It was a question for some years 
whether or not the act was done under the influence 
of and by the direct orders of John Brown. No 
one now doubts that it was." The act is regarded 
by our author as a logical necessity of the situation ; 
and its effects are thus forcibly, if not conclusively, 
stated : " The Pottawatomie slaying, temporarily at

least, awed the border ruffians into a trembling peace 
and startled alike the brave and timid in free-state 
ranks with a triumphant yet serious feeling that on 
their side at last a Man had arrived." It unques- 
tionably did all that ; yet more would be required, 
one would think, to justify such deeds of savagery. 
It must not be overlooked, however, that John Brown 
claimed to have had conclusive evidence that the 
men killed by him on Pottawatomie Creek had set 
a date when they would kill him and his sons, and 
that in his belief it was simply a question of which 
party should kill the other. The author's standpoint 
and writing, as our brief extracts show, are those of 
the partisan rather than the historian. The book 
does much, however, to throw light on John Brown's 
character and acts, and will have its useful place 
among his biographies. It is a pity the work could 
not have been given a more presentable form ; the 
typography is worthy of Kansas in its darkest days. 

Mr. Frederick W. Morton is the 
Smart myings compiler of a volume entitled Wo- 

about women. *. . ,-., >. , . 

man in Epigram (McClurg), which 
collects many hundreds of bright or brutal sayings 
about the sex, extracted from a great variety of 
authors. The writers most largely represented are 
Mr. W. R. Alger, Balzac, Mr. Junius Henri Browne, 
" George Eliot," Emerson, Euripides, Holmes, Leigh 
Hunt, Irving, Johnson, Alphonse Karr, La Bruyere, 
La Rochefoucauld, Lecky, Richter, Mr. Ruskin, 
Steele, Thackeray, Mr. Frederick Sheldon, Shake- 
speare, and Mr. Frederick Morton. Ten or more 
" epigrams " are given from each of these writers. 
One cannot expect to find everybody in a book of so 
modest dimensions, but it is a little significant that 
the first three names by which we sought to test the 
collection Schopenhauer, " Stendhal," and Mr. 
Frederick Greenwood should not occur at all in the 
index. " That women have been carefully inspected 
through both ends of the telescope " will, as the edi- 
tor remarks, " readily be seen " from these pages. It 
is a little curious that Mr. Morton's idea should have 
occurred at the same time to another person ; that 
such is the case appears from the simultaneous pub- 
lication of " About Women : "What Men Have Said " 
(Putnam), for which booklet Miss Rose Porter is 
responsible. Miss Porter's compilation is a sort of 
birthday book. Each month has an author, and 
each of its days a selection from his works. The 
authors range from Shakespeare to Ruskin, and, 
since there are but twelve of them, the effect is 
more coherent than that produced by Mr. Morton's 
book. Five of Miss Porter's authors, by the way, 
do not occur in Mr. Morton's collection. 



The early life " Thomas of London before His Con- 
ey Thomas secration " is the title of a " Cam- 
of canterbury. bridge Historical Essay," by Mr. 
Lewis B. Radf ord, issued from the University Press 
( Macmillan) . It is a prize monograph, and deals 
with the relatively neglected part of the great Pri- 
mate's career before he became Archbishop of Can- 



terbury and the champion of "Peter's rock " against 
the " customs " of the realm. The work is admir- 
ably done ; it is compact, scholarly, and readable, 
with reference to the best and latest authorities, and 
with a conception of the character of Thomas not 
biased in either of the two directions in which bias 
is commonly found. In the presence of the great 
problem presented by the chancellor-archbishop's 
career, the author frankly admits that absolute con- 
sistency is not to be predicated. He takes refuge, 
however, in the view that there is a lower sort of 
consistency to be found, and he thus defines it : " It 
is the consistency less lofty, but not less real on its 
lower level of the man who is faithful to the ideal 
of the office in which he is placed, but allows himself 
to be placed in office without any definite choice of 
his own ; who holds to his principles, but takes them 
from his position, instead of carrying them into it; 
who does whatever he finds to do with all his might, 
bat leaves circumstances to find it for him." Some 
such view as this, we fancy, must be taken by the 
candid and impartial historian. In a note, the 
author discusses Miss Lambert's glorification of 
Thomas apropos of Tennyson's play in "The 
Nineteenth Century "; and in an appendix he dis- 
cusses the claims of the various biographies of the 
martyr of Canterbury. It is a curious fact, not, we 
fancy, known to many who are not specialists in the 
period, that one of these biographies is a saga 
" Thomas Saga Erkibyskups " the work of an Ice- 
landic visitor to England, probably Arngrin, Abbot 
of Thingeyrar. The statement is also made that 
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries churches 
were dedicated to Thomas in all parts of Iceland. 

Mr. Edwin L. Shuman's " Steps into 
Journalism," published at Evanston 
by the "Correspondence School of 
Journalism," is the outcome of a course of instruc- 
tion given at the summer school of Bay View, Mich- 
igan. The number of young people who are already 
inclined to turn their "steps into journalism," when 
they might become useful members of society in- 
stead, is so great that we naturally look askance 
upon any attempt to swell these misguided ranks. 
But the author reassures us at the start by saying : 
" It is not the aim of this book to make any more 
writers : we have too many now. On none of these 
pages will there be found a single word tempting 
any young man to leave the farm or the business 
office, or advising any young woman to forsake the 
household routine, in order to run after the ignis 
fatuus of literary fame." This introductory claim 
is sustained by the text that follows. Mr. Shuman's 
chapters describe from full knowledge the workings 
of the modern newspaper, and contain much prof- 
itable advice for reporters and others ; but they cast 
no glamour over the newspaper life, and do not 
minimize its degrading influence upon the majority 
of those who choose to lead it. The only aim of 
the modern city newspaper is to make money ; " as 
for the uplifting of the public morals or ideals, that

scarcely cuts any figure at all in the purpose of the 
publisher." This is a frank saying, but a true one ; 
and equal in both frankness and truth are the re- 
peatedly urged statements that the newspaper writer, 
whether reporter or editor, has no business with con- 
victions of his own, but must make himself a mere 
automaton for the registration of ideas that are 
not even the convictions of anybody else. It is de- 
lightful to note the vigorous way in which the writer 
describes the newspaper life as it actually is. Here, 
for example, is a pen-portrait of the city editor : 
" Damocles was a bobolink in nesting-time compared 
with the city editor of a great daily, who forever sits 
with two swords dangling over him, ready to carve 
off his editorial head without a moment's warning. 
One of these is the deadly ' scoop,' and the other 
is the no less sanguinary libel-suit." Surely, no one 
is likely to be tempted into journalism by such pas- 
sages as these. But for those already in the net, 
and for those who are bent upon finding cause for 
repentance in their own experience, we can recom- 
mend the book as likely to prove helpful in a hun- 
dred ways. Mr. Shuman's advice is usually good 
and to the point. Upon two matters only do we 
feel bound to disagree with him. He does not suf- 
ficiently condemn in fact, he rather justifies the 
practise of eking out facts by the aid of a lively im- 
agination, and publishing all sorts of statements that 
are not true. His remark that " the day of servile 
party organs is past " is not only false, but it is so 
amazingly false that we cannot understand how Mr. 
Shuman could have made it. The partisan spirit 
has never, we should say, been so offensive and un- 
blushing as it has become in the newspapers of our 
own times. _ 



Special reprints of new volumes have been added 

Swinburne's lyrics to the exquisite " Bibelot " series of 

andlhe"Rubaiya(. repr[nis published by Mr> Thomas 

B. Mosher, and are even more acceptable than the 
two with which the series began a year ago. One 
is a book of lyrics selected from the works of Mr. 
Swinburne, and the other is FitzGerald's " Omar." 
The book of lyrics, named " Felise," has drawn 
largely upon the first volume of " Poems and Bal- 
lads," although the other two are not ignored. It 
also includes two choruses from " Atalanta," three 
lyrics from the "Mary Stuart" trilogy, and the 
lovely " Adieux a Marie Stuart." The edition of 
the immortal " Rubaiyat " is easily the most desira- 
ble of those yet published at a moderate price. It 
includes Mr. Lang's verses, Mr. J. H. McCarthy's 
" Envoy," FitzGerald's introduction and notes, a 
bibliography of the English versions of Omar, and 
the texts of first and fourth editions printed page 
to page for easy comparison. The quatrains that 
appeared in the second edition only are given as an 
appendix, one of them being the magnificent 
" Nay, but for terror of his wrathful Face, 

I swear I will not call Injustice Grace ; 
Not one Good Fellow of the Tavern but 

Would kick so poor a Coward from the place," 

which no lover of Omar would be willing to spare. 



It would be difficult to suggest any particular in 
which this "Bibelot" edition of the "tent-maker" 
could be improved upon. The edition is limited, 
and we shall be much surprised if it holds out long. 



"Down East" 
manners and 
dialect. 



" Danvis Folks " (Houghton) is a 
neat reprint of a series of New En- 
gland sketches written for " Forest 
and Stream " by Mr. Rowland E. Robinson. The 
author attempts not so much to tell a story though 
there is a slight thread of continuity throughout 
as to faithfully reproduce the rustic " Down East" 
speech, manners, and customs of fifty years ago ; 
and in this we should say that he is successful be- 
yond cavil. Some of the chapters are as good as 
" Sam Slick " quaint, racy, bubbling over with 
dry Yankee fun, and bristling with eccentricities of 
mind and vernacular. We have had rather a sur- 
feit of dialect in literature of late ; but the stiffest 
prejudice against it must yield before Mr. Robin- 
son's orthographical ingenuity of which " julluk" 
for just like, "kwut" for coat, and " soddaown " for 
sat down, are mild examples. 

M. Andre" Lefevre, of the Paris An- 
thropological School, has prepared 
for the " International Scientific " 
series ( Appleton) a treatise upon " Race and Lan- 
guage," written from a strictly evolutionary stand- 
point, and based upon the results obtained by the 
latest workers in philological and anthropological 
science. These sciences are making rapid progress, 
and it was time that someone should go over the 
old familiar ground with the help of the new light. 
This task M. Lefevre has accomplished in a highly 
satisfactory manner. His work has three chief 
divisions : " The Evolution of Language," " Geo- 
graphical Distribution of Languages and Races," 
and " The Indo-European Organism." 

Pen-pictures of "Vignettes of Manhattan" (Har- 
New York life per ) is a collection of sketchy little 
and character. pen-pictures, mild feints at the short 1 
story, most of them, of New York life and char- 
acter, by Mr. Brander Matthews. The drift of 
the papers may be inferred from the titles : " At 
a Private View," " Spring in a Side Street," " Be- 
fore the Break of Day," " The Speech of the Even- 
ing," " A Vista in Central Park," etc. In drawing 
his types and echoing their more or less futile chat- 
ter, Mr. Matthews is almost grievously accurate ; 
and his efforts, to say nothing of his patience, should 
not go unrewarded. The volume is a very pretty 
one externally, and Mr. Smedley's drawings are 
clever. 

"The Pearl of India" (Houghton) is 
still another book of travels from the 
indefatigable Mr. M. M. Ballou. In 
it Mr. Ballou writes of his recent visit to Ceylon, 
of which island he says : " No point presents more 
varied attractions to the traveller, more thoroughly 
and picturesquely exhibits equatorial life, or ad- 



American

dresses itself more directly to the delicate apprecia- 
tion of the artist, botanist, antiquarian, general sci- 
entist, and sportsman." Mr. Ballou writes in his 
usual chatty way, freely mingling his own impres- 
sions with facts culled from the authorities, and 
affording a very fair general view of Ceylon, its his- 
tory and traditions, its people, religion, industries, 
flora and fauna, etc. One is a little surprised to 
find that Matthew Arnold is made to figure mag- 
nificently in Mr. Ballou's pages as Sir Matthew 
an accolade rather belated, if merited. The pub- 
lishers issue the book in their usual irreproachable 
style. 

BRIEFER MENTION. 

Mr. Richard Watson Gilder's " Five Books of Song" 
(Century) is a collection, in a single volume, of his com- 
plete poems, with a few lyrical pieces that we do not 
recollect to have seen in the earlier editions. Mr. Gilder's 
place among the American poets is now so well assured 
that this collection will be widely welcomed, although 
the five booklets whose contents are now incorporated 
within one set of covers will by no means be displaced 
from the shelves by this reissue. We have on several 
occasions expressed our appreciation of the high poet- 
ical quality of Mr. Gilder's work, and need now only 
chronicle the advent of the new and convenient collec- 
tion. 

As the holiday gift-book season approaches, the an- 
thologist is busy. The latest collections of verse upon 
special themes are " Because I Love You " (Lee), a 
volume of love poems collected and arranged by Miss 
Anna E. Mack; and "Poems and Lyrics of Nature" 
(imported by Scribner), edited, with an introductory 
essay, by Miss Edith Wingate Kinder. The latter vol- 
ume has a charming " electrogravure " portrait of Mr. 
Andrew Lang, although it is not easy to understand just 
why he, rather than many another, should have been 
thus distinguished. Miss Rinder's introduction is taste- 
ful and sympathetic, and her selections are all from con- 
temporary poets. 

The new " Cambridge Edition " of " The Complete 
Poetical Works of John Greenleaf Whittier " (Hough- 
ton) has all the admirable characteristics of the " Cam- 
bridge " Longfellow, published a year ago. There is a 
fine portrait, a title-page etching of the poet's Ames- 
bury home, a full index and collection of notes, and a 
prefatory memoir by Mr. Horace E. Scudder. All 
these things, besides the complete text of the poems, are 
contained within the covers of a single beautiful volume 
of between five and six hundred double-columned pages. 
It is a great joy to have our Longfellow and Whittier 
in this compact and attractive form. 

There seems to be a marked revival of interest in 
Henry Kingsley. We have already mentioned the new 
edition of his novels started by the Messrs. Scribners, 
and there now comes to us the first volume of another 
edition, equally attractive, and more nearly of what may 
be called library dimensions, bearing the imprint of 
Messrs. Ward, Lock, & Bowden. This edition, we un- 
derstand, is to be complete, while that of the Messrs. 
Scribners will include only three or four of the novels. 
" Ravenshoe " is the volume now at hand. 

Mr. William Francis Collier's " History of English 
Literature " has long been in use as a school text-book 



of the subject. It now appears in a revised edition 
(Nelson), with a brief supplement upon American lit- 
erature. The treatment is essentially biographical. 
While far from being a model text-book, it is not with- 
out certain merits of arrangement and condensation, and, 
in its new form, offers a marked improvement upon the 
earlier editions. 

The " Advanced Science Manuals " published by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. are now made to in- 
clude a treatise on " Human Physiology," by Mr. John 
Thornton. Some four hundred pages of text, diversified 
with many cuts and a few colored illustrations, set forth 
the elements of the science in reasonably attractive form. 
A book of about half the size is the " Physiology for 
Beginners " (Macmillan) which has been prepared by 
Dr. Michael Foster and Dr. Lewis E. Shore. The treat- 
ment is as admirable as might be expected in a book 
having the great authority of Dr. Foster. 

Under the title of " Oriental Studies," Messrs. Ginn & 
Co. publish a volume of papers read before the Oriental 
Club of Philadelphia during the past six years. There 
are a baker's dozen of the papers, among which we note 
" The Physical- Geography of India," by Dr. Morton W. 
Easton; " Literature of Chinese Laborers," by Mr. Stew- 
art Culin, " The Alphabets of the Berbers," by Dr. 
Daniel G. Brinton; " A Legal Document of Babylonia," 
by Dr. Morris Jastrow; "The Holy Numbers of the 
Rig- Veda," by Dr. E. W. Hopkins; " The Aryan Name 
of the Tongue," by Dr. H. Collitz; and "The Book of 
Ecclesiastes," by Dr. Paul Haupt. That papers by such 
men are scholarly goes without saying. 

" Asolando," the last volume of Browning's poems, 
has been issued by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. as the sev- 
enteenth and final volume of their handy edition of the 
poet. More than half of this new volume is devoted to 
indexes and notes for the complete edition. The indexes 
are of titles and first lines; the notes are biographical 
and historical, and form a sort of encyclopaedia explan- 
atory of the allusions contained in the poems. Thus 
completed, this edition of Browning is extremely satis- 
factory, and is decidedly preferable to any other now 
existing. 

An International Congress of Charities, Correction, 
and Philanthropy was held at Chicago in June, 1893, 
in connection with the World's Congress Auxiliary of 
which our readers have been so abundantly informed. 
Of the proceedings of that Congress certain sections 
have been published and heretofore noticed by us. A 
new volume, now at hand, reports the " General Exer- 
cises " at the opening of the Congress, and includes the 
special report on " The Public Treatment of Pauperism," 
edited by Dr. John H. Finley, of Knox College. These 
reports issue from the Johns Hopkins Press. 

Mr. John Campbell Oman, in a volume of moderate 
size, has told for English readers the stories of " The 
Great Indian Epics" (Macmillan), the "Ramayana" 
and the " Mahabharata." " I have written," Mr. Oman 
says, " for the benefit of those, whether Europeans or 
Indians, who may be acquainted with the English lan- 
guage, the brief epitomes of them contained in the fol- 
lowing pages ; deriving my materials not from the orig- 
inal Sanskrit poems, which are sealed books to me, but 
from the translations, more or less complete and literal, 
which have been given to the world by both European 
and Indian scholars." After this frank admission, there 
is little to be said, except that the stories are told in 
fairly finished and readable English.

YORK TOPICS. 



New York, November 10, 1894. 

Permanent quarters have at last been engaged for 
the Authors Club of this city, in the newly-erected ex- 
tension of the Carnegie Music Hall in Fifty-seventh 
street. A comfortable suite of rooms has been especially 
constructed for the club's purposes, and will be fitted 
up by the club itself. It is now expected that the new 
rooms will be opened about the first of the year, and, 
in the meantime, the Architectural League has kindly 
offered the use of its assembly hall for the fortnightly 
meetings. It will be remembered that the Authors 
Club was organized in October, 1882. At first the mem- 
bers met at each other's homes, then for a time at the 
Tile Club hall, and afterward, until last year, at the 
Twenty-fourth street rooms so familiar to members. 
The club has now passed its twelfth anniversary, and is 
more prosperous than at any period in its history. A 
large portion of its " Liber Scriptorum " has been sub- 
scribed for, and it is proposed to place the remaining 
siibscriptions at once. 

Herbert P. Home's " The Binding of Books," Bras- 
sington's "History of the Art of Bookbinding," Miss 
Prideaux's " Historical Sketch of Bookbinding," and sev- 
eral other recently published works of the same charac- 
ter, have stirred up an unusual degree of interest in their 
subject. The Grolier Club's exhibition of commercial 
or edition bindings was of great value. During the 
next fortnight there will be on exhibition at Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons' new building a collection of 
about two hundred and fifty books in fine bindings for 
amateurs. These books, old and new, have been selected 
as handsome specimens of the printer's art, or for their 
rarity, and have been sent within the past few months 
to the best binders of France, England, and America. 
They thus represent the ultimate skill of the binders of 
to-day. Among American bindings there are especially 
handsome specimens from the establishments of Messrs. 
Blackwell, Bradstreet, and Stikeman. Some of the 
French bindings in which the decorative design is cut 
out with gravers from the surface of the leather are 
quite remarkable. All of these finely-bound books are 
for sale, and will be- distributed to purchasers at the 
close of the exhibition. 

The local political upheaval is not without its interest 
from a literary point of view. Among the Congressmen 
elected from this city is Mr. Lemuel Ely Quigg, whose 
" Tin Types Taken in the Streets of New York," pub- 
lished some years ago, contains several remarkable 
sketches dealing with machine politics of the baser sort. 
Something more elaborate in the line of fiction, and deal- 
ing with the same subject, has been looked for from Mr. 
Quigg, who has long been a member of the " Tribune " 
editorial staff; but it has remained for Mr. Paul Leices- 
ter Ford, the editor of Jefferson's works, to write a po- 
litical novel pure and simple. Mr. Ford has varied his 
historical studies with considerable study and experi- 
ence of local political methods and men. " The Hon- 
orable Peter Stirling " is based on actual occurrences 
in this city, and the characters are partly drawn from 
life. This is notably the case with the hero, who is 
evidently the August Personage (to use an eighteenth 
century expression) now most prominent in the affairs 
of the nation, although many incidents connected with 
others are assigned to his career. Mr. Ford's novel is 
longer than the ordinary American story, and, indeed, 
this length is required for the proper development of 



the plot to which, of course, the political atmosphere is 
incidental. ; 

Announcements of books to appear in time for the 
Christmas season have practically all been made. The 
holiday catalogues of the great publishing houses will 
perhaps be more elaborate and decorative this year than 
ever before, those of the J. B. Lippincott Co. and of 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. particularly so. The latter 
firm, by the way, will issue an American edition of the 
London " Bookman," under the editorship of Professor 
Harry Thurston Peck and Mr. James MacArthur. Pro- 
fessor Boyesen, Mr. Mabie, and Professor Charles F. 
Richardson will be among the American contributors. 
Mr. Melvil Dewey is also to have charge of a depart- 
ment devoted to library economy and giving general 
news of the libraries of the world. The London editor 
of " The Bookman," Dr. W. Robertson Nicoll, is to edit 
for Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. the " Contemporary 
Writers " series, of which the first volume, " Thomas 
Hardy," by Miss Annie MacDonnell, will shortly appear. 

" Three Score and Ten Years," the recollections of 
the veteran poet and engraver, Mr. William James Lin- 
ton, appears this week from the Scribner press, and is 
interesting not only for its contents but on account of 
the picturesque personality of its author, who is still 
frequently to be seen at the Century Club, so warmly 
spoken of by him in his book. Mr. Linton, who was 
born in 1812, had already lived out an ordinary man's 
life in England, before coming to this country in 1866; 
but he seemed as full of life and energy, when I called 
on him at his cottage near East Rock, New Haven, 
Conn., last winter, as most men of half his age. He has 
a pleasant way of putting his own books of poetry in 
type and printing them at his house, where he has a 
press and printer's materials. Some of these little vol- 
umes, printed at the " Appledore Press," as he calls it, 
and daintily illustrated with his own engravings, are 
much in demand among collectors. Another picturesque 
figure, much seen about the city of late, is that of Dean 
Hole, whose " More Memories " will be issued this com- 
ing week by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

The poems of Richard Realf, edited by Colonel Rich- 
ard J. Hinton, and announced for publication this au- 
tumn in San Francisco, will be published by Messrs. 
Funk & Wagnalls of New York, who have just issued 
Colonel Hinton's " John Brown and His Men." The 
edition of Realf's poems will be limited to five hundred 
numbered copies, of which about half have already been 
subscribed for. Colonel Hinton's memoir will contain 
a number of Realf's war letters, written from the camp- 
and field, which have recently come to light. Subscrip- 
tions for the volume may be sent to Colonel R. J. Hin- 
ton, Box 21, Bay Ridge, N. Y. ARTHUR STEDMAN. 



BRYANT DAY AT KNOX COLLEGE. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) j 

The centenary of the birth of Bryant, Nov. 3, was 
made the occasion of a celebration in the poet's honor by 
the faculty and students of Knox College. The citizens 
of Galesburg joined heartily in the spirit of the occasion, 
and thronged the historic old First Church beyond the 
limits of its capacity. Upon the pulpit platform sat 
representatives of three Illinois colleges. The presid- 
ing officer was the venerable Newton Bateman, LL.D., 
for many years superintendent of public instruction in

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



this state, now president emeritus of Knox College. 
Prominent in the group, and the figure of chief interest 
during the day's events, was the only surviving brother 
of the poet, Mr. John H. Bryant, of Princeton, 111., 
hale and hearty still, and bearing with notable vigor the 
burden of his eighty-seven years. 

The centennial address was delivered by Mr. E. R. 
Brown, of Elmwood, 111., a native of Cummington, Mass., 
and a life-long friend of William Cullen Bryant, and of 
the Bryant family. In the now famous celebration held 
in August last at the poet's birthplace, Mr. Brown de- 
livered a similar address; and as in the earlier commem- 
oration, so in the later one, the speaker achieved a happy 
and notable success. Tenderly and sympathetically he 
told the story of the poet's life ; with warm appreciation, 
and yet temperately, he offered his estimate of the poet's 
labors. He gave much emphasis to the sincerity and 
genuineness of Bryant's inner life, and claimed for the 
poet a more tender and responsive nature than was ap- 
parent to the outside world. 

Mr. John H. Bryant recited his own pathetic " Mon- 
ody," written in memory of his last visit with his brother 
at the old homestead in Cummington. 

"My heart to-day is far away ; 
I seem to tread my native hills ; 
I see the flocks and mossy rocks, 
I hear the gusli of mountain rills. 

" There with me walks and kindly talks 
The dear, dear friend of all my years ; 
We laid him low not long ago, 
At Roslyn-side, with sobs and tears." 

Mr. Bryant prefaced the recitation of his poem with a 
few words of interesting reminiscence; and elsewhere 
in the programme he recited by request his brother's 
familiar lines beginning, " The melancholy days are 
come, the saddest of the year." The presence of the 
poet's brother made the occasion memorable indeed; and 
the interest of such an incident was increased to a still 
higher degree by the fact that Mr. Bryant was accom- 
panied by all the members of his immediate family and 
by representatives of other branches as well. 

Professor W. C. Wilkinson, of Chicago University, 
and the Rev. John White Chadwick, of Brooklyn, con- 
tributed poems, which were read. A large number of 
interesting letters were received from persons at a dis- 
tance, and the reading of extracts from them closed the 
ample programme. Among the letters received were 
those from Mr. Parke Godwin, Professor G. Stanley 
Hall, Professor Charles F. Richardson, Mr. Francis F. 
Browne, President Angell, Mr. Horace E. Scudder, Mr. 
Eugene Field, and Mr. Richard Watson Gilder. Among 
the musical numbers of the programme was the singing 
of "The Old Friends are the Truest," by Mr. E. L. 
Brown, son of the orator; and the hymns by William 
Cullen Bryant, " As shadows cast by cloud and sun," 
and " Oh, deem not they are blest alone." The exer- 
cises seemed not unworthy the occasion, and everywhere 
were heard expressions of satisfaction that such a tribute 
had been paid to the honored memory of America's good 
first-poet. \\r_ E. S. 

Galesburg, EL, Nov. 7, 1894. 



MUNICH was not the only city to have a " Hans Sachs 
Feier " on the fourth of this month. The four hun- 
dredth anniversary of the poet-cobbler of Nuremberg 
was celebrated by appropriate exercises both in New 
York and at the Northwestern University of Evanston. 



LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 

Mrs. G. J. Romanes is engaged upon a biography of 
her late husband. 

Mr. Henry Altemus announces a facsimile reprint of 
the first edition of " The Pilgrim's Progress," as issued 
in 1678. 

Professor Rhys-Davis, the great Orientalist, and Mr. 
David Christie Murray, the novelist, are lecturing in 
this country just now. 

It is said that while over 100,000 copies of " Trilby " 
have been sold in this country, the English three vol- 
ume edition has hardly amounted to a fiftieth of the 
number. 

A single-volume edition of Chaucer, complete, is prom- 
ised by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. It will be supplied 
with an introduction and glossary made especially for 
it by Professor Skeat. 

The English Spenser Society, which recently dis- 
banded, has, during the twenty-seven years of its exist- 
ence, published no less than fifty-three volumes of six- 
teenth and seventeenth century literature. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. announce an inexpensive 
series of " Economic Classics," to be edited by Professor 
W. J. Ashley. It will include translations and reprints, 
in whole or in part, of old and famous books. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. will soon begin the pub- 
lication of " The Bookman," in an Americanized form. 
The American part of the editing will be done by Pro- 
fessor Harry Thurston Peck and Mr. James Mac Arthur. 

" Four American Universities " will be the subject of 
an illustrated volume soon to be issued by Messrs. Har- 
per & Brothers; the universities being Harvard, Yale, 
Princeton, and Columbia, and the writers Professors 
Charles Eliot Norton, A. T. Hadley, W. M. Sloane, 
and Brander Matthews. Nearly simultaneous will be 
the publication, by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., of a trans- 
lation of Professor Paulsen's account of the German 
universities, with an introduction, contrasting the Ger- 
man and American universities, written by Professor 
N. M. Butler. 

Persons who are undertaking, or planning to under- 
take, anything like a systematic study of literature, 
whether at home, in the public library, or in private 
clubs or classes, may find practical advantage in a little 
pamphlet issued by " The Round Robin Reading Club " 
of Philadelphia, an organization that is doing excellent 
work in outlining and directing courses of reading by 
means of correspondence and printed schedules. The 
method has been approved by Mr. Howells, Mr. Hale, 
and Mr. Scudder, who also commend this organization. 
The pamphlet referred to may be had by addressing 
Miss Louise Stockton, Director, 4213 Chester avenue, 
Philadelphia. 

Dean Hole, in an interview published by " The Out- 
look," thus states the main purpose of his visit to Amer- 
ica: "I would never have taken this long vacation had 
I not been able to make arrangements to lecture while 
here. So, while my chief object in coming is to see 
America, I have another object that of raising money 
by my lectures to complete the architectural restora- 
tion of the Rochester Cathedral. The Cathedral has the 
oldest Norman nave in England. It is one of the first 
specimens of ecclesiastical architecture which one sees 
after landing at Liverpool. Some restorations have 
been attempted and partially carried out, but we need

much more money. Many thousand pounds have been 
expended in the restoration thus far, and we need to 
spend many thousand pounds more. We have a very 
ugly tower, which was added to the Cathedral about 
sixty years ago. We hope to bring that into some sort 
of consonance with the original lines of the Cathedral 
itself." 

From a considerable number of brief tributes to 
Holmes, published in " The Writer " for November, we 
select for reprinting the sonnet of Mrs. Julia C. R. 
Dorr: 

" ' How shall I crown this child ? ' fair Summer cried. 
' May wasted all her violets long ago ; 
No longer on the hills June's roses glow, 
Flushing with tender bloom the pastures wide. 
My stately lilies one by one have died : 
The clematis is but a ghost and lo ! 
In the fair meadow-lands no daisies blow ; 
How shall I crown this Summer child ? ' she sighed. 
Then quickly smiled. ' For him, for him,' she said, 
' On every hill my golden-rod shall flame, 
Token of all my prescient soul foretells. 
His shall be golden song and golden fame 
Long golden years with love and honor wed 
And crowns, at last, of silver immortelles ! ' "

The past record of THE INDEPENDENT is an 
earnest of what it will be in the future.

resentative character of its contributors, and in the 
breadth, ability, and vigor of its editorial discussions.

printed 1050 columns of reading matter, equivalent in 
octavo volumes to Bancroft's complete " History of the 
United States " twice over, with three volumes to spare. 

It has printed during the same time over 200 orig- 
inal poems, from the pens of the leading American, En- 
glish, and Canadian poets. 

It makes a specialty of short stories for old and young 
bright, readable ones of unexceptionable tone and lit- 
erary merit. 

It gives a complete religious history of the times in 
addition to full reports of all important religious assem- 
blages at home and abroad. It prints fresh letters from 
all mission fields throughout the world. 

There is no weekly newspaper printed in the English 
language so instructive, so necessary and useful to all 
classes and conditions of society, as THE INDEPEND- 
ENT. 

It makes its terms of subscription so favorable that 
few people have any excuse for not reading it habitually.

THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS. 

EDITED BY <DR. ALBERT SHAW. 



IN January, 1890, a new magazine, with a new idea in periodical literature, made its appearance 
in England. Its name, the " Review of Reviews," was suggestive of its purpose. Its aim was 
to give each month an epitome of current history and a summary of the world's best thought. In 
a single year it reached a sale of more copies than all the rest of the English reviews combined. 

In April, 1891, an American edition, under the editorial management of Dr. Albert Shaw, 
was brought out. This American edition was not a reprint of the English magazine. On the 
other hand, it dealt largely with American matters and was edited with perfect independence 
in its own office. The success of the American edition has become an event in the history of 
periodical literature in this country. During the first year it surpassed, in circulation, the most 
popular of the old and established reviews and before the close of the second year it was in close 
competition with the leading illustrated magazines. 

The principle on which the " Review of Reviews " has been edited, is that a magazine, made 
bright, timely, and comprehensive in text and illustration, and immediately in sympathy with 
every movement of social progress, would be considered indispensable. This theory has been 
vindicated in the career of the " Review of Reviews." The leaders in the religious and educa- 
tional worlds, the most prominent literary and professional men and women, have written to 
express their sense of the extraordinary ability and awakening power of this magazine.

COLONIAL T>AYS AND T>AMES. 

By ANNE HOLLINGSWORTH WHARTON, author of " Through Colonial Doorways." Illustrated. 12mo, 

cloth extra, $1.25. Edition de luxe, limited to the number of subscribers. 

The extraordinary success of " Through Colonial Doorways " has caused the authoress to prepare another 
book on the same lines, which, like it, deals with colonial personages and incidents. The edition de luxe will be 
profusely illustrated by portraits and sketches, while the small-paper edition has the necessary number of illus- 
trations to make a delightful Christmas gift.

Napoleon at Home. 

The Daily Life of the Emperor at the Tuileries. By 
FREDERICK MASSON. With 12 full-page illustrations 
by F. DE MYRBACH. 2 vols., 8vo, $7.50; half calf, 
$12.50. 

"These two handsome volumes form an addition to Napoleonic liter- 
ature which perfectly accords with the fashion of the present day and 
the taste which delights in domestic revelations concerning great per- 
sonalities. " London Daily Telegraph. 

Napoleon and the Fair Sex. 

By FREDERICK MASSON. With 10 full-page illustra- 
tions in the best style of the French art. 1 vol., 8vo, 
cloth, $5.00; half calf, $7.50. 

A large proportion of the chapters of the above work ap- 
peared in the " Figaro," the idea of writing them being sug- 
gested to the author by the following questions : " With what 
women is Napoleon known to have had temporary relations as 
a young man, as Consul, and finally as Emperor ? Had he an 
absorbing passion for any one woman ? and, if so, for whom ? " 
In his task the author has found many powerful allies, and 
has distilled the essence of documents that have been accum- 
ulating for years. The result is a narrative of the facts as 
they appear from these various evidences. 

Memoirs of Count Lavalette, 

Adjutant and Private Secretary to Napoleon, and Post- 
master-General under the Empire. With portraits. 
A limited edition of 150 copies for America, 12mo, 
cloth, $3.00. A limited edition of 25 large-paper 
copies for America, $6.00. 

Few persons knew Napoleon as did Lavalette ; and histo- 
rians gathering materials may place full confidence in his 
recital. No other facts are mentioned than those in which he 
was an eye-witness, and the author's character will prove a 
sufficient voucher for the truth. 



Around a Throne.

and her Favorites. By K. WALISKEWSKI, author of 
" Romance of an Empress." 2 vols., 8vo, cloth, $7.50 ;

History of Art in Primitive Greece. 

MYCENIAN ART. 

By GEORGES PERROT and CHARLES CHIPIEZ. With 564 Illustrations. 2 vols., imperial 8vo, uniform 
with " History of Art in Ancient Egypt," " History of Art in Chaldea and Assyria" "History of Art in Phoenicia" 
"History of Art in Sardinia, Judcea, Syria, and Asia Minor" "History of Art in Phrygia, Lydia and Caria, 
Lycia, Persia." Handsomely bound in cloth, gilt top, $15.50; three-quarter crushed levant morocco, $22.50. 
This New Work is the sixth in the Series by these distinguished writers on the " History of Ancient Art," 

the Jive previous works having achieved remarkable success and being accepted by the Highest Authorities as the 

Standard Works on the Subjects. 

This great history is, in many respects, the most important contribution of modern times to the literature of art and archaeology. As it pro- 
gresses its value becomes more and more apparent. The illustrations are admirable as illustrative art, and abundant to bring the descriptive text 
within the comprehension of the ordinary reader, as well as the student. The value of these works to every reader of history, whether of mankind 
or of what man has produced, consists in the fact that we have here from a scholar of the first rank (and none holds higher rank than Perrot) the 
results, in digested form, of the extensive contributions of knowledge made by Layard, Rawlinson, Loftus, George Smith, Lenormant, Maspero, 
Oppert, and a host of other distinguished laborers in the field.

the set, in a neat box, $7.50. Also bound in half calf, extra, at $3.00 per volume. 

It will be seen from the above description that in issuing the Fordham Edition it has been the aim of the publishers to offer volumes that shall

England in the Nineteenth Century. By ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER, author of 
" France in the Nineteenth Century," etc. Handsomely illustrated with twenty-seven half-tone portraits of 
celebrated characters. 8vo, 451 pages, $2.50. 
" It is a book which for interesting, comprehensive survey of events, done into thoroughly enjoyable form, cannot be too 

highly commended. Not for the learned student of historical details, but for the intelligent masses of reading people, Mrs. 

Latimer writes, taking no knowledge for granted, but telling her whole story with simple explicitness and charming ease." 

The Interior. 

Lady. By MARGUERITE BOUVET, author of " Sweet William," " Prince Tip Top," " Little Marjorie's 
Love Story." Illustrations and cover design by MARGARET and HELEN ARMSTRONG. 16mo, 284 pages, $1.25. 
" Perhaps no woman is so beloved of women readers as Marguerite Bouvet. . . . ' My Lady ' is a quaint, prim, and lofty 
little novel, old with the filmy aristocratic antiquity which hangs in the web of point lace and gobelin tapestries. It is a 
poem in prose, after the manner of Mendelssohn's ' Songs Without Words,' and the charming storv is exquisitely told with a 
sincere, plain gentleness which adds years of worth to the telling of it." AMY LESLIE, in The Chicago ffews. 

Reminiscences of a Portrait Painter. By G. P. A. HEAL Y. with portraits of Lincoln, 

Grant, Pope Pius IX., Webster, Thiers, Gambetta, Liszt, and others, after the original paintings by Mr. Healy. 

12mo, 221 pages, $1.50. 

" A capital autobiography, and a real multum in parvo in point of anecdotal good things. . . . Mr. Healy, as the world 
knows, was a master of the brush, and his book shows that he could wield the pen with a fluent neatness that might put 
many a professed writer to the blush. . . . The book is prettily gotten up, and the many portraits after originals by Mr. 
Healy form an element of decided interest." The Dial. 

In Bird Land. A Book for Bird-Lovers. By LEANDER S. KEYSER. 16mo, 269 pages, $1.25. 

" I have read your book with great pleasure. You are one of the few who write what they see, and do not draw on their 
imagination, nor on the old books." OLIVE THORNE MILLER, in a letter to the Author. 

Tales from the y^Egean. By DEMETRIOS BIKELAS. Translated by LEONARD E. OPDYCKE. With 

an introduction by HENRY A. HUNTINGTON. 16mo, 258 pages, $1.00. 

"It is a great pleasure to meet the modern Greeks in the pages of Mr. Bikelas, and to find them not the formidable people 
that their ancestors used to be in one's schooldays. These stories, besides the pleasure they give to artistic sensibilities, will 
enlarge the sympathies of the reader a merit which American readers particularly appreciate. The art of Mr. Bikelas is as 
effortless as the acting of Joseph Jefferson." The Chicago Tribune. 

Jewish Tales. Translated from the French of LEOPOLD VON SACHER MASOCH by HARRIET LIBBER 
COHEN. IGmo, 317 pages, $1.00. 

"The old-time Israelite is painted with a truthfulness that invariably commands and retains attention. The author's 
style is charming. He is realistic without being prosy, and his characters truly live and express themselves with a natural- 
ness that imparts to each one of them a distinct individuality. Those who are in search of original and unhackneyed fiction 
will find it in this volume." The Saturday Evening Gazette, Boston. 

The Price Of Peace. A Story of the Times of Ahab, King of Israel. By A. W. ACKERMAN. 12mo, 
390 pages, $1.25. 

" The author has made those stirring times of the Israelites the incidents of his story, and he has used his material well. 
His characters are admirably drawn. His story is full of dramatic interest. Many of his descriptions are strong and vivid. 
But most important, perhaps, are the pictures of Micaiah and Ruth, which the author gives. They are skilfully presented, 
and full of present interest." The Milwaukee Journal. 

The Crucifixion Of Phillip Strong. A Novel. By C. M. SHELDON. 12mo, 267 pages, $1.00. 

"It is a powerful discourse, in story form, on practical Christianity, or rather the utter absence of it, in this business 
world of ours. . . . It is the story not new, but newly told and peopled of the sacrifice of a brave life for conscience's 
sake." The Chicago Herald . 

Things Of the Mind. By the Rt. Rev. J. L. SPALDING, Bishop of Peoria. Author of "Education 

and the Higher Life," etc., etc. 12mo, 235 pages, $1.00. 

Bishop Spalding is here in his chosen field, and writes in a delightfully clear and terse style of Education, Culture, Relig- 
ion, and Patriotism. Essays of this character are all too rare, and they are to be welcomed for their tendency to draw the 
mind from things material to things spiritual. 

The Power Of an EndleSS Life. By the Rev. THOMAS C. HALL. 12mo, 190 pages, $1.00. 

" These sermons are intensely Christian in spirit, thought, and purpose. . . . The style, as well as the thinking, is sim-

piled by FREDERICK W. MORTON. 16mo, $1.00.

amusing, and edifying collection of the utterances of the best minds on the best possible subject." MARY ABBOTT, in the 

Chicago Herald.

IN THE 



NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW 

YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND 

THE RIGHT TOPICS, 

BY THE RIGHT MEN, 

AT THE RIGHT TIME. 



The Topics are always those which are uppermost 
in the public mind in religion, morals, politics, 
science, literature, business, finance, industrial econ- 
omy, social and municipal affairs, etc. in short, all 
subjects on which Americans require and desire to be 
informed. No MAGAZINE FOLLOWS so CLOSELY FROM 

MONTH TO MONTH THE COURSE OF PUBLIC INTEREST. 

All subjects are treated of impartially on both sides. 

The Contributors to the REVIEW are the men and 
women to whom the world looks for the most author- 
itative statements on the subjects of the day. No 
other periodical can point to such a succession of dis- 
tinguished writers. 

The Time when these subjects are treated of by 
these contributors is the very time when the subjects 
are in the public mind not a month or two after 
people have ceased to think of them. The prompt- 
ness with which the REVIEW furnishes its readers 
with the most authoritative information upon the 
topics of the day is one of its most valuable features. 



THE 

North American Review 

Is the only periodical of its class which has a 
recognized place as 

A FAHILY nAGAZINE. 

This is because it devotes much attention to subjects that 
are of special interest to women. Among such subjects re- 
cently discussed are : 

MARK TWAIN'S DEFENCE OF HARRIET SHELLEY. 

THE RENAISSANCE OF WOMAN. 

WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN PRACTICE. 

SARAH GRAND, Author of "THE HEAVENLY TWINS," on 

THE NEW ASPECT OF THE WOMAN QUESTION. 

THE MODERN GIRL. 

THE MEN OF THE MOMENT. 
THE FINANCIAL DEPENDENCE OF WOMEN. 
THE SERVANT GIRL OF THE FUTURE. 
THE AMATEUR NURSE. 
THE TYRANNY OF THE KITCHEN. 
GOOD AND BAD MOTHERS. 

AMERICAN LIFE AND PHYSICAL DETERIORATION.

BRITISH WOMEN AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. 
THE LACK OF GOOD SERVANTS. 
DOMESTIC SERVICE IN ENGLAND. 
THE SERVANT GIRL'S POINT OF VIEW.

CO-OPERATIVE WOMANHOOD IN THE STATE. 
THE FUTURE OF MARRIAGE. 
WHY MORE GIRLS DO NOT MARRY. 
EVILS OF EARLY MARRIAGES. 
RESCUE WORK AMONG FALLEN WOMEN. 
ETC., ETC., ETC. 



THE LIST OF CONTRIBUTORS 

to the REVIEW forms a roll of men and women who are making the history, controlling the affairs, and leading 
the opinion of the age. No other periodical in the world can point to such a succession of distinguished writers 
as have contributed to the REVIEW during the past three years. The list embraces American and British Cab- 
inet Ministers, including the Prime Minister of England; United States Senators and Representatives; Governors 
of States; American Ministers abroad; Foreign Ministers to the United States; Judges of the Supreme Court; 
Ecclesiastical Dignitaries and Eminent Theologians of every Denomination; Officers of the Army and Navy; 
famous Physicians and Scientists; and in general men and women whose names are household words throughout 
the English-speaking world. 

WOMEN CONTRIBUTORS. 

Among the well-known women who have written for recent numbers of the REVIEW are the following: Sarah 
Grand, Lady Henry Somerset, (jail Hamilton, Agnes Repplier, Amelia B. Barr, " Julien Gordon," 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, fladame Adam, Lady Jeune, Ouida, The Countess of Aberdeen, flarion 
Harland, Amelie Rives, 1-ady Frances Balfour, Mrs. Kate Gannett Wells, Mrs. M. E. W. Sherwood, 
Emily Faithful), Lady Dilke, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, Clara fiords, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. 



A NEW FEATURE FOR 1895. 

The REVIEW will publish in twelve chapters, beginning with the January number, the 
PERSONAL HISTORY OF THE SECOND EMPIRE, 

a historical work of unsurpassed importance, which will throw a flood of new light upon the chequered career of 
Napoleon III. and the influences which led to the collapse of his Empire in the gigantic struggle with united 
Germany, under Wilhelm I. and his Iron Chancellor. It is as fascinating as a romance, being richly anecdotal 
and full of information drawn from sources hitherto inaccessible, presented in the graphic and vivacious style 
which " The Englishman in Paris," by the same author, has made familiar to thousand of readers.

THE CRERAR LIBRARY. 

It is now just five years since the will of the 
late John Crerar passed through the Probate 
Court. By that will, as is widely known, the 
wealthy testator left the bulk of his fortune to 
be applied to the endowment of a public library 
to be established in the South Division of the 
City of Chicago. Vexatious litigation has 
caused the accomplishment of his purpose to 
be postponed ; but the disputed questions have 
now been definitely settled by the courts, and 
executors and trustees are preparing to carry 
out the wishes of the testator. On the whole, 
the public has fared better than it did with the 
Newberry Library, which had to wait twice as 
long, and with far less excuse for delay, to get 
started. The postponement, in the present case, 
was unavoidable, and it has had the beneficent 
effect of permitting opinion to ripen, and of 
leaving to the Newberry Library a fair start, 
thus avoiding the confusion of aim that would 
inevitably have followed an attempt to begin the 



324 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



collection of two great libraries at the same time. 

The funds at the disposal of the Crerar trus- 
tees now amount, in round numbers, to two and 
a half millions of dollars. The trustees met 
on the twenty-third of November, listened to a 
number of reports and suggestions, and organ- 
ized for work. The only question practically 
settled up to this point is that of the general 
character of the library. The executors re- 
ported in favor of a library for reference rather 
than for circulation, and the trustees seem sub- 
stantially agreed upon this subject. There is 
no doubt that the decision is a wise one. The 
City Library, supported by general taxation, 
amply provides for the circulation of popular 
literature. Its efficient management makes it 
a real factor in the educational work of the 
community, and its thirty-one delivery stations 
give to all sections and classes of the popula- 
tion the easy use of its collections. An attempt 
to duplicate this work, already so well done, 
would be a waste of energy ; and we are glad 
to note that no such attempt is contemplated 
by the trustees of the Crerar foundation. 

The questions immediately confronting the 
trustees relate to the choice of a librarian, the 
selection of a site, and the determination of the 
special lines upon which books shall be col- 
lected. It seems to be the general sentiment 
of the trustees that the last of these questions 
is the first to deserve settlement, since the 
answer given to it may influence the settlement 
of the other two. We are by no means sure 
that this opinion is well-founded. Why the 
site of the library should help to determine the 
character of the librarian is not obvious. The 
special trend of the collections to be made 
should doubtless be taken into account when 
a librarian is chosen, but does not constitute so 
large an element in the problem as may at first 
be thought. Suppose that the decision be made 
to collect mainly in one bibliographical field, 
it is still far more important that the librarian 
be a man of broad general culture than a spe- 
cialist in that field. On the other hand, there 
is a good deal to be said for the view that 
the professional advice of the librarian is need- 
ful from the very start, even in such prelimin- 
ary matters as the selection of a site and the 
determination of the library's scope. In fact, 
" First appoint your librarian " seems to us a 
maxim almost as cogent as the more familiar 
" First catch your hare." 

In making this statement we assume as a 
matter of course that the trustees are prepared 
to defer to the expert knowledge of a profes- 



sional librarian in all matters relating to the 
special work of the library. If they are not 
prepared to do this, if they intend themselves 
to assume the direction of the institution in 
any other than its external and financial as- 
pects, it matters little when they choose their 
librarian, or whom they designate for the post. 
An instructive illustration of misconceived du- 
ties, and of what happens when a board of trus- 
tees fails to confine its action within its own 
proper field, is afforded by the history of the 
Newberry Library. Perhaps the two greatest 
mistakes that it is possible for a board of library 
trustees to make are those which have been 
made by the Newberry directors. In the first 
place, they listened to the enticing voice of the 
architect, and disregarded the sober wisdom of 
the librarian, when the question of a suitable 
building was considered. In consequence of 
this action, an imposing structure, at an enor- 
mous cost, was planned and erected, while the 
endowment of the library suffered proportion- 
ally. Yet the problem of a library building is 
very distinctly one of librarianship rather than 
of architecture. And the income of the New- 
berry Library will suffer for all time to come 
from this reckless impairment of the endow- 
ment. The other mistake was that of so limit- 
ing the powers of the librarian as to make him 
little more than an agent of his employers, the 
latter arrogating to themselves the right to con- 
trol the library management in its smallest de- 
tails. Fortunate enough to secure the services 
of the most distinguished American represent- 
ative of the profession, the trustees refused him 
the powers which are the very sine qua non of 
efficiency the power of absolute control over 
his subordinates, and the largest of discretion- 
ary powers in the selection and purchase of 
books. It is to be hoped that the Crerar trus- 
tees will be warned by the example set them, 
and will at least avoid the mistakes that have 
so sadly crippled the resources and the service- 
able efficiency of this sister institution. 

Within the past few years we have had fre- 
quent occasion to contrast the management of 
the two great culture endowments of Chicago, 
and never without a feeling of wonder that the 
same general machinery should have produced, 
in the two cases, results so different. Both 
the Newberry Library and the University of 
Chicago are controlled by bodies of men be- 
longing to the same general class of society, 
and having the same general characteristics. 
They are gentlemen of a certain achievement, 
high social standing, and marked business abil- 



1894.] 



THE DIAL

ity. On the other hand, they are not, as a rule, 
possessed of expert knowledge in educational or 
library matters, respectively. Each body of trus- 
tees was able to secure for the executive head of 
the institution under its control a man of excep- 
tional ability and experience. At this point the 
cases cease to run parallel. The University trus- 
tees were wise enough, having chosen a president 
for their institution, to leave its control, as far as 
all educational questions are concerned, entirely 
in his hands and in the hands of his faculty. 
The real work of the trustees is the manage- 
ment of the endowment fund ; all other uni- 
versity matters are left to the president and 
faculty, the approval of the trustees being a 
pure formality. The trustees would never 
dream, for example, of forcing a faculty ap- 
pointment or of controlling the courses of study. 
On the other hand, the Newberry trustees were 
unwise enough to act in a manner directly op- 
posed to that above described. The discretion- 
ary powers that correspond, in the case of the 
librarian, to those that the university president 
must exercise, are the power to appoint, direct, 
classify, and promote his assistants, and the 
power to use his own judgment in the selection 
and purchase of books. These are the funda- 
mentals of self-respecting librarianship. A 
board of trustees should hardly do more than 
say to their librarian : " We find that we can 
spare so much a year for the library service, 
and so much a year for the purchase of books ; 
the money is now placed at your disposal, to be 
used to the best possible advantage." This is 
substantially the position that has been taken 
from the start by the University trustees to- 
wards President Harper ; it is almost the exact 
reverse of the position taken by the Newberry 
trustees towards Librarian Poole. It is not 
difficult, comparing the results, to say which of 
the two systems has worked the better. And 
it is hoped that so plain a moral will not be 
missed by the trustees of the Crerar Library. 
In the selection of a site for the new library, 
the future as well as the present should be con- 
sidered. The division of the city in which the 
library must be established is fast expanding, 
and its centre of population is moving swiftly 
southwards. A site somewhat in advance of 
that centre would seem to be the most desir- 
able, a consideration which indicates the neigh- 
borhood of the University. In fact, the exist- 
ence of the University and of the Field Museum 
in the same region offers a very strong reason 
why the third great foundation should go there 
also. There is much advantage in the concen- 



tration of such foci of culture as libraries, uni- 
versities, and museums. While we are not dis-' 
posed to say that the situation of the Crerar 
Library should be settled by these considera- 
tions, it seems as if the argument were stronger 
for this region than for any other. 

The remaining fundamental question is that 
of the special field of the Crerar collection. A 
familiar epigram has it that the well-educated 
man should know something of everything and 
everything of something. We think that a great 
library, pending the remote period when it may 
come to realize the Utopian ideal of containing 
" everything of everything," should be like the 
man of the epigram. That is, it should have 
a well-rounded collection of general litera- 
ture, including all the books likely to be wanted 
upon any subject by people who are not special- 
ists, and it should also develope one or more 
subjects as specialties. Upon this question of 
specialties we understand that the Crerar trus- 
tees are practically agreed ; but the question 
is still open as to what the specialties shall be. 
Among the suggestions made at the meeting of 
last week, the subjects of science, the industrial 
arts, and Americana were named, and the lat- 
ter was particularly favored. We should con- 
sider the adoption of this suggestion unfortu- 
nate for several reasons. In the first place, 
the late Dr. Poole, being an ardent student of 
American history, laid broad foundations for 
the development of this department, first in the 
Public Library, and afterwards in the New- 
berry. It would be better to carry on the good 
work in one or both of these institutions than 
to start it afresh in the new one. In the second 
place, the collection of Americana, important 
though it be, is even now relatively overdone 
throughout the country. In the third place, 
such a collection would mean the purchase of 
many rare and curious volumes at large ex- 
pense ; and no library should indulge in such 
luxuries as long as more pressing wants remain 
unsupplied. Lastly, there are other subjects 
of wider and more permanent interest, yet 
strangely neglected in our libraries ; subjects 
which, all things considered, would be more 
welcome to the constituency of the Crerar Li- 
brary, and are more deserving the attention of 
its trustees. One of these subjects is that of 
English literature, in the largest sense ; and 
we wish to offer, as our contribution to the 
discussion, the suggestion that this be made 
the main subject of the Crerar collection. The 
reasons for this suggestion, if reasons be needed, 
must be left for future discussion.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



MR. BURROUGHS ON "MERE LITERATURE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

May I add a word to what Mr. John Burroughs so 
finely and nobly says on " Mere Literature," in your 
issue of Nov. 1 ? 

A reviewer in " The Nation " some time ago used 
this language : 

" To tell the truth, Carlyle was not, properly speaking, a 
literary man. He felt that he had a moral message to deliver 
to the world, and for the purpose of delivering it he invented 
an extraordinary literary vehicle, which he used with great 
effect. But his interests were all ethical." 
The contrast here between ethical interests and literary 
interests is tolerably plain. A man with a message, like 
Carlyle, may speak in perfect literary form (I do not 
say that Carlyle did), but this form is never an end in 
itself to him. He does not write to please, to delight, 
but to stir and inspire. The " literary " man, on the 
other hand, delights in perfection of literary form for 
its own sake, and satisfies that delight in others. The 
difference is not in the subject-matter, the content of 
what is said, but in the point of view. Does not Mr. 
Henry James seem to be an instance of the man whose 
interests are mainly literary, who if he produces a work 
of art is satisfied, and who would find it almost vulgar 
to have any purpose beyond this ? 

And yet that perfection of literary form need not 
hinder one from rising out of the rank of " men of let- 
ters " altogether, seems to be proved by the case of the 
late Dr. Newman. Where shall we find more finish 
even in his " Parochial and Plain Sermons " and yet 
where more power ? Who more entirely wrote to con- 
vince, to move, to persuade ? It was he who in his " Let- 
ter to the Duke of Norfolk on Occasion of Mr. Glad- 
stone's Recent Expostulation" (1875), after a great and 
almost classical passage on Conscience, used this lan- 
guage : 

"Noble buildings have been reared as fortresses against 
that spiritual, invisible influence which is too subtle for science 
and too prof ound for literature."

THE SOCIAL DISTRIBUTION OF CRUELTY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I was a little amused at the tone of a recent book- 
notice in THE DIAL (Oct. 1, p. 200), headed " Poultry- 
killing as a Fine Art," in which the character of the 
British sportsman came in for a sharp scoring. With 
your writer's humanitarian views I heartily agree; but 
to his unfair and thoroughly American intimation that 
the barbarities of British " sport " are confined to the 
gentry, as contradistinguished from the mob (or per- 
haps one should say nowadays the proletariat), I beg 
leave to demur. If aristocratic Hurlingham has its 
pigeon-matches, vulgar Whitechapel has its rat-pits ; 
and the British tradesman, for all his supposed monop- 
oly of the national virtues, is certainly quite as prone as 
his social betters to regard a fine day mainly as the pro- 
verbial invitation to " go and kill something." As a 
matter of fact the passion for amateur butchery is shared 
in, in England, by all classes alike (not forgetting the 
clergy, a distinguished member of whose sporting wing 
is now lecturing in America) from the peer to the cos- 
termonger; and our cis- Atlantic habit of mentally as- 



sociating the vices with " the classes " and the virtues 
with " the masses " should not blind us to the truth that 
it is largely to " the classes " that the growing human- 
itarian movement is due. One of its foremost cham- 
pions, for instance, is Lady Florence Dixie; and I may 
say that a letter from her ladyship to the " Pall Mall 
Gazette " on the subject of pheasant-driving quite bears 
out your reviewer's estimate of that singularly brutal 
pastime, in which tens of thousands of tame hand-reared 
birds are butchered yearly in the name of " sport." But 
is sport-loving England, after all, the only fruitful field 
for the humanitarian propaganda ? There is perhaps 
more than a grain of ugly truth in " Ouida's " charge that 
" If in a mob of Londoners, Parisians, New Yorkers, 
Berliners, Melbourners, a dove fluttered down to seek 
a refuge, a hundred dirty hands would be stretched out 
to seize it, and wring its neck; and if anyone tried to 
save and cherish it, he would be rudely ' bonneted ' and 
mocked and hustled amidst the brutal guffaws of roughs, 
lower and more hideous in aspect and in nature than 
any animal which lives." Truly, they order these mat- 
ters better in the Orient, where religion has thrown its 
shield over the dumb creatures, and where the hard- 
and-fast Scriptural distinction between man and beast 
is unknown. A. W. G. 

Toronto, Canada, Nov. 27, 1894. 

[The reviewer disclaims any thought of imputing 
the " barbarities of British ' sport ' " to " the classes " 
exclusively. The form of " sport " singled out for 
condemnation was the " drive," as practised on the 
grouse moors of the great landed estates. This 
pastime, like many others, is surely well out of reach 
of proletarian pockets. EDB. DIAL.] 

WHAT DO WE MEAN BY " LITERATURE " ? 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

After reading the many valuable articles published 
in THE DIAL on English in the several Universities 
represented, and looking in vain for someone to tell us 
just what he means when he speaks of "literature," I 
am led to wonder whether any well-defined idea exists 
as to what impression each produces upon the other 
when the word " literature " is used. We have had one 
unbroken succession of wise and willing critics, from 
Aristotle to men now living, who have told us what lit- 
erature ought to be, and where it falls short in certain 
cases. The line of march of literary criticism is strewn 
with the bleaching skulls of innumerable law-givers and 
dogmatists, but the Darwin and the Spencer of litera- 
ture are yet invisibly distant in the future. For me to 
say what literature is, or how it should be studied, 
places me upon the same dangerous ground upon which 
wiser ones have stood and have fallen, and would make 
me no less dogmatic than those I question. 

If I were required to offer a starting-point in the 
study of literature, it would be a proposition so simple 
that I believe no one could take exceptions; and while 
I should not offer it as a panacea for all the ills that 
literary study is heir to, I am constrained to believe 
that it is founded upon safe principles of studentship 
and may be helpful as a suggestion. My proposition is 
this : The literature of any selection is permanent. What- 
ever of literature is in Chaucer's Knight's Tale now was 
in it the day it was written, neither more nor less, and 
there is no literary question in it for me that was not 
there for the author's contemporaries. The literature

of Browning and Whitman will be in the twenty-ninth 
century what it is in the nineteenth. True, no doubt, 
future generations must study our ethics, religion, so- 
ciology, and language, in order to understand our art 
impulses and tendencies; but it is to be hoped they will 
not misname these preparatory studies " literature," as 
their ancestors did. 

If the proposition set forth is of any value, there is 
one thought to be emphasized. If I am studying the 
literature of Sidney to-day, I must deal with the same 
material which his contemporaries dealt with. If his 
language was to them a problem, it is so to me; if not 
to them, it can be only a preparatory study for me only 
a clearing-away process. The religion and sociology of 
Piers Plowman is for me a study, but only prepara- 
tory, for these facts were generally known to his con- 
temporaries. And on the other hand, if sentence struct- 
ure, figures of speech, mythological references, verse, 
stanza, and rhyme are art devices now they were cer- 
tainly art devices when used by an early author, and are 
therefore appropriate for consideration; yet they are 
only devices. 

To the student of literature, looking from the proposi- 
tion announced, there is one test for each question that 
he shall consider: Did this question exercise the thought, 
feeling, or will of the artist ? If not, why should it ex- 
ercise me as a student of the thought, feeling, and will 
of the artist ? w E HENRY.

THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF WHITTIER.* 

Mr. Pickard's " Life and Letters of John 
Greenleaf Whittier " meets at all points the 
pleasant anticipations we had formed of it, and 
the author is to be credited with perhaps the 
best and most satisfying piece of literary biog- 
raphy since Mr. Cabot's " Emerson." It is a 
definitive work which all lovers of the laureate 
of rural New England and the anti-slavery cru- 
sade will receive with gratitude, and one which 
no American who loves his country and feels 
a proper pride in the movement which finally 
erased from the scutcheon its one damning blot 
should leave unread. Mr. Pickard began his 
work with the double advantage of an engaging 
theme and an abundance of correct data. Pos- 
sibly Mr. Whittier felt the force of Brougham's 
remark that death has an added sting for emi- 
nence, in the form of lying biography ; for we 
find that ten years before his death he took the 
precaution to begin arrangements for the pres- 
ent Life, authorizing the collection of material 
for it, freely aiding the author with general sug- 
gestions, and giving information that led to 

* LIFE AND LETTERS OF JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER. 
By Samuel T. Pickard. In two volumes, with seven etchings. 
Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



a large collection of letters illustrating every 
period of his life. The work thus not only 
bears the hall-mark of his express sanction, but 
it is to some extent the result of his personal 
cooperation and supervision. Every phase of 
Mr. Whittier's career is fairly and satisfac- 
torily shown his boyhood on the ancestral 
farm, his scanty school-days, his earlier literary 
and journalistic ventures, his editorial experi- 
ences at Boston, Haverhill, and Hartford, his 
excursions into the field of practical politics 
(he barely escaped Congress in 1832 by being 
under the Congressional age), his anti-slavery 
apostolate, and the more familiar phases of his 
later life. 

But little has been known hitherto of the 
first thirty years of Mr. Whittier's career a 
period during which his ambition was clearly 
political rather than literary, although he was 
at the same time winning some credit as a poet 
by verses which the riper judgment of his later 
years suppressed. It was not, indeed, until he 
was about twenty-seven years of age that he 
found his true poetical utterance. Up to that 
time the hundreds of poems he had written 
were mere metrical and rhetorical exercises, 
jejune enough mostly, and sadly unsuggestive 
of " those brave translunary things " that are 
born of inspiration and elude effort. But after 
1833, a date marking a spiritual crisis with Mr. 
Whittier, a sudden and magic change came 
over the quality of his verse. It was with his 
resolve to champion the cause of the slave that 
the long-courted afflatus came ; and he passed 
at once from poetaster to poet. Says Mr. 
Pickard : 

" His pen was kept busy in advocating the cause he 
had espoused, and the poems known as the Voices of 
Freedom ' came rapidly one after another, hammer 
strokes against flinty prejudice. Sparks followed each 
blow. Those who are old enough remember how these 
spirited verses stirred and warmed the young hearts of 
the North, and prepared the soil from which sprang the 
great political party which took from him the watch- 
word, ' Justice the highest expediency.' " 

Whatever may be Mr. Whittier's title to 
purely literary fame, it is his true distinction 
to have been the Tyrtseus of the only war in 
history spontaneously waged by a great people 
to vindicate a moral principle. 

The story of Mr. Whittier's boyhood and 
early youth is interesting in itself and in its 
bearing upon his after life. It tells of a pretty 
constant struggle with the stony acres of the 
New England farm, and with the difficulties of 
getting an education ; yet it is lighted with 
many a bit of quaint humor, the source of which 



328 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



is unmistakable. The Whittiers held a leading 
social position in the East Parish, and their 
religious views, though shared in by none of 
their neighbors, were respected. Religion was 
a matter of daily theme and practice in the 
Quaker household. 

" A portion of the afternoon was generally spent by 
the assembled family in reading the Scriptures. . . . 
To this faithful teaching in the home may be attributed 
in large measure Whittier's familiarity with Holy Writ 
and the frequent quotations therefrom in his writings. 
As Stedinan has truly said, ' The Bible is rarely absent 
from his verse, and its spirit never.' " 

Quaker meetings were sometimes held in the 
great farm-kitchen of the Haverhill homestead ; 
and Mr. Whittier used to tell with great glee 
how on one such occasion a favorite ox, known 
to the family as " Old Butler," thrust his head 
in at the window, and benignly yet critically 
surveyed the assemblage. 

" While a sweet-voiced woman was speaking, ' Old 
Butler ' paid strict attention, but when she sat down and 
there arose a loud-voiced brother, he withdrew his head 
from the window, lifted his tail in air, and went off bel- 
lowing. This bovine criticism was greatly enjoyed by 
the younger members of the meeting." 

There was another comical incident of his 
boyhood that Mr. Whittier was fond of tell- 
ing. When he was nine years old President 
Monroe visited Haverhill, and it happened that 
on the same day there was a rival attraction in 
the shape of a menagerie. Both spectacles, it 
seems, savored of vanity to the elder Whittiers ; 
and the Quaker boy was forbidden to see either 
the wild beasts or the nation's Chief Magis- 
trate. 

" He did not care much for the former, but he was 
anxious to see a President of the United States. The 
next day he trudged all the way to Haverhill, deter- 
mined to see at least some footsteps in the street that 
the great man had left behind him. He found at last 
an impression of the elephant's foot in the road, and 
supposing this to be Monroe's track, he followed it as 
far as he could distinguish it. Then he went home, sat- 
isfied that he had seen the footsteps of the greatest man 
in the country." 

An altogether stupendous event to the farm- 
bred boy was his first trip to Boston. He wore, 
as he used to relate, on this great occasion his first 
" boughten buttons," and a special broad-brim 
that would have credited George Fox, " made 
for him by Aunt Mercy out of pasteboard, cov- 
ered with drab velvet " ; and he was rather sur- 
prised to find that his gala attire failed to im- 
press those who passed him on the street. A 
notable incident of this visit was his purchase 
of a copy of Shakespeare. That temptation he 
could not resist as he did one scarcely less 
alluring. 



" He had been strictly cautioned by his mother to 
avoid the theatre, and when he learned that a brilliant 
lady he met at the table of his hostess, who had been 
very kind in her attentions to the quaint, shy boy, and 
who had quite won his heart by her simplicity and grace, 
was an actress, it was a great shock to him ; but he had 
the courage to refuse her invitation to the play-house, 
and cut short his visit to the city to avoid the terrible 
temptation to which he was subjected. He had gone 
quite too far in buying Shakespeare's plays, and fled 
homeward lest he should bring disgrace upon his Qua- 
kerism." 

It may be inferred from this story that the 
Whittier library was a slender one. There were 
about thirty volumes in all journals and reli- 
gious disquisitions of the pioneers of Quaker- 
ism, most of them, and rather juiceless aliment 
for an imaginative lad in his teens. Yet he 
devoured them all, and knew them nearly by 
heart. He used to say in later life that he read 
the journals of Friends so much that he had 
steeped his mind with their thoughts. " He 
loved their authors because they were so saintly, 
and yet so humbly unconscious of it." 

For some time, as it seems, these meagre, if 
pious, productions filled young Whittier's ideal 
and rounded his literary horizon. But sud- 
denly a richer world, a world of matchless song 
and unpremeditated art, of pathos the tender- 
est, tears the saddest, and laughter the mer- 
riest, opened as if by magic before him. The 
Merlin who (all unconsciously) wrought the 
wonder was the district teacher, who, accus- 
tomed to read aloud to the Whittiers as they 
sat round the evening fire, brought with him 
one memorable night a copy of Burns. From 
this copious fount he read many pages, explain- 
ing the Scottish dialect as he proceeded ; and 
young John Greenleaf listened spellbound to 
the end. 

" A fire was that evening kindled upon an altar that 
grew not cold for seventy years. The reader had only 
thought of his older listeners as he read and explained. 
. . . He recalled the lad to his ordinary senses by offer- 
ing to leave the book with him, if he was interested in 
it. The offer was, of course, gladly accepted. What 
this little volume thus loaned to him was to young Whit- 
tier, has since been told in one of the finest tributes to 
Burns that has yet been written." 

Thus inspired, the boy soon began to try his 
own wings ; but it must be owned his early 
numbers were perhaps the feeblest poetic flut- 
terings that ever heralded the upward flight of 
bard. There is a tradition that his first rhymes 
were written upon the beam of his mother's 
loom and the story is not without its symbol- 
ism ; for there is nearly always a certain sug- 
gestion of homespun in Whittier's verse. One 
of his first effusions, happily rescued from ob-

livion by the memory of an older sister, ran 
thus : 

" And must I always swing the flail, 

And help to fill the milking-pail ? 

I wish to go away to school ; 

I do not wish to be a fool." 

A production even more unpromising than 
the above was an attempt at a rhymed catalogue 
of his father's library a theme, however, that 
must have heavily handicapped a stronger 
Muse. Here are four of the verses : 

" William Penn's laborious writing. 
And a book 'gainst Christians fighting. 

" A book concerning John's Baptism, 
Elias Smith's Universalism. 

' ' How Rollins to obtain the cash, 
Wrote a dull history of trash. 

"And Tufts, too, though I will be civil, 
Worse than an incarnate devil." 

It is pretty hard to reconcile these harrow- 
ing pieces with the boy's honest admiration for 
and study of the memorable volume of Burns ; 
but Mr. Whittier's talent, as we have shown, 
was late in flowering. 

Touching the rhymed wish, quoted above, 
" to go away to school," it is interesting to 
note that its fulfilment was brought about partly 
through the intercession of Whittier's future co- 
laborer, William Lloyd Garrison, then (1826) 
editor of the weekly " Free Press," in New- 
buryport. Whittier had contributed a poem 
(probably a vast improvement upon the above 
productions), entitled "The Deity," to this 
journal ; and Garrison thought so well of it 
that he not only drove out fourteen miles to 
see his new contributor, but introduced his 
poem editorially as follows : 

" The author of the following graphic sketch, which 
would do credit to riper years, is a youth of only six- 
teen, who we think bids fair to be another Bernard Bar- 
ton, of whose persuasion he is. His poetry bears the 
stamp of true genius, which, if carefully cultivated, will 
rank him among the poets of his country." 

It would seem from this that Garrison, the 
destined hero of the anti-slavery agitation, was 
the first to point out the poetic promise of its 
future bard. 

Mr. Pickard's second volume is largely made 
up of Mr. Whittier's letters ; and these singu- 
larly frank and unstudied missives enable us 
better than volumes of labored analysis to see 
and understand the writer. The letters to 
Holmes, Emerson, Lowell, Channing, Sumner, 
Bayard Taylor, and others, offer a rich field 
for quotation, but we must limit ourselves to 
the following, addressed to Dr. Holmes, Dec. 
17, 1879: 

" Thy note received the evening before my birthday 



made me very happy. Among the many kind greetings 
which reach me on this anniversary, thine has been most 
welcome, for a word of praise from thee is prized more 
highly than all, though I do not undervalue any one's 
love or friendship. I have often since I met thee in 
Boston thought of thy remark that we four singers seem 
to be isolated set apart as it were in lonely compan- 
ionship, garlanded as if for sacrifice, the world about 
us waiting to see who first shall falter in his song, who 
first shall pass out of the sunshine into the great shadow ! 
There is something pathetic in it all. I feel like clasp- 
ing closer the hands of my companions. I realize more 
and more that fame and notoriety can avail little in our 
situation; that love is the one essential thing, always 
welcome, outliving time and change, and going with us 
into the unguessed possibilities of death. There is noth- 
ing so sweet in the old Bible as the declaration that 
' God is Love.' I am no Calvinist, but I feel in looking 
over my life double-motived and full of failures that 
I cannot rely upon word or work of mine to offset sins 
and shortcomings, but upon Love alone. 

" Dear H., we began together in Buckingham's ' Mag- 
azine,' and together we are keeping step in the ' At- 
lantic.' Not evenly, indeed, for thy step is lighter and 
freer than mine. How many who began with us have 
fallen by the way ! The cypress shadows lie dark about 
us, but I think thee contrive to keep in the low wester- 
ing sunshine more than I can." 

Mr. Pickard's book is likely to meet the wide 
appreciation it deserves ; for Whittier is of all 
our considerable poets the one nearest the pop- 
ular heart and understanding. He is the most 
essentially and uniformly native of all ; and in 
his works if anywhere is found that " flavor of 
the soil " that we read so much about nowa- 
days and meet so little of. He is the true 
Theocritus of " stern New England's hills and 
vales "; and the voice of her streams, the song 
of her birds, and the scent of her flowers is in 
his verse. This distinctive home-keeping qual- 
ity has found touching recognition. When the 
" low westering sun " had vanished, and the 
" cypress shadows " were merged in final dark- 
ness, it was in a grave lined with the native 
fern and golden-rod that Whittier was laid to 
rest. The thought thus beautifully symbolized 
finds expression in a verse from Dr. Holmes's 
tribute to his friend : 

" The wild flowers springing from thy native sod, 

Lent all their charms thy new-world song to fill, 
Gave thee the mayflower and the golden-rod 

To match the daisy and the daffodil." 

E. G. J. 



THE second volume of Mrs. Garnett's new translation 
of Tourgue'nieff gives us " A House of Gentlefolk," 
which title, we need hardly say, corresponds to the more 
familiar " Lisa " and " A Nest of Noblemen." " Step- 
niak," who contributes an introduction, outlines the his- 
torical and social significance of this immortal work, 
and hints once or twice at an esoteric sense in which it 
should be taken to be fully understood. The transla- 
tion, which we understand to be made directly from the 
Russian, is excellent.

THE ANTIQUITY OF E VOLUTION. * 

Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn has ren- 
dered an important service by the preparation 
of a concise history of the growth of the idea 
of Evolution. The chief contributions of the 
different thinkers from Thales to Darwin are 
brought into clear perspective, and a just esti- 
mate of the methods and results of each one is 
reached. The work is extremely well done, 
and it has an added value of great importance 
in the fact that the author is a trained biolo- 
gist. Dr. Osborn is himself one of the author- 
ities in the science of Evolution, to which he 
has made important contributions. He is there- 
fore in a position to estimate the value of sci- 
entific theories more justly than would be pos- 
sible to one who approached the subject from 
the standpoint of metaphysics or that of litera- 
ture. 

Dr. Osborn has endeavored to make clear the 
fact of the continuity of thought in Evolution : 

" Evolution has reached its present fulness by slow 
additions during twenty-four centuries. When the 
truths and absurdities of Greek mediseval and sixteenth 
to nineteenth century speculation and observation are 
brought together, it becomes clear that they form a con- 
tinuous whole, that the influences of early upon later 
thought are greater than has been believed, that Darwin 
owes more even to the Greeks than we have ever rec- 
ognized. . . . The Evolution law was reached, not by 
any decided leap, but by the progressive development 
of every subordinate idea connected with it until it was 
recognized as a whole by Lamarck and later by Darwin." 

The study of the work of these various 
thinkers as contained in this book suggests to 
us, however, that the year 1858, before which 
" speculation far outran fact," does mark a 
very decided " leap " in the history of Evolu- 
tion as a science. The " leap " was not that 
of a change in thought or in theory, but in 
method of work. The pre-Darwinian writers, 
for the most part, had been engaged with the 
theory of Evolution and with its factors as 
determined by the methods of philosophy. The 
facts of nature served them as illustrations of 
their theories, not as the basis from which their 
theories must of necessity arise. Darwin de- 
termined to " collect blindly every sort of fact 
which could bear in any way " on what are 
species. On the collection of such facts, in 
this spirit, by the great biologist of our century 
and by his successors, the fabric of Evolution 
as we know it to-day must rest. The process

velopment of the Evolution Idea. By Henry Fairfield Osborn,

of philosophical deduction has contributed little 
to its progress. Given the facts as we know 
them now, or even as given us by Darwin alone, 
and our chief conclusions could be reached by 
an automatic logic machine, if such a contriv- 
ance could be devised. The main inductions 
are plain, and the unsolved problems still re- 
maining can be solved only by a return to the 
same methods. 

It is certainly true, I think, that all the known 
factors in organic Evolution were known to the 
ancients, and. the reality of each individual one 
of them has been insisted upon by many differ- 
ent writers before Darwin. Their relative im- 
portance and their interrelations were less fre- 
quently recognized. It is true, also, that the 
fact of derivation itself has never been wholly 
absent from philosophic thought. But the fol- 
lowing considerations seem to mark a break 
in continuity as a result of Darwin's method : 

(1) The doctrine of Special Creation was never 
so strongly intrenched, either in the popular 
mind or in scientific literature, as in 1858, in 
spite of the onslaughts of all the earlier evolu- 
tionists. The minor errors of fact in the illus- 
trations chosen by Lamarck and his successors 
counted for more than the truth in their phil- 
osophic speculations. The errors were tangi- 
ble, the truths were not. In the aggregate no 
progress had been made toward the reception 
of these truths. But the doctrine of Special 
Creation crumbled with the advent of the Ori- 
gin of Species. This was not due to the weight 
of Darwin's authority, nor to the boldness of 
his speculations. It was due to the soundness 
of his method. He appears as the interpreter 
of nature ; and the naturalists who followed 
him became " Darwinians " because their own 
studies led them to the same results. No other 
conclusions were possible to them. At the same 
time, no one could forecast the conclusions of 
one who should follow the u method " of Eras- 
mus Darwin, or of Buffon, or of Lamarck, 
or of any other writer whose study of details 
served to illustrate a philosophical conception. 

(2) Had Darwin's studies resulted otherwise, 
had his collection of facts led us to wholly dif- 
ferent conclusions, whatever these were, we 
should still be able to show the continuity of 
speculation. In any case, Darwin's indebted- 
ness to his predecessors would be exactly what 
it is now. 

In other words, there is probably no philo- 
sophical conception of the operations of life, 
whether true or false, that has not been held 
by someone. Every conceivable theory has been

thought out. It is the business of science to 
test these theories by the slow but certain 
method of induction, to collect, " more or less 
blindly, every sort of fact," and to follow whith- 
ersoever these facts lead.

THE PROBLEM OF THE UNEMPLOYED.* 



Mr. Geoffrey Drage, the able secretary of the 
recent Royal Commission on Labor in England, 
has written a suggestive book upon the unem- 
ployed. His facts are those secured by the 
Royal Commission largely through his own 
efforts, and by the Board of Trade of England. 
The book is the best summary of what had been 
done in Europe to help the unemployed prior 
to the summer of 1893. The results of the 
very interesting municipal experiments to re- 
lieve the unemployed by work in the winter of 
1893-4 were not published in time for Mr. 
Drage's use. The writer well divides the prob- 
lem into the removal of the causes of the un- 
employed and into relief for the unemployed 
who are present with us. In the matter of pre- 
vention, he suggests moral, intellectual, and 
technical education, better sanitation, factory 
legislation, the building, by municipalities and 
private benevolence, of model tenement homes, 
and some check, if possible, upon the rush of 
country people to displace the workers in the 
city. These remedies would deal with the pre- 
vention of a permanent surplus, he thinks, pro- 
viding the contaminating influence of the exist- 
ing stock of unemployed could be eliminated 
by the relief measures which are further re- 
ferred to. 

As for the temporarily unemployed, our au- 
thor holds that much of this evil is inevitably 
caused by the dependence of industry upon the 
supply of materials from abroad ; by the state 
of the weather; by the uncertainty of foreign in- 
vestments, and lack of confidence in them. He 
suggests that certain of these causes are remov- 
able, for example, (1) capricious changes of 
fashion, for which the public must realize they 
are responsible ; (2) fluctuations in demand, 
due to changes in seasons, a matter for which 
employers and the public must realize their re- 
sponsibility, and give their orders more in ad- 
vance ; (3) excessive and immoral speculation, 
leading to loss of commercial confidence, a 
matter in which he again invokes public opin-

ion, holding employers to moral responsibility, 
but also urges a revision of the laws relative to 
trade speculation, adulteration, and fraudulent 
bankruptcy ; (4) inability to forecast fluctua- 
tions of trade, a partial remedy for which is 
reliable government trade statistics ; (5) trade 
disputes, demoralizing industry, his remedy 
being more of conciliation and arbitration ; (6) 
immobility of labor, his remedy being the 
development of trade-union and voluntary em- 
ployment bureaus, nationally and locally con- 
ducted without an eye for profit. But the 
remedy urged by the socialist for disorganized 
labor, he dismisses as not immediately prac- 
ticable. 

As regards the relief measures for the pres- 
ent unemployed, our author thinks we must 
divide the problem into relief for the perma- 
nently and for the temporarily unemployed. 
For the former, he suggests a rigid execution 
of the English poor-law and the use of chari- 
table and religious agencies. Labor colonies, 
he thinks, have been shown in Germany to be 
of little value for the mass of workers, but they 
are most useful for discovering those who are 
reclaimable among the permanently and chron- 
ically unemployed. Mr. Drage would have the 
labor colony located in country districts to 
which. the permanently unemployed might be 
sent. If, after awhile, they do not earn their 
maintenance, they should be handed over to 
the harsher treatment of other agencies. It is 
in the treatment of the temporarily unemployed 
that Mr. Drage has written most at length. 
He believes in voluntary relief works, main- 
tained locally, but national in application, and 
conducted in harmony with a central voluntary 
office or bureau, to prevent a rush of the un- 
employed to the districts where relief work is 
given. Employment bureaus should be both 
local and central, and voluntary, not state. The 
men given work should earn the wages paid, 
but should work but half time, in order to have 
time on their hands to seek permanent situa- 
tions, and in order to prevent sufficient earn- 
ings to draw a man from regular industry. In 
case the unemployed are concentrated in a few 
places and there is work in other places, they 
are to be forced to remove to where the central 
employment bureau showed that there was 
work, on penalty, Mr. Drage probably means, 
of losing all relief. Only in times of excep- 
tional distress does Mr. Drage believe in local 
public relief works, because he greatly fears 
that such relief will foster the idea that the 
State ought to find work for its citizens, and

because public authorities cannot so easily in- 
vestigate the character of applicants as can pri- 
vate agencies for their relief. Despite these 
weaknesses of public relief work, it seems sure 
to grow, and to be necessary where private re- 
lief work proves insufficient. Amid growing 
democracy and socialistic feeling among the 
masses, private charitable agencies cannot con- 
trol the field unless they seek the cooperation 
on their committees of labor leaders. Even 
then, public relief work will make much pro- 
gress. 

In considering Mr. Drage's suggestions, we 
must judge them with reference to what is im- 
mediately practicable, since the suggestion of 
such remedies is all he means to give. Looked 
at in that light, his book has great suggestive- 
ness and value ; though as a keen study of the 
permanent causes of the unemployed, it is not 
equal, by any means, to certain chapters in 
Hobson's " Evolution of Modern Capitalism," 
and some other economic discussions. This 
book of Mr. Drage should be read in connec- 
tion with the clear and concise article in the 
July " Annals of the American Academy " on 
" Charity and the Unemployed," by J. G. 
Brooks. E. W. BEMIS.

How important a part the short story plays in

also by the increasing number of volumes into 
which the better of these stories are thought worthy 
of collection. We fancy that the symptom is not 
unrelated to the tendency which, in our newspapers, 
is condensing editorials into paragraphs, and which, 
in our popular entertainments, is substituting " acts " 
and " features " for presentations of sustained and 
coherent art. We do not object to the short story 
per se, but it is possible that we have something too 
much of it, even allowing for all the refinements 
and the subtleties that so many writers are lending 
it nowadays. The last few weeks' output of fiction, 
for example, includes no less than a dozen collec- 
tions containing, in all, close upon one hundred 
stories of such merit, or signed with such names, 
that they cannot pass unnoticed, besides many oth- 
ers that we have not space to discuss. 

One of the latest of these collections presents our 
recent visitor and old friend, Dr. A. Conan Doyle, 
in a new light. The title, " Round the Red Lamp," 
covers a multitude, numbering no less than fifteen, 
of stories and sketches based upon, or suggested 
by, the author's professional experience as a medi- 
cine man. There is a great deal of " shop " in this 
volume, and a zest not altogether pleasant is given 
by the grewsome incidents with which the tales are 
provided ; but the most difficult situations are car- 
ried off with the literary cleverness that makes of 
the Sherlock Holmes series so much more than a 
string of mere detective stories, and invests seem- 
ingly unpromising material with fascination, grim 
though it may be in the present instance. This 
sort of thing is not, any more than the detective 
series already mentioned, representative of Dr. 
Doyle's real powers, and, skilful as it is, we cannot 
help grudging the time thus spent by the author of 
such noble historical fiction as " Micah Clarke " 
and " The White Company." 

Some three or four years ago, the readers of 
" The Fortnightly Review " were regaled with a 
peculiarly nauseating compound of piety and im- 
morality in the shape of "A Modern Idyll," a story 
by Mr. Frank Harris, the editor of the " Review." 
It introduced to us a Baptist clergyman of Kan- 
sas City, in love with the wife of one of the deacons 
of his church, the affection not unrequited. Other 
delineations of American society in the far West 
appeared in later issues of the " Review," and the 
astonishment of its readers was not permitted to 
subside. Presently the " Revue des Deux Mondes," 
always on the watch for queer American things, 
translated one of these stories, " Elder Conklin " 
by name ; and the sapient Frenchman, as he read 
of the extraordinary doings of " Conklin 1'Ancien," 
doubtless opened his eyes very wide, and said to 
himself: "This is surely the real thing; now we 
see ces Americains as they actually are." There 
are six of the stories in all, and they form a volume 
to which " Elder Conklin " gives his name. As tran- 
scripts of American life, even in Kansas and other 
remote localities, they are grotesquely inadequate,

THE DIAL

and their very crudity is doubtless what recom- 
mends them to the foreigner unacquainted with our 
civilization. Many an Englishman, we fancy, will 
take them very seriously as seriously, for example, 
as he took Mr. Howe's " Story of a Country Town" 
a few years ago. To us, who can make the neces- 
sary allowances and supply the missing links, they 
are merely amusing ; but it is not to be denied that 
they are that, in a marked degree. 

It is instructive to compare these stories with 
Mr. Bret Harte's masterly treatment of similar ma- 
terial, and opportunity for the comparison is just 
now afforded by the eight stories which " The Bell- 
Ringer of Angel's " leads off. In place of the 
baldness of Mr. Harris's superficial delineations, we 
have equally dramatic incidents, interpenetrated 
with humor, and set against a richly romantic back- 
ground. Will Mr. Harte never exhaust his imag- 
inative resources? A few years of early manhood 
spent in contact with the civilizations of the West 
the new civilization of the American pioneer and 
the old mellow civilization of the Spaniard and 
behold, a supply of incident available for a lifetime 
of production. Besides the novels of more ambi- 
tious scope, Mr. Harte must have penned something 
like two hundred sketches and stories of Western 
character, and there is hardly a trace of weariness 
in the newest of the collections. The present vol- 
ume is, however, diversified by some Scotch consu- 
lar experiences, by the fascinating " Johnnyboy," 
which simply cannot be described, and by a humor- 
ous reminiscence entitled "My First Book." The 
book in question was an anthology of California 
poets, and the humor is in the depiction of the 
"woolly" journalism of the Coast. 

Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, the unreconstructed, 
displays his usual strength, penetration, and feeling 
in " The Burial of the Guns," which, with five other 
numbers, makes up his latest volume. They are 
studies of character rather than stories, and breathe 
the warmest devotion to the State and the Cause 
already so many times celebrated by the author. 
Whatever one's attitude towards the Southern Con- 
federacy, he can hardly fail to be moved by the 
purely human quality of these sketches, some of 
which do not even touch upon the debatable ground, 
and all of which are written straight from the 
heart. The story of "Little Darby," in particular, 
is one of those tales of unrequited humble heroism 
that are irresistible in their appeal to the sympa- 
thies. As for " My Cousin Fanny," with its soupqon 
of irony, and its gentle humor, it is a delineation 
masterly in every stroke. 

The good work of observing and recording the 
evanescent phases of local civilization upon this vast 
American continent goes steadily on. The army 
of workers is a large one, and the future student 
of our shifting life will find few nooks and corners 
of the land that have not had their artist. If noth- 
ing more can be said of the majority of these work- 
ers than that they are painstaking and truthful, it 



will be enough to entitle them to the thanks of 
those who come after. Miss Anna Fuller's thir- 
teen transcripts from a Colorado sketch-book, col- 
lectively named " Peak and Prairie," are certainly 
both truthfully and carefully wrought. They reflect 
the stir, the freshness, and even the crudity of the 
pioneer region with which they deal. Hardly elab- 
orate enough to deserve the name of stories, they 
are, within their limits, singularly engaging, and 
their interest, although quiet, is none the less gen- 
uine. 

A more romantic background than the mining 
camps of Colorado can supply relieves the eleven 
stories for they are stories, this time told by 
Mrs. Atherton, of Old California in the days " Be- 
fore the Gringo Came." The stories more than 
verge upon the melodramatic, and their passion 
seems a little too theatrical to be justified even by 
the hot-blooded race of which they are told. Nor 
is the language any more restrained than the senti- 
ment. Those which deal with the actual arrival of 
the " gringo " are the best, and we get from them 
some vivid glimpses of the fascinating history of 
the place and period concerned. 

The four somewhat inconclusive tales or sketches 
that make up " Marsena and Other Stories of the 
Wartime " are by no means to be reckoned with 
Mr. Frederic's best work, but they contribute an 
acceptable mite to our knowledge of what men 
were thinking and doing in the rural districts dur- 
ing the four years of our great civil convulsion. 
Most of us who were boys at that time have suffi- 
ciently vivid recollections of the period to enter 
with close sympathy into the feeling of these homely 
episodes, typical as they are of what was going on 
in thousands of other Northern hamlets. It is well 
that even boyish impressions of the period should 
be fixed before time has faded or effaced them, and 
Mr. Frederic here, as well as elsewhere, has done 
his full share of the work. 

The special field of Mrs. Catherwood's labors lies 
far back of the reach of recollection, but she is one 
of the few writers who can really project them- 
selves into the remote past, and whose sympathies 
can find in the mustiest of records the palpitating 
life that most of us can find only in the memory of 
what we have personally known. To praise her 
new volume of seven stories, headed by "The Chase 
of Saint-Castin," is but to repeat what we have said 
upon many earlier occasions, for the touch is still 
delicate and firm, the charm unfailing. The Illi- 
nois country is the field of two of these tales ; the 
others lie about the St. Lawrence, one of them 
" Wolfe's Cove " casting a side light upon the 
momentous scene upon the Heights of Abraham 
that fixed the destinies of two nations. 

In the excellent company of Mr. Henry James 
and Mr. Brander Matthews, and in the tasteful 
form of the series known as " Harper's American 
Story Tellers," there come to us two volumes 
fathered (or mothered) respectively by Mr. John 



334 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



Kendrick Bangs and Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spof- 
ford. Mrs. Spofford's book, "A Scarlet Poppy and 
Other Stories," comes as a reminder -that the 
younger generation is not yet to be permitted a 
monopoly of story-telling, and, indeed, as an exam- 
ple of work so artfully conceived that most of the 
younger generation would do well to profit by its 
example. These seven tales, with their shrewd and 
gentle humor, their unquestionable hold upon hu- 
man life, and their touches of the fantastic, make 
us regret that we hear so little of late from the 
Merrimac island-home of their writer. They do 
new honor even to Mrs. Spofford's already honor- 
able place in our literature, and may be read with 
unalloyed satisfaction from the first page to the 
last. 

If there is a touch of fantasy in Mrs. Spofford's 
volume, there is hardly anything but the fantastic 
in "The Water Ghost and Others." In these 
eight stories by Mr. Bangs, the freakish humor 
known to readers of "Mr. Toppleton's Client " dis- 
ports itself unchecked. The old ghost story took 
the supernatural too seriously ; the new, as exem- 
plified by Mr. Stockton and the present writer, 
makes it chiefly a .vehicle for fun, and we may add 
that the new is a great improvement upon the old. 
Anything more delicious in their way than " The 
Ghost Club " and " The Spectre Cook of Bangle- 
top " is not often met with. So delightful a com- 
mingling of the prosaic with the weird as the story 
of the " Psychical Prank," which filled a New York 
street-car with astral bodies, or the tale of the too 
material spoons which the ghostly King Ferdinand 
presented to the too-confiding nephew of a conser- 
vative uncle, deserves more than passing mention. 
To imagine such things at all is a gift ; to set them 
forth with their present verisimilitude is an art in 
its kind almost incomparable. 

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin is indefatigable in trans- 
lating into English the works of Henryk Sienkie- 
wicz. Just now he offers us a volume of relatively 
trifling worth, containing four stories or sketches. 
They will not lack an audience, for the name of 
their author claims attention for anything he may 
have written ; but they hardly suggest the genius 
that conceived the great Polish trilogy of love and 
war, or even the keen analyst to whom we owe 
"Without Dogma." Only one of the sketches is 
Polish in subject ; another describes a Spanish 
bull-fight ; the remaining two " Lillian Morris " 
and " Sachem " are fruits of the author's sojourn 
in the regions of our own pioneer civilization. In 
dealing with American themes, the author is not 
quite dans son assiette, and his descriptions are not 
altogether in touch with American feeling. Still, 
there is a certain impressiveness, particularly in the 
longest story of all, which tells of a band of forty- 
niners who took the overland route to the Califor- 
nian El Dorado, and endured grim hardships in 
their quest. It is curious to find the Chicago of 
1849 described as a " poor, obscure fishing village, 



not found on maps." This is one of many trifles 
which go to show that the author does not know 
his subject as well as, say, seventeenth -century 
Polish history. 

The collection of translated stories just mentioned 
may be coupled with the volume of " Tales from 
the JEgean," by Demetrios Bike'las, which the Mar- 
quis de Queux de St. Hilaire translated from Greek 
into French, and which have been turned from 
French into English by Mr. Opdycke. These facts, 
and many others of interest concerning the author 
of the tales, may be gleaned from the interesting 
introduction written for this translation by Major 
H. A. Huntington. As for the author, he is already 
known to English readers by a translation of " Lou- 
kis Laras," his tale of a modern Greek merchant, 
who started in life as a shop-keeper, and who re- 
mained a shop-keeper at heart through all the stir- 
ring times of the Revolution. His literary activity 
has also been marked in several other directions, 
and he has a distinct claim upon our English grat- 
itude as the Greek translator of six of the plays of 
Shakespeare. This translation is into colloquial 
Greek, and the iambic metre of fifteen syllables is 
employed. As Major Huntington puts it, he has 
" lent to the strongest and sweetest voice in the 
English choir almost the accents of JEschylus." 
This were a feat indeed, but doubts as to the pos- 
sibility of its accomplishment need not lessen our 
thankfulness to the man who has attempted it. 
Certainly, the reader of the eight tales now pub- 
lished will be prepared to share in any moderate 
enthusiasm for their writer. " Simple in motive, 
pure in sentiment, sometimes enlivened with humor, 
but oftener pervaded with ideal melancholy," they 
come to us as a joyful surprise, and invite compari- 
son with the great masters. Particularly do they 
suggest Tourgue'nieff, whose method and whose re- 
straint they exhibit in a remarkable degree. We 
should be much surprised to learn that the author 
had not carefully studied, and been profoundly in- 
fluenced by, the work of the great Russian. Hun- 
dreds of little touches reveal the spiritual kinship of 
the two men, although the deep tragic note seldom 
missing in the analyst of the steppe becomes muted 
in the pages of our .ZEgean analyst. 

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



MR. WALTER BESANT has this to say of the workings 
of our Copyright Act: "It is impossible to escape the 
conclusion that the Copyright Act has given a great im- 
petus to American work. While English work could he 
had for nothing, the American author in every branch was 
fatally overweighted. This obstacle removed, we begin 
to see what we expected the great bulk of the literature 
of the States written by their own people, and only the 
exceptionally useful and popular authors of this country 
being published there. This proportion we may expect 
to find every year greater in favor of American writers. 
At the same time there will be found on both sides of 
the Atlantic a great and always increasing demand for 
the work of the first and best."

THE DIAL

HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 

i. 

Pursuant to our custom, the Holiday Publications 
received for review by THE DIAL will be noticed 
in two instalments the earlier arrivals in the pres- 
ent issue, the later ones in that of December 16. 
Priority of mention does not necessarily imply pri- 
ority of importance, some of the more notable of 
the season's books often being late in making their 
appearance. The output of the season promises to 
be a fairly good one surprisingly good, in fact, 
when one considers the uninspiring commercial con- 
ditions that prevailed six months or more ago, when 
the works that are now appearing were being 
planned. The publishers have wisely pursued a 
somewhat conservative course in their holiday un- 
dertakings. There is a lack of the gorgeous quarto 
and folio volumes, representing enormous outlays 
to the publisher and costing the purchaser from fif- 
teen to fifty dollars, which have been so marked a 
feature of former years ; and in place of these we 
have the modest but attractive reprints of standard 
works, which are always unexceptionable for the 
purposes of holiday gifts. A book costing more than 
ten dollars excepting works in sets is, indeed, 
something of a rarity this season. A few ambitious 
and costly volumes have appeared, and there are 
other less expensive works representing the best ef- 
forts of our artists and publishers, and presenting 
to us some old favorite or newly-found friend decked 
in winning and irresistible charms. Among them 
all, those tastes and wishes must be hard to suit 
which do not find their due account. 

Our list may be suitably headed with a sumptu- 
ous four-volume edition, limited to 1000 copies and 
re-edited by Mr. G. F. Russell Barker, of Horace 
Walpole's " Memoirs of the Reign of George III." 
(Putnam). In the material features of these beau- 
tiful volumes the most captious will find little to 
cavil at. With their moderate-sized yet clear type, 
elegant hand-made paper, fair margins, and sub- 
stantial covers of crimson buckram stamped in gold 
with the Walpole arms, they present an ensemble 
which the finical owner of the Strawberry Hill Press 
might himself have approved of. Like almost every- 
thing Walpole wrote, the Memoirs are immensely 
readable. They cover a period of great political 
importance ; and while their life and piquancy are 
patent, their serious historical value is sometimes 
lost sight of. They belong to the good old-fashioried 
type of history which aims to be a narrative, and 
little else; and history, as M. Scherer says, "is first 
of all a narrative." If Walpole is seldom deep, 
he is never dull ; if he is seldom weighty, he is 
never pedantic. He had to a rare degree the gift 
of making his dramatis personce live and act out 
their parts before us. They are people of flesh and 
blood not the mere names or abstract arithmet- 
ical units of more philosophical historians. Says 
Mr. Leslie Stephen : " Turn over any of the proper 
decorous history books, mark every passage, where 



for a moment we seem to be transported to the 
past to the thunders of Chatham, the drivellings 
of Newcastle, or the prosings of George Grenville, 
as they sounded in contemporary ears and it will 
be safe to say that, on counting them up, a good 
half will turn out to be the reflections from the 
illuminating flashes of Walpole." Gossipping Hor- 
ace will live long after many a more pretentious 
historian has been relegated to the dust-bin ; and 
the present holiday edition of his best historical 
work will doubtless continue for some time to be a 
model one. 

The term " holiday gift-book " is necessarily a 
somewhat elastic one, and can by no means be lim- 
ited to the elegant specialties that are designed pri- 
marily for Christmas sales. Any good book is of 
course a suitable gift-book, especially when embel- 
lished with attractive illustrations and clad in hand- 
some dress. Foremost among the season's elegant 
editions of standard books is the Lippincott Co.'s 
reprint of Thiers's great historical works, " History 
of the Consulate and the Empire of France under 
Napoleon " and " History of the French Revolu- 
tion," the former in twelve volumes and the latter 
in five, uniform in typography and binding, and in 
illustrations from steel plates. The sets are sold 
separately. Of the works themselves it is of course 
not necessary to speak; they are among the most 
standard of historical works, and indispensable for 
the field they cover. The translations are the au- 
thentic ones of Campbell and Stebbing for the 
" Consulate" and of Frederick Shoberl for the "Rev- 
olution." The works are printed from new type, 
and purchasers of the more substantial sort of gift- 
books will thank the enterprise of Messrs. Lippin- 
cott for providing these really sumptuous editions. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. issue a new and en- 
larged edition of Mr. Joseph PennelPs standard 
treatise on " Pen Drawing and Pen Draughtsmen," 
a study of the art as practiced to-day, with techni- 
cal suggestions. There are over four hundred illus- 
trations from originals by Sir F. Leighton, Messrs. 
J. E. Millais, F. Burne Jones, Abbey, Holman 
Hunt, A. Parsons, Aubrey Beardsley, and many 
others, the value of which to the art-student can 
scarcely be over-estimated. Mr. Pennell's book, at 
the date of its first appearance in 1889, met with 
the cordial and general approval of those best qual- 
ified to judge of it; and it is safe to pronounce it 
hors concours in its class. As an art-work of actual 
and solid value, nothing on our list surpasses it 

Mrs. Oliphant's recent articles in " The Century 
Magazine " on " The Reign of Queen Anne " have, 
very fittingly, been formed into a fine gift-book 
one of the best of the season by the Century Co. 
The theme is perennially attractive, and Mrs. Oli- 
phant treats it with her usual freshness and anima- 
tion. The characters of the Churchills, Harley, 
Godolphin, St. John, Swift, Berkeley, Defoe, Addi- 
son, Steele, and other more or less brilliant satel- 
lites of that comparatively rayless primary the stupid

and all too trusting Anne, are admirably drawn. 
For the Queen herself " the church's wet-nurse, 
Goody Anne," as flippant Walpole styled her Mrs. 
Oliphant has some words of judicious kindness. 
Anne has been roundly snubbed and laughed at by 
everybody, from Macaulay down ; but the fact re- 
mains that she was one of the few sovereigns who 
may without hyperbole be said to have been loved 
in her day. She was a good wife, a good woman, 
a good friend, and what was then politically very 
much to the purpose a good Protestant. Mrs. 
Oliphant's book is pleasant reading, and it makes a 
goodly show outwardly, with its fine print and pa- 
per, its richly tooled binding, and its thirty-three 
sound wood-engravings. Among the latter are por- 
traits of Anne, John Evelyn, Defoe, William III., 
the Marlboroughs, Burnett, Swift, " Stella," and 
Addison. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.'s dainty holiday 
edition, with illustrations by Messrs. George Whar- 
ton Edwards and F. Hopkinson Smith, of Dr. 
Holmes's "The Last Leaf" appears with a melan- 
choly opportuneness. In the touching letter, dated 
July 12, 1894, prefixed in facsimile to the volume, 
Dr. Holmes says : " I am one of the very last of the 
leaves which still cling to the bough of life that 
budded in the Spring of the nineteenth century"; 
and now this leaf too has fluttered to earth, and the 
bough is indeed forsaken. Walt Whitman draws 
somewhere a fine and just distinction between " lov- 
ing by allowance ' ' and " loving with a personal love ' ' ; 
and in the limited class of authors whom we love 
as we do Lamb and Goldsmith with " a personal 
love," and not, as it were, by convention, the cheery 
Autocrat surely takes his place. The little book 
forms a timely and charming souvenir of its author. 
The poem is printed entire on the opening pages ; 
after which follow separate lines and stanzas, with 
decorative designs and illustrations interspersed. A 
history of the poem, written by Dr. Holmes in 1885, 
is appended. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s inexpensive two- 
volume edition of " The Count of Monte Cristo " 
brings a neat, well-printed, fairly-bound copy of 
Dumas's kaleidoscopic romance within range of all 
purses. There are eighteen illustrations by Mr. 
Frank T. Merrill, and commendable pains have 
been taken to secure a good text, ordinary English 
versions of the story having been tinkered into 
shape from some strange original that must itself 
have been bad enough in all conscience. Omissions 
have been supplied, additions expunged, solecisms 
corrected, nautical terms " exported," and, in short, 
the English "Monte Cristo" has been, to quote Sid- 
ney Smith, metaphorically washed, shaved, brushed, 
and forced into clean linen, by the present editors. 
The publishers are to be credited with more than 
one praiseworthy deed in the way of making good 
editions of good books popularly accessible. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons' luxurious " Van 
Tassell " edition of Irving's "Sketch Book " is gen- 



erally similar in style to the " Agapida," the 
"Darro," and the "Van Twiller" editions of "The 
Conquest of Granada," " The Alhambra," and the 
" Knickerbocker's History of New York," respect- 
ively, of former seasons. To our thinking the lat- 
est publication is even more attractive than its pre- 
decessors. The border designs this time are dainty 
festoons of leaves and berries, etc.; and there are 
thirty-two illustrations by Messrs. Church, Barraud, 
Rackham, Rix, and Van Deusen. The " Van Tas- 
sell " edition should prove one of the marked suc- 
cesses of the season. 

Little need be said in characterization of form 
or matter of Messrs. Harper & Brothers' superb 
two volume edition of Charles Kingsley's " Hypa- 
tia." The work is generally uniform with the same 
firm's well-known editions of "Ben Hur" and "The 
Cloister and the Hearth" bindings of sea-green 
silk, lightly glazed paper, dainty typography, and 
a profusion of full-page and marginal drawings by 
Mr. William Martin Johnson. Kingsley's master- 
piece ranks with the classics of fiction ; and it is, 
to our taste, worthier of its present sumptuous set- 
ting than either of its popular predecessors assur- 
edly than the earlier of them. As an example of 
an art work resulting from the union of ripe learn- 
ing and forceful imagination, "Hypatia" has few 
rivals in its class in any language. Mr. Johnson's 
drawings are for the most part well done, and form 
a running pictorial exposition of the text at once 
ornamental and instructive. 

A very taking and desirable edition, in two trim 
volumes, illustrated with fifty small drawings and 
eight full-page photogravures by Mr. Edmund H. 
Garrett, of Dickens's " A Tale of Two Cities," is 
issued by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. Like Thack- 
eray's " Esmond," this novel is, when viewed with 
the body of its author's works, something of a book 
apart ; and the publishers have done well in select- 
ing it for a special reprint. Good critics have pro- 
nounced it the author's greatest novel ; and, consid- 
ered as a piece of pure constructive art, it probably 
is so. If he nowhere in it quite touches his highest 
level, there is certainly no other work of his in 
which the level reached is so well sustained. In 
his more characteristic books, Dickens sinks all too 
often into a bizarrerie of style, and a commonness, 
even a mawkishness, of sentiment, that offend his 
discriminating admirers. But in "A Tale of Two 
Cities " his taste seldom lapses, his inspiration sel- 
dom flags. " There is," says Forster, " no other in- 
stance in his novels of a deliberate and planned 
departure from the method of treatment which had 
been preeminently the source of his popularity." 
The present edition is handy, sightly, and, style con- 
sidered, inexpensive. 

The true stories of " Three Heroines of New En- 
gland Romance," Priscilla Mullins, Agnes Surriage, 
and Martha Hilton, are gracefully set forth by Mrs. 
Harriet Prescott Spofford, Miss Alice Brown, and 
Miss Louise Imogen Guiney, in a tasteful volume 



1894.]

profusely illustrated by Mr. E. H. Garrett, and pub- 
lished by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. Priscilla is, 
of course, modest John Alden's Priscilla ; Martha 
Hilton (afterwards Lady Wentworth) figures in his- 
tory and in Longfellow's pretty ballad ; while Ag- 
nes Surriage was a Marblehead lass, who, after 
an unusually stormy experience of the proverbial 
" course of true love," married the man of her heart, 
and, as Lady Agnes Frankland, '' lived happy ever 
after," as the story-books say, and as she certainly 
deserved to do. The subjects have furnished am- 
ple opportunity for the illustrator's best work, and 
Mr. Garrett has on the whole acquitted himself 
creditably. 

Mr. G. S. Layard's "Tennyson and his Pre- 
Raphaelite Illustrators" (Copeland & Day) is a 
book about a book, or, better, about the illustrators 
of a book that is, of the Tennyson quarto pub- 
lished by Moxon in 1857, and soon to be repub- 
lished by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. (And we may 
add, en passant, that we hope the latter firm will 
note Mr. Ruskfn's statement that the original wood- 
cuts were in a few cases " terribly spoiled in the 
cutting, and generally the best part, the expression 
of feature, entirely lost." These designs should cer- 
tainly be re-engraved.) In his appreciations of the 
quarto of 1857, " the most intrinsically valuable," 
he thinks, of all Tennysonian volumes, Mr. Layard 
devotes himself mainly to the work of the three 
more prominent pre-Raphaelites Rossetti, Millais, 
and Holman Hunt, to each of whom a separate 
chapter is given. There are a few interesting pages 
on the origin of the P. R. B.; and here the au- 
thor joins issue with Mr. Quilter, crediting the 
movement to Holman Hunt, rather than to Ros- 
setti's first master, the eccentric F. Madox Brown. 
Tennyson, who was as insensible to pictorial art as 
Shelley was to music, seems to have left his illus- 
trators to their own devices ; though in one or two 
cases he raised rather captious objections for in- 
stance, to Hunt's noble, if rather dishevelled, " Lady 
of Shalott." " My dear Hunt," he exclaimed, on 
first seeing this plate, " I never said the young wo- 
man's hair was flying all over the shop ! " "No," 
calmly replied the painter, " but you never said it 
wasn't " and, happily, the design stood. Mr. Lay- 
ard's book is interesting and critical in tone, and the 
nine illustrations (including two after water-color 
drawings by Mrs. Rossetti) are well chosen and well 
reproduced. 

Jane Austen illustrated by Hugh Thomson forms 
a combination that discerning book-buyers should 
find hard to resist. Messrs. Macmillan & Co.'s new 
edition of "Pride and Prejudice" offers these joint 
attractions ; and to round off the volume there is a 
capital introduction by Mr. George Saintsbury. 
Touching the friendly strife among Miss Austen's 
adherents as to the relative merits of her books, Mr. 
Saintsbury unhesitatingly awards the primacy to the 
present work. He finds it " the most perfect, the 
most characteristic, the most eminently quintessen- 



tial " of them all ; its hero is " by far the best and 
most interesting of Miss Austen's heroes "; while 
as to its heroine he concludes, after calmly weigh- 
ing the competing charms of her rivals in his affec- 
tions, that " to live with and to marry, I do not 
know that any one of the four can come into com- 
petition with Elizabeth." The volume is uniform 
in make-up with the same firm's well-known editions 
of " Cranford," " Our Village," etc. 

In her " Schools and Masters of Sculpture " (Ap- 
pleton), Miss A. G. Radcliffe essays to tell "clearly, 
vividly, and accurately " the story of the progress 
of plastic art from archaic times down to the pres- 
ent day a pretty difficult task in a moderate-sized 
12mo volume of 560 odd pages. The author con- 
fines herself closely to facts, and these have been 
carefully and judiciously winnowed. Successive 
schools of sculpture the Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek, 
Roman, Mediaeval, and Modern are shown by the 
flash-light of single chapters, and the personality of 
the great masters is briefly set before us. Miss 
Radcliffe has evidently " got up " the authorities 
carefully ; and her book, like its companion volume 
on painting, affords a useful and accurate birdseye 
view of the subject, and it should prove serviceable 
as a larger guide-book to European and American 
galleries and museums. There are thirty-five full- 
page plates in half-tone. 

Mr. Laurence Hutton's "Portraits in Plaster" 
(Harper) is a vastly interesting, attractively mount- 
ed work though not, to our thinking, one exactly 
suggestive of Christmas cheer. Mr. Hutton, as the 
readers of "Harper's Magazine" have been made 
aware, is the happy possessor of the largest and 
fullest collection of death-masks in the world ; and 
the present volume contains photographic repro- 
ductions of seventy-two of them. The earliest casts 
are those of Dante and Tasso ; the latest one is 
that of Edwin Booth. They range from Sir Isaac 
Newton, the wisest of men, to Sambo, the lowest 
type of the American negro ; from Cromwell to 
Clay ; from Bonaparte to Grant ; from Keats to 
Leopardi ; from Pius IX. to Tom Paine ; from 
Ben Gaunt, the pugilist, to Dr. Chalmers, the light 
of the Scotch pulpit. Marat, Robespierre, Burke, 
Washington, Tom Moore, Mme. Malibran, Swift, 
Brougham, Sherman, and other celebrities, stare 
stonily at us from Mr. Hutton's pages with an 
effect, as " Mr. Wegg " delicately said of the home 
of his friend, " Mr. Venus," " rather ghastly, all 
things considered." The nucleus of the collection 
was a half-dozen plaster casts found by a boy in a 
dust-bin. They came into Mr. Hutton's possession 
by chance, and from that time on he has been a 
collector, an amateur, of death-masks. Some would 
have chosen a more cheerful line of connoisseur- 
ship ; but, as Yorick says, "there's no disputing 
about hobby-horses." The tale of Mr. Hutton's 
researches in the museums, studios, plaster-shops, 
and curiosity shops of half the capitals of Europe 
and America would, he tells us, fill a fair volume ;

and he has traced and identified his trophies with 
much care. He is sure, for instance, that his is the 
actual death-mask of Aaron Burr, because he has 
the personal guarantee of the maker of the mould ; 
he is equally certain of another cast, because he 
saw it made himself ; while as to a third, he has no 
manner of doubt, because, he frankly admits, " I 
know the man who stole it." Mr. Button's book 
is unique, and it has a decided (albeit rather grew- 
some) fascination. The value of the masks as por- 
traits is beyond question, and the descriptive text 
is chatty and informing. 

It seems a pity that so exquisitely artistic a set- 
ting should be lavished on so nonsensical a produc- 
tion as Mr. Edward Garnett's " An Imaged World " 
(Dent & Co., London ) . What Mr. Garnett is really 
driving at in his " Poems in Prose," as he calls 
them, must, for the most part, remain a secret be- 
tween himself and his Maker ; but his illustrator, 
Mr. William Hyde, has wrestled manfully with the 
problem, and has produced some pretty, if pardon- 
ably vague, drawings that partly redeem the text. 
The "poems " consist largely of rhapsodic addresses 
to Nature, mingled with amatory caterwaulings ad- 
dressed to no one in particular, of which the follow- 
ing may serve as a sample : " Flower of my heart, 
would thou wert here on the hillside this dark eve 
of grey and windy autumn, and the dim greyish 
heavens and fleeing clouds were over our two heads. 
Girl, the sad wind is rising, O Girl, this night 
that is falling will bring desolation into the heart 
of the world. I would thou wert by my fireside 
this night; ah, Girl-flower" and so on for over a 
hundred pages. That a man should be willing to 
rush into print with this sort of thing in the age of 
Spencer, and Darwin, and Huxley, and common- 
sense generally, passes understanding. 

A neat illustrated edition of Mr. Howells's "Their 
Wedding Journey " the inimitable account of the 
bridal tour of a couple " no longer very young, but 
still fresh in the light of their love," in which the 
author takes occasion to " talk of some ordinary 
traits of American life ... to speak a little of 
well-known and easily accessible places, to present 
now a bit of landscape and now a sketch of char- 
acter," is issued by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co. The book is essentially a series of Ameri- 
can travel pictures and character sketches, thrown 
off with the author's usual photographic and phono- 
graphic accuracy, and it is one of his crispest and 
cleverest works. Mr. Clifford Carroll's drawings 
are acceptable, but hardly equal the snap and verve 
of the text. 

A second series of Mr. Austin Dobson's " Eight- 
eenth Century Vignettes," that will doubtless repeat 
the success of its popular predecessor of last year, 
is issued by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. There are 
twelve papers in all : " The Journal to Stella," 
" The Topography of ' Humphry Clinker,' " " Rich- 
ardson at Home," " Johnson's Library," " Rane- 
lagh," etc. themes in which Mr. Dobson is very 



much at home, and which he handles with his usual 
piquancy and lightness of touch. The portraits of 
Swift, Dodsley, Richardson, Garrick, Smollett, Rou- 
billiac, and others, are notably good, and the volume 
altogether is a choice piece of book-making. 

Mr. Mowbray Morris's compact edition of Bos- 
well's "Life of Johnson" is issued in a neat two- 
volume reprint by Messrs. Crowell & Co. The type 
is new, bright, and open, the paper is good, the 
thirty-four full-page portraits are well chosen and 
well executed, and the price (three dollars) is low 
enough, certainly, for a sound copy of one of the 
richest works in any language. In annotating his 
work, Mr. Morris did little more than to cull from 
his editorial predecessors, and he left Boswell's 
notes intact. The present American editor has 
added some judicjkms selections from Dr. Hill's 
notes, and he has wisely followed the latter's exam- 
ple in restoring the original spelling of Dr. John- 
son's and his friends' letters. The edition is, we 
should say, decidedly the best to be had for any- 
thing like the money. 

Another desirable reprint of standard literature 
from the press of Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. is an 
edition in two octavo volumes of " The Complete 
Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott." By printing 
the poems in double columns, compactness has been 
secured without unduly sacrificing size and clear- 
ness of type ; and the volumes, like other similar 
publications of this firm, challenge comparison with 
editions considerably more costly and pretentious. 
The text is carefully edited ; there is an admirable 
Introduction by Professor Charles Eliot Norton, 
and a Biographical Sketch by Nathan Haskell Dole. 
The frontispiece portrait of Sir Walter is one of 
the best plates of the kind that we remember to 
have seen. 

The charm of " Paul and Virginia " is perennial, 
and older readers who have experienced its delights, 
and desire their younger friends to share them in 
their turn, will welcome the new edition of the 
French classic issued by Messrs. Appleton & Co. 
The translation includes a brief memoir of Saint- 
Pierre, and the pretty but inexpensive volume is 
profusely illustrated with the drawings of Leloir. 

Cost considered, we know of no comelier and 
handier shelf edition of Irving's ever -charming 
" Sketch-Book " than the one now issued in two vol- 
umes by the J. B. Lippincott Co. The volumes 
throughout are models of quiet tastefulness and 
sound workmanship. They are printed from new 
type, and contain the familiar wood-cuts of the 
" Artists' Edition." 

The desiderata of good taste and inexpensiveness 
are happily blended in The Century Co.'s tiny book- 
lets, "Writing to Rosina," a novelette by Mr. W. 
H. Bishop, and "P'tit Matinic," a sheaf of thumb- 
nail sketches by Mr. George Wharton Edwards. 
Both volumes are prettily illustrated and daintily 
bound in embossed sheep, and either may be slipped 
into the waistcoat pocket.

BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 



I. 

This season's publication of books for young readers 
is not only unusually large, but on the whole may be 
said to be of rather unusual interest and value. Some 
of our best writers, alive to the importance of this field, 
are sharing in the production of books of information, 
useful but by no means dry; and in a few cases juveniles 
combining attractive narrative with a pure literary in- 
terest are offered. Even the fiction work with the ex- 
ception, possibly, of that of Jules Verne and a few of 
the more trivial books for girls, has, it would seem, to 
assume an air of seriousness in order to get itself into no- 
tice. While there is good fun and plenty of it among the 
season's publications for the young, such books as " The 
Story of Alexander," "Czar and Sultan," and "The 
Century Book for Young Americans " have a quality 
that makes for usefulness in any developing mind; and 
there is this year rather less than the usual amount of 
that " writing down " to young readers which does so 
much harm. There is, of course, no real necessity for 
lowering artistic standards in order to reach the com- 
prehension of children, as their uncorrupted taste is ca- 
pable of enjoying the best art, provided it be simple; 
and the recognition of this fact is improving the quality 
of children's books. The reproduction of the great 
works of the older writers, in suitable form for the chil- 
dren of to-day, is much to be commended. Why should 
not certain stories from Homer, following closely the 
Butcher and Lang translation, be edited and illustrated 
as superbly as is that narrative of old, " The Story of 
Alexander " ? And that tale of the middle ages, the 
friendship of Amis and Amile, to whose exquisite charm 
Mr. Pater calls attention, would also, edited for children, 
have great literary value, to say nothing of its ennobling 
power. The tenderest age is none too early to begin 
setting before the child the simpler elements of literary 
beauty. 

The unexplored charm of new books is enhanced by 
illustrations which stir the fancy and train the eye. 
Those pictures which do not really illustrate detract 
from rather than aid the printed page, for most children 
have plenty of imagination of their own, and the great 
value to them of illustration is in properly directing 
their imagination and familiarizing them with good 
models in art. Mr. Andrew Lang's annual " Fairy 
Book " (Longmans) has not always been so well illus- 
trated as it is this year by Mr. Ford, and even now a 
timid child might well be alarmed at the frightful 
witches who have smuggled themselves between the 
covers. In his preface, which is really only a familiar 
talk with his young readers, Mr. Lang pays his respects 
to Mr. Laurence Gomme, President of the Folk-Lore 
Society, who " does not think it very nice to publish 
fairy books, and above all, red, green, and blue fairy 
books." Though Mr. Lang takes the liberty of mis- 
quoting Mr. R. L. Stevenson, his quiet sarcasm redeems 
him. Anyone who reads his grave assurance that the 
existence of fairies is a difficult question, that Profes- 
sor Huxley thinks there are none, though the Reverend 
Mr. Baring-Gould saw several when he was a boy trav- 
elling with the Troubadours, and that " probably a good 
many stories not perfectly true have been told about 
fairies, but such stories have also been told about Napo- 
leon, Julius Caesar, and Joan of Arc, all of whom certainly 
existed," may feel he would rather hear Mr. Lang mis- 
quote than to hear other people recite volumes. " The 



Enchanted Swans," the source of Reineke's cantata, is 
in this " Yellow Fairy Book," and also a Chinese tale, 
rescued from oblivion, from which the expression " A 
little bird told me " probably took its origin. Though 
the tales are gathered from many lands, and from such 
accomplished writers as Andersen, Grimm, and Madame 
D'Aulnoy, none are more poetic or spiritual than those 
from the Red Indian, one from the Iroquois strongly 
suggesting, in its pathetic ending, the story of Orpheus 
and Eurydice. 

A new edition of " Tales from Hans Andersen " (Lip- 
pincott) is illustrated by Mr. E. A. Lemann, who has 
endeavored to embellish the tales more fitly than has 
been done before. This is, however, rather like paint- 
ing the lily ; since the chief interest remains in the tales 
themselves. Though Mr. Lemann has been moderately 
successful, the illustrations are on the whole common- 
place. 

Mr. Palmer Cox, inimitable as ever, has this year sent 
"The Brownies around the World" (Century Co.). 
Poor sprites ! They look dreadfully ill on their demo- 
cratic raft, but they learn the sage lesson that 
" You can't through foreign countries roam 

And have the comforts of a home." 

They scale the Alps, they ride the crocodile ; they mor- 
alize soberly on the follies of idol-worship while toying 
with the gold ear-ring of Buddha; but in the end they 
reach home safely, after having made the world their 
own. Adventures like these are sure to please the chil- 
dren. Mr. Cox, as usual, furnishes his own capital illus- 
trations. 

Though Mr. Lang believes the successful invention 
of new fairy stories is rare, two at least are brought out 
this season. They are quite different in style, however, 
one by the Countess of Jersey, entitled "Maurice, or 
the Red Jar" (Macmillan), having an air of reality 
which makes it fascinating. It contains the conven- 
tional ingredients of fairy tales an enchanted castle, 
nixies, old dames, and the spirits of earth, water, and 
fire. These are combined in so novel a manner that 
one hardly regrets the absence of a princess. The cen- 
tral idea that expiation through suffering is the only 
cure for disobedience is very well worked out. 

No serious purpose, only amusement pure and simple, 
is the object of Mr. Tudor Jenks, whose " World's Fair 
Book " was among the more interesting of last year's 
publications for boys and girls. " Imaginotions " (Cen- 
tury Co.) is likely to prove very popular, as it is a clever 
combination of wit and fancy, fact and fable. It would 
seem as though Mr. Jenks must have had a prelim- 
inary view of all the fairy books of the season, for he 
has burlesqued them all. " The Sequel," which is one 
of the best of the stories, describes the woes of the Hero 
after he marries the Princess, and tells how he lived 
unhappily ever after until he succeeded in throwing off 
the shackles of royalty. It is difficult to say which is 
funnier, " The Sequel " or the " Kaba ben Ephraf," the 
latter being a matter-of-fact individual who succeeds in 
life through a free use of the simple motto, " If you 
do n't see what you want, ask for it." The comical idea 
of the Professor, who is convinced by the scientific rea- 
soning of the Patagonian Giant that it is his duty to let 
himself be eaten by that eloquent monster, is carried 
out with a dash and humor which " Mark Twain " himself 
has scarcely excelled. The book is worthily illustrated 
by Messrs. Birch, Drake, Bensell, Dan Beard, and Oli- 
ver Herford. Some of the stories have previously ap- 
peared in " St. Nicholas."

[Dec. 1, 



" The Story of Alexander, Retold from the Originals 
by Robert Steele, Drawn by Fred Mason and Published 
by Macmillan and Co.," is the imposing title of what is 
probably the most marked departure from the conven- 
tional juvenile book of the present season. With pic- 
tures in black and white suggestive both of Mr. Elihu 
Vedder and Mr. Walter Crane, a rich and artistic bind- 
ing, and unexceptionable paper and print, the traditions 
that gathered round the figure of Alexander the Great 
have here received a truly noble setting. The tale is 
told with Homeric simplicity a tale of conquest and 
love, and of an unconquerable spirit. The bibliography 
of the story is of such interest that eight pages of the 
author's " Afterwords " do not suffice to tell all the 
forms it has undergone. Probably many of the tradi- 
tions grew up soon after the death of Alexander, and 
since that time it has received additions from many 
tongues in many ages. But young readers are advised 
not to annoy their teachers in Greek history by putting 
any of it into their examination papers and, indeed, 
such a course would be dangerous, since the book con- 
tains no dates. Perhaps its purpose is best told in these 
lines from the " Open Letter " which takes the place of 
a preface: "If it pleases you and shows you who were 
the heroes of our ancestors, and what were the stories 
they delighted in, it will have reached the object of 
your loving liegeman, R. S." The full-page illustra- 
tions, noble in design and execution, are worthy of se- 
rious study, and the head and tail pieces are rich in alle- 
gorical meaning. 

Mr. Frost's fortunate auditor in his " Wagner Story 
Book " (Scribner) is a little girl ; though these enno- 
bling tales, like all folk-lore, are no less suitable for 
boys. The author's style, in dealing with stories some- 
what involved, is clear, and while there is a certain awk- 
wardness in the use of the present tense throughout the 
book, another form would require the sacrifice of the 
conceit that the stories are being enacted in the burn- 
ing coals, an idea which gives life to the whole, and 
is always well sustained. A delicate fancy plays about 
the immortal German myths, and in the flames are seen 
Wotan and the river nymphs, Parsifal and Elsa, while 
the " Magic Fire Scene " glows again before the reader. 
The text is so picturesque that the illustrations might 
have been dispensed with, especially as their workman- 
ship is often indifferent. 

A curious contrast to the German myths, with their 
powerful human interest, is formed by the no less at- 
tractive Pueblo Indian folk stories written out for boys 
and girls by Mr. Charles F. Lummis in " The Man who 
Married the Moon " (Century Co.). Great friendliness 
has sprung up between Mr. Lummis and this interest- 
ing Indian tribe, about whom he knows and tells us 
much. Tales of craft abound, though the one which 
gives the book its title is full of poetry, and a keen 
sense of humor is everywhere apparent. The many 
predicaments of the coyote, in his domestic and social 
relations with other animals, are particularly laughable ; 
and the stories many of which are much older than 
the Spanish invasion of North America have also an 
ethnological interest. Altogether, the book, with its 
good drawings from photographs by the author, is full 
of charm both for young people and their elders. 

The adage " Too many cooks spoil the broth " is well 
illustrated in " Bible Stories for the Young " (Harper), 
where various scraps of scriptural meat are served up 
for young readers. Several well-known divines have 
assisted in the task, with the result that the flavor is by 



no means uniform. The stories of " David and Jona- 
than " and of " Mary in the Garden of Gethesemane " 
perhaps suffer less in the telling than the others; but 
the Rev. Mr. Parkhurst has wholly destroyed the sim- 
ple sweetness of the " Story of the Nativity." The 
Bible story of Isaac and Rebekah, too, gains nothing 
from its writer's suggestion that " Rebekah knew more 
than we are told about Isaac, when she said so readily 
' I will go,' and started right off." 

" The Century Book for Young Americans " (Century 
Co.) is issued under the auspices of the National So- 
ciety of the Sons of the American Revolution. The 
purpose of the book, its scope and thoroughness of treat- 
ment, entitle it to a prominent position among the more 
serious juvenile publications. Under the guidance of a 
well-informed and kindly-disposed uncle, a party of 
young people visit Washington, to study the workings 
of the Government. The conversation of the tourists 
introduces, without effort, the historical cause for the 
creation of the different governmental departments, and 
the functions of each. The book is enlivened by glimpses 
of the social life of the capital, and by excursions to 
Mount Vernon, Arlington, and other points of romantic 
interest. The comments of the young visitors should 
excite the patriotism of every youthful American. Ex- 
cellent portraits of men who have distinguished them- 
selves as statesmen, soldiers, and citizens, as well as 
charming pictures of Washington itself, embellish the 
work. It may be mentioned, in passing, that an un- 
mistakable picture of the Woman's Temple is entitled 
" One of Chicago's tall Buildings the Masonic Tem- 
ple "; an error which the author, Mr. Elbridge S. Brooks, 
should not have allowed to pass into print. 

Of books about foreign countries, " The Land of 
Pluck " (Century Co.), in its dress of " Dutch pink," is 
one of the most attractive. An idea of life in Holland, 
and of the determination and patience of that brave lit- 
tle country, is given with much picturesqueness, and 
with that simplicity of style which contributes so greatly 
to the success of its author, Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge, 
in writing for children. The text is ably supported by 
the pictures, which, in addition to several by Mr. George 
Wharton Edwards, number several reproductions of the 
old Dutch masters, chiefly pictures of children. The se- 
ries of Dutch sketches is an amplified form of an arti- 
cle which appeared in " St. Nicholas " some years ago ; 
but the short stories that make up the second part of 
the volume, though not entirely new, have never before 
been published in book form. They are very sweet and 
wholesome in tone, in every way suitable for children. 

" Czar and Sultan " (Scribner), a. large volume of 
several hundred pages, is written with that fondness 
for circumstantial detail and love of anecdote which so 
facile a war correspondent as Mr. Archibald Forbes 
would be apt to display. Though the author assumes 
the modest part of the young son of a Scotch grain mer- 
chant in Eastern Europe, it is plain that the book is 
largely one of personal reminiscences of the Russo- 
Turkish campaign. Mr. Forbes says as much in his 
preface, at the same time acknowledging his indebtedness 
to his colleagues, MacGahan and Mr. Frank Millett, as 
well as to other sources. Of Mr. Millet he says that his let- 
ters always read as if they had been written with a paint 
brush. In spite of his Russian sympathies, Mr. Forbes 
is not slow to recognize the brave spirit of Osman Pasha, 
as well as the splendid fighting powers of his subjects. 
A thrilling account of the dreadful suffering of the rem- 
nants of both armies after the fall of Plevna sufficiently

indicates that the Russians, if less inclined to butchery 
than their enemies, were yet capable of the passive cru- 
elty of neglect and an indifference to human distress of 
which it is difficult to conceive outside of barbarism. 
Just at this time the work is of especial interest, even 
beyond the circle of readers for whom it is intended, 
as the recent death of the Czar greatly enhances the 
value of anecdotes concerning him and Nicholas II. 
Clearly, as seen through Mr. Forbes's eyes, Alexander 
III. was a monarch who took very much to heart the 
anxieties of the campaign, while Nicholas displayed a 
moody coldness which won him no love. General Sko- 
beleff denounced Nicholas with vigor. " I 've a good 
mind," said he to MacGahan, " to desert and join the 
Turks I am so mad with our idiots of the headquar- 
ters staff. I don't speak of the Grand Duke Nicholas; 
he is a mere figure-head, and has about as much notion 
of conducting a campaign as I have of the differential cal- 
culus." Nevertheless, in his salutation of Osman Pasha, 
after the fall of Plevna, Nicholas showed that he could 
be both just and gracious. The book contains a number 
of illustrations, of indifferent merit, most of them from 
portraits in the possession of Mr. Forbes. 

The fifteenth volume of the time-honored " Boy Trav- 
ellers " series (Harper) is devoted to the adventures of 
the " Boy Travellers in the Levant." Colonel Knox has, 
as usual, spared no pains to make this volume both in- 
teresting and instructive. The pictures are not all new; 
in some cases they appear to be from worn plates, and 
are lacking in clearness. 

After the difficulty of its peculiar jerkiness of style 
is overcome, the book of travel " To Greenland and the 
Pole " (Scribner) proves very interesting. It is full of 
the fresh atmosphere of the northern countries, and de- 
scribes faithfully the ice-fields of virgin snow and the 
dangers of Polar travel. There is no straining after 
effect, only a straightforward narrative, which, while it 
has its lighter phases, touches also tragic cords. Its 
author is Mr. Gordon Stables, M.D., R.N., whose pro- 
totype for the chief hero is Nansen, while several of 
the other figures are sketched from living models. Much 
of the interest of the narrative centres, however, in the 
two brave lads, Colin and Olaf, whose northern birth 
makes them susceptible to the awful fascination of 
" dead nature in her winding-sheet," and endows them, 
also, with something of its austere charm. Another book 
by the same author is a tale of a seafaring lad and his 
love, called " As We Sweep through the Deep " (Nelson). 

Mr. Kirk Monroe's story of The Fur Seal's Tooth " 
(Harper) is more conventional than that of Mr. Stables, 
and at the same time more improbable. The scenes are 
in and about Alaska, and the plot is loosely woven 
around an Alaskan charm carved from the tooth of the 
fur-seal. The cruelty of the slaying of mother-seals is 
clearly impressed on the mind of the reader. Mr. J. 
Macdonald Oxley's In the Wilds of the West Coast " 
(Nelson) is another story of sea and land in and about 
Alaska. 

Professor John Trowbridge, in " Three Boys in an 
Electrical Boat " (Houghton), describes the adventures 
of three boys on board an American warship, where 
they make themselves useful in navigating a submarine 
boat. Two of them, the real heroes, have run away 
from school to embark; and their virtue is rewarded by 
their finding in the Governor-General of Bermuda their 
father, who had supposed them drowned in infancy. 
The details of the story are very exciting, but the 
plot is improbable and the moral questionable. 



Nearly all the distinctively boys' books have this 
year an historical foundation, by far the most inter- 
esting of them being those of Mr. G. A. Henty, who 
appears with three good books (Scribner), each sure to 
delight the " dear lads " to whom he addresses himself. 
Two of the books are historical, " Wulf the Saxon " 
rather surpassing in interest " When London Burned," 
though the latter is very entertaining. But the primi- 
tive simplicity of the life of the Saxons before the battle 
of Hastings has a charm which the story of the Restora- 
tion period lacks, and Wulf is rather more human than 
Cyril Shenstone, who almost is too bright and good for 
human nature's daily food. But Mr. Henty's lads are 
all brave and manly. He has placed one of them " In 
the Heart of the Rockies," and there, as elsewhere, dur- 
ing the hardships of a winter on the frontier, courage 
and integrity win love and respect. It shows the sound- 
ness of boys' hearts, that they respond to the note Mr. 
Henty strikes, and they freely testify that he writes the 
best boys' stories published. The strongest feature is 
their direct simplicity. Each phrase contributes vigor 
to the whole, and the dramatic element is never over- 
done. His characters are decidedly alive. 

Old fires are stirred and the embers live again in the 
pages of Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth's " The Patriot 
Schoolmaster" (Appleton). That "Father of the Rev- 
olution," Sam Adams, is its hero, and a brave boy 
marches boldly by his side to the tune of " Yankee 
Doodle " the interesting history of that good old air 
being completely set forth. The adventures of the 
" four cannon which constituted the whole train of field 
artillery possessed by the British Colonies of North 
America at the commencement of the war," form the 
motive of the book. Mr. Butterworth has performed a 
good deed also in telling the curious history of Phillis 
Wheatley, the first American colored poet, whose bust 
was made for the World's Fair through the influence 
of the colored women of Alleghany County, Pennsyl- 
vania. A certain disconnectedness of style throughout 
the book is easily forgiven, for it is fabricated of good 
stuff; its heroes live and are full of interest. The illus- 
trations, by Mr. R. Winthrop Peirce, are so excellent as 
to make one wish they were more numerous. 

A period which is conceded to have received less at- 
tention than it deserves that of the War of 1812 is 
the subject of " The Search for Andrew Field " (Lee & 
Shepard), in which Mr. Everett T. Tomlinson describes 
the adventures of boys with smugglers at the outbreak 
of the war. Another war story is contributed by " Ol- 
iver Optic," who writes for the lads of to-day the first 
of a series of six books to be called " The Blue and the 
Gray on Land and Sea." The boys for whom he wrote 
forty years ago are long since gray, but " Oliver Optic " 
is still popular. The scene of his present book, " Brother 
Against Brother " (Lee & Shepard) is laid in Kentucky; 
and the thoroughness of the work is attested by the au- 
thor's account, in the preface, of his preparatory study 
of the subject. The same author completes the second 
series of the " All-over-the- World Library " in the vol- 
ume on "Asiatic Breezes" (Lee & Shepard). 

The exterior of the biographical romance of " Olaf the 
Glorious" (Scribner) is not prepossessing, but Mr. Robert 
Leighton has imparted a living interest to its Viking 
hero. The book might be improved by the omission of 
many names, so briefly mentioned that their enumera- 
tion somewhat cumbers the narrative; but the stirring 
and bloody battle scenes would doubtless compensate 
most boys for uninteresting details, which they would 



342 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



be likely to skip anyway. The picture of the life of 
the Norseman in the tenth century is at once interesting 
and instructive. 

" The Sons of the Vikings" (Nelson) are the heroes of 
an Orkney story by Mr. John Gunn, which describes the 
daring, in modern warfare, of two brave descendants of 
more primitive men. The time is that of the great na- 
val war with France ; and though the plot is slender, the 
events are not without interest and the tone of the book 
is wholesome. 

A third and somewhat different book about still 
younger Norsemen is Mr. H. H. Boyesen's " Norseland 
Tales," which relates the adventures, often pathetic, of 
Norwegian boys in other countries and of foreign chil- 
dren in Norway. They are bright and simple tales, 
The Feud of the Wildhaymen " and the " Sun's Sis- 
ters " having the Norse atmosphere more clearly than 
the others. The ten stories form a pleasing but not ex- 
citing volume. 

A truly delightful book, racy of the sea, is Mrs. Molly 
Elliot Seawell's " Decatur and Somers" (Appleton). Its 
style is vigorous and free, its atmosphere bracing, and 
a rich humor abounds. A brave, sad life was that of 
Somers, and his tender friendship for his comrade 
touches the heart. With so many authors who introduce 
treacherous unwholesome characters into books for boys, 
it is refreshing to read a story which is full of noble 
thoughts and deeds, yet loses none of its exciting inter- 
est. The company of heroes such as these, and the 
interest centring perpetually about the frigate " Con- 
stitution," combine to make this a particularly attract- 
ive book. 

The writings of Miss Charlotte M. Yonge are so well 
known that " The Cook and the Captive " (Whittaker) 
requires no detailed description. It is a story of the 
Franks in the sixth century, and of the introduction of 
Christianity; and it is eminently safe and appropriate 
for Sunday-school libraries. 

A continuation of Mrs. Sarah K. Bolton's " Famous 
Leaders among Men " (Crowell) contains sketches of 
Bonaparte, Nelson, Phillips Brooks, Beecher, Spurgeon, 
Bunyan, Dr. Arnold, Charles Kingsley, General Sher- 
man, and Wendell Phillips. The group seems perhaps 
incongruous, but the fact that each fought a good fight, 
either in church or secular warfare, gives the collection 
a certain uniformity. 

The illustrations in Mr. Clifton Johnson's "The Farm- 
er's Boy " (Appleton) are very attractive. They are 
from photographs, and tell the story of farm-life with 
more skill than the text itself, which is somewhat com- 
monplace. Boys and girls would probably take but a 
mild interest in the rambling narrative, which would 
leave them with the impression that a farm is a good 
place to keep away from. 

The same vein of sentiment that runs through her 
past work lends attraction to Miss Plympton's little 
story of " Rags and Velvet Gowns " (Roberts), a taste- 
fully bound book with illustrations by the author. It 
lightly touches on the social problem of rich and poor, 
a little child at Christmas- time leading her father to re- 
member the responsibility which his wealth entails. It 
is a sad story, with a death as its climax; but out of 
sadness grows sympathy for sorrow. Like Miss Plymp- 
ton's story of " Dear Daughter Dorothy," however, the 
more delicate touches, such as the misunderstood na- 
ture of the little heroine, would be apt to escape young 
readers. 



DEDICATION AND INAUGURATION AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS. 



(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

Thursday, November 15, was an important day in the 
history of the University of Illinois. The occasion was 
the inauguration of the newly-elected President, Dr. 
Andrew S. Draper, and the dedication of the handsome 
new Engineering Hall. Very seldom has more enthu- 
siasm been manifested by either the students or friends 
of the University than was then shown. It was a per- 
fect November day ; the buildings everywhere were 
gay with orange and blue, the University colors ; and 
prominent men were present from all over the country. 
Governor John P. Altgeld presided, and twelve college 
presidents lent dignity to the occasion. 

The programme was in two parts, that in the after- 
noon consisting of short addresses from members of the 
Faculty, of the Alumni Association, of the Board of 
Trustees, and of the student body, who all welcomed 
the President to his new work. These were followed 
by the inaugural address of President Draper, who dis- 
cussed at some length the relation of the State to the 
University. 

The dedication programme in the evening consisted 
of introductory remarks by President Draper, a short 
talk by General William Sooy-Smith, of Chicago, and 
an able address on University Ideals, by Dr. Charles 
Kendall Adams, President of the University of Wiscon- 
sin. Dr. Adams made suggestions which Illinois might 
well adopt in its relations with the State University. 
Excellent music was furnished for both programmes by 
the various musical organizations of the University. 
The Military Battalion had charge of the movements 
of the four thousand people present, and a more suc- 
cessful management of the large assembly could not be 
imagined. 

At the close of the evening programme, the Presi- 
dent and Deans of the Colleges, with their wives, held 
a reception in the new Engineering Building, which was 
attended by at least two thousand people, who were, for 
the first time, given an opportunity to examine the inte- 
rior of the new hall. The new building is probably the 
largest and best equipped of any in the country used 
exclusively for engineering purposes. It was designed 
by an alumnus of the State University, and was built 
at a cost of $160,000, the sum having been appropri- 
ated by the Legislature for that purpose. The building 
is 200 feet front, with wings at each end 76 feet long, 
while the central part extends back 140 feet. It is four 
stories in height. 

The new President, Dr. Andrew Sloan Draper, is too 
well known among educational people to need an intro- 
duction. Coming from his recent successful career as 
State Superintendent of the schools of New York, and 
head of the Cleveland, Ohio, schools, he is even at this 
early date beginning to show what he will do for Illi- 
nois. He is a man of remarkable diplomacy and execu- 
tive ability, and has quite captivated the hearts of all 
connected with the University, both students and fac- 
ulty. During his brief connection with the institution 
he has displayed excellent judgment in adapting him- 
self to his new surroundings, and the friends of the Uni- 
versity feel that his coming will mark a new era in the 
progress of the institution. The entire success of the 
recent exercises seems to point in that direction.

YORK TOPICS. 



New York, November 26, 1894. 

It was a pleasant thought to gather in one volume 
the romances of the three New England heroines, Pris- 
cilla, Agnes Surriage, and Martha Hilton ; and Mr. 
Edmund H. Garrett has faithfully and tastefully illus- 
trated the little book in quite an Abbey-like vein. If 
he had rested there, I should have no quarrel with him ; 
but he has added some notes to the volume, in which he 
does a real injustice to one of the most commendable 
performances in the way of preserving historic antiqui- 
ties which have taken place in New England. In speak- 
ing of the old Wentworth house at Portsmouth har- 
bor, Mr. Garrett refers to its former appearance as 
venerable, and to its present appearance as " spick- 
span in yellow and white paint, and set back in a well- 
groomed lawn," with a flout at this latter condition 
of things. No doubt there was much spick- spanness 
about the house when Martha Hilton lived there as 
the wife of Governor Wentworth, and no doubt, too, 
the " venerable " grayness of some ten years ago was 
picturesque enough in its way. It is a question, how- 
ever, as to how long the old house would have lasted be- 
fore falling to pieces, had it not been taken in hand by 
its last purchaser, Mr. J. T. Coolidge, the Boston art- 
ist. Having been a witness of the restoration of the 
old mansion during three or four summers, I can truth- 
fully declare that never was a similar task more lov- 
ingly carried out. Without doubt, the house in shape 
and appearance is precisely what it was in colonial days. 
To reproduce the old shutters, a few specimens of which 
remained, it was necessary toforge certain carpenter's 
tools now no longer in use; and this detail is given as 
an example of Mr. Coolidge's fidelity to old traditions. 
He bought the house for his summer home, and so he 
has made it inhabitable and incidentally has put it in 
order for another hundred years. As to the color of 
the outside, now and formerly, Mr. Coolidge and Mr. 
Garrett both being artists, it is useless to dispute about 
tastes; but for my part, since so many brand-new cot- 
tages by the sea are made to look " venerable " and 
" weather-beaten " before their fires of chemically man- 
ufactured " driftwood " are lighted for the first time, it 
is something of a relief to see a last-century mansion 
restored to its original splendor. This little discussion 
is based on a copy of " Three Heroines of New England 
Romance," published by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., 
which, as I have already intimated, will repay more 
than a passing glance. 

The Bryant centennial celebrations and memorial 
meetings have now all been completed, separate affairs 
having taken place at different dates in Cummington 
and Great Barrington, Mass., and in Brooklyn and this 
city. A volume containing an account of the memorial 
exercises which took place at Cummiugton, the poet's 
birthplace, together with the speeches and poems that 
were delivered on that occasion, will soon be issued by 
the committee in charge. It will be illustrated with 
portraits and views, and will be sold in two bindings to 
suit purchasers. Mrs. Henrietta S. Nahmer, secretary 
of the memorial committee, may be addressed at Cum- 
mington, Mass., in the matter of subscriptions. 

Literary readings and lectures, and meetings of social- 
literary clubs, are more frequent than usual this season. 
Dr. Horace Howard Furness, of Philadelphia, the Shake- 
spearean scholar, has just given a reading and interpre- 
tation of " As You Like It " before a dramatic club of 



this city. Mr. L. J. B. Lincoln's " Uncut Leaves " so- 
ciety listened this week to readings from Mr. Cable, 
Mrs. Wiggin, and others. This society, which meets 
monthly, has now reached a membership in this city 
alone of some six hundred. Mr. Paul Blouet (" Max 
O'Rell ") arrived a week ago for a lecture tour which 
will embrace this country and Canada. He was put 
down by his manager for a lecture on the very day his 
steamer was due; and he was able to fulfil the engage- 
ment. Mr. Blouet, who has been renewing old friend- 
ships here, thinks that this tour will complete his ca- 
reer as a lecturer. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. have on sale a number of 
interesting manuscripts of the late Dante Gabriel Ros- 
setti. The same firm will follow up Ian Maclaren's suc- 
cessful volume of Scottish tales, " Beside the Bonnie 
Brier Bush," with a novel of Somerset life, " Love and 
Quiet Life," by Walter Raymond. Both these volumes 
were recommended for publication by Dr. Nicoll, who 
is said to have discovered Barrie and Jane Barlow. The 
differentiation of English fiction according to the sev- 
eral shires goes merrily on. Somersetshire seems to 
be a new field and a new dialect, at least as far as the 
present year is concerned. The book in question is a 
pleasant study of English rural life.

LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. will soon publish a vol- 
ume of poems by Mrs. Sarah Knowles Bolton. 

" Factors in Organic Evolution," by President David 
Starr Jordan, is just issuing from the press of Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. 

A new edition of Herr Bjornson's novels is promised 
by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. We presume it to be the 
same as that announced in London by Mr. William 
Heineman. 

Signor Hoepli, of Milan, has begun the publication 
of Lionardo da Vinci's " Codice Atlantico." There are 
to be thirty-four parts, and the edition will be limited 
to two hundred and eighty copies. 

Our statement, in the last issue, that Philip Gilbert 
Hamerton died at Autun was a mistake. It seems that 
his death took place at Boulogne-sur-Seine, where he 
has spent much time of late years. 

London has just been having a Gibbon centenary, and 
the French have been talking, although to little pur- 
pose, of a celebration of Voltaire's two-hundredth anni- 
versary, which also falls this year. 

Walter Pater's unpublished papers are being pre- 
pared for the press by Mr. C. L. Shadwell, the trans- 
lator of Dante. One volume will be a collection of 
"Greek Studies"; another will be similar to "Imagin- 
ary Portraits." 

During the past year, there have been published in 
Russia (exclusive of Finland) no less than 10,242 sep- 
arate works, of which nearly 34,000,000 copies were 
printed. Perhaps the Muscovite is not such a barbarian 
as some people think, after all. 

The Knox College celebration of the Bryant Centen- 
nial was described in our last issue. We now learn 
that the proceedings are to be printed in a limited edi- 
tion, copies of which, numbered and signed by Mr. John 
Howard Bryant, may be subscribed for with Mr. E. E. 
Calkins, Galesburg, 111.

The seventh annual meeting of the American Eco- 
nomic Association will be held December 26-29 at Co- 
lumbia College. An attractive list of papers is offered, 
and all interested in the science of economics are invited 
to attend the meetings as well as the reception given 
by President Low on the twenty-seventh. 

The magnificent "History of Ancient Art" by MM. 
G. Perrot and Charles Chipiez (Armstrong), of which 
past volumes have been reviewed by us, is now con- 
tinued with a two-volume " History of Art in Primitive 
Greece," which we only mention upon this occasion, as 
we intend to review it at length in a later issue. 

Mr. Justin McCarthy protests very vigorotisly against 
the action of the American publishing house which has, 
without any authorization or even notification, issued an 
edition of his " History of Our Own Times," with new 
chapters by an American hand. It appears that the 
author himself had in contemplation the work of bring- 
ing the history up to date. 

Carl Plong, poet and patriot, statesman and journal- 
ist, died at Copenhagen on the twenty-seventh of Octo- 
ber. When we read him twenty years ago, he seemed 
even then one of the old-timers, and we hardly realized 
that he existed in the flesh. And yet he was not only 
living, but was destined to survive until the present year, 
and to the ripe age of eighty-one. 

Mr. Walter Blackburn Harte's new volume of social 
and literary papers, " Meditations in Motley : A Bundle 
of Papers Imbued with the Sobriety of Midnight," has 
a fantastic and curious dedication. It runs : " I com- 
mend this little book to the Devil and Dame Chance, 
the two most potent deities in literary fortunes as in all 
other sublunary dispensations." The book is published 
by the Arena Publishing Co., of Boston. 

We take this bit of information from " The Athen- 
a3um ": " The most important contribution yet published 
to the biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti is now in 
course of preparation, and is likely to be issued at a not 
very distant date. The book will consist of two sections, 
1, a memoir of some considerable length, on which his 
brother, Mr. William Michael Rossetti, is now actively 
engaged; 2, Dante Rossetti's family letters, from his 
boyhood to the latest months of his life." 

" The Tragedies of Euripides in English Verse " (Mac- 
inillan), by Mr. Arthur S. Way, is to consist of three 
volumes, the first of which is at hand. Mr. Way has 
previously published translations of both " Iliad " and 
" Odyssey," and hence brings a practised hand to his 
new task. Certainly, a good verse-translation of Euri- 
pides is much needed, for half of the plays have been 
untouched since Potter, and the others have been spor- 
adically versified in English by a score of hands. Mr. 
Way's work is excellent, although it may hardly be called 
brilliant. 

The death of Froude has set in circulation a half-for- 
gotten skit, which recalls a passage at arms of many 
years ago. 

" While Froude assures the Scottish youth 
That parsons do not care for truth, 
The Reverend Canon Kingsley cries 
' All history's a pack of lies.' 
" What cause for judgment so malign ? 

A little thought may solve the mystery ; 
For Froude thinks Kingsley a divine, 
And Kingsley goes to Froude for history." 

Sir Frederick Pollock, the well-known authority on 
Copyright, writes as follows to " The Author " of Lon- 



don: "I have observed with uneasiness, in ' The Au- 
thor ' and elsewhere, a tendency to revive the high 
metaphysical theory of copyright as a perpetual and 
immutable right of property conferred by the law of 
nature. This theory is, in my opinion, unsound, and at 
all events it has been definitely rejected by English and 
American law. Copyright is property, but not a prop- 
erty in ideas; it is a monopoly or exclusive franchise, 
created for reasons of policy, in particular forms whereby 
ideas are expressed." 

The mortuary record of the last fortnight includes 
the names of James McCosh and of Robert C. Win- 
throp, both of whom died on the sixteenth of Novem- 
ber ; of Anton Gregor Rubinstein, who died on the 
twentieth, and of Jean Victor Duruy, who died on the 
twenty-fifth. These four men were born, respectively, 
in 1811, 1809, 1829, and 1811. When we sought to 
enumerate in a recent issue the American men of let- 
ters yet surviving from the first quarter of the century, 
the ink was hardly dried before we had to expunge the 
name of Dr. Holmes. Winthrop was another of the 
veterans, and our list once more shrinks. He is best 
remembered by his orations, filling three large volumes, 
and by his " Life and Letters of John Winthrop." The 
death of Rubinstein emphasizes the loss of Tschai- 
kowsky, Gounod, and Billow, all of whom have left us 
within about a year. As for Dr. McCosh, of his three 
quarter-centuries and more only one has been passed in 
our midst, but he thoroughly identified himself with our 
life and institutions. His many published works were, 
with hardly an exception, of a religious or philosophical 
character. Among the works of Duruy the following 
should be mentioned: " Histoire de la Grdce Ancienne," 
" Histoire des Remains," " Histoire de France," and 
" Histoire des Temps Modernes." A translation of the 
latter work is one of the latest publications of Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. 

THE THINNED RANKS OF OLDER ENGLISH AUTHORS. 

In its article on the death of Froude, the " Saturday 
Review " thus speaks of the mournful passing of the 
older group of English authors: "Last week English 
literature still had two leaders; now it has only one. 
Not since that rapid fall of the greatest writers of En- 
glish which in the early Thirties drew from Words- 
worth some of the best of his later lines, has there been 
such a thinning of the ranks of the captains of prose 
and verse as the last few years have seen. Lord Ten- 
nyson and Mr. Browning, Cardinal Newman and Mr. 
Arnold, had left us; Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Froude re- 
mained. There is no one but Mr. Ruskin now of the 
first class of veterans. The best of those who remain 
belong distinctly to the next generation and perhaps they 
are not very numerous; certainly not more than one or 
two of them are ever likely to be ranked by posterity 
with those who have just been named. What younger 
generations still may have in store time will show; but 
it is not ungracious to say that the very best man, be 
he who he may, who has not yet reached fifty, will have 
to make new and strange progress before he can be 
ranked with those of whom only Mr. Ruskin survives." 

THE HISTORY OF A PUBLISHING HOUSE. 

The romance of business has an interesting illustra- 
tion in " The History of a Publishing House " in the 
current number of " Scribner's Magazine." The house 
referred to is that of Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, 
and the particular occasion of the present history is its 



1894.]

occupancy of its fine new building in Fifth Avenue, 
New York. The house is not yet quite fifty years of 
age, but it has long held its place among the foremost 
of American publishing-houses, and may well indulge 
in these reminiscences of its remarkable career and fe- 
licitations upon its position and prospects. Great pub- 
lishing houses are not built in a day, hardly in a gen- 
eration; the real successes seem to come with the sec- 
ond or later generation of descendants or of partnerships. 
Such is the case with this house. Mr. Charles Scribner, 
Senior, who founded it in 1846, was a man of energy 
and sagacity, and conducted it for twenty-five years, 
when he was succeeded by his sons who form the heads 
of the present firm. It was during the elder Mr. Scrib- 
ner's administration that the old " Scribner's Monthly " 
(now " The Century Magazine ") was established, in 
conjunction with Dr. Holland and Mr. Roswell Smith; 
and it is interesting to note that this magazine and the 
present " Scribner's " (founded in 1877) were perhaps the 
two most powerful factors in the growth and prosperity 
of the firm. Of the older magazine the article states that 
it " set a virtually new standard for the illustrated pop- 
ular periodical; through its artistic side especially it 
had the chief part in the great progress in American 
illustration and wood-engraving which has been one of 
the notable things of our last quarter of a century ; and 
the way in which it revolutionized all former ideas of 
the possibilities of magazine circulation was epoch-mak- 
ing." The article gives many interesting details of the 
firm's career and of the more notable enterprises in 
which it has engaged. Portraits are given of deceased 
members of the firm, with exterior and interior views 
of its new home.

FORD. Crown 8vo, cloth, gilt edges, yellow and gold cover, 337 pages, $2.00. 
"The Yellow Fairy Book" immediately takes place among the leading juvenile publications of the 
fall, and a large share of holiday favoritism may be pledged to it in advance, for its predecessors have 
hewn a path for it. 

" Mr. Lang's graceful and prepossessing style presents these old and yet ever new tales in charming 
text, and the numerous full-page and smaller illustrations by H. J. Ford are spirited and in complete 
harmony with the stories. Without, it is one of the handsomest and within one of the most entertain- 
ing books the season can produce." Boston Times.

The regular systematic use of a Diary economizes time, 
teaches method, and in the use of its Cash Account saves 
money. Even the briefest notes made in a Diary are easily 
referred to, and give a reliable and chronological history of 
one's acts, while if entered in a memorandum book they are 
soon lost. 

CHILDREN SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO USE DIARIES. 
NOTHING BETTER FOR A CHRISTMAS OR A NEW YEAR'S 

PRESENT. 
A DAILY REMINDER OF THE GIVER FOR A YEAR.

SCIENCE. 

PHYSICAL LABORATORY MANUAL. 

By H. N. CHUTE, Teacher of Physics in Ann Arbor, Mich.,

ideas propounded in the report of the Conference on Physics 

to the Committee of Ten.

HISTORY. 

A HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. 

By ALLEN C. THOMAS, A.M., Professor of History in Haver- 
ford College, Pennsylvania. 

" It is, in its method and arrangement, admirably adapted to the 
class-room. The author lias the right view of history, that is, it is not 
a series of dates or descriptions of battles, but a revelation of the spirit 
of the people, their aims and motives and achievements. It is a difficult 
task to write an intelligent, clear history of the United States in 400 
pages, and yet every student, if he reads no more than this book, will 
have a clear idea of not only the great events, but the spirit of the 
people who executed them. We mark the book as one of more than 
usual excellence. It is elegant in its English sentences, has no hobbies, 
and teaches history from the best modem methods. The volume is em- 
bellished with many portraits of the Nation's statesmen and heroes."

GEOGRAPHY. 

LESSONS IN THE NEW GEOGRAPHY, 

For Student and Teacher. By SPENSER TROTTER, M.D., 
Professor of Biology in Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania. 
The New Geography is new in the sense that its point of view is essen- 
tially human. The old methods of geography teaching dealt almost 
exclusively in the hard facts and dry detail of surface features, political 
divisions, an endless, meaningless collection of names, with little if 
any reference to the true value of geographical conditions as factors in 
the development of man. As the earth is the theatre of human action, 
the true study of geography is a study of human life under the varied 
conditions of existence imposed by the different regions of the earth. 
It is thus synonymous with History. One object of these " Lessons " 
is to bring forward this view of the study of Geography, to bring it 
with a fresh and living interest to the mind of every teacher and student.

MODERN LANGUAGES. 

A DANISH AND DANO-NORWEGIAN 
GRAMMAR. 

By P. GROTH, A.M., late Fellow of the University of Chris- 
tiana. 

The great interest which has of late been aroused in the Scandinavian 
literature, and the correspondingly increased demand for instruction in 
the Scandinavian language in our colleges and universities, has made 
the lack of a suitable grammar of the Dano-Norwegian language more 
perceptible. At the same time the annually increasing number of tour- 
ists in Norway has also increased the number of those intelligent trav- 
ellers who wish to familiarize themselves with the customs, traditions, 
and literature of the country something that cannot be done without 
some knowledge of the language. This book can be safely recom- 
mended to all interested in the subject.

gested to the author by the following questions : " With what 
women is Napoleon known to have had temporary relations as 
a young man, as Consul, and finally as Emperor ? Had he an 
absorbing passion for any one woman ? and, if so, for whom ? " 
to. his task the author has found many powerful allies, and 
has distilled the essence of documents that have been accum- 
ulating for years. The result is a narrative of the facts as 
they appear from these various evidences. 

Memoirs of Count Lavalette, 

Adjutant and Private Secretary to Napoleon, and Post- 
master-General under the Empire. With portraits. 
A limited edition of 150 copies for America, 12mo, 
cloth, $3.00. A limited edition of 25 large-paper 
copies for America, $6.00. 

Few persons knew Napoleon as did Lavalette ; and histo- 
rians gathering materials may place full confidence in his 
recital. No other facts are mentioned than those in which he 
was an eye-witness, and the author's character will prove a 
sufficient voucher for the truth.

By Mrs. ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS-WARD, who presents an ideal of character in her hero which will 
be sure to command attention. 

SHORT STORIES. 

Early issues in 1895 will contain a two-part story by Mrs. WIGGIN, a single-number story of unusual 
charm by Miss JEWETT, and another, Joint Owners in Spain, by Miss ALICE BROWN, a new author 
of promise. 

Other contributors will be 

Mrs. Catherwood, Eliza Orne White, Lafcadio Hearn, Gilbert Parker, Robert W. Herrick, 
Kate Chopin, (i. Pitre, Joel Chandler Harris, Grace Howard Peirce. 



During 1895 THE ATLANTIC will follow in the main the lines laid down in previous years. An effort 
will be made to direct attention to subjects which can be grouped as follows : 

Studies in Great Literature. 

New Figures in Literature and Art. 

International Relations of the United States. 

Political History. 

Non = Partisan Politics. 

Education and Discussion of Public Affairs. 



An Announcement of Importance. 
DR. JOHN FISKE will furnish a Series of Historical Papers entitled 

VIRGINIA AND HER NEIGHBORS.

many admirers will be particularly interested in this announcement of another of his important contribu- 
tions to the history of our country. 

The Issue of January, 1895, will contain 

The Survival of the American Spirit. 

An article of unusual interest touching upon the rise of the A. P. A.

LITER AR Y CENTENNIALS. 

There is no doubt that the human mind in- 
clines toward round numbers, and takes a cer- 
tain pleasure in contemplating them. Just why 
this should be the case is a problem for the 
psychologist ; but we, being now concerned 
with the fact alone, will not stop to inquire into 
its antecedents. Particularly are most of us 
attracted by a round number when it happens 
to be a number of years. When a thing is ten, 
or twenty-five, or fifty years old, we begin to 
think that we must do something about it. 
And when a full hundred years has been 
counted, the thing somehow becomes all at once 
so memorable that it suddenly fills a large arc 
of that horizon upon which only the year before 
it was hardly more than a speck. 

As far as our individual lives are concerned, 
we have to be content with the celebration of 
silver weddings, semi-centennials, and such-like 
petty affairs. The inexorable reaper cuts us 
down (with the exception of a Chevreul here 
and there) before we can claim a full century 
for our own, and thus have real cause for glor- 
ification. As for a wedding centennial, that 
has not been even thinkable since the Flood. 
Perhaps the nearest approach to such an event 
is made by the pensioned widows of our Revo- 
lutionary veterans, some of whom (that is, of 
the widows) still survive. But even pensioners 
are mortal, and then the celebration by a widow 
of any wedding anniversary would be too mel- 
ancholy an affair to be seriously undertaken.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



But if we are by nature debarred from the 
enjoyment of our own centennials, we can at 
least celebrate those of other people. What 
may be called the craze for the centennial 
reached its height in this country when we 
rounded the first hundred years of our national 
existence. But those who fondly fancied that 
a single big Centennial Exposition would do 
the business were vastly mistaken, as the event 
proved. For the Declaration of Independence 
was no sooner out of the way than we found it 
necessary to indulge in successive jubilations 
over the anniversaries of a great many other 
things, and the Revolutionary series was not 
closed until we had worked our way down to 
the inauguration of George Washington. Then 
we had a bare year or two of respite before 
becoming engrossed in a bigger celebration than 
any of the others that of the discovery of 
America by one Christopher Columbus, a Gen- 
oese. What the future has in store for us is 
not known ; but a Cabot quadri-centennial for 
1897 should at least be in order, and others are 
pretty likely to follow. 

The fashion of the literary centennial has 
spread somewhat alarmingly during the past 
quarter-century from the time, say, of the 
Shakespeare celebration of 1864 and the Dante 
celebration of the year following. Michelan- 
gelo had his turn in 1874. During the past 
few weeks we have had occasion to chronicle 
various celebrations in honor of the worthy 
Nuremberg cobbler, whose shoes, we trust, were 
better than his songs. We have also reported 
divers gatherings in commemoration of the first- 
born of our own American poets. The first 
quarter of the twentieth century will, we im- 
agine, be fairly well sprinkled with occasions 
like these, for we cherish the memory of the 
builders of our literature, and delight to do 
honor to their names. Nor is the honor thus 
done altogether an empty one, or the occasion 
fruitless, for with each event we furbish up 
our recollections of a worthy writer, and re-read 
his books with new interest. We are likely, 
also, to get from the publishers new and im- 
proved editions, and perhaps new biographical 
studies, upon such occasions. 

Among the literary celebrations of the pres- 
ent year we note, not without a touch of alarm, 
the Gibbon memorial exercises that Mr. Fred- 
eric Harrison has so successfully carried out in 
London. We would not question the claims 
of Gibbon upon the love and reverent gratitude 
of all English-speaking people ; but a danger- 
ous precedent is set up by the exercises in ques- 



tion. For the significant fact must be noted 
that it is the centennial of Gibbon's death that 
we now commemorate, not that of his birth. 
Thus the number of possible future celebrations 
is doubled at a single stroke. There seems, 
moreover, to be some question of taste involved 
in the celebration of a man's death. If it were 
Gower, for example, or almost any one of the 
early Poets Laureate, there might be a certain 
appropriateness in the act. But the anniversary 
of a really great writer's death is a rather poor 
pretext for a glorification of his life. But the 
pretext, such as it is, will probably be seized 
upon many times. Already the Italians are 
making great preparations for their celebration 
next year in honor of the third centenary of the 
death of Tasso. The French might be engaged 
this very year in commemorating the centenary 
of the death of Condorcet ; but as they have 
neglected the far more obvious opportunity of- 
fered by the birth of Voltaire in 1694, it is not 
surprising that they should have let slip the 
memory of the philosopher. If they want to 
make up for the neglect, they may celebrate 
next year the death of La Fontaine, or the 
deaths of La Bruyere and Madame de Sevigne 
in 1896, or of Racine and Beaumarchais in 

1899. The Germans are not likely to pay at- 
tention to such mortuary centennials during 
the present century, as their literary necrology 
presents no very conspicuous name. But the 
English, following the Gibbon precedent, may 
signalize in 1896 the death of Burns, in 1897 
that of Burke, in 1899 that of Spenser, and in 
1900 those of Dry den and Cowper. 

But the celebrations that have about them 
no shadow of illegitimacy are those that sig- 
nalize the secular recurrence of the birthday of 
some name great in the literature of a country 
or of the world. We have thought it interest- 
ing to ask what occasions of this sort are offered 
by the half-dozen remaining years of the nine- 
teenth century. In our own country, no more 
poets will be ripe for commemoration during 
this century ; but the historians Prescott and 
Palfrey were born in 1796, while Bancroft first 
saw the light in 1800. England may celebrate 
the birth of Carlyle or Keats next year if she 
will, of Hood in 1898, and of Macaulay in 

1900. Germany will soon be reminded that 
Ranke was born in 1795, and Heine in 1799. 
Possibly, by the centennial of the latter date 
the worthy Philistines of Diisseldorf may have 
consented to the erection of a monument to the 
greatest German since Goethe. The French, 
in 1896, may celebrate the third Descartes cen- 



1894.]

tennial, and in 1900 the first centennial of the 
great master of their fiction. Surely the au- 
thor of the Human Comedy deserves remem- 
brance, if a writer ever did. The Italians will 
have occasion, in 1898, to celebrate both Me- 
tastasio and Leopard born just a century 
apart, and thus brought into incongruous fel- 
lowship. And finally, Calderon, the greatest 
poet of Spain, born in the closing year of the 
sixteenth century, should not be forgotten by 
the closing year of the nineteenth. We shall be 
much disappointed if his fellow-countrymen do 
not contrive to do something for the author of 
" La Vida es Sueno " when the year 1900 comes 
around. 

We have one more suggestion to make, al- 
though it probably comes too late for responsive 
action. On the third of January, B.C. 106, 
there was born near the town of Arpinum, in 
the Volscian hills, a boy who received the name 
of Marcus Tullius Cicero. A little calculation 
will show that the third of January, 1895, will 
be the two thousandth anniversary of that birth. 
When the boy grew up he came to play a con- 
siderable part in the affairs of the state, and 
was altogether a man of mark. That he is still 
remembered countless schoolboys and other 
competent persons will testify. Here is surely 
a chance that ought not to be missed. It is 
not often that the opportunity is offered to cel- 
ebrate the second millenial of a great writer's 
birth, and, beside such an occasion, mere cen- 
tennials, and even bi-, tri-, and quadri-centen- 
nials, seem insignificant. Here is a round num- 
ber, indeed, that must appeal to the most 
wayward fancy ; and we offer to our readers 
as a Christmas gift the suggestion that some- 
thing be planned for the coming year to com- 
memorate the twentieth Ciceronian centenary. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



ENGLISH IN THE SOUTHERN UNIVERSITIES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your series of articles on the study of English in 
American universities, and particularly the general con- 
clusions of your summary in the issue of November 1, 
have proved interesting reading to a large constituency. 
Yet I fear the silence as to the work in English in a 
whole section of our country might seem unintentionally 
misleading. True, the University of Virginia has found 
a place in your list as a Southern institution, and all her 
old students know how to praise warmly the work she 
has done and promises to do for American scholarship. 
But, just in the department of English, there have also 
been other institutions in the South and Southwest which 
established reputed courses, even before Virginia's noble 



university, and have influenced vitally the tendencies of 
thought and culture in the Southern half of the United 
States. 

I shall not here reproduce any of the points empha- 
sized in an article on " The Study of English in the 
South " written for the " Sewanee Review," February, 
1894. The attempt was there made to give the history 
of the movement. But one marked fact was the atten- 
tion paid to English, by the side of Latin, Greek, and 
other " humanistic " studies, as a full and independent 
course, in many Southern institutions at very early dates. 
Randolph-Macon and Richmond colleges in Virginia 
have had full English courses since 1868. English was 
emphasized at Washington and Lee University from the 
beginning of General R. E. Lee's administration, and 
the present incumbent of the English chair in that in- 
stitution has been in position steadily to develop his de- 
partment since 1876. Vanderbilt University in Nash- 
ville, the University of the South at Sewanee, Tulane 
University in New Orleans, have, from their inception, 
emphasized and strengthened their English courses. 
Some of the smaller colleges, too, have been exception- 
ally zealous in this field; e. g., William and Mary and 
Hampden-Sidney in Virginia, Davidson in North Car- 
olina, and Charleston and Wofford in South Carolina. 
Washington and Lee and Vanderbilt Universities have, 
moreover, developed valuable post-graduate courses in 
English looking to the Doctor's degree. The preceding 
are all cases of private corporations. Likewise, many of 
the State universities have shown peculiar sensitiveness to 
the importance of the English instruction, and have em- 
phasized its scope and its inspirational and training value. 
The merit of the courses offered in the Universities of 
Texas, Missouri, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Car- 
olina, and Tennessee, I can readily instance. 

An interesting and noteworthy feature, in these cases, 
is the attention given to the constant practice in English 
composition, to criticism, to personal acquaintance with 
literature, and to the emphasis of library needs and 
library work. The historical study of the language goes 
hand in hand with the above, yet serves, I think, in most 
cases, not as an end in itself, but mainly as a means of 
giving greater power in linguistic knowledge and attain- 
ment and in literary expression. But the greatest gain 
has been in the fact that more attention is paid each 
year to the entrance requirements; preparatory schools 
are everywhere discarded, independent fitting schools 
are encouraged in their stead, and the system of special 
accredited schools is generally extending. While much 
is still to be desired in the country localities, the policy 
is working well in towns and cities. Fair training and' 
practice in the elements of the mother tongue may thus- 
be demanded before entrance, and generally be accepted 
as already possessed. 

With some ground-work to start with, therefore, a 
course of four years in the practical application of the 
rules of composition and rhetoric and in the study of" 
literary topics is usually added in college. For instance,, 
the University of Tennessee maps out for the four full 
years such a course in composition and literary work;: 
the philology course of two years is independent and 
parallel, for advanced students and graduates who de- 
sire linguistic training. All work centres in the library: 
the library is the workshop of the English classes. Prac- 
tical composition is attained, not only by constant theme- 
work, but also by reports (we make them weekly) based 
upon work done in the library in connection with class 
topics. From our librarian's record for the last two

months (October and November), 1351 slips show that 
this number of volumes was taken out over-night from 
the Seminary Room alone, where all the important books 
referred to in class lectures are temporarily placed for 
general use. A total of 1933 volumes, all told, taken 
out by the students in only two months, apart from the 
perhaps still larger number of books used in the library 
rooms, when there are fewer than three hundred stu- 
dents altogether in attendance in all departments, is a 
fair showing for the general interest and the nature of 
the practical results. 

Most of the Southern institutions, I find, study formal 
literature by topics or periods. Adopting the topical 
method as most clearly defined for all purposes, in our 
own case, we have made the serious study of American 
literary conditions the subject for investigation for one 
whole year, just because it contains the essence of our 
nationality and brings the facts and possibilities of Amer- 
ican life and authorship closer home to the youthful 
aspirant. Similarly, the study of the nineteenth cen- 
tury English writers, both in prose and in verse, best 
bears the impress of the modern consciousness and re- 
produces most closely existing tendencies and habits of 
thought. The prolonged study of Shakespeare by the 
maturest students is a just recognition of the poet's su- 
preme power. 

Necessarily, all the courses in the above-named insti- 
tutions (and there are others still) differ among them- 
selves ; but nevertheless one general spirit animates 
them. They cannot pretend to have solved all the dif- 
ficulties present and to have met all the needs required; 
but, I think, it is not too bold to assert that they are 
at least doing their share in upbuilding and leavening 
and spiritualizing the existing conditions of American

THE STUDY OF LITERATURE IN PREPARA- 
TORY SCHOOLS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It is hard to believe that the writer of a recent com- 
munication to THE DIAL (Nov. 16, p. 286) on The 
Work of Preparatory Schools in English " expected to 
be taken altogether seriously. If the picture therein 
painted is a true one of New York, or, still worse, if it 
represents the Eastern States in general, then must we 
Californians, in pure self-defence, abandon our convic- 
tions and join heart and soul in a movement toward ex- 
clusion which most of us have always deprecated, and 
shut ourselves from all influences that come from the 
East, from all so-called educational reforms that arise 
there, from everything that we have fondly thought 
would lead us out of our own provinciality. Especially 
must we beware of teachers who have been educated in 
those " helpless " Eastern schools, the especial merit of 
which seems to be their " discipline of coercion and re- 
straint." But we will not yet believe the case is as bad 
as it seems; all those dismal things were not really 
meant. 

The writer of the communication referred to of course 
does not use the word " appreciation " in its strict sense 
of a perfectly just or complete estimate of merit, but 
rather has in mind such partial appreciation as belongs 
to the perception and enjoyment of the chief excellences 
of a work. This is said to be secured only in the case 
of " exceptional teachers and pupils in exceptional re- 



lations." There flashes across my mind a scene in a 
preparatory school in San Francisco a teacher of En- 
glish, with a class of forty or fifty boys, reading " Evan- 
geline." I recall the quiet tones, the absorbed attention, 
of the whole class ; the evident pleasure with which the 
boys in turn pointed out their favorite lines; and then 
the questions of the teacher, put so naturally and easily, 
by which one passage after another became richer in 
meaning and beauty to his pupils. I will grant that 
here may have been the " exceptional teacher "; but one 
can hardly say the same of the many teachers of gram- 
mar, secondary, and country schools, who have borne 
glad testimony to a general love of literature among 
their pupils. 

Recently, after a class in a preparatory school had 
read, somewhat hastily but with apparent enjoyment, 
two long poems, its members were called upon to give 
some reason for their preference of one of these poems 
to the other. Among the answers given were the fol- 
lowing: " It is a poem of deeper feeling." " The inter- 
est is centred in one character." " I like the language 
better; there are so many beautiful similes, and many 
of these make the meaning clearer." " I enjoyed the 
metre so much; the other was too jingling." "It is 
more pathetic." " The characters are noble." " It is 
more sympathetic." Now, however little value these 
answers may have from a purely aesthetic point of view, 
they certainly show the beginnings of literary apprecia- 
tion. In this case there could hardly have been any 
exceptional conditions. Nay, rather, the conditions must 
be unusually adverse that can crush out the simple 
healthy instincts of the young, their natural attraction 
toward what is beautiful and good the basis of literary 
appreciation. Moreover, I believe that nowhere can 
these natural instincts be so easily guided as in the sec- 
ondary schools, provided the literature offered is thor- 
oughly within the intellectual grasp of the pupils. That 
the artistic sense is slow to develop in American youth 
I will admit; but I believe that it is seldom either alto- 
gether absent or perverted. 

In few secondary schools can composition be robbed 
of all its terrors especially when the work begins there, 
but at least the pupil can generally be led to attack 
it boldly and cheerfully; and when he has learned to 
frame a good sentence or paragraph, even if he goes no 
further, he cannot escape a certain satisfaction in it, a 
pleasure no different in kind from that of the great lit- 
erary artist. This impels him to greater effort, and he 
no longer looks upon his work in composition as an ar- 
bitrary requirement of his teacher. He knows now that 
it is for his own good, for he does really enjoy it a little, 
loth as he is to acknowledge this. 

The relation existing between the preparatory school 
and the college must be very different in the East from 
what it is here. Is it the examination system that is at 
fault ? When the University Examiners visit our 
schools, as they do every year, they do not present them- 
selves as rigid censors, but rather as helpful and sym- 
pathetic friends. They say that they have learned by 
their visits to understand our difficulties as they could 
not otherwise have done. They do not always find much 
to praise, but they give encouragement when they can, 
and offer very practical suggestions. The uplifting in- 
fluence of the Universities on the secondary schools is 
everywhere acknowledged among us, and teachers of 
English at least have found great inspiration from this 
source. GERTRUDE H. MASON.

AMERICAN M AXXERS. * 



Nearly sixty years ago a book was published 
in England called " Domestic Manners of the 
Americans," which raised a storm of indigna- 
tion throughout this country. The author was 
Mrs. Trollope, mother of the now famous nov- 
elist, Anthony Trollope ; and she had gained 
the materials for her book during a three years' 
residence in this country, spent mostly in Cin- 
cinnati, Ohio, then a little town of some twenty 
thousand inhabitants. The refined and luxury- 
loving woman, fond of social pleasures and 
accustomed to the best associations of literary 
and social London, found the manners of the 
small raw backwoods settlement extremely un- 
congenial and repulsive, and described them 
without fear or favor. She spent but little 
time in the older and more settled portions of 
the country, passing through them only on her 
journey home. The New England States she 
never visited at all. But with a woman's fond- 
ness for generalizations, she labelled what had 
come within her vision " American," and set it 
down as the necessary outcome of democracy. 

Naturally, a picture so one-sided and un- 
favorable was greatly resented by the Ameri- 
can people at large, and it was even asserted 
that the author had written her book with the 
deliberate purpose of villifying and caricatur- 
ing this country. Yet there is no doubt that, as 
far as it went, it was a truthful picture. Hav- 
ing outgrown our sensitiveness, we can afford 
now to take up the work as a valuable contri- 
bution to social studies of a period which en- 
dured but a short time, rapidly passing away as 
the onward sweep of material progress prepared 
the way for the graces of life. This we have the 
opportunity of doing, in a new edition of the fa- 
mous book, handsomely issued in two volumes 
with novel bindings of " bluet " cloth and white 
backs, and with an introduction by Professor 
Harry Thurston Peck of Columbia College. 

To turn the pages of these volumes is to re- 
veal the enormous changes of the sixty years 
since they were penned. Many of the things 
most distinctive then are entirely unknown 
now, and the qualities then most conspicuous 
for their absence have now become those most 
distinctive of our civilization. For example, 
Mrs. Trollope is particularly struck with the

lope. With Introduction by Harry Thurston Peck. In two 
volumes. New York : Dodd, Mead & Co. 



dulness of our so-called festivities ; she con- 
siders Jonathan a very dull boy, and says : 
" Compared with Americans, we are whirligigs 
and teetotums ; every day is a holiday and every 
night a festival." And the descriptions of the 
social gatherings she attended certainly war- 
rant her judgment. It is hard to realize that 
anywhere or at any time American society has 
been notable for reticence and withdrawal of 
the sexes from each other ; yet this is some- 
thing continually noted here. Evening parties 
are thus described : 

" The women invariably herd together at one part of 
the room, and the men at the other; but, in justice to 
Cincinnati, I must acknowledge that this arrangement 
is by no means peculiar to that city, or to the western 
side of the Alleghanies. . . . The gentlemen spit, talk 
of elections and the price of produce, and spit again. 
The ladies look at each other's dresses till they know 
every pin by heart ; talk of Parson Somebody's last ser- 
mon on the day of judgment, on Dr. T'otherbody's new 
pills for dyspepsia, till the ' tea ' is announced, when 
they all console themselves together for whatever they 
may have suffered in keeping awake, by taking more 
tea, coffee, hot cake and custard, hoe cake, johnny cake, 
waffle cake and dodger cake, pickled peaches and pre- 
served cucumbers, ham, turkey, hung beef, apple sauce, 
and pickled oysters, than ever were prepared in any 
other country of the known world. After this massive 
meal is over, they return to the drawing-room, and it 
always appeared to me that they remained together as 
long as they could bear it, and then they rise en masse, 
cloak, bonnet, shawl, and exit" 

Still more surprising is it to learn that mixed 
dinner-parties of ladies and gentlemen were 
very rare, and that the gentlemen were seated 
at one end and the ladies at the other, while, 
unless several foreigners were present, but lit- 
tle conversation took place at table. At large 
balls, the gentlemen were served to a sump- 
tuous repast at table in one room, while the 
ladies had each a plate put into her hands as 
they pensively promenaded the ball-room dur- 
ing the absence of the favored lords of crea- 
tion, or seated themselves at the sides of the 
room, while sweetmeats, cakes, and creams were 
passed. This division of the company was not 
owing to absence of room, but simply because 
the gentlemen liked it better ! 

The " lamentable insignificance of American 
women " is another cause of frequent remark, 
and her description of the " day " of a Phila- 
delphia lady of the first class reads like a bit 
of ancient history, so entirely removed is it in 
all respects from the life of the " new woman " 
of to-day. Its chief event was attendance upon 
the Dorcas Society an assemblage of ladies 
provided with parings of broadcloth, ends of rib- 
bon, gilt paper and minikin pins, out of which

they manufactured pin-cushions, ink -wipers, 
and watch-cases. 

" Their talk is of priests and missions; of the profits 
of their last sale, of their hopes from the next; of the 
doubt whether young Mr. This or young Mr. That should 
receive the fruits of it to fit him out for Liberia ; of the 
very ugly bonnet seen at church on Sabbath morning, 
of the very handsome preacher who performed on Sab- 
bath afternoon, and of the very large collection made 
on Sabbath evening. This lasts till three, when the car- 
riage again appears, and the lady and her basket re- 
turn home; she mounts to her chamber, carefully sets 
aside her bonnet and its appurtenances, puts on her scal- 
loped black silk apron, walks into the kitchen to see that 
all is right, then into the parlour, where, having cast a 
careful glance over the table prepared for dinner, she 
sits down, work in hand, to await her spouse. He comes, 
shakes hands with her, spits, and dines. The conversa- 
tion is not much, and ten minutes suffice for dinner; 
fruit and toddy, the newspaper and the work-bag suc- 
ceed. In the evening the gentleman, being a savant, 
goes to the Wister society, and afterwards plays a snug 
rubber at a neighbour's. The lady receives at tea a 
young missionary and three members of the Dorcas so- 
ciety. And so ends her day." 

No wonder that the cultured Englishwoman 
found the women of America, although the 
handsomest in the world, the least attractive, 
if this was a fair sample of the occupations and 
interests of a woman of wealth in a large city ! 

But of all the customs of the country, the 
one to which she alludes of tenest and with great- 
est repugnance is " the incessant and remorse- 
less spitting of Americans." Alas, that this 
should also be the one respect in which Amer- 
ican manners can claim to have made the least 
improvement ! That men who profess to be 
gentlemen who are, in fact, gentlemen in 
all other respects can permit themselves the 
indulgence of a habit so disgusting, is a matter 
for continual surprise to the feminine mind. 
Not only smokers and chewers, not only the ill- 
bred, but refined and otherwise cleanly gentle- 
men do still, in cars, at theatres and public 
places, and even by the fireside, consider it per- 
missible to indulge in so objectionable a prac- 
tice ; and it is almost the one direction in which 
Mrs. Trollope could to-day note scarcely any 
gain in propriety and decency. 

Tobacco-chewing and whiskey-drinking must 
certainly have been much more common then 
than now, since Mrs. Trollope makes the sweep- 
ing assertion that, except among literary men, 
she never met any man who had escaped these 
degrading habits. But, also, she never met a 
literary man who had acquired these habits, 
which seems to indicate a greater distinction 
between men of different pursuits than any now 
existing. The native literature, however, did 
not elicit much praise ; the American reviews 



contained some clear-headed articles, but they 
were lacking in the playful vivacity and keenly- 
cutting satire which, in that day of the reign 
of " The Edinburgh " and " The Quarterly," 
was the standard of fine criticism. Neither in 
the writings or conversation of Americans was 
there any trace of that graceful familiarity of 
learned allusion and general knowledge which 
in Europe is to be heard in festive halls and 
gay drawing-rooms, as certainly as in the clois- 
tered library or student's quarters. Perhaps 
even to-day there is room for the same criticism 
and comparison with respect to conversation in 
polite circles. This subtle tone of a cultured so- 
ciety, which is as distant from pedantry as from 
ignorance, is not learning itself, but the effect 
of it. It is the last finish of highly finished soci- 
ety, and the conditions are seldom encountered. 
Mrs. Trollope was almost the first of the 
tribe with which we have since become so fa- 
miliar the tribe of English travellers, who, 
having spent a longer or shorter period in 
America, go home to make a book out of their 
" impressions." But, notwithstanding the lim- 
itations of which we have already spoken, she 
was better prepared than most of her succes- 
sors have been. Her knowledge of the country 
was gained by residence and personal contact ; 
she had spent almost as many years in the 
United States as some of her followers have 
spent months ; she was not a literary lion like 
Charles Dickens and Harriet Martineau ; and 
for her, therefore, the people whom she met 
were not her entertainers, and the society that 
she found was not consciously on show. She 
described what she saw with a woman's passion 
for detail, with all a woman's keen appreciation 
of personal description, and with a wealth of 
anecdote and illustration carefully garnered in 
the daily intercourse of nearly four years. 
Gifted with a singularly vivacious and pungent 
style, her book is still better worth reading than 
many of the newer works on the same subject.

THE OLD IJIGHT ON THE NEW PATH.* 
A monumental work on the history of owner-

terse style and orderly arrangement, the results 
of studies and researches that are almost ap-

palling in their magnitude. The author mod- 
estly claims, in the preface to her work, that 
its aim is simply " to enable the economic stu- 
dent to utilize the crumbs that have fallen 
already from the explorer's table." That eco- 
nomic facts should have significance, it is neces- 
sary that the student should know the society 
from whose workings the facts are educed. We 
have in these books a study of society as it ex- 
isted in that great domestic race which early 
reached civilization in Western Asia and in 
Northern Africa, and which still exists, a 
mighty power, in the Chinese Empire. 

The work is a marvel of condensed state- 
ment. In a review of reasonable length it is 
impossible to discuss either subject or treat- 
ment in any detail. At best we can only sketch 
the outline pursued, and aim to suggest its 
character and style. Miss Simcox starts from 
the proposition : 

" Egypt, Babylonia, and China are the three great 
seats of archaic civilization, and the ancient history of 
each is absolutely free from European influence. Two 
of them are remarkable for the permanence as well as 
for the antiquity of their national greatness; and all 
have left authentic records from which we are able to 
reconstruct, to some extent at least, the outline of their 
social and industrial life, and to understand upon what 
principles they regulated that portion of it which had 
to do with possessions, or the instruments by which life 
is maintained." 

Recognizing thus the importance of the ma- 
terial we possess for studying archaic civiliza- 
tion among these three nations, our author 
characterizes the people composing them : 

" The nations belonging to the group of which Egypt 
and China are representative are for the most part easy- 
going, pleasure-loving, and pacific, somewhat anarchic, 
in the strict sense of the word ; that is to say, private life 
in them is little controlled by government or legislation ; 
they are liberal in the sense that public opinion always 
praised giving more than getting, and required a free 
distribution of family property amongst the members 
of the household and of the State among such members 
of the State as were in need; and they were also very 
strongly conservative, since all classes valued their life 
just as it was, feeling and believing that any change at 
any point must be a change for the worse. If we have 
to find a single word to describe the points in which 
these States resemble each other and differ from the 
modern world, which traces its intellectual parentage 
to Greece and Rome, it may be said that the civilization 
of the great civilized States of Antiquity was domestic, 
and the civilization of the European States political." 

To gain a clear idea of the economic condi- 
tions of Ancient Egypt, Miss Simcox investi- 
gates the governmental structure ; the relation 
of ruler and officials to the people ; the condi- 
tions of commerce and industry ; class, religion, 
and priesthood ; and a wide range of kindred 



subjects. Some curious and suggestive thoughts 
are thus brought out. 

" The reason that there was so little progressive ac- 
cumulation of wealth in Egypt seems to have been that 
each generation spent its own savings on its own tombs 
and temples ; and this habit of dedicating surplus income 
to a comparatively disinterested, immaterial purpose 
helped to keep the greed for accumulation at the tem- 
perate point required for national security." 

On the whole, we must believe that the old 
Egyptians were a happy folk. " v The little 
people in the city are like the great ones,' 
i. e., have leisure to take part both in religious 
festivals and in the season's feasts." Honesty 
seems to have been prevalent, and, "failing 
other evidence, the solemn oath of an inter- 
ested party was admitted even in support of 
his own claim, and accepted as conclusive by 
the other side." " They are certainly the first 
of all the nations in the world to put on record 
the existence, and their appreciation of the ex- 
istence, of love in marriage." Woman was 
her husband's equal, and had remarkable free- 
dom of action. The Nile fertilized land was 
ever-productive, and native ingenuity had de- 
vised better irrigation systems than some which 
modern science has constructed in that same 
region. The ideas underlying such business 
contracts as antechresis are more humane and 
kind than those underlying our modern mort- 
gages. 

" The essence of an antichretic bargain is the exchange 
of use. The capitalist does not lend his money at interest, 
nor the landowner sell or let his land, but they exchange 
their two possessions pro tern., the use of the money being 
set against the use of the land. In this way the idea of 
ownership as distinct from use grew up easily and nat- 
urally, for the ownership might, and often did, continue 
for generations to belong to one family, while its use 
remained with another, without the right of the former, 
to reclaim the land by repaying the money, lapsing." 

Our author believes Egyptians, Babylonians, 
and Chinese to be scattered fragments from 
one primitive stock. Much of their character- 
istic civilization was acquired before their sep- 
aration. This went with them in their mi- 
grations. In their new homes, with varying 
conditions of life, further development went on 
independently, but the common fundamental 
portion lived on among all. Sumer, Akkad, 
Babylonia, Assyria, show much in common 
with Egypt, with much that is independent 
and original. A wonderful trading people, 
their weights and measures, the sexagesimal 
counting, and their science, influenced pro- 
foundly the ancient world. Their financial 
operations and business transactions were of 
the most varied kinds, and hundreds of their

records are preserved on clay tablets. We 
may read contracts and agreements, records of 
lawsuits, leases, mortgages, and gain a clear 
notion of their legal ideas. Antichresis sim- 
ple, or complicated with other forms of con- 
tract is found here also, as in fact wherever 
the domestic civilization was at home. As to 
domestic life, it seems to have been much like 
that of Egypt. Society was thoroughly devel- 
oped, conservative, healthy. The people were 
contented and happy. 

" This framework [of society] had been so patiently 
elaborated and coordinated, it was so elastic and at the 
same time so full of resistance, that even a foreign mas- 
ter found it more politic to preserve it and fall in with 
its ways than to destroy it; he was content in most cases 
to step into the place of the prince he had ousted. Af- 
fairs then fell into their accustomed groove, as soon as 
the conquest was complete; classes were reconstituted 
on their old bases; property and people took up their 
former conditions; the only difference lay in the fact 
that a new group of privileged individuals shared the 
wealth created by agricultural, industrial, and commer- 
cial activity. The sovereign and his chief officers might 
be of foreign race, but the social machine rolled on over 
the same road and with the same wheels as before." 

Our author presents evidence, drawn from 
monuments and inscriptions, as well as from 
curious survivals in modern culture, of the for- 
mer existence of the ancient domestic civiliza- 
tion over an area extending from Massalia to 
Malabar. The Phoenicians, Carthaginians, 
Etruscans, Lycians, Rhodians, Cretans, Spar- 
tans, old Arabians, Indians, and others, are 
either referred back to the old black-headed 
race or shown to have been influenced by it. 

Miss Simcox's second volume is devoted to 
the Chinese. It is a thoughtful study of the 
life and achievements of that mighty people, 
tracing the gradual evolution of ideas regard- 
ing property, society, and government. A na- 
tion which has existed for four thousand years, 
with authentic historical records for much of 
that long period, has much to teach the world. 
There are few problems in life but have pre- 
sented themselves to these " black-heads," and 
been solved to their satisfaction by them. In 
the solution no class in society has been sacri- 
ficed. Nowhere else is there so great a degree 
of comfort for all ; nowhere else is ideal society 
so nearly reached. Not that they are social- 
ists : every man seeks the best for himself, but 
in the seeking never forgets the rights of oth- 
ers. Property and labor have set values, and 
to underbid or overcharge to gain a personal 
advantage are equally reprobated. Opportu- 
nity for rational enjoyment is within the reach 
of all. Never warriors, seldom undertaking 



great military enterprises, they conquer their 
conquerors by civilizing and assimilating them. 
Paternal affection and filial respect prevail. 
Admiration for scholarship is universal, and a 
chance to attain the highest position through 
learning lies open to the meanest. 

Confucius says the essentials of government 
are "'Sufficiency of food, sufficiency of mili- 
tary equipment, and the confidence of the peo- 
ple in their ruler'; if one of these must be done 
without, let it be the military equipment ; if 
two must be sacrificed, part with the food, 
'from of old death has been the lot of all 
men,' but the foundation of the State is in the 
people's faith." 

Proverbs give the best hints of a people's 
inmost thought. A Chinese proverb runs : 
" When swords are rusty and spades bright, 
prisons empty and granaries full, the steps of 
the temples covered with mud and the courts 
of the tribunals filled with grass, doctors on 
foot and bakers on horseback, when old men 
and children abound, the empire is well gov- 
erned." 

The old black-headed race worked out the 
first known civilization, first built mighty cities, 
invented writing, made the great discoveries, 
solved the great problems of life, society, and 
human relations. From its story we might 
learn a lesson. That we should do things just 
as it did is as unnecessary as that we should 
try to compel its remaining fraction to do things 
in our way. But to have its life brought before 
us as Miss Simcox has presented it, may help 
us ; for that life has happily attained to many 
of the best things for which we strive.

Two GREAT VIRGINIANS.* 

It is not sheer accident that the two books 
named below are treated in a single article. 
They have many points in common besides the 
fact that they both belong to the same series. 
General Washington and General Lee were 
both Virginians. They both belonged to the 
social class that has mainly made the history 
of the Old Dominion. Their families were 
associated for several generations, and the two 
men were related by ties of marriage. They

had many intellectual and moral qualities in 
common. The one was the military leader in 
the first serious attempt to divide the English- 
speaking world politically, and the other in 
the only serious attempt to divide that world 
still farther. This is no identification of the 
causes for which the two men fought ; nor is it 
to say that Washington would have been called 
a rebel if he had failed, and that Lee would 
not have been so called had he succeeded. A 
further point of contact is that the two books 
are written by generals who won their titles in 
the Confederate Army. The two authors are 
further alike in this : that they make the chap- 
ters relating to the ancestry of their heroes too 
long ; and in this : that they lose no opportun- 
ity, Johnson as well as Lee, to say a good word 
for the cause in which they once hazarded their 
lives. 

General Johnson approaches his subject with 
the diffidence that is natural to a modest man 
who attempts such a task, when he reflects that 
" there are about five hundred biographies of 
George Washington, original and translations, 
published in almost every language of modern 
times, as well as Greek and Latin versions of 
them." Still, he plucks courage out of his be- 
lief that his own biography is " the first at- 
tempt to consider the military career of Wash- 
ington, and to write his life as a soldier." On 
the whole, it must be said that his attempt is 
very successful. There are not lacking features 
that deserve criticism. Ill sense of proportion 
is shown in the undue compression of some 
parts of the story, and the undue expansion of 
other parts. We have a very good account of 
Braddock's expedition ; but when the remnants 
of that expedition are brought back to the set- 
tlements, the writer passes immediately to the 
treaty entered into at the close of the war, and 
then adds to his chapter eight pages of mat- 
ter, all of it more or less interesting, but some 
of which should have made room for a rapid 
sketch of the later fortunes of the struggle, thus 
avoiding the abrupt transition experienced in 
passing from 1755 to 1763. This may serve 
as an illustration of the defective sense of pro- 
portion that is sometimes shown. We are not 
even told why Washington did not farther par- 
ticipate in the war. But, all defects aside, the 
author has made a careful study of his subject, 
and shows a clear and strong grasp of the mili- 
tary career and character of Washington, which 
he also presents in a plain, sensible, and vigor- 
ous style of composition. The book is a valuable 
contribution to the literature of its subject. 



General Fitzhugh Lee, as might be expected, 
writes of his hero, not only con amore, but con 
magna amore. To the high estimate in which 
General Lee's abilities, character, and achieve- 
ments are universally held, he adds the pride 
of a nephew, of a Confederate soldier, and of 
a Virginian. He dwells on his ancestry, re- 
counts the story of his life down to the Civil 
War, shows him to us as he stood deprecating 
the act of secession but resolved " to go with his 
State," and follows him through the four years' 
struggle, and then to the close of his life. Only 
a specialist could pronounce with confidence 
on the military aspects of the work, point by 
point ; but, on the whole, it is an interesting 
and valuable account of the great Confederate 
commander, doing full justice to his intellec- 
tual, moral, and professional character. Nearly 
every page, however, bears witness that the 
writer is less familiar with the pen than he is 
reputed to be with the sword. Rhetorical in- 
felicities abound, and grammatical errors occur. 
He dedicates the book to the memory of " the 
soldiers who fought and fell under the wave of 
Robert E. Lee's sword," etc. Generally, the 
narrative is clear and continuous ; but when, 
on the battle-field, the author sees " the red- 
crested wave of assault," beholds battalions 
" marching into the jaws of death " or re- 
coiling from " the mouth of hell," and hears 
the Southern guns " raining metallic tons " on 
the Northern infantry, while the cavalry are 
" stormed at with shot and shell," he becomes 
confused in his story and grows lurid in lan- 
guage. He has a habit of tagging out his sen- 
tences with bits of striking quotation. Gettys- 
burg was lost because Lee's orders were not 
obeyed. The official head of the offender, how- 
ever, did not " drop in the basket," owing to 
Lee's " great heart, or habit of self-denying for 
himself, self-suffering for others." The author 
does not apparently think whether so great a 
captain as he holds his hero to be would allow 
himself to be governed by such considerations. 
The last chapter, which is devoted to Lee's mil- 
itary character, we cannot think very satisfac- 
tory. Eminently worthy of being read is the 
portion of the book that deals with General 
Lee's connection with Washington and Lee 
University. The facts stated in connection with 
the trustees' tendering him the presidency, 
and his acceptance of the office, show clearly 
the financial condition of the institution at the 
time and also the financial condition of the 
whole Southern country at the close of the War.

STUDIES ix AMERICAN HISTORY.* 

Mr. Gold win Smith, in referring to Washington, 
says : " His form, like all other forms of the Rev- 
olution, has no doubt been seen through a golden 
haze of panegyric." The statement suggests a 
marked weakness in our methods of study of the 
formative days of the republic. When a writer tries 
to discuss ante-revolutionary times with cool consid- 
eration, looking at each question raised with the eye 
of the critic, there is a consciousness of uneasiness 
on the part of the readers, who are impatient of 
such methods in telling the life of people who have 
been surrounded so long with this halo of glory. 
Some of the suggestions of Professor Sumner in his 
chapters on " Social Features before the Revolution " 
in his little book on Alexander Hamilton, or of 
William B. Weeden in his " Economic and Social 
History of New England," certainly appeal with 
strength to the iconoclast of modern scientific meth- 
ods ; but the heresy creates no end of comment 
among those who have read only to glorify, and who 
cannot be brought to the point of believing that 
many of the heroic figures which loom so grandly 
in the twilight of the century are but images of com- 
mon clay. Americans have been trained to glorify, 
to cherish the memory only of that which appeals 
to the sentiment ; and, as a consequence, catch- 
phrases and high-sounding expressions have been 
incorporated into our history, to the exclusion of 
much that is fact. Putnam galloping down a hill, 
or Lawrence crying " Don't give up the ship," or 
Francis Marion eating sweet potatoes from off a 
log, or Thomas J. Jackson standing like a stone- 
wall, these are the pictures we have been encour- 
aged to preserve ; while the great mass of mankind, 
those who have had no fortune to make them par- 
ticularly conspicuous, have been almost entirely for- 
gotten. Mr. Greene, in his " Historical View of the 
American Revolution," gives lists of the general 
officers of the American army at various times dur- 
ing the Revolutionary War. Here and there a 
name attracts attention, but it is certainly true that 
many of the commanders have been entirely for- 
gotten ; and if it were not for some enthusiastic de- 
scendant, the achievements of a man like General

John Paterson would pass entirely into oblivion. 
There was real worth in a man of whom it could 
be said upon a memorial tablet placed in the meet- 
ing-house in Lenox: 

"He graduated at Yale College in 1762, represented 
Lenox in the Provincial Congress of 1774 and 1775, 
raised a regiment on his return in 1775, and was one 
of the first in the field with it after the battle of Lex- 
ington. He crossed the Delaware with Washington, 
and narrowly escaped death at Saratoga ; he was at the 
council of Monmouth in 1778, and fought in most of 
the battles of the Revolution, serving during the whole 
war, and was one of the founders of the society of the 
Cincinnati. His love of country was unbounded, his 
patriotism unflinching, and his public spirit untiring." 

The life of General Paterson, written by his great- 
grandson, tells many incidents of value to our early 
history; and there would be wonder at the neglect 
of so good a leader, if the " haze of panegyric " 
were not remembered. If indices are to be trusted, 
this general is mentioned neither by Bancroft nor 
Hildreth. There are several chapters which will 
be read more carefully than those that tell of the 
military life of the hero, the one on Shay's Rebellion 
being particularly valuable. Many features of social 
life find mention ; and despite the first impression, 
that it is only an offering of family love, the book 
will repay quite careful examination. It used to be 
said that a colonial Virginian would go ten miles 
any day to catch a horse to ride to town a mile dis- 
tant. General Paterson was somewhat different in 
temperament, apparently, because he used to walk 
eighteen miles to court, when he was county judge, 
rather than take the trouble to go to the pasture to 
catch his horse. He did not have a lazy bone in 
his six feet of frame, and seems to have been a good 
type of the stalwart pioneer of early days. 

If our historians have erred in allowing sentiment 
to get the advantage of fact in many instances, they 
just as certainly have been unfortunate in coloring 
with prejudice their accounts of some early religious 
troubles. It is results that tell ; and when the in- 
vasion of the Quakers, the anxiety about Ann 
Hutchison, and the banishment of Roger Williams 
are considered in the light of subsequent develop- 
ments, the student is forced to take different views 
than those that have prevailed so long, owing to the 
provincialism of the New England makers of our 
history. Mr. Straus shows Roger Williams in the 
true historic setting. In his earlier production, " The 
Origin of Republican Form of Government," he had 
declared of Roger Williams: "To him rightly be- 
longs the immortal fame of having been the first 
person in modern times to assert and maintain in 
its fullest plenitude the absolute right of every man 
to a ' full liberty in religious concernments,' and to 
found a state wherein this doctrine was the keystone 
of its organic laws." This thought, elaborated, 
makes up Mr. Straus's new book, " Roger Williams, 
the Pioneer of Religious Liberty." There is, of 
necessity, a good deal of religious controversy in the 
several chapters ; but the author presents many very

interesting facts to support his thesis, and these 
soften the asperities and make the volume readable 
and suggestive. There are many words of praise 
for the hero, but not too many. Unless one is very 
much biased by former historic training, there will 
be agreement with these two sentences: 

" We call those great who have devoted their lives 
to some noble cause, and have thereby influenced for 
the better the course of events. Measured by that 
standard, Roger Williams deserves a high niche in the 
temple of fame, alongside of the greatest reformers who 
mark epochs in the world's history." 

" The Making of the Ohio Valley States " is the 
fourth in the series of illustrated books in which Mr. 
Samuel Adams Drake is telling the story of the de- 
velopment of the United States. It follows the 
lines laid down in the former numbers, discussing 
subjects topically, and aiming to afford supplement- 
ary material to teachers and other readers who de- 
pend for the main facts upon ordinary school histo- 
ries. The arrow-head upon the cover is typical of the 
illustrations, which are very helpful in giving impres- 
sions of the varied features of life in the early days. 
The story is divided into three parts, descriptive of 
"The Conquest of the West," "The Advance into 
the West," and " The Progress of the West." The 
familiar tales of pioneer life are presented in pleas- 
ing form, and many matters to which it is not easy 
to refer in the ordinarily accessible books are ex- 
plained with sufficient clearness and completeness. 
Mr. Drake is always entertaining, and even the dull 
episodes of history reflect brighter colors when he 
paints -them. The motto of his series is, " Tell the 
Truth." Romancers have filled our histories with 
wonderful tales ; truth reveals many things stranger 
than any fiction. For the class of readers intended 
to be reached, there are no popular histories better 
than these ; because, by reference to authority, by 
supplementary foot-note, by illustration from local 
environment, Mr. Drake has stamped his narrative 
with the certificate of truthfulness. 

When Mr. Lodge, and other writers about Puri- 
tan days, attempt to lessen the measure of oppro- 
brium resting upon the people of Massachusetts for 
their share in the witchcraft delusion, mention is 
always made of the "pirates who had begun to in- 
fest the coast and disturb commerce." The pirates 
were everywhere in colonial times, the line of de- 
markation between a privateer and a pirate, a 
licensed fighter and a freebooter, being a very faint 
one indeed. Mr. Hughson, in his account of " The 
Carolina Pirates and Colonial Commerce," has made 
an exhaustive study of the situation along the coasts 
of the Carolinas, searching in many a nook and 
corner for facts, and making an apparently trivial 
part of American history seem quite important in 
the light of his interesting narrative. He rightly 
lays the blame for the existence of pirates upon the 
Navigation Acts. When the mother country at- 
tempted to compel the colonists to sell in a market 
where competition was prevented, the temptation 
was strong to cultivate the friendship of those who 



dared to risk violation of the law for the sake of 
possible gain. The conscience of the individual be- 
came stilled in the presence of commercial interest ; 
and if a violator were caught and brought to trial, 
it was more than likely that the solemn-faced jurors 
who heard the testimony were themselves gainers 
from the illegal trade. The richness of the Span- 
ish trade proved another very strong temptation to 
piracy, and there was little opposition to be feared 
from the mother country, because the downfall of 
Spanish supremacy on the sea meant the advance 
of England. The pirates were free livers ; they had 
many ways of scattering their ill-gotten gains, and 
public sentiment easily became corrupted, until 
many were perfectly willing to support the bucca- 
neers on the ground that piracy was a necessary 
evil which might as well as not be made to pay trib- 
ute to the community. Mr. Hughson offers us a 
curious study, especially if one think of it in con- 
nection with the words of Mr. Lecky, " The most 
serious evil of the colonies was the number and the 
force of the influences which were impelling large 
classes to violence and anarchy, brutalizing them by 
accustoming them to an unrestrained exercise of 
power, and breaking down among them that salu- 
tary respect for authority which lies at the root of 
all true national greatness." 

Piracy and smuggling Mr. Lecky regards as in- 
fluences of this kind ; and he classes with them the 
corrupting power of slavery and with the treat- 
ment of the Indians by the colonists. The stand- 
point of the pioneers on the border was always 
vastly different from that of those remote from the 
. presence of the redskins. In " General Joseph Mar- 
tin and the War of the Revolution in the West," 
Professor Weeks tells the story of the fighting with 
the Cherokees, who, instigated by the British, made 
life a burden to the people of the Southwest. Gen- 
eral Martin was especially skilled in Indian diplo- 
macy, and rendered very effective service to the 
American cause, quieting the savages on many oc- 
casions when their added opposition would have 
been disastrous, as, for example, in the King's 
Mountain campaign. Mr. Weeks gives a good ac- 
count of the organization of the State of Franklin, 
in which matter General Martin opposed Sevier 
and the other so-called commonwealth-builders. He 
was a sturdy upholder of the authority of the gov- 
ernment at all times, and only one versed in West- 
ern lore can appreciate all that is meant by such a 
statement. If, as George Washington used to de- 
clare, Lord Dunmore made treaties with the In- 
dians, in 1775, with the possibility of independence 
of the colonies in mind, hoping in the wilderness 
to set up obstacles in the way of the new govern- 
ment, the work of a pioneer leader like Martin is 
to be more praised, when tested by the true rule of 
results. A man six feet in height, weighing over 
two hundred pounds, never sick in his life, he was 
a type of the hardy pioneer, to whose indomitable 
perseverance and unflinching bravery the United 
States owes so much.

[Dec. 16, 



For the adequate tribute to these pioneers, mate- 
rial is being gathered by many hands. Their study 
is in more than one way peculiar. There was a 
restlessness about them which made them impatient 
of restraint ; they were men of great strength, of 
will as well as of sinew ; they feared no foe ; they 
were absolutely essential to the winning of the West. 
Mr. Theodore Roosevelt has few equals in delineat- 
ing their character. His volume on "The Found- 
ing of the Trans- Allegheny Commonwealths" covers 
the seven years immediately following the Revolu- 
tion. Many people are inclined to put so much into 
the idea of " manifest destiny " that they have ex- 
treme difficulty in understanding writers who show 
how the West had to be won. Writing to Benja- 
min Harrison in 1784, Washington declared his be- 
lief that "The Western States stand, as it were, 
upon a pivot. The touch of a feather would turn 
them any way." Jefferson saw the same thing, 
when he informed Madison, in 1787 : " When we 
consider the temper of the people of that country, 
derived from the circumstances which surround 
them, we must suppose their separation possible at 
every moment." Mr. Roosevelt shows us what these 
circumstances were. 

" North and south of the valley lay warlike and pow- 
erful Indian confederacies, now thoroughly alarmed and 
angered by the white advance ; while behind these war- 
rior tribes, urging them to hostility, and furnishing 
them the weapons and means wherewith to fight, stood 
the representatives of two great European nations, both 
bitterly hostile to the new America, and both anxious to 
help in every way the red savages who strove to stem 
the tide of settlement." 

There were three tasks to be done by the winners 
of the West, tasks to be accomplished under pain of 
utter failure. 

" It was their duty to invade and tame the shaggy 
wilderness; to drive back the Indians and their Euro- 
pean allies; and to erect free governments which should 
form parts of the indissoluble Union." 

In showing how these three results were brought 
about, Mr. Roosevelt deals with the important ques- 
tions connected with the inrush of settlers, the In- 
dian wars, the navigation of the Mississippi, the 
state of Franklin, the development of Kentucky, 
the organization and settlement of the Northwest 
Territory, and the Indian troubles in the South- 
west. One has difficulty in commenting where there 
is so much good, but there certainly is a great deal 
of value to be attached to the characterizations of 
the pioneers who came into the West in such num- 
bers after the Revolution, at first the hunter- 
trapper ; then the hunter-settler, who soon became 
cramped for room as population increased, and so 
moved on to a more remote part ; then the perma- 
nent pioneer, who came resolved to stay and make 
a home ; and, here and there, a fourth class, com- 
posed of sons of prominent families, the gentry of 
the new territory. These pioneers were not gifted 
with much learning of the books, but they spoke 
with authority. One wrote to the Indians : 



" You will compell ous to retaliate, which will be a 
grate pridgedes to your nation." 

" He did not spell well," remarks our author, " but 
his meaning was plain, and his hand was known to 
be heavy." 

The British come in for well-deserved criticism for 
their holding of the Western posts so long, and for 
the part they played in trying to check the advance 
of civilization, the sinister influence of the fur-trade 
being again brought to notice. The importance of 
the waterways is clearly shown, the navigation ques- 
tion, with its various accompanying schemes, being 
fully discussed. The reader rather enjoys the clear 
statement of the truth about General James Wilkin- 
son, who usually has had the good fortune to get off 
too easily, when handled by our writers. 

" In character he can only be compared to Benedict 
Arnold, though he entirely lacked Arnold's ability and 
brilliant courage. He had no conscience and no scruples ; 
he had not the slightest idea of the meaning of the word 
honor; he betrayed his trust from the basest motives, 
and he was too inefficient to make his betrayal effective. 
He was treacherous to the Union while it was being 
formed and after it bad been formed; and his crime 
was aggravated by the sordid meanness of his motives, 
for he eagerly sought opportunities to barter his own 
infamy for money. In all our history there is no more 
despicable character." 

There is enough of the romantic in the stories which 
are scattered through Mr. Roosevelt's volume to 
keep up the interest of the careless reader ; while 
the clear statements about controverted questions 
of our Western history will attract the student, who 
is sometimes bewildered, as he tries to work his way 
through the labyrinth, confused by the persuasive- 
ness of the descendant of this hero or that, who 
would keep him from the silken thread that would 
lead him to the centre of the maze. 

A vindication of anyone has few charms to Amer- 
ican readers. Truth cannot easily overtake a lie, 
and popular biographers have a great influence in 
creating general impressions. Mr. Charles Henry 
Lee, the author of " Arthur Lee as seen in History," 
had therefore an unpleasant task in undertaking to 
refute certain charges made by influential writers 
against a member of his distinguished family. It 
was unfortunate that Lee did not get along with 
Franklin, for the position of our ministers abroad 
during the Revolution at best was anything but 
enviable. The strictest harmony would have been 
desirable. Mr. Lee endeavors, by quoting from 
official documents and extensive correspondence, to 
show that the career of Arthur Lee was creditable 
to himself and to the government, and that after 
his return home he remained a distinguished and 
trusted citizen of the Old Dominion. 

With one exception, each of the books that have 
been mentioned deals in some way with the Revo- 
lution, thus calling our attention again to the many- 
sided nature of that great struggle for American 

independence.

THE DIAL 



HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 



ii. 

Resuming, and concluding, our necessarily gen- 
eral survey of the current Holiday Publications, we 
may begin with a notably elegant and artistic publica- 
tion Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co.'s quarto vol- 
ume containing twelve favorite " Border Ballads," 
illustrated with twelve etchings by C. 0. Murray, 
and prefaced with an Introductory Essay by (why 
say it?) Mr. Andrew Lang. Mr. Murray's designs 
are equally well conceived and executed, showing 
a finish and feeling, and a conscientious effort to 
catch and render the finer spirit and distinctive 
aroma of the several pieces, that lift them out of 
the level of ordinary book-illustration. While every 
ballad-lover will necessarily miss in the present col- 
lection a prime personal favorite or two, the selec- 
tions are well made, and are fairly representative 
of the more serious and romantic order of ballads. 
Mr. Lang's Introduction is sober, pithy, and to the 
point. He has treated his subject from the anti- 
quarian and historical side, abstaining from "sign- 
post criticism," and judiciously leaving to the artist 
the pictorial aspects of the text. 

Another notable art-book is Messrs. Porter & 
Coates's new two-volume edition of Miss Zimmern's 
translation of De Amicis's "Holland." The pic- 
torial feature of the work is forty-four full-page 
photogravures, after views taken in Holland espe- 
cially for it by Dr. Charles L. Mitchell, who has, 
as usual, shown no less skill with his camera than 
taste in his choice of subjects. The volumes are 
finely bound in red cloth stamped with the national 
tulip, and each is encased in a stout slip-cover. An 
excellent map is a feature for which careful readers 
will be truly thankful. De Amicis's work is one of 
the most fascinating books of travel ever written, 
and as a familiar pen-picture of Holland and the 
Hollanders of to-day it has no peer in any language. 
Apart from its literary charm, it may serve as a 
larger guide-book; and, in short, no judicious trav- 
eller nowadays visits Holland without first resorting 
to De Amicis. The one thing lacking in the pres- 
ent edition is an index. 

A work that will doubtless prove a favorite with 
seekers of the more substantial and elegant gift- 
books is Canon Farrar's fine volume on " The Life 
of Christ as Represented in Art" (Macmillan). 
The scope and aim of the work are well indicated 
in the title. Canon Farrar disclaims in his preface 
the intention of intruding " upon the functions of 
the art critic," or even of attempting an art history, 
in the stricter sense of the term. " This book has 
not," he says, " been written from love of art, deep 
as my love of art is, but because I wished to illus- 
trate the thoughts about religion, and especially 
about our Saviour Jesus Christ, of which art has 
eternized the ever-varying phases." Touching his 
theme but secondarily on its technical and purely 
aesthetic sides, the author has regarded the works 



of Christian art mainly as spiritual documents which 
show the religious tone and attitude of different 
periods, and indicate the great phases of religious 
thought which have changed and are changing from 
age to age. At the same time, Canon Farrar shows 
himself deeply penetrated with a sense of the beauty 
and majesty of the masterpieces he describes, and 
of the gifts and acquirements of their makers ; and 
his readers will not fail to find their own art en- 
thusiasms and appreciations enhanced and refined 
by his eloquent pages. The examples are drawn 
largely from the great Italian works of the four- 
teenth and fifteenth centuries the Dutch, German, 
and Flemish schools being referred to less frequently, 
and the Spanish painters, except Velasquez, scarcely 
at all. The volume, a large, beautifully printed 
octavo, is profusely and artistically illustrated with 
one hundred and sixty engravings in the text and 
twenty-three full-page plates, thus presenting a com- 
plete pictorial history of the changing conceptions 
of Christ and of the central incidents in his life. 

Lovers of athletics (and their name is now legion 
in America) will find their special holiday account 
in Mr. Caspar W. Whitney's liberally-illustrated 
volume, " A Sporting Pilgrimage " (Harper). Mr. 
Whitney went to England, the athlete's Mecca, ex- 
pressly to watch the Britisher at play on his own 
soil, study his sporting systems and traditions, and 
report thereupon for the behoof of ambitious ama- 
teurs at home. The present volume the text of 
which has already, we think, appeared serially in 
" Harper's Magazine " and " Harper's Weekly " 
is the literary outcome of the trip. Mr. Whitney 
seems to have seen in England about everything 
worth seeing in the line of out-door sports hunt- 
ing, golf, cycling, university and club rowing, track 
athletics, football, cricket, etc.; and he describes 
what he saw with the zest of an enthusiast and 
the point and clearness of an expert. Touching 
the prevalence of the sporting spirit in England, 
Mr. Whitney quotes the following curious challenge 
from the advertisement columns of a London daily 
paper : " Mr. Furniss will sing a linnet against a 
linnet, one in the mouth, an home-and-home race, 
for 2 a side. A match can be made by calling at 
the Elephant and Castle, Orchard Street, Westmin- 
ster, any evening after eight P.M." The publishers 
have made the volume a very attractive one artist- 
ically and mechanically. 

We shall congratulate in advance those who shall 
find among their holiday gifts the two bound vol- 
umes now ready of " European Architecture " (Chi- 
cago: Smith & Packard), a really artistic monthly 
publication of ten photogravure illustrations, that 
bids fair to become as well known to cultivated peo- 
ple generally as it already is to professional archi- 
tects. The views in the present volumes are drawn 
almost entirely from France and Italy ; and for 
prospective tourists to those countries they form the 
best possible pictorial preparative for an intelligent 
enjoyment of their architectural treasures. Profes-

sional taste and judgment have, of course, been em- 
ployed in the choice of subjects ; and these comprise 
a great variety of buildings and sections of build- 
ings, interiors and exteriors, fine facades, doorways, 
capitals, and architectural details generally, tombs, 
monuments, bas-reliefs, wrought-iron work, etc. Col- 
lectors of this class of foreign photographs will thank 
the present publishers for a royal road, easy, short, 
and comparatively inexpensive, to the object of their 
desires. The plates, each about 7x9, are finely 
printed on 9^x12 bond paper, and bound in soft 
covers. A stout tied portfolio encloses both volumes, 
making an ensemble at once elegant and convenient, 
and suitable for library or parlor. 

Hilda Gamlin's " Life and Art of George Rom- 
ney " ( Macmillan) is an interesting account of that 
admirable artist, of whom little has been generally 
known hitherto, save that he was a contemporary 
of Reynolds, and once bade fair to share the honors 
of the town with that prince of portrait painters. 
" There are," said Lord Chancellor Thurlow, " two 
factions in art, and I am of the Romney faction." 
Strange to say, Sir Joshua, who, as Johnson said, 
" hated no one living," seems to have at least dis- 
liked Romney. He used to speak of him slightingly 
as " the man in Cavendish square " though prob- 
ably this only recorded lapse of a courtesy that 
was proof even against Johnson's bearishness was 
really due not so much to personal jealousy as 
to Romney's persistent refusal to exhibit at the 
Royal Academy. In one respect Romney had an 
undeniable advantage over his great rival, and over 
Gainsborough: in the durability of his pigments. 
Sir Joshua's " flying colors " were proverbial in his 
own day ; and a hundred years ago it was com- 
plained that he made his pictures die before the 
sitter. "Reynolds filled the halls of England," 
says Mr. Ruskin, "with the ghosts of her noble 
Squires and Dames," but, alas! one may add, 
they are now too many of them the ghosts of ghosts. 
Romney's colors, on the contrary, seem as fresh and 
solid to-day as when they were laid on ; and that he 
was not hopelessly behind Reynolds in grace and 
invention, in the art of making his portraits true 
pictures as well as mere likenesses, is attested by 
the many charming plates in the present volume. 
Miss Gamlin's book is a timely one. There is just 
now a revival of Romney's popularity ; and we learn 
that at a recent exhibition at the Grafton Gallery 
of portraits of fair women there were twenty-one 
of his canvasses, against nineteen of Sir Joshua's. 
Again, as in their own day, is London divided on 
the question of their rival merits, the scales of pop- 
ularity being pretty evenly balanced. The volume 
is produced in fairly good shape, and the eighteen 
full-page illustrations lend it the conventional hol- 
iday flavor. 

It is surprising that so piquant and tempting a 
book as the " Memoirs of the Duchesse de Gon- 
taut" should have so long escaped the translators. 
The French original was published in 1853 ; and 



the first English version is now issued in two rather 
elaborate volumes by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 
Mme. de Gontaut's reminiscences range from the clos- 
ing days of the old regime, through the revolutionary 
and Napoleonic eras and the first and second res- 
torations, to the reign of Louis Philippe. Born in 
1773, she saw as a child the waning splendors of 
Old France quenched in the chaos that heralded 
the drama of the Terror the courtly gayeties of 
Versailles merging with startling swiftness in her 
earlier memories into the mad carmagnoles and 
orgies of revolutionary Paris. "Les aristocrates h la 
lanterne ! " was a familiar and terrifying cry in her 
childish ears ; and she recalls, as some grim night- 
mare, the raging mobs from the Faubourg Saint 
Antoine pouring through the Paris streets, shouting, 
dancing, and singing, reeking with blood and wine, 
the men disguised as nuns, the women as Capuchin 
monks, " loaded with booty, and in a state of ex- 
citement and intoxication frightful to witness." In 
1792 Mme. de Gontaut's parents joined the ranks 
of the emigres, and she accompanied them to Hol- 
land, and, a year later, to England, where they re- 
mained until the first restoration. After the acces- 
sion of Louis XVIII. she was appointed governess 
to the royal children ; and from that time up to 
1836, where the Memoir closes, she was in close 
touch with the reigning family and its immediate 
entourage. The book is entertaining throughout, 
light, pleasantly discursive the retrospect of a 
bright and cheery old lady of eighty, who has seen 
the great world and been of it, and yields to the 
entreaties of her friends to tell the story of her long 
and eventful life. " One can hardly be expected," 
says Mme. de Gontaut, " to write well at eighty." 
Certainly not so well, the reader is likely to add, as 
Mme. de Gontaut has written. The publishers have 
issued the work in good shape, and the twelve por- 
traits are attractive and interesting. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons publish, in form 
generally similar to their small folio editions of 
" Marse Chan " and " Meh Lady," Mr. Thomas Nel- 
son Page's " Polly," with six illustrations by A. Cas- 
taigne. " Polly " is a sentimental tale of rural life 
in Virginia " befo' the wah," a literary province in 
which the author reigns supreme. The story has the 
usual local flavor of mint juleps, bluster, " darkey " 
dialect, pinchbeck chivalry, and the Old Dominion 
generally, and Mr. Page paints his characters with 
a fidelity that makes one wonder the more at his 
predilection for their uncouth and unlovely proto- 
types. Mr. Castaigne's drawings range from fair 
to indifferent. 

The drift of Mr. Horace E. Scudder's little book, 
"Childhood in Literature and Art " (Houghton), 
is manifest in the title. Beginning with the classic 
prototypes Astyanax and the young Ascanius, Mr. 
Scudder traces the long line of childish figures in 
the art and letters of different times and peoples, 
down to the Paul Dombeys and little Pearls of our 
own day. The theme is gracefully treated ; and Mr.

Scudder adds some useful observations on literature 
for children a topic on which he is specially qual- 
ified to speak. 

" Hoofs, Claws, and Antlers " (Frank S. Thayer, 
Denver) is the sufficiently striking title of a novel 
and interesting publication which is throughout a 
product of the Far West, and a very creditable one. 
The book, a flat quarto, full gilt, printed on thin 
boards, contains thirty-six large half-tone pictures 
of wild game in their native haunts, reproduced 
from photographs taken by Mr. and Mrs. A. G. 
Wallihan. The unique merit of these plates lies in 
the fact that the creatures are shown each in its 
normal state and habitat; Mr. Wallihan, in taking 
his " snap shots " simply substituting the Kodak for 
the deadly Winchester. The following account of 
one of his minor photographic "bags" may serve 
to indicate his modus operandi in securing the neg- 
atives (at best a most ticklish undertaking), as well 
as the peculiar value of the finished results. " I had," 
says Mr. Wallihan, " waited long and patiently one 
morning, when I saw the gleam of the sun on a pair 
of horns through the cedars. With nerves all of a 
tremor I waited to see if he (the deer) would keep 
on the trail he was on, which passed about sixty 
feet from me ; but no he turns directly toward 
me and comes panting down the trail until within 
sixty feet, when I bleated like a fawn, at which he 
instantly stopped, with his mouth wide open, as he 
had evidently been running and was very fat. The 
click of my shutter told me that I had his shadow 
hard and fast, so when he had looked and I had 
admired him as much as I liked, I moved my hand 
and he was gone almost like magic." The picto- 
rial result of this operation is a really noble bit of 
realism. At the foot of a gentle declivity, ridged 
with rocks and scrubby cedars, stands the stag with 
upthrown head and branching antlers, alert, startled, 
snuffing danger and quivering with sudden alarm 
a true lord of the glen. Landseer or Rosa Bon- 
heur never chose a finer motif. Other plates show 
us as in a mirror picturesque groups of deer, ante- 
lope, and bison, Rocky Mountain goats, many of 
them taken near at hand, a treed cougar, a brace of 
bears foraging in a berry-patch, a bull elk, a lone 
coyote " out for a breakfast," a colony of prairie- 
dogs and owls, a monstrous rattlesnake coiled and 
ready to strike, etc., the realism of each picture be- 
ing enhanced by the stretch of wild Colorado scenery 
which forms its setting. The book contains portraits 
of Mr. and Mrs. Wallihan, together with their own 
brief and modest account of their lives, and of the 
way in which some of the more notable negatives 
were obtained. Mr. Theodore Roosevelt furnishes a 
warmly commendatory preface; and we join him 
in wishing so fresh and informing a work the suc- 
cess it deserves. 

The elaborate and cumbersome edition of John 
Anster's metrical translation of Part I. of Goethe's 
" Faust," with illustrations by Mr. Frank M. Greg- 
ory and an introduction by Burdett Mason, first 



issued in 1888, is now reprinted, with some changes, 
in a convenient octavo by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & 
Co. All of Mr. Gregory's main designs, thirty- 
eight in number, are given, considerably reduced, 
in the new edition the original eighteen colored 
aquarelles being replaced by tinted photogravures. 
The text is clearly printed on moderately-glazed 
paper, and the volume altogether makes a good ap- 
pearance. Dr. Anster's version is one of the good 
ones that of the Second Part almost the best ex- 
tant. Some of Mr. Gregory's drawings, notably 
the frontispiece and " The Fountain," are graceful 
and pretty ; but he is, on the whole, plainly over- 
weighted with his theme. 

A beautiful and instructive art-work that should 
find especial favor with holiday buyers is " Raphael's 
Madonnas" (Macmillan), by Karl K^roly, author 
of "A Guide to the Paintings of Florence." The 
pictorial features of the work comprise fifty-three 
illustrations, including nine photogravures, after 
Raphael ; and these have been in all cases made 
directly from the paintings themselves, and not 
from reproductions. Each plate is concisely de- 
scribed and characterized, and the author has added 
a brief life of Raphael and an index to his works. 

An attractive little volume of " Old English Songs " 
("old but choicely good," as Walton said), illus- 
trated with much humor by Hugh Thomson, is issued 
by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. Each verse is printed 
by itself, and is faced by the illustration it suggests. 
There are ten titles, including " Coridon's Song " 
and " The Angler's Song " from " The Complete 
Angler," " Come Sweet Lass," " A Journey to Exe- 
ter," "Sir Dilberry Diddle," etc.; and Mr. Austin 
Dobson furnishes an introduction, which he felici- 
tously describes as " somewhat invertebrate and 
inconclusive." 

" A Girl I Know " (Knight) appears at first sight 
a book of verses and illustrative drawings of the con- 
ventional type. But closer examination reveals the 
fact that the pictures are not fanciful sketches, but 
photogravure reproductions from actual negatives, 
made by Mrs. N. Gray Bartlett. They all repre- 
sent the same maiden, but her surroundings are 
widely varied, and show many aspects of rural life. 
Mrs. Bartlett's standing as an amateur photog- 
rapher is a sufficient warrant for the taste displayed 
in pose and setting, and the result is, in many cases, 
strikingly artistic. As for the verses by Miss Marian 
L. Wyatt, they are evidently written up to the pic- 
tures, and will serve, although in no way remarkable. 

The new six-volume edition of the novels of Susan 
Edmonstone Ferrier is a welcome addition to the 
series of exquisite reprints sent to us from time to 
time by Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. Mr. R. Brim- 
ley Johnson writes the introduction, and Miss Nelly 
Ericksen prepares the drawings, reproduced in pho- 
togravure, three to a volume. A group of Miss 
Ferrier's letters acceptably supplements the bio- 
graphical and critical introductory matter. Thus 
equipped for a fresh career, these novels of the lesser

Jane Austen ought to take a fresh lease of life, and 
they are, on the whole, worth the pains that have 
been taken, by publishers, editor, and artist, to make 
them attractive. " Marriage," " Destiny," and " The 
Inheritance " are the titles. 

Our readers are already sufficiently familiar with 
the form and merits of Messrs. Little, Brown, & 
Co.'s excellent Library Edition of Victor Hugo's 
Romances, which now reaches an opportune con- 
clusion with two new volumes "Hans of Iceland," 
and " ' Bug-Jargal,' ' Claude Gueux,' and ' The 
Last Day of a Condemned.' " Thus complete, the 
set will commend itself to seekers of the more sub- 
stantial and standard class of holiday gifts. 

We have previously referred to the completion 
of the "Ariel" Shakespeare (Putnam), in forty 
volumes, but should add that it is published not only 
in the full-leather style of our description, but also 
in garnet cloth, at a very moderate price. In the 
latter form it closely resembles the "Temple" 
Shakespeare (Macmillan), to the nine volumes of 
which already mentioned there are now added two 
others "As You Like It" and "The Taming of 
the Shrew." Either of these editions would make 
a holiday gift of the most acceptable sort. 

Few as have been the books issued by Mr. Thomas 
B. Mosher, they have been so artistically planned 
and so distinctive in their individuality as to win 
for their publisher a warm place in the affections 
of the book-lover. Not long ago we had occasion 
to praise the two new volumes of the "Bibelot" 
series, and we now have .occasion to give thanks for 
a still choicer gift the sonnet-sequence of Mr. Rob- 
ert Bridges on " The Growth of Love." Practically 
inaccessible hitherto (only one hundred copies hav- 
ing been privately issued from Mr. Daniel's Oxford 
press), the four hundred copies of Mr. Mosher's ex- 
quisite reprint quintuple at one stroke the poet's 
audience. An essay on the poetry of Mr. Bridges, 
by that rising English critic Mr. Lionel Johnson, 
here serves as an introduction, and is reprinted 
from the " Century Guild Hobby Horse " of Octo- 
ber, 1891. We may also, in this connection, refer 
readers wishing further critical aid to Professor 
Dowden's appreciation of the poet in " The Fort- 
nightly Review " of last July. The reprint now be- 
fore us is uniform in style with Mr. George Mere- 
dith's " Modern Love " and Thomson's " The City 
of Dreadful Night," for the latter of which volumes 
we expressed our gratitude nearly two years ago. 

A person of scholarly and artistic tastes com- 
bined would find gratification in the volume, at once 
substantial and elegant, entitled " Life in Ancient 
Egypt " (Macmillan), a translation, by Helen Mary 
Tirard, of Adolf Erman's " ^gypten." The need 
of a popular yet accurate and fairly comprehensive 
work on the manners and customs of the ancient 
Egyptians has long been felt by English readers ; 
and the present volume supplies it. Herr Erman 
confines himself to the historical periods known as 
the Old, the Middle, and the New Empires, draw- 



ing freely upon Lepsius's " Denkmaler" and "The 
London Select Papyri " for his text, and upon Wil- 
kinson's " Manners and Customs," the " Denkmaler," 
and Perrot-Chipiez's " L'Histoire de L'Art," for his 
illustrations. Of the latter, there are four hundred 
cuts set in the text and eleven full-page plates ; and 
these, studied in connection with the animated and 
minutely-graphic narrative, serve to convey a good 
impression of the way the ancient Egyptian, of 
whatever degree or occupation, pursued his daily 
round. Herr Erman informs his English readers 
that while certain alterations might be wrought into 
his work to bring it into nicer accord with the re- 
sults of later research, he feels that such changes 
would only affect details, and not the general scope 
of his book. Students of special topics of Egypt- 
ology will of course need to consult special text- 
books ; but for readers who desire to pursue the 
study as a branch of general culture, Herr Erman's 
work should prove all-sufficient. There is a good 
map, an abundance of notes and references, and an 
index ; and the volume altogether is an excellent 
piece of book-making. The scholarly work of the 
translator calls for special praise. 

Those who desire to gain a good general knowl- 
edge of astronomy without going too deeply into the 
science will find in Mr. J. Ellard Gore's translation 
of M. Camille Flammarion's " Popular Astronomy " 
(Appleton) a work precisely suited to their needs. 
It is handsomely produced, and liberally, and with 
one or two exceptions satisfactorily, illustrated. M. 
Flammarion is the most popular scientific writer in 
France, and no fewer than a hundred thousand 
copies of the present work have been sold there. The 
book gained the Montyon prize of the French Acad- 
emy, and it has been selected by the Minister of 
Education for use in the public libraries a good 
test of its suitability for popular reading. Mr. Gore's 
translation is as idiomatic as it was possible to make 
it without sacrificing accuracy, and he has added 
notes as to recent researches and discoveries, which 
fairly bring the text up to date. 

Mr. J. Hampden Porter's "Wild Beasts " (Scrib- 
ner) presents in separate chapters, with a photo- 
graphic plate in each, studies of the characters and 
habits of the elephant, lion, leopard, panther, jaguar, 
tiger, puma, wolf, and grizzly bear. Mr. Porter is 
well up in the literature of his subject, and he has 
made a good and readable compilation of facts in 
natural history, hunting stories, illustrative anec- 
dotes, etc. 

Hair, as Thomas Howell observes, " is but an 
excrementitious thing." It has been, nevertheless, 
a prime object of female solicitude from the re- 
motest ages ; and the late Mr. Theodore Child, in 
his treatise on the coiffure, " Wimples and Crisping 
Pins" (Harper), places hair-dressing at the head 
of the decorative arts, " inasmuch as its function is 
to adorn the most perfect of nature's works, the 
head of woman." Mr. Child disclaims in his pre- 
face any notion of competing with the technical

treatises of practical professors of this great art. 
He is simply the gentleman amateur who has made 
a study, from the outside, of its history and chef- 
d'ceuvres; and he writes with the "special object 
of calling attention to the wealth of example and 
suggestion contained in the paintings and sculptures 
of past ages, and of thus setting forth indirectly 
the principles and conditions upon which beautiful 
coiffure and ornament depend." With this view, 
he has studied (from the hair-dresser's standpoint) 
the bas-reliefs, statues, and pictures of different 
times and countries ancient Egypt, Asia, classic 
Greece and Rome, mediaeval Florence and Venice, 
the Eighteenth Century, etc. The text is liberally 
strewn with illustrations from these sources ; and 
these offer a rich variety of suggestions as to the 
arrangement of the hair and its ornamentation, 
which ladies of an adaptive turn might put to good 
account. 

"A Hilltop Summer" (Lee & Shepard) is the 
collective title of a sheaf of clever newspaper 
sketches of village life, by Alyn Yates Keith, re- 
printed from the New York " Evening Post." Hill- 
top is a very out-of-the-way place indeed ; and the 
author seems to have been the first "summer 
boarder" to exploit its bucolic attractions, set the 
tongues of its gossips a-wagging, and startle its 
sleepy little postoffice out of the rural repose of 
a-letter-a-week into the metropolitan activity of a 
letter daily. The papers show a pleasant vein of 
humor, and a touch of literary quality that warrants 
their appearance between covers. The text is in- 
dented with a number of pretty vignettes. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s modest and tasteful 
volume of " Faber's Hymns " contains about all this 
favorite religious poet's noteworthy pieces. The 
hymns are established favorites of the whole Chris- 
tian world without distinction of sect ; and the pres- 
ent collection is a representative one. There are 
fifty illustrations, of varying degrees of merit, by 
Mr. L. J. Bridgman, and a biographical sketch by 
Mr. N. H. Dole. The cover of white and gold is 
especially attractive and delicate. 

Tennyson's " Becket " is published by Messrs. 
Dodd, Mead & Co. in a rather showy duodecimo 
volume, with a cover of pale green cloth richly 
stamped with episcopal emblems. The text is clearly 
printed on rather thick glazed paper, and there are 
a number of clever drawings and decorations in 
wash, by Mr. F. C. Gordon. The same publishers 
issue in four tiny volumes, boxed together, Paul 
Heyse's ever-popular ghost tales, " The House of 
the Unbelieving Thomas," " Mid-Day Magic," "The 
Fair Abigail," and "The Forest Laugh." The 
translator is Frances A. Van Santford, and the illus- 
trator is Alice C. Morse. The little set makes a 
tempting show and should not go begging. 

An attractive little book for young readers or old 
is "The Fables of ^Esop" (Macmillan), selected, 
re-worded, and historically traced by Joseph Jacobs, 
and illustrated by Joseph Heighway. It is pretty 



difficult to say just what are and what are not the 
fables of ^Esop almost all the fables that have ap- 
peared in the Western world having at one time or 
another found shelter under the shadow of that am- 
ple name. Indeed, the great fabulist himself is so 
spectral a personality that one might almost be for- 
given for holding, in respect to him, the shocking 
heresy of Mrs. Betsy Prig. Among the apologues 
attributed to him, however, a certain number stand 
out as the most telling and familiar ; and these Mr. 
Jacobs has brought together in the present volume, 
re-wording them as compactly and pointedly as pos- 
sible, and tacking to the end of each its appropriate 
moral. A short history of the JEsopic fable is pre- 
fixed to the volume, and there are abundant notes. 
The volume is a pretty one outwardly, and Mr. 
Heighway's drawings are strong, bold, and quaintly 
humorous. 

Scottish sympathies, American sympathies, and 
Scottish- American sympathies will equally find their 
poetical account in the pretty and freely illustrated 
volume of "Wayside Poems" (Harper), by that 
pleasant versifier, Mr. Wallace Bruce. Mr. Bruce 
is already known to readers on both sides of the 
Atlantic through his " Old Homestead Poems," a 
work that will doubtless pave the way to popularity 
for its successor. Mr. Bruce's themes are mostly fa- 
miliar, his sentiment rings true, and his numbers 
are easy and fluent. Many of the pieces in the pres- 
ent collection were inspired by the incidents and as- 
sociations of the author's consular life at Edinburgh, 
others are born of home memories, and several are 
occasional poems, a style of composition at which 
Mr. Bruce is unusually happy. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. add Byron's Childe 
Harold" to their pretty and convenient series of 
" Handy Volume Classics." The little volume, with 
its daintily-tinted title-page and numerous photo- 
gravure views of scenes mentioned in the poem, 
makes a suitable yet very inexpensive gift-book. 

Messrs. Fords, Howard & Hulbert re-issue, in a 
cloth cover and with an added feature in the shape 
of a photographic print of the Sistine Madonna, their 
last year's booklet entitled " The Sistine Madonna, a 
Christmas Meditation," by the Rev. Amory H. Brad- 
ford. Dr. Bradford treats his theme from the usual 
clerical standpoint, shedding about it a cloud of pious 
sentiment, and reading into Raphael's canvas hidden 
meanings and symbolisms which that simple and 
sensuous painter who marks the dawn of simple and 
sensuous art would have been the last of his day to 
attempt. Raphael, a true child of the Renascence, 
was no painter of theological riddles but one need 
not look for sober art criticism in a popular Sunday 
evening lecture, which Dr. Bradford's work origin- 
ally was. 

The first shelf edition, we think, of Eric Mackay's 
" Love Letters of a Violinist " is issued in attractive 
form by Brentano's. Mr. Fagan's illustrations are 
pretty, but show at times a lack of refinement which 
is a pity, as the book is a very comely one generally.

[Dec. 16, 



BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

u. 

A vigorous search among the girls' books of this sea- 
son yields but little substantial reward. In place of 
subjects to nourish the growing mind, girls are given 
soporific doses of everyday romance, or mixtures of so- 
cial reforms and emotional sensations whose entire com- 
position is faulty. A few lessons in courtesy are doubt- 
less desirable ; but they might be interwoven with more 
heroic warp, and real vigor of treatment made the rule 
rather than the exception. 

A bevy of clever but conventional girls and their ex- 
periences at an exclusive boarding-school occupy Miss 
Nora Perry in her first long story for girls, " Hope Ben- 
ham " (Little, Brown & Co.). Some good lessons in self- 
control, and in the art sufficiently rare among young 
girls of maintaining silence as to the faults of others, 
are pleasantly inculcated; but the social ostracism of 
one high-spirited girl who was guilty of flirting, seems 
a somewhat severe climax for the book. Miss Perry's 
girls are refined to the point of being over-nice, and 
they analyze themselves too closely. 

In " Another Girl's Experience " (Roberts), Mrs. 
Leigh Webster tells the story of a minister's fledgling, 
who, leaving the home-nest, ventures on a career as 
companion to a New York woman, wealthy but eccen- 
tric. The fledgling has her wings clipped all too soon ; 
and after various mortifying and even tragic experiences, 
she is only too glad to return (with thirty dollars in her 
pocket) to her home duties in the estate to which it 
pleased Providence to call her. 

The chief merit of " Witch Winnie at Shinnecock " 
(Dodd), a sequel to " Witch Winnie in Paris," is a cer- 
tain vigor of style. The love-story, with its unfortu- 
nate termination, is not sufficiently neutralized by the 
attempt to introduce an art-atmosphere ; and the fraud- 
ulent trick which constitutes the plot has not force 
enough to form the backbone of a story. 

" Sirs, Only Seventeen " (Lee & Shepard) is the odd 
title chosen by Miss Virginia Townsend for her book 
portraying the mutual love of a brother and sister. The 
climax is attained when the heroine (who, since her mis- 
understanding with her brother, has been threatened 
with brain fever) overhears his apologetic account of 
their difficulty, and straightway recovers. Possibly the 
title is apologetic; for the heroine, with her "graceful- 
molded " features and " beautiful-shaped " head, seems 
rather morbid and high-strung. Her brother is more 
attractive, but only one or two minor characters are 
really natural. 

Miss Beatrice Harraden has drawn upon personal ex- 
perience in " Things will take a Turn " (Macmillan), 
where the change in the fortunes of two little girls, 
widely separated by circumstances, yet brought close 
together by chance, forms the motive of a mildly at- 
tractive book. The reader will be apt to tire of the in- 
cessant praises of " Childie " which gre'et him on every 
page, and even the humor of the red-nosed bird-fancier 
will not altogether relieve him. The illustrations are 
by Mr. J. H. Bacon. 

Mrs. Molesworth's praise for her heroine " Olivia " 
(Lippincott) is not always justified by the conduct of 
the latter, who, though very conscientious, lacks charm. 
The love episode is more marked than is desirable, but 
the book has an ingenious plot and contains a stern 
moral on the evils of the practical joke. A pretty story 
of a little English girl, by the same author, shows how 



morbid a child may become through misunderstanding 
the motives of those about her. " My New Home " 
(Macmillan) is for younger girls than "Olivia." 

Young children will be interested in Miss Eliza Orne 
White's "When Molly was Six" (Houghton), which 
comes in daintily-tinted covers from the Riverside Press. 
The book is illustrated by Miss Katherine Pyle, and 
contains twelve realistic studies of red-letter days in a 
child's life, one for each month. They teach no special 
lesson, but are written with skill and sympathy. 

The short stories which are compiled in " Not Quite 
Eighteen " (Roberts), by Miss Susan Coolidge, are 
wholesome and attractive, though the title is mislead- 
ing, as the children described are all of different ages 
and but sixteen stories are told. 

Four stories by Miss Plympton are collected in a 
pretty illustrated volume which takes its title from the 
first of them, "Penelope Prig" (Roberts). Though 
their construction is artificial, a note of real pathos is 
occasionally struck. Other books for girls are " The 
Little Lady of the Horse " (Roberts), by Miss Evelyn 
Raymond; "Two Girls" (Lippincott), by Miss Amy 
Blanchard, illustrated by Miss Ida Waugh; and "Six 
Little Australians" (Ward, Lock & Bowden), by Miss 
Ethel S. Turner, who warns us from the first that Aus- 
tralian children are never good. This is reassuring. 

" Toinette's Philip " (Century Co.) is among the best 
of the books intended to please boys and girls alike. Mrs. 
Jamison takes her reader at once into the picturesque 
" old quarter " of New Orleans, where he makes the 
acquaintance of a number of romantic figures. The 
boyish hero, " Philip," whose spice of roguishness gives 
him a more human interest than " Little Lord Fauntle- 
roy," divides the reader's attention with a no less charm- 
ing heroine. At last everybody proves to be related to 
everybody else, their families having been divided by 
the complications of the Civil War. It is a very fasci- 
nating if somewhat improbable tale, and readers already 
familiar with it through the pages of " St. Nicholas " 
will doubtless welcome its publication as gladly as those 
to whom it is new. The book is prettily illustrated. 

Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett's graceful style makes 
everything from her pen agreeable reading, but the col- 
lection in " Piccino and Other Child Stories " (Scribuer) 
is not so well adapted for young readers as some of her 
former writings have been. " Two Days in the Life of 
Piccino " is a fresh and amusing sketch of a cherub-faced 
Italian boy; but "The Captain's Youngest" contains a 
picture of domestic misery which no child should be 
able to understand, and its termination is entirely too 
tragic. Though " How Fauntleroy Occurred " smacks 
strongly of maternal pride, it is written in a playful 
vein, and contains Mrs. Burnett's consoling assurance 
that the original of the famous " Little Lord " (now six- 
teen years of age) no longer wears black velvet doublets 
and broad collars of lace. Mr. Birch's illustrations have 
their usual charm. 

The quaint humor with which Miss Jeanne Schultz 
tells the story of " Madeleine's Rescue " (Appleton) 
marks it with an originality that is wanting in the theme 
itself the healing of an old feud through the efforts 
of children. The author is thoroughly in sympathy with 
childhood, and at the same time takes older readers into 
her confidence. The marriage with which the book 
closes seems a natural sequel to the good comradeship 
which has gone before ; and these French children, Mad- 
eleine and her four loyal boy friends, are sure to appeal

to American readers, who might profit by the lesson in 
chivalry which their conduct teaches. 

Mrs. Mary P. Wells Smith follows the pastimes of 
" Professor Strong's " children in " Jolly Good Times 
To-day " (Roberts), which is intended to illustrate the 
difference in the atmosphere surrounding children of 
the present time from that at " Hackmatack " or else- 
where fifty years ago. There are practically no restric- 
tions placed upon these lively boys and girls, who, when 
the size of their bonfire becomes alarming, are approached 
with deference by Mrs. Strong, with the request that 
they will put it out as a personal favor to her. They 
are certainly jolly children, and the account of their act- 
ive gayety proves pleasant reading. 

A conscientious historical study is introduced in the 
romance of " Kensington Palace in the Days of Queen 
Mary " (Macmillan), whose author, Mrs. Marshall, feels 
that this Queen's character has been frequently misun- 
derstood. She is certainly attractive in this book, as 
is the heroine, a young country girl of good birth, who 
becomes lady-in-waiting to her majesty. The love story 
is simple and sweet, though another episode, in which 
the heroine is subjected to indignity, is in questionable 
taste for young readers. The story has a decided charm, 
and a sketch of the child-life of the Duke of Gloucester 
gives it additional interest. 

Somewhat sketchy in character, though not devoid 
of interest, are the " Stories from English History, from 
Julius Caesar to the Black Prince" (Macmillan), by 
the Rev. A. J. Church, M.A. The story of the Roman 
Conquest is told in the form of a dialogue, the later 
period being described in a series of sketches. The 
whole book is relieved from a suspicion of dryness by the 
numerous illustrations from old casts and engravings. 

Very artistic in binding and illustration is the volume 
of "More Celtic Fairy Tales " (Putnam), edited by Mr. 
Joseph Jacobs, who in his two volumes of English fairy 
stories has practically exhausted that field. This is not 
the case in the last two volumes of the series, in which 
he says, " I have done little more than spy the land and 
bring back some specimen bunches from the Celtic vine." 
These are certainly fragrant of the region whence they 
sprung, gay, rollicking, dramatic, and not without a 
touch of melancholy in one of the three sorrowful tales 
of Erin. It is with surprise that one finds in " The 
Russet Dog " a resemblance to one of Mr. Lummis's 
Indian folk-stories that of the bear and the coyote. 
There is also a story bearing traces of Japanese origin, 
though Mr. Jacobs hints that the case may be reversed. 
Mr. Batten's illustrations are worthy of their interest- 
ing subjects, and students will find the notes very com- 
plete. 

Two beautiful little gift-books bound in pale olive 
and gold cloth, are of the " Banbury Cross Series " (Mac- 
millan), prepared for children by Miss Grace Rhys, and 
suitably illustrated by R. Anning Bell. Each volume 
has a brief preface giving a history of the two good old 
tales forever new which it contains, wherein " Well- 
ington and his Cat " and " The Sleeping Beauty," " Jack 
the Giant Killer " and " Beauty and the Beast " are in- 
vested with a new charm. The educative value of the 
excellent illustrations and workmanship of these vol- 
umes cannot be too highly commended. 

The realm of the fantastic is invaded by Mr. Joel 
Chandler Harris, whose " Little Mr. Thimblefinger " 
(Houghton) introduces his young friends to the mys- 
teries " under the water in the spring at precisely nine 
minutes and nine seconds after twelve o'clock." Our 



old acquaintance, Mr. Rabbit is found chatting socia- 
bly with Mrs. Meadows; and their reminiscences of Mr. 
Bear, Mr. Wolf , and Mr. Billygoat, of the Pumpkin-Eater 
and the Talking-Saddle, form the substance of the book. 
The folk-lore of " Uncle Remus " does not provide the 
material for these stories, some being purely inventions, 
and others owing their origin to England. Mr. Oliver 
Herford's full-page illustrations contribute greatly to 
the success of the volume. 

Mr. George Manville Fenn, author of " First in the 
Field " (Dodd), does not tell us whether or not he has 
founded his story on experience in the Polar Seas. It 
has, however, a true ring, and the mystic charm of most 
stories of Polar exploration, of which it is among the 
best. There are the usual experiences with terrible 
gales, ice-floes, and that dreadful depression of spirits 
which becomes almost a disease, though the book as a 
whole is not sad. The illustrations are numerous. 

The painstaking quality of Colonel Knox's writings 
for boys in itself assures the authenticity of his new war 
story, "The Lost Army" (Merriam). Its subject is a 
portion of the Army of the West in the Civil War, which 
at a critical period excited grave fears at headquarters 
because communications from it were so infrequent. 
But an army which engaged in the battle of Pea Ridge 
could not be lost to history, as events showed; and the 
adventures of the two boys from Iowa who accompanied 
it prove entertaining reading. 

Two books by Mr. William O. Stoddard are of very 
unequal merit, " Chris the Model Maker " (Appleton) 
being by far the most attractive. It is a touching story 
of the life of a cripple in New York City. The book 
has considerable local color, a quality which is decid- 
edly lacking in "The Captain's Boat" (Merriam). 
Though possessed of a denouement and several hair- 
breadth escapes, the story is incoherent and not gen- 
uinely interesting. 

An unusual amount of all-around information is stored 
in a book of travel by Mr. Eugene Murray-Aaron. " The 
Butterfly Hunters in the Caribbees " (Scribner) is written 
with an enthusiastic love of nature as a field for scien- 
tific study, and is entirely drawn from an exploring nat- 
uralist's personal experience. Two bright boys are con- 
ducted by an experienced scholar through Jamaica and 
Haiti (which the author says should be pronounced 
Haw-ee-tee*), in search of rare butterflies though inci- 
dentally they encounter some larger game, like the wild 
boar. A careful account of the tropical fruits, com- 
merce, and customs of the region contribute greatly to 
the interest of the book, and its readers will doubtless 
be glad of the hint, at its close, that a similar journey to 
Spain will be undertaken. The illustrations are at- 
tractive. 

Another book of out-door sport and scientific study, 
the "Boys' Own Guide to Fishing" (Lee & Shepard), 
has illustrations conspicuous for usefulness rather than 
beauty. The diagrams, with the text, furnish ample 
directions for the making of good fishing-tackle at home, 
which the author, Mr. John Harrington Keene, regards 
as very attractive work for young anglers. Fly-fishing 
for trout, and the winter breeding of fish, are carefully 
treated ; while directions for the proper cleansing and 
cooking of fish render the book useful for campers, as 
well as to many others. 

Very little boys and girls will enjoy with equal relish 
the text and pictures in Mrs. Dodge's collection of 
rhymes and jingles, " When Life is Young " (Century 
Co.). Some of them have already appeared in "St.

Nicholas," but they hear repetition, as they are full of 
humor and sweetness, and are now collected in a dainty 
and serviceable form. 

The well-worn subject of the settling of old feuds 
through the loving simplicity of a child is freshly treated 
by Miss Julia Magruder in " The Child Amy" (Lothrop). 
Amy seems to be a very human little girl, not without 
a temper, and possessed of a decided genius for loving. 
The pleasing illustrations are by Miss Helen Maitland 
Armstrong. 

Miss Adelaide F. Samuels publishes a nonsense-book 
for children, called " Father Gander's Melodies " (Rob- 
erts); but it is hardly a fit companion for our time- 
honored " Mother Goose " neither illustrations nor 
rhymes being very successful. 

A few charming little poems are included in the forty- 
two " Love Songs of Childhood " (Scribner), by Mr. 
Eugene Field. Some are in the dialect which he has 
made familiar, and a few are humorous, as " The De- 
lectable Ballad of the Waller Lot"; but in most cases 
the humor is that of middle-aged retrospect rather than 
of childhood. "Kissing Time," with its reiteration of 
a familiar childish joke, is full of a child's pure joy in 
living; but one finds it difficult to sympathize with 
" The oogling and the googling 
Of my little Googly-Goo." 

Four books published in London by the Society for 
promoting Christian Knowledge and in New York by 
Messrs. Young, vary widely in merit, though none of 
them can be numbered among the best of children's 
books. An exciting story of the recovery of a buried 
treasure is told with considerable vigor in the " Cruise 
of the Esmeralda," by Mr. Harry Collingwood. " Mid- 
shipman Archie," by Miss Annette Lyster, relates in 
wholesome fashion the story of an Irish family of good 
birth. The author of " The Dean's Little Daughter " 
tells of a drunkard's reform in " Jenny Dear," and Mrs. 
Isla Ditwell contributes " Farmer Golds worthy's Will." 

A good edition of " Robinson Crusoe," published for 
the " Children's Library " (Macmillan) contains a num- 
ber of quaint illustrations by Mr. George Cruikshank. 
The frontispiece is particularly interesting by reason of 
its old-fashioned quality; and the text has been mod- 
ernized and adapted for children in a commendable man- 
ner. The binding, in blue and white, is rather dainty 
for hard service. 

A new edition of Miss Kate Douglas Wiggin's " Tim- 
othy's Quest " (Houghton) is likely to meet with the 
success which attended the first appearance of that pop- 
ular book. The same firm issues a captivating new edi- 
tion of the inimitable " Story of a Bad Boy," in which 
Mr. Aldrich's humor proves itself delightfully fresh in 
spite of many readings. 

The season brings the usual substantial array of bound 
volumes of standard serials. " St. Nicholas " (Century 
Co.) is filled with the good things of the past year, 
plenty of solid food for children, garnished with " sugar 
and spice and everything nice." The names of many 
of the writers for " St. Nicholas " also appear in " Har- 
per's Young People," which will possibly be more inter- 
esting to older children. The past success of " Chatter- 
box " (Estes & Lauriat) doubtless ensures that of this 
year's volume, containing articles about birds and fishes, 
sketches of foreign children, and also short stories of 
famous men. A series of papers on British field-sports 
is of interest, but it is be regretted that the illustrations 
are so inferior. 



NEW YORK TOPICS. 



New York, December 12, 1894. 

Mr. Besant's pleasant remarks concerning the work- 
ings of the Copyright Act, quoted in the last number of 
THE DIAL, do not represent the situation as closely as 
they might have done six months ago. At that time 
many were under the impression that the result of the 
Act of 1891 had been directly beneficial to American 
authors by removing from the market the cheap reprints 
of current English books with which it was then flooded. 
It was supposed that American books would then com- 
pete on even terms with those of foreigners. But Mr. 
Harold Frederic cables to the New York " Times " that, 
" as this month's ' Bookman ' says, it seems as if English 
fiction were almost entirely supplanting the American. 
This remark is echoed by other papers, which dwell 
pleasantly on the anomalous fact that although the copy- 
right agreement was expected, by making foreign books 
dearer, to help the American novelists, its actual result 
has been to give the British novelists a vastly bigger 
vogue in America than they had in the former piratical 
days." 

Mr. Robert Barr also declares, in a recent interview, 
that there is much competition among American pub- 
lishers for British authors, and expresses his wonder 
thereat. When the Copyright bill was passed, however, 
nearly four years ago, a number of those active in put- 
ting it through understood thoroughly that the chief 
benefit would accrue to the British author. At the din- 
ner given in honor of the passage of the bill, one of the 
speakers said: 

" The road to publication for an American work has been 
easy almost too easy for some trashy American works since 
the manufacture of unauthorized reprints became unprofit- 
able. So far as respects the Author's Copyright League, its 
efforts have been, to use a hackneyed word, altruistic, except 
for the satisfaction derived from a sense of honor, dignity, 
right. For what have we dared to do ? We have doubled 
at a stroke the list of our competitive writers. All British 
authors are now American authors. All will now compete on 
nearly equal terms in the market of this ' Greater Britain ' 
of what must be the greatest bookmart of the world." 

So Mr. Besant and some others will have to revise 
their impressions of the workings of the Copyright Act. 
Some weeks ago I promised to consider a few of the 
reasons for the overshadowing of our home novelists by 
the rising school of British romancers. The reasons for 
the overshadowing have meanwhile been so fully ex- 
ploited iu various directions that there is now no need 
of an additional word on the subject. It was Gilbert 
Parker, by the way, who first commented on the success 
of these writers as a group. It should be remembered 
that the framers of the Copyright bill, while anticipating 
the temporary disadvantages to American authors which 
have arisen, looked for permanent benefits to all con- 
cerned in the future. I trust they will not be disap- 
pointed. At present the outlook for American books in 
the British market does not seem particularly encour- 
aging. With the exceptions of Mrs. Burnett's and Mrs. 
Wiggin's books, full lists of which are occasionally to 
be found, the " Athenaeum " advertising pages rarely 
contain the titles of more than a dozen American books, 
while a search of the review columns iu the issue for 
November 24 failed to disclose a notice of even one 
American book. 

A delightfully reminiscent article by Mr. A. V. S. 
Anthony, the veteran engraver and art-editor, on " The 
Making of Illustrated Books," appears in this week's

" Independent." It recounts some of his successful ex- 
periments in illustrating the books of Whittier and Long- 
fellow at a time when the art of illustration had not 
reached its present perfection. The few anecdotes given 
will suggest to many of Mr. Anthony's friends that a 
volume of reminiscences from his pen would be a gen- 
uine addition to the literary and artistic history of the 
time. 

The Order of the Round Table, a juvenile society 
formed by readers of " Harper's Young People," is hold- 
ing a very successful fair in behalf of one of its char- 
ities here. There will be an authors' reception at which 
a number of writers for both young and old people have 
promised to be present and meet their young friends. 
Mr. William Hamilton Hayne, the Southern poet, is 
paying his annual visit to the city, and Mr. George W. 
Sheldon, of London, is here for a few days. Provence 
and the Riviera are the attractions which have induced 
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas A. Janvier and Mrs. Anna Bow- 
man Dodd to spend the winter in France. Mr. Alex- 
ander Black's " picture play," " Miss Jerry," is meet- 
ing with gratifying success wherever presented. This 
form of entertainment is the particular invention of Mr. 
Black, who is literary editor of the Brooklyn " Times," 
and an expert in photographic matters. While he reads 
the story, dissolving views of the characters and scenes 
are thrown upon a screen, changes being made twice or 
thrice a minute as the story progresses. 

A most absurd notice of the illustrated edition of Dr. 
Hohnes's " The Last Leaf," which recently appeared in 
the London " Saturday Review," has caused much amuse- 
ment here. The writer says among other things that 
"the poem is supposed [in America] to be a classic; it 
is supposed to be unique in kind and excellence; sup- 
positions which lead one to inquire whether Americans 
have ever heard of Austin Dobson." Mr. Dobson un- 
doubtedly will enjoy this, inasmuch as he dedicated the 
first American edition of his poems to Dr. Holmes, and 
may fairly be said to look on the latter as one of his 
masters. Why not ask whether Americans have ever 
heard of Mr. Frederick Locker-Lampson, whose best- 
known poem is almost a parody of " The Last Leaf " ?

LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers will publish in March a 
new novel by Mr. Henry B. Fuller. 

The fourth volume of Professor McMaster's " History 
of the People of the United States " will be ready for 
publication at an early date. 

We regret to learn that " The Southern Magazine," 
of Louisville, Ky., has suspended publication. The mag- 
azine was a credit to the South, and deserved a better 
fate. 

With reference to the contemplated Life and Letters 
of Dr. Holmes, his son and executor requests that any 
persons having letters of the poet will send them to his 
publishers, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston. 
These letters will be carefully returned to their owners 
after copies have been made of such as are found to be 
available for publication. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. are to publish a series of 
" European Statesmen," similar to the " Twelve English 
Statesmen " series. The editing is in the hands of Pro- 



fessor J. B. Bury. " Charles the Great "; by Mr. Thomas 
Hodgkin; "William the Silent," by Mr. Frederic Har- 
rison; " Richelieu," by Professor R. Lodge; and " Maria 
Theresa," by Dr. J. Frauck Bright, are among the vol- 
umes promised. 

Apropos of our recent communications and comments 
on the San Francisco Vigilance Committee, attention 
may be called to a series of articles on the subject in 
the " Overland Monthly " for October, November, and 
December, of the current year. The writer of the arti- 
cles, Mr. Almarin B. Paul of San Francisco, was a mem- 
ber of the famous Committee, and his account has value 
as coming from an eye-witness of and a participant in 
the strange scenes and events described. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons make the following an- 
nouncements of their forthcoming publications: "The 
Women of Shakespeare, "by Dr. Lewis Lewes; " Three 
Men of Letters" (Berkeley, Dwight, Barlow), by Pro- 
fessor Moses Coit Tyler; " Personal Recollections of 
War Times," by Mr. Albert Gallatin Riddle; "King 
Arthur," a comparative study of the Arthurian epic, by 
the Rev. S. H. Gurteen; and In the Heart of the Bit- 
ter-Root Mountains," an account of the Carlin hunting 
party of 1893. 

A project was formed some time ago at Aquila in 
Italy to erect in that town a monument to the Roman 
historian Sallust, whose birthplace, Amiternum, was 
near by. President Gilman of Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity and Professor Tarbell of the University of Chicago, 
having been requested to secure subscriptions for this 
object in the United States, have received and sent to the 
Aquila Committee seventy dollars, contributed in equal 
sums by the following universities: Chicago, Columbia, 
Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Princeton, 
Yale. Subscriptions have been made in various parts 
of Europe, and the fund must now amount to nearly or 
quite thirteen hundred francs. 

M. Ernest Lavisse has succeeded the late James Dar- 
mesteter in the editorship of " La Revue de Paris," and 
a happier substitute could hardly have been found. The 
note on Darmesteter supplied to the " Revue " of Nov- 
ember 15 by his colleague, M. Louis Ganderax, is fol- 
lowed up, in the issue of December 1, by an appreciative 
study of the deceased scholar from the pen of M. Gas- 
ton Paris. 

The cultured circles of San Francisco have been con- 
siderably stirred by an address lately delivered in that 
city by Prof. M. B. Anderson of Stanford University, 
in which, while saying some very pleasant things of the 
city, he ventured upon a few criticisms that proved de- 
cidedly unpalatable, and for which he has been duly 
" roasted " by the local press. That spirited and strong- 
headed journal, " The Argonaut," thinks a part of the 
city's vulgarity, of which Professor Anderson complains, 
is due to the occasional visits of Stanford University 
students, who are turbulent and unruly, especially just 
after winning football games. But, with the fullest 
allowance for the exuberance of even a victorious foot- 
ball team, this does not seem a complete answer to Pro- 
fessor Anderson's strictures. By a curious coincidence, 
in the same issuse of " The Argonaut " a contributor is 
permitted to call attention to the fact that " in no other 
city in this country are the disgusting sights thrust be- 
fore one's eyes that in San Francisco can be seen, if one 
glances to the left or right, in passing along respect- 
able thoroughfares in the very heart of the city." But 
the San Franciscans may rest in peace. No one sus-

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



pects them of possessing a monopoly of the vulgarity 
of American cities, and the criticism which they find so 
hard to bear could be made, and has been made, upon 
most large places. Even Chicago has had its expe- 
rience of similar chastenings from friendly critics, and 
has lived to look back with a smile at its own hyper- 
sensitiveness. It is probable that both San Francisco 
and Professor Anderson will survive the recent episode. 
Mr. Swinburne's " Memorial Ode on the Death of 
Leconte de Lisle," which appears in " The Saturday Re- 
view," is such a noble commemorative tribute as its au- 
thor alone of living men could have written. It is a 
lyrical structure in three sections, of which we quote the 
first entire, and add the closing strain of the last. 

" Beside the lordliest grave in all the world 
A singer crowned with golden years and fame 

Spake words more sweet than wreaths of incense curled 
That bade an elder yet and mightier name 

Hail, for whose love the wings of time were furled 
And death that heard it died of deadlier shame. 

" Our father and lord of all the sons of song, 

Hugo, supreme on earth, had risen above 
Earth, as the sun soars noonward : grief and wrong 

Had yielded up their part in him to love : 
And one man's word came forth upon the throng 

Brief as the brooding music of the dove. 

" And he now too, the praiser as the praised, 
Being silent, speaks forever. He whose word 

Reverberate made the gloom whereon he gazed 
Radiant with sound whose song in his we heard 

Stands far from us as they whose souls he raised 
Again, and darkness carolled like a bird. 

"Now the lyre whose lord's wise mastery gave its notes re- 
verberate skill 
Whence to give again the grace of golden gifts of hands 

long dead, 
Now the deep clear soul that all the lore of time could scarce 

fulfil, 
Now the sovereign voice that spake it, now the radiant eye 

that read, 

Seem to sleep as sleeps the indomitable imperishable will 
Here, that haply lives and sleeps not, though its word on 
earth be said."

"MIRABEAU STANDS OUT AS THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THE TIMES; THE GREATEST STATESMAN OF FRANCE." 

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

TESTED BY MIRABEAU'S CAREER. 

Twelve Lectures on the History of tlie French Revolution, delivered at the Lowell Institute, Boston, Mass 

By Dr. HERMANN E. VON HOLST, 
Author of " Constitutional and Political History of the United States " and " The Constitutional Law of the United 

States." Head Professor of History in the University of Chicago. 

At the invitation of the trustees of the Lowell Institute of Boston, Hermann E. von Hoist, Professor 
of History in the University of Chicago, gave, in the condensed form of twelve one-hour lectures, a sum- 
mary of his reflections on the causes of the French Revolution, as tested by Mirabeau's career. For 
twenty years the French Revolution, its causes, progress, and results, has been the main theme of Von 
Hoist's teachings in the Universities of Germany, and, second only to his labors in the field of American 
Constitutional History, the history of France during the eighteenth century has chiefly engaged his time 
and study. These lectures, which met with the unanimous commendation of Boston's intellectual circles, 
and which awakened the deepest interest on their delivery in Chicago, have now been given to the larger 
public in two neat volumes. 

LECTURE HEADINGS. 



I. The Heritage of Louis XIV. and Louis XV. 

II. Paris and Versailles. 

III. Mending the Old Garment with New Cloth. 

IV. The Revolution before the Revolution. 

V. A Typical Family Tragedy of Portentous Histor- 
ical Import. 

VI. The States-General. 



VII. The Party of One Man." 

VIII. The 5th and 6th of October, 1789, and the Me- 
moir of the 15th. 

IX. The Decisive Defeat of November 7th. 

X. Other Defeats and Mischievous Victories. 

XI. Mirabeau and the Court. 

XII. The End. A Unique Tragedy. 



%* All questions which, for the general public, are perhaps the most difficult to understand, are lucidly and 
graphically discussed. Such a mass of information and suggestion is condensed into each of these lectures that 
no extracts would adequately represent their character.

" His labors, indeed, have been immense. ... A work which every student must needs possess in its 
entirety." THE NATION. 

" A masterpiece as to depth, clearness, impartiality, and scope. It seems the testimony of a disinterested 
witness; one who needed no cross-questioning; one who in the direct narrative omits no significant detail."-
