May Sinclair's THE THREE BRONTES 

"Will interest all who are interested in the Brontes; it is a study that has unusual value." The Dial. 
" Understanding, sympathy, a certain wistfulness toward these long: dead sisters whom she would so intensely have 
liked to have known mark this intimate biography." Chicago Tribune. Illustrated. $3.00 net. Postage 18 cents. 




James O. Pagan's 



THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF AN INDIVIDUALIST 



" The philosophy underlying this life story is one that needs more and more emphasis in this day and generation, and 
it is brought out with cumulative interest. The book is decidedly worth reading and ought to attract to itself a host of 
readers." Boston Transcript. $1.25 net. Postage 11 cents. 



Henry D. Sedgwick's 



ITALY IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 



An important contribution to the field of Italian historical scholarship. The book is as readable and interesting to 
the general reader as it is sound and authoritative, and will appeal strongly both to those specially interested in Italy and 
her development and to those interested in the larger aspects of the history of European civilization. 

In two volumes. Illustrated. $5.00 net. Postage 32 cents. 



Havelock Ellis's 



THE TASK OF SOCIAL HYGIENE 



"An admirable example of a sane and intelligent handling of a subject which in this country is apt to be treated 
from one of the two extreme points of view." New York Sun. 

"A singularly powerful book, the whole argument deserves careful study. It will supply much food for thought." 
London Daily Graphic. $2.50 net. Postage 15 cents. 



Frances Jenkins Olcott's 



THE CHILDREN'S READING 



" We have long been waiting for a book to be written with as much authority as this. Miss Olcott is already known

Bliss Perry's 



THE AMERICAN MIND

a note of frankness, a quality of intimacy, which make his criticism especially valuable." The Outlook. 

$1.25 net. Postage 10 cents. 



Samuel M. Crothers's 



HUMANLY SPEAKING 



" The happy blending of keen insight and the wit which is neither caustic nor destructive, but a kind of high light on

of the most delightful chapters are based on recent European experiences." The Outlook. $1.25 net. Postage 12 cents. 



Agnes Repplier's 



AMERICANS AND OTHERS 



"This is a companionable book, interesting and comforting as a friendship old enough to have lost all stiffness, not 
so old as to have outgrown the exigencies and decent reserves of good taste. To laugh at ourselves and with others is a 
lesson worth learning, and Miss Repplier cleverly renders its acquirement a veritable joy." Chicago Record-Herald.

LITERATURE AND THE UNDER- 
GRADUATE. 



On the occasion of the death of George Meredith, 
one of our college magazines justly plumed itself 
upon having recognized his genius a good while he- 
fore it was recognized elsewhere in America, and 
even before England had rubbed her eyes to watch 
him a little more closely. In that day, the "pro- 
gressive " spirit was less pronounced than it is now ; 
in literature as well as in social and political move- 
ments, the "old fogies" were still venerable rather 
than antiquated. But with the change in the mood 
of the age, the past has receded into a dismal Boeo- 
tian fog, the present has assumed the loveliest hues, 
and the future, arrayed in the magnificence of per- 
fect novelty, is apparently on the point of making 
even the present seem conventional. The most in- 
tellectually alert type of student has bid perfunctory 
adieux to the giants of the old order, is often bored 
by living writers of acknowledged genius or talent, 
and spends his time in scanning the horizon for 
giants of a new breed, manifesting a radical cosmo- 
politanism such as we never expected to find in the 
universities. With blaring trumpets the press-agents 
announce the Irish dramatists: our latter-day col- 
lege litterateur straightway parts company with Mr. 
Henry James, cries "Who are they? Hurray ! " and 
flings his cap for Synge until he hears of a " cork- 
ing " play by Wedekind. I have known students 
who " specialized " in the drama without enjoying 
even a nodding acquaintance (such as one gets in 
translations) with Sophocles or Euripides, Moliere 
or Racine, without so much as an ability to read the 
Elizabethan English of Shakespeare one of them, 
indeed, admitted to "hating" Shakespeare with par- 
ticular fervor. These same students are indisput- 
able authorities on dramatists and novelists of 
whom even their more "progressive" professors 
have barely heard, so that if a new Meredith were 
to appear to-morrow he would be instantly detected 
and lauded by a chorus of students in a number 
of universities and colleges. That would be well 
enough if Merediths were not so rare ; but it is un- 
fortunately true that our undergraduate watcher of 
the skies normally beholds, not new planets swim- 
ming into his ken, but only a succession of swift 
meteorites melting into non-existence. 

It may be that this strict contemporaneity (almost 
futurity) of interest, is not to be regretted. Amer- 
ican institutions of higher learning, unlike those of 
the Continent, have always been timid and conven- 
tional, without a strong desire for independent 
thought, and it is possible that the radical interests 
of our students may lead to a curiosity and breadth

of mind that have been only too rare in American 
education. Something will, indeed, suffer : deli- 
cately ornate poetry, prose that is strong because it 
is chastened and restrained, graceful comedy and 
opera, these are not for the new generation. 
The new gods are Wells and Shaw, Meredith and 
Chesterton, Ibsen (already a little old-fashioned), 
Strindberg, the Irish school, indeed any writers who 
put genuine " red blood " into their work, who have 
broken violently with tradition, who have u a deep 
love for the primitive," who are socialistic, who are 
tremendously free of thought and speech. The col- 
lege club devoted to Greek tragedy has been meta- 
morphosed into a group of young men with a rosy 
Socialistic vision, and some of our college papers 
are avowedly given over to Socialistic propaganda, 
one of them, for instance, asserting with modern 
openness that " the Socialistic party, it is a truism 
to say, stands to-day as the one consistent, progres- 
sive, self-respecting party in American politics." 
Above all is the cry of young America in the 
colleges let us not be prejudiced and reactionary : 
let us be absolutely outspoken. We will spare no 
man and no institution, we will revere nothing, but 
look the facts in the eye and speak out what we 
think. Such is the attitude, not only when young 
men or young women gather in earnest discussion, 
but also when young men and young women meet 
for social pleasure no drawing-room prattle, as of 
overgrown children, but manly and womanly direct- 
ness, even when the most delicate, or indelicate, 
subjects are broached. 

All this may, I have said, lead to better things, and 
unfavorable comment may savor of old-fogeyism. 
We are told that what is radical to-day will be tame 
and conventional to-morrow; we are told, specific- 
ally, that a new era of frankness, sex equality, and 
social service is dawning. These things it is not 
for us to deny. In any event, however, we are 
surely justified in assuming that some of the new 
virtues are replacing older virtues that are quite as 
precious, and that a good deal of the new attitude 
is little better than attitudinizing. Despite all our 
talk of advanced thought in the colleges, it is to be 
feared that college students do not really think as 
much as they did in more sober decades, that the 
love of reflection has been smothered in a passion 
for "doing things," that action is tending to take 
the place of thought instead of following it. It is 
not yet clear that the reddest of red blood is better 
than true blue blood, or better than a favorable com- 
bination of the two purple, or royal, blood. Action 
is extolled at the expense of wisdom the prime 
token of a good king, a good student, a good man of 
any kind. 

So much for the gospel of Red Blood as we find 
it in our colleges. It is the gospel of the most 
promising young men and women, those who are 
most alert and intelligent. If it is a sorry gospel, 
let us turn to another type of undergraduate who 
reads literature; in him we shall find another, 
though perhaps not nobler, ideal. 



The second type of undergraduate who reads 
books (save in one or two colleges there are only 
two prominent types) is the student whose interests 
are not primarily literary. He is very likely spe- 
cializing in engineering, or agriculture, or chemistry, 
or music, and he reads for momentary amusement 
rather than for pleasure and profit. He probably 
takes a course or two in English literature, does the 
reading required of him, but makes a sharp division 
between literature prescribed by the instructor's 
wisdom and literature prescribed by his own inclina- 
tion; he will read a play of Shakespeare's, if one 
is assigned, but when he reads for diversion he will 
prefer Sherlock Holmes to lago, and if he goes to 
the theatre will elect "Louisiana Lou" and not 
"Twelfth Night." He is not ashamed of his tastes 
far from it, indeed so far that if you remind him 
that Shakespeare is more worth while than Conan 
Doyle he will assume that the burden of proof is 
yours. 

Just what this type of student the usual type of 
undergraduate reads, can hardly be known with- 
out extended inquiry. As a result of several investi- 
gations, both in the East and in the West, I present 
the following data. Most students read virtually 
nothing but magazines. Of our multitudinous mag- 
azines, by all odds the most popular is the " Satur- 
day Evening Post," partly because it costs less than 
the others, partly because it contains short stories in 
abundance. Next in order, but far less popular, are 
the "Cosmopolitan," "Everybody's," "Ladies' Home 
Journal" (in coeducational institutions), "Scrib- 
ner's," "Popular Mechanics," "Red Book," then 
three or four others including the "Review of Re- 
views." These are read primarily for the short 
stories, secondarily for a knowledge of current events, 
and lastly for scientific information. A large num- 
ber of students read no ephemeral novels ; those who 
do read them prefer novels of an adventurous or 
sentimental cast usually not the "red blood" fic- 
tion which one finds in a mild form in Mr. Kipling 
and in a virulent form in Mr. London. An equally 
large number of students read no standard novels; 
those who do, prefer Dickens, Scott, Cooper, Steven- 
son, and other writers in whose works adventure, 
sentiment, and sentimentalism are prominent. Poetry 
is, generally speaking, never read for pleasure, mainly 
because it is regarded as "hard to understand" and 
is somewhat " effeminate." Of the poems read in 
high school or college courses only those of Long- 
fellow and Tennyson seem to make any impression 
on the student. As for the drama, the average under- 
graduate neglects whatever is worth his attention, 
calling it "dry" and "deep," and attends as many 
musical comedies and vaudeville performances as his 
purse will countenance; favorite "shows" are "The 
Slim Princess" and "The Soul Kiss." 

No one, of course, would be foolish enough to 
deny that a great deal can be said in favor of each of 
these interests of the undergraduate ; in themselves, 
they are laudable enough. Combined, however, it 
is clear that they are regrettably frivolous. 



1913.] 



THE DIAL, 



Now, as the immature mind is naturally somewhat 
frivolous, something like the foregoing state of affairs 
is what we should expect in any age provided the 
immature mind is permitted to roam unguided. 
Several decades ago, back to 1636, if you will, the 
literary tastes of the undergraduate were guided with 
more care and success than they are to-day. Theo- 
retically, we still seek to guide his taste; but it is 
hardly an exaggeration to say that we have never 
done so with as little care or success. We condemn 
the narrow Puritan ideal to-day, but we should not 
forget that the Puritans educated the young to sturdy 
morality and citizenship. The classical education in 
vogue until the scientific spirit cast it aside was per- 
haps also too narrow; but whatever else it did or 
failed to do, it produced men whose tastes were less 
vulgar than are those of our day. Yet we should not 
condemn our present educational ideal merely on the 
ground that the reading habits it fosters are deplor- 
able. For one thing, cultivating a love of good lit- 
erature has been made extremely difficult on account 
of the noisily alluring yellow newspapers and mag- 
azines that belong uniquely to our own age ; trivial- 
ity and sensationalism have never surrounded the 
student, in a physical as well as figurative sense, as 
they do to-day. But the fact remains that the under- 
graduate's reading betokens a kind of uncivilization 
for which the yellow journals are only in part 
probably in small part responsible. 

When the student interested in literature reads 
Shaw and Wells to the exclusion of Shakespeare and 
Thackeray (one intelligent undergraduate, by the 
way, remarks that he "cannot keep up with Wells 
as he writes faster than I can read"), and when the 
student interested in other phases of human activity 
reads almost nothing but the poorer short stories of 
this age of the short story ; when, in brief, the love 
of good literature is on the verge of losing its last 
citadel, the college, we have reason to look with con- 
cern into the future. In our laisscz faire democracy 
(it is less of that than it was), we are inclined to let 
the future take care of itself, assuming that if we 
go too far one way now, we shall in due time have a 
reaction and go the other way. Possibly this attitude 
is wiser than it seems. But before we follow the cur- 
rent blindly, we should pause to consider whether 
even materialism is not more effective if it is not 
altogether material, whether, granting the para- 
mount value of our present ideals, the present itself 
may not be bettered by the addition of some of the 
indirectly practical virtues. This idea is an old one, 
but it is not popular to-day certainly not with the 
undergraduate. 

For many a long year the cause of culture has 
suffered through the lusty growth of two laudable 
but relatively undesirable ideals : the athletic ideal, 
and the eagerness for practical training. The two 
are not without relation, since we are probably right 
in ascribing the athletic ideal to the gospel of Red 
Blood, to admiration of the man who " does things," 
the man of concrete achievement as contrasted with 



the man of thought. So long as the builder of 
bridges, of model barns, and of more or less solid 
Socialistic platforms enjoys our respect at the ex- 
pense of the man of taste and reflection and unreal- 
ized potentiality, so long will athleticism make us 
wonder what, after all, colleges are for. Colleges 
which are combating the exaggerated athleticism 
that distorts their aims, might more profitably com- 
bat the "practical training" fallacy by a readjust- 
ment in their requirements for degrees. We must 
understand clearly, before we can go far, the paradox 
already alluded to, a paradox that puzzles this age 
though it was clear enough to our forefathers, 
namely, that a "practical" education is less prac- 
tical than an impractical one. Fortunately we are 
once more beginning to grasp this truth, partly by 
reaction from the excesses of the elective system; 
the new attitude or rather the return to the old 
point of view is manifested by the bold attempt 
to rehabilitate Greek and Latin at Amherst College, 
by the requirement at Oberlin that every graduating 
student shall have taken a course in one of the arts, 
by the action of Rutgers in making the Master's de- 
gree a symbol of two years' study in " elementary and 
liberal" subjects, and by the tendency at Harvard, 
Yale, and Princeton toward a general rather than 
special education. 

Signs, then, are not wanting that "practical" 
study is to be tempered by liberal study, that 
specialization will not be a luxury for freshmen, but 
rather a necessity for graduate students. With the 
waning of early specialization we shall have, doubt- 
less, a healthy decrease in the number of teachers 
of the latter-day Ph.D. type. The undergraduate 
ordinarily does not respect the new type of in- 
structor, whom he regards, often unjustly it is true, 
as a dry word-grubber, a lover of the dullest manu- 
scripts and palpably worthless books, a dehuman- 
ized precisian; he is repelled and driven into the 
camp of the athletes, where he is reasonably sure to 
find a coach whom he can honestly respect ; or he 
is driven to his textbooks and to the laboratory, seek- 
ing, as men will, knowledge rather than wisdom. 
But if he is to make a man of himself, and not a 
physical or mental machine, he must be stimulated 
by humane instructors, professors of a type not often 
bred by our colleges as they are now conducted. No 
doubt we shall have more of these professors when 
specialization and " quick returns " are less eagerly 
sought and less readily obtained. Then, and not 
till then, will the love of good literature be found 
again in our colleges ; then will the fiery young man, 
who spurns bis professors of literature and, for want 
of guidance, holds admirable only what is novel and 
red-blooded, and the ordinary undergraduate, who, 
if he reads at all, finds pleasure only in light stories 
and Slim Princesses, then will both types of under- 
graduates have an opportunity to acquire a love of 
good literature. Perhaps some of them will even 
read poetry.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



ROBERT COLLYEB'S VOICE AND PEN never failed, 
up to the very end, to win him hosts of eager hear- 
ers and readers, though undoubtedly his living and 
breathing presence gave to his spoken word a power 
and a charm that could not be communicated to the 
printed page. "I wanted to touch his garments to 
see if virtue would not come out of him," said one 
whom the preacher's strong personality had attracted. 
For almost a score of years his home and the centre 
of his influence was Chicago, where he founded 
Unity Church and, as its pastor, was widely known 
as the most famous preacher in the West. Under his 
heroic leadership his church went through the great 
fire (which destroyed the building and left only two 
houses of his parish standing) and came forth dis- 
mayed but not disheartened. "At that time some- 
thing went out of me," he once confessed to a friend. 
"Before that, thoughts pressed for utterance faster 
than I could write them. Now everything comes 
with effort." This helps explain his removal to New 
York and to a scene of less arduous labors a few 
years later. To that quieter afternoon of his life we 
owe some of his best published utterances. He wrote 
"Nature and Life," "The Life That Now Is," "The 
Simple Truth," "Talks to Young Men," "Things 
New and Old," "Father Taylor," and a delightful 
autobiography, "Some Memories," which latter, as 
he has said, "stole out from the mists of time by no 
effort of memory, but as if they had been waiting 
for those quiet mornings when they were written, I 
dare not say by inspiration from on High, but will 
say the inspiration of a grateful heart." Of him 
can be truly said what he himself said of his friend, 
Father Taylor, whom he resembled in the rugged 
strength, the homely simplicity, the sweetness and 
beauty of his character, "He had his limitations, 
but was so sincere and so right where the fastness 
of all Tightness dwells, in a man's soul." 



MAGAZINE POETRY OF THE YEAR just ended is 
passed in review by Mr. William Stanley Braith- 
waite in the Boston "Transcript." This is the eighth 
consecutive year that he has performed this service 
for students and lovers of American poetry, and in 
these eight years he has witnessed what seem to him 
encouraging signs of an increasing appreciation of 
poetry on the part of the public, and of growing 
ability to produce good verse on the part of the poets. 
"For the year just ended," he affirms, "there can 
be no doubt in the face of the proofs that American 
poetic art has entered upon a new era an era that 
not only promises a better and higher quality of 
accomplishment, but also in which the commercial 
prosperity that formerly attended its publication will 
return." Among visible evidences of poetry's im- 
proving condition he cites the publication of " The 
Lyric Year," and four other notable collections of 
American verse, the establishment of two magazines 
("Poetry," in Chicago, and "The Poetry Journal," 
in Boston) devoted to the interests of the art, and 



the number and prominence of volumes of verse in 
the autumn output of books. Moreover, Mr. Braith- 
waite has been assured by the editor of one of our 
foremost magazines " that these annual articles on 
magazine poetry had the effect of compelling him to 
select ' distinctive ' verse for his periodical, and not 
merely good verse." As in former years, six leading 
magazines have been examined by the appraiser, and 
this year a number of other periodicals have also 
been searched for distinctive pieces of poetry. The 
sixty-eight best poems, out of three hundred or more 
good ones published in the year, are named by Mr. 
Braithwaite ; and from these, he says, he has chosen 
forty-two for his "Anthology of Magazine Verse for 
1912." These forty-two he also names, and likewise 
the twenty-one of preeminent worth out of the forty- 
two. Finally he chooses six of the thrice-sifted 
twenty-one and publishes them with his review in 
the "Transcript"; and these six are surely deserv- 
ing of mention even in so brief a summary of Mr. 
Braithwaite's work as the present. The titles, authors, 
and periodicals, as given by him, are as follows: 
" He Whom a Dream Hath Possessed," Shaemas 
O'Sheel, "Forum"; "Hungarian Love-Lament," 
Ethel Syford, " Lippincott's "; " To Little Ren^e," 
William Aspenwall Bradley, " Scribner's "; "The 
Wife," Anna Spencer Twitchell, " Delineator "; 
" The Reveler: A Vineyard Song," George Edward 
Woodberry, " Harper's "; " As an Old Mercer," 
Mahlon Leonard Fisher, "The Bellman." Natu- 
rally, but unfortunately, the critic has excluded his 
own work from appraisal in this annual survey ; but 
those interested need go no further than to " The 
Forum " (December) to find an example of it. No 
recent writer has served the cause of poetry more 
zealously and lovingly than Mr. Braithwaite. 

* 

WESTERN LITERATURE IN THE FAR EAST, espe- 
cially in Japan, is winning increased favor. Mr. R. 
Matsushite, manager of the Maruzen Company, the 
largest importers of books in Japan, has recently 
been in London and New York for business purposes, 
and has of course been interviewed. His alleged 
assertion that the Japanese, though possessed now of 
a robust national consciousness, are humble at heart 
and still eager to learn from other nations, and that 
they study foreign languages and buy foreign books 
more than any other people, is easily credible. That 
they also buy more pure literature than books on 
science and industry, one is glad to believe. Foreign 
classics are read by them now more than ever before, 
Shakespeare being in especial demand ; but modern 
authors of note are equally popular, and Mr. Bernard 
Shaw, Mr. Arnold Bennett, Strindberg, and Haupt- 
mann find many appreciative readers. America 
sends to Japan more books on commerce and indus- 
try than on other subjects, our business methods 
being gladly studied and adopted there, while Ger- 
many contributes medical works, and other European 
countries those books in which Japan considers them 
especially strong. The American short story, it is 
gratifying to learn, and also American books about

THE DIAL 



Russia and from the Russian, are in favor with the 
Japanese; but America's commercial influence on 
Japan has far exceeded her literary influence, as was 
to have been expected in this day and generation. A 
slight but significant sign of the times is to be noted 
in Japan's recent adoption of foreign stationery. Our 
pens and ink are rapidly invading the island kingdom, 
where two years ago no official document could law- 
fully be written in European fashion; now, how- 
ever, the steel pen may legally take the place of the 
camel's-hair brush or whatever the old-fashioned 
native implement may be. But after all is said, a 
feeling of regret will arise at these evidences of the 
u standardization " of all modern civilization. Gain 
in uniformity means loss in picturesque variety. 

PENALTIES OF LITERARY GREATNESS might almost 
be proved to exceed those of literary unsuccess and 
obscurity. Among recent celebrities, Mark Twain 
lamented in his last years that his popularity and 
prominence made it impossible for him to gratify his 
longing to visit once more in a quiet way the scenes 
and friends of his youth. When a disguise was sug- 
gested he shook his head. " No," said he, sorrowfully, 
"my drawl would give me away." Mr. A. C. Ben- 
son has in one of his books well depicted some of the 
annoyances thai; his own acceptability with readers 
has brought him. The great Dumas, to go back a 
few decades, probably enjoyed all the popularity he 
achieved; but the later attachment of his name to 
works rather feebly imitative of his genius might not 
have pleased him so well. Walter Scott was another 
who suffered at the hands of unscrupulous imitators. 
A writer in the New York "Evening Post" calls at- 
tention anew to pseudo-Scott catchpenny publications 
foisted on an unsuspecting public in the days before 
the author of "Waverley" had revealed himself. 
"Walladmor" came out in Germany as an attempt 
to supply the demand for a Waverley novel at the 
annual book-fair when no genuine product was forth- 
coming; and, nearer home, one William Fearman 
boldly issued a fourth and fifth series of "Tales of 
My Landlord " as from the hand of the Gandercleuch 
schoolmaster and parish clerk, Jedediah Cleish- 
botham. These spurious romances, "Pontefract 
Castle" and "The Fairy of Glas Lyn," their unscru- 
pulous fabricator extolled as equal in merit to their 
predecessors in the series, and he wrote an impudent 
letter to John Ballantyne in answer to the bookseller's 
protest against the fraud. But Scott refused to take 
any action in the matter, confident that the counter- 
feits would enjoy but a brief currency; and he was 
soon proved to be in the right, as the bogus " Tales " 
failed to reach even a second edition, while the gen- 
uine ones have been reprinted hundreds of times. 



THE VERSATILITY OF OUR LATE AMBASSADOR 

TO ENGLAND must impress all who review even 
hastily the extent and variety of his achievements. 
Born at Xenia, Ohio, in 1837, Whitelaw Reid not 
unnaturally went for his college education to the 
near-by Miami University at Oxford, little dreaming 



that another and more famous Oxford would one day 
bestow upon him its most coveted degree of D.C.L. 
The young man's quickness to learn enabled him to 
complete the college course in three years and to get 
his diploma at the early age of nineteen. A few 
years of teaching followed, then came newspaper 
work, service as staff officer in the war, a three-years 
term as librarian of the House of Representatives, 
cotton-planting in Louisiana, further journalistic 
experience, and in 1872 the editorship and chief 
ownership of the New York "Tribune," for which 
journal he built the first of the now too-familiar 
sky-scrapers. For this newspaper, too, he bought 
the first linotype machines, and organized a com- 
pany for their manufacture and sale. In the field 
of education he also figured prominently, rising to 
the chancellorship of the University of the State of 
New York. In the diplomatic service, besides twice 
refusing the ministry to Germany, he has repre- 
sented this country in France and England, and has 
accepted a number of extraordinary missions. As 
author he is known for his "After the War," "Ohio 
in the War," "Schools of Journalism," "Newspaper 
Tendencies," "Problems of Expansion," and many 
other published utterances, including a large num- 
ber of public addresses on notable occasions. His 
well-selected library at his New York residence and 
that in his country house are ranked among the best 
of private libraries. So fine a union of statesman- 
ship, scholarship, and executive ability is rarely met 
with. . . . 

A CURIOUS TENDENCY IN WORDS, a tendency not 
without its deeper significance, is their well-known 
habit of standing for exactly contrary meanings, 
illustrating, as it were, the ease with which all things 
pass into their opposites, the fondness that extremes 
have for meeting. Without dwelling" on the anomaly 
whereby "fast" means both "firmly fixed" and 
"moving rapidly," or the puzzling fact that the neg- 
ative prefix un has a positive force in such words as 
"unloose" and "unravel," or the bewildering way 
many Italian words have of not living, up to their 
derivation (why, for example, should " scontraff are " 
not mean the opposite of " contraff are " if "scom- 
parire" means the opposite of " comparire " ?) 
without adducing a multitude of similar instances, 
we will bring this little philological disquisition to a 
close with a brief reference to an account, in the 
Manchester "Guardian," of the wager between two 
disputants as to the meaning of "lurid," one making 
it mean "deep red," and the other "pale." All the 
dictionaries accessible to the parties to this dispute 
gave the meaning " pale, wan, ghastly pale," but the 
"Guardian" has discovered that "the latest and 
greatest English dictionary " supports popular usage 
and gives the definition, "shining with a red glow or 
glare amid darkness ( said of lightning flashes across 
dark clouds or flame mingled with smoke)," and forti- 
fies its position with a quotation from Wordsworth. 
Nevertheless, the Latin luridus has commonly been 
taken to mean "pale yellow, wan, ghastly"; but may

NEW AIDS TO LIBRARY-USERS are constantly being 
devised by our alert and inventive librarians and 
their assistants. In the latest report of the Pratt 
Institute Free Library occurs mention of a recently 
adopted plan for furnishing illustrations to technical 
literature. The illustration takes the form of the 
actual machine or other object described in the text- 
book. For example, a model marine engine has for 
some time been on exhibition at the library; and now 
there has been secured from an automobile company 
"a complete 30 H. P. four-cylinder gasoline engine 
with parts cut open to show the action" a loan 
likely to benefit all parties concerned in the trans- 
action. Another somewhat novel feature at the 
same institution bears the name of the "Dinner- 
pail Library," a designation sufficiently self-explan- 
atory to call for little further elucidation here. The 
collection seems to have grown from an original 
nucleus of a practical library for Dr. Grenfell's 
Labrador mission, and now has its special card- 
catalogue and is in other ways brought to the atten- 
tion of mechanics and others likely to desire its 
privileges. Such developments as these on the 
popular and '' practical " side of library service would 
not attract all who may chance to read this para- 
graph; nevertheless they help to round out the gener- 
ous activities of the modern as distinguished from 
the grudgingly accommodating old-time library. 



AN ACHIEVEMENT IN EDITORSHIP AND BIBLIOG- 
RAPHY of which even the most industrious of German 
scholars might be proud is to be placed to the credit 
of Dr. Edward Arber, whose death by accident a 
few weeks ago makes English scholarship the poorer 
by one of its most learned and productive represen- 
tatives. Edward Arber was born in London, Decem- 
ber 4, 1836 ; served as clerk in the Admiralty from 
1854 to 1878 ; held a lectureship on English at 
University College under Professor Henry Morley 
from 1878 to 1881; and from 1881 to 1894 was 
professor of English at Mason College, Birmingham. 
Since 1894 he has lived in London as emeritus pro- 
fessor, being also a fellow of King's College, London. 
He has also been English examiner at London Uni- 
versity and at Victoria University, Manchester. But 
his chief service to the world of letters lies in his 
series of " English Reprints " (1868-80), whereby 
he has enabled the general public to gain easy access 
to an accurate text of early English authors that 
were formerly accessible only in rare and expensive 
editions; his "English Scholar's Library," in six- 
teen volumes ; his " English Garner," in eight vol- 
umes ; " British Anthologies " in ten volumes ; and 
a series begun five years ago and entitled " A Chris- 
tian Library." He also, unaided, edited two monu- 
mental English bibliographies, "A Transcript of the 



Registers of the Stationers' Company, 15531640," 
and "The Term Catalogues, 1668-1709, with a 
Number for Easter Term, 1711," edited from the 
quarterly booksellers' lists. In all these, and in 
other productions not mentioned here, Dr. Arber 
showed in full measure that peculiar variety of the 
scholar's taste and that dogged perseverance to 
which our reference libraries owe not merely a debt 
too vast for measurement, but, as one might say, 
their very existence. 

CHAOS IN CARD CATALOGUES is in more than one 
public library taking the place of a former cosmos, 
now that the cards approved by the A. L. A. and 
issued by the Library of Congress are making their 
way into drawers already partly filled with cards of 
a different pattern. Usually the old cards are nar- 
rower, so that if the old drawers can hold the new 
cards at all, the invaders project awkwardly above 
the aboriginal inhabitants, thus making the manipu- 
lation of the cards (already a process provocative of 
impolite language) more patience-trying than ever. 
Some libraries, especially the newer ones, adopt the 
obvious remedy of gradually replacing all the old 
cards with new ones of standard size. Others are con- 
tent, or at any rate are compelled, to leave the two 
sets of cards jostling each other in unsightly disorder. 
Still others, with even a million or more of old cards 
to re-write or re-print, will heroically and at great 
expense struggle into line with the latest standards. 
Attention is just now called to this troublesome ques- 
tion by the changes and improvements in prospect 
for Harvard's fine library. In its new two-million- 
dollar building, and modernly equipped in every 
other way, the library will be forced to substitute for 
its old-fashioned card catalogue one more in harmony 
with the latest official sanction in such matters ; and 
the replacing of a million and a half catalogue cards 
is no small task. ... 

COQUETTING WITH THE CLASSICS, rather than ear- 
nest and continuous study, is undoubtedly somewhat 
encouraged by the issue of so attractive a series of 
" cribs "as is offered at a moderate price by the 
publishers of the recently inaugurated " Loeb Class- 
ical Library." But many a piece of coquetry has 
ended in happy marriage; and so there are likely 
to be some who, dipping into the Loeb volumes as 
an easy way of brushing up their Greek and Latin, 
will be caught by the charm of the ancient text and 
gradually wooed to a complete disregard of the 
modern rendering on the opposite page. Relatively 
small though this number may be for Sophocles 
and Lucretius are not the easiest of reading even 
after years of classical study its growth might 
have been further encouraged by the use of a larger 
and clearer type for the Greek and Latin texts. 
Even the English is none too handsomely treated 
in this respect, but the greater familiarity with one's 
native tongue makes easily legible a size of type 
that would try the eye in reading a foreign language. 
Unwieldiness is of course to be avoided in the vol-

umes now issuing under such happy auspices ; never- 
theless a little more regard for the comfort of those 
readers (no longer in the first flush of youth) to 
whom the Loeb Library especially appeals, may not 
be out of the question in future volumes, and thus 
the bespectacled reader may be induced to do some- 
thing more than coquet with the Greek or Latin 
that faces the English translation. 

PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE ALCOTTS and their 
Concord home, the famous Orchard House, now 
preserved as a memorial of the family, or more 
especially of the gifted Louisa and her eccentric 
father (equally gifted in his peculiar way), is at- 
tested by the number of visitors to the above-named 
little house under the hill on the outskirts of the 
village. Mr. Frank B. Sanborn, in a recent " Boston 
Literary Letter " to the Springfield " Republican," 
says : " The Orchard House has been visited by 
more than six thousand pilgrims to this Mecca of 
Concord since it was opened to the public six months 
ago, and they have contributed nearly $1000 to the 
fund for maintaining the good old house." In this 
connection he further remarks : " It is a pity that 
the letters of Mrs. Alcott to her husband and friends, 
which were carefully copied out by Mr. Alcott after 
her death, were not wrought up into her biography 
by Louisa, who found she had not spirit enough for 
a work involving so many sad memories. Some of 
them afterward came out in the life of Alcott, in 
which were first published some thirty pages of 
Emerson, most of which have since been included 
in the Journals, or will be. They are among his 
most characteristic writing." 


THE FIRST QUARTER-CENTURY OF THE LIBRARY- 
SCHOOL IDEA has come to a close, and the advocate 
of a library-school education for librarians is no 
longer regarded as a crank. It was in 1887 that 
the New York State Library School, the parent of 
all subsequent institutions of the sort, had its modest 
beginnings in the Columbia College Library under 
the librarian's direction. Now, at the end of its first 
twenty-five years, it has, after sundry shif tings and 
wanderings, found a home worthy of its prestige in 
the new State Education Building at Albany, which 
has risen, not on the ruins left by the late disastrous 
fire in the State Capitol, but largely as a necessary 
consequence of that fire. A notable publication, in- 
teresting to all library workers, and to some others, 
marks the entrance of the school upon its second 
quarter-century and its instalment in its new home. 
"The First Quarter Century of the New York State 
Library School" is a generously illustrated, hand- 
somely printed pamphlet of sixty-two pages, wherein 
both Mr. Dewey, founder of the school, and a num- 
ber of his disciples, and of those later graduates not 
his immediate disciples, indulge in pleasing remi- 
niscence or in more matter-of-fact history all to 
the glory of the N.Y. S. L. S. It is a most enjoy- 
able symposium. 



ONE WAY TO REDEEM THE HUMAN MIND FROM 

ERROR is well illustrated in the founding of the 
Sturge Library for the Japanese of San Francisco. 
This library, named in honor of Dr. and Mrs. F. A. 
Sturge, known for their work of more than twenty- 
five years among the Japanese of the Pacific coast, 
and of its chief city especially, had its formal open- 
ing recently in the Japanese Y. M. C. A. building, 
with addresses in Japanese from Consul-General 
Nagai and Professor Guy of the State University, 
and the ceremonial delivery of the key to Dr. Sturge 
by Pastor Miyazaki. The collection already num- 
bers eight hundred Japanese and thirteen hundred 
English books, with some hundreds of unbound peri- 
odicals in both languages. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

CHRISTIANIZING THE SOCIAL ORDER. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

May I call attention to a thought suggested by 
B. R. Wilton's letter in your issue of December 1. He 
speaks of Socialism as a "great far-reaching system of 
social moralization and regeneration that promises to 
every individual a rational hope of freedom and self- 
realization." 

All the inspiration of our race has flowed from that 
source of Life Eternal, Jesus Christ. Countless men, at 
countless times, have drunk deep of His Spirit and have 
been given new life and courage to press on towards 
attainment, some using Art, others the Church, and 
many whatever instrument was at hand, to make their 
fellow-men bow down at the foot of the Cross; even 
the Agnostics, cast out by the Church, jeered at by the 
orthodox, have builded, some of them perhaps uncon- 
sciously, their share of the structure at which humanity 
must ever toil, the human heart. Perhaps the task 
had been easier if only the Peter in each one of us were 
not so ready to draw the sword, as did the Peter of old 
in the Garden ; the way is strewn with countless ears. 

Christ made no resistance when they came to arrest 
Him, nor did He seek to defend Himself against the 
hatred of the mob that jeered and mocked Him in the 
ensuing hours. Instead He shouldered the Cross with- 
out a murmer, and as His overflowing heart of love was 
released from the constraining bonds of the flesh He 
prayed that those who killed Him be forgiven! 

Then followed black days for the disciples, days of 
sorrow for the band of friends He left behind. Space 
will not permit me to follow the birth and growth of 
the early Church, nor to call attention to the psycho- 
logical tendencies which already were at work; but it 
must be noted that many of those who were in the lead, 
notably St. Paul, saw visions or were met by angels on 
the road, who gave them messages. And it was soon 
felt that organization, laws, and creeds (the very things 
which crucified Him) were necessary in order to save the 
message of Christ to the world; so it began to be that a 
man had to join the Church, conform to its ceremonials 
and support its sacraments, in order to reach Christ. 
Then came days of power and wealth, with " Christian" 
wars and " Christian "controversy, the very things which 
He had said must come, although He warned against 
them and never advocated them. Do we not at this 
point recall the disciples disputing as to which was

greatest, and the demands made at the trial that He 
show them His earthly Kingdom if He was King. 
This was the era of the Canonization of Love, and it has 
nearly passed. 

But now comes Socialism, with its systems of rnoral- 
ization and regeneration, and its promises of self- 
realization. Is not this but a " legislating " of that 
same Love which we all feel but have with so little suc- 
cess Canonized. Is the hope of humanity in any system 
of scientifically framed rules ? I cannot think so, nor 
do I think that under any system of rules will humanity 
ever find freedom and self-realization, although it may 
ever so vainly hope to. But I stand ready to let it try, 
and know that when its earthly kingdom totters, it will 
be better able to listen to the One who said " Come unto 
me all ye weary, and I will give you rest." 

We were warned that " false Christs and false pro- 
phets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders to se- 
duce," and we were told to take heed. How, then, am I to 
measure this man or that, whether he be a false prophet? 
Was St. Paul, was Mohamed, was Brigham Young, was 
Mrs. Eddy ? They all claim to have been instructed 
by an angel, and to speak with a voice of authority, as 
do the Catholic and Protestant Churches. They have 
their followers, and have each done his work, to be 
judged by others than we. I plead that those who 
have lost hope will forsake all other prophets, all other 
teachers, and will first open their hearts to the message 
which Jesus Christ laid down His life to give to the 
world, the heritage of every man and woman regardless 
of race or position in society (or the gutter), which rests 
on His life and His words and not on any system of 
education, ethical creed, or political party, although 
these may have been devised by sincere men, to advance 
His cause, or make it more easy and pleasant to follow 
Him. Then will we uncover the source of all our proud- 
est hopes and aspirations, then will we have new inspira- 
tion, and then know that never again can humanity 
completely lose hope, for we can ever help it to find 
new life. JAMES McALPiN PYLE.

ROBINSON CRUSOE AND TOBAGO. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Very prominent misstatements in two recent books, 
relative to Robinson Crusoe's connection with the island 
of Tobago, seem to warrant a restatement of the facts. 

Alexander Selkirk was a Scotch sailor who was put 
ashore, at his own request, after a quarrel with his cap- 
tain, on one of the islands of the Juan Fernandez group, 
in September, 1704. After four years and four months 
he was rescued. He afterwards became an officer in 
the British navy. He was not shipwrecked. Accounts 
of his experiences were published, notably that by Steele. 
There is also evidence that he placed his personal ac- 
count in the hands of Defoe. Robinson Crusoe's Island, 
as it is now called, in the Juan Fernandez group, is well 
known. Visitors there may to-day see his lookout and 
the cave, and members of the British navy have there 
erected a memorial to Alexander Selkirk. Selkirk's 
experiences were the undoubted basis for Defoe's im- 
mortal work. 

It is customary when basing works of fiction upon 
real events to change the names and the circumstances. 
Defoe determined to have his hero shipwrecked, which 
was not the case with Selkirk. He further wanted him 
to come gradually into contact with other members of 
the human race. The Juan Fernandez islands are far 



away from much travelled water routes. There were no 
natives there. There was no probability that he might 
be visited by cannibals. For these reasons Defoe arbitra- 
rily made his hero set sail from the coast of Brazil, and 
by a hurricane he was driven onto an island near the 
mouth of the Oronoco. This was a region much trav- 
elled, and the Caribs had a reputation as savages and 
cannibals. Tobago answers very well for the con ^.itions 
as portrayed by Defoe, and that island is therefore gen- 
erally agreed upon as the tropical island which Defoe 
had in mind in writing his fiction. 

Mr. Stephen Bonsai, in his new book on "The 
American Mediterranean," speaks of Tobago as " Rob- 
inson Crusoe's real home." In the fiction, this island 
was not the home of the hero, but the scene of his 
shipwreck. The expression " real home " is therefore 
misleading. Mr. Lindon Bates, Jr., in his " Path of the 
Conquisadores," is still further from the truth. The 
first sentence of his second chapter says : " The green 
slopes of Tobago, where the shipwreck of the real 
Alexander Selkirk inspired the ' Robinson Crusoe ' of 
Defoe, have been left behind in the dark mists of the 
Caribbean." As we have stated, Selkirk was not ship- 
wrecked, and we have no evidence that he was ever on 
the island. 

A more correct statement is found in Mr. W. A. 
Aspinwall's " The British West Indies," also recently 
issued : " Though the story of that book is based on 
the adventures of Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned 
on the island of Juan Fernandez, it is a generally accepted 
fact that Tobago was the island which Defoe had in his 
mind when he wrote his graphic descriptions of that 
tropical island on which poor Crusoe was wrecked."

THE AUTHOR OF "CANZONI." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I pause on a somewhat remarkable statement in your 
issue for Dec. 16, 1912. The statement occurs in the 
opening article, wherein it is said that the prizes in the 
" Lyric Year " competition went " to three men whose 
names are absolutely unknown to the general reading 
public." Two-thirds of this assertion I do not question, 
but I ask its reconsideration in the case of Mr. T.'A. 
Daly. In view of the fact that Mr. Daly has been a 
prominent journalist for twenty years or more, that he is 
the most widely copied " newspaper poet " in the United 
States, that he is the author of three volumes of verse, 
the first, "Canzoni," in its seventh or eighth thousand; 
the second, "Carmina," of which Mr. Jewett, late 
American manager of the John Lane Co., said he sold 
more copies than of any other poet, with the single ex- 
ception of Francis Thompson; the third, "Madrigali," 
just off the press and a widely-sought gift book on the 
Christmas market, it seems impossible to say that this 
author is " absolutely unknown to the general reading 
public." I do not speak of the newspaper men among 
whom, at least from New York to Chicago as witness 
Mr. Franklin P. Adams's account of the American Press 
Humorists' convention at Detroit this year, in a sum- 
mer issue of "The Editor and Publisher" "Tom" 
Daly's is a name to conjure by. A final indication that 
Mr. Daly is not an absolute obscurity is that he has been 
made the subject of an article in " The American Mag- 
azine," in the department, " Interesting People."

A GALAHAD OF ART.* 

" One day Gabriel took me out in a cab 

it was a day he was rich, so we went in a han- 
som, and we drove and drove until I thought 
we should arrive at the setting sun and he 
said, ' You must know these people, Ned ; you 
will see a painter there paints a queer sort oJ 
pictures, about God and Creation.' " So runs 
a note written in the late fifties by Edward 
Burne-Jones. The painter of the "queer sort 
of pictures, about God and Creation," to whom 
Rossetti was carrying the young man, was 
George Frederic Watts. And the end of that 
cab-ride through the west of London was the 
beginning of an affectionate intimacy between 
the two masters whose work forms the most 
precious heritage of later British art, an in- 
timacy that ceased only with the death of the 
younger, forty years later. The two were singu- 
larly alike in character and aspirations. " I 
have no politics," said Burne-Jones, "and no 
party, and no particular hope : only this is true, 
that beauty is very beautiful, and softens, and 
comforts, and inspires, and rouses, and lifts up, 
and never fails." Watts, as well, might have 
written these same words. 

It is not many years since Lady Burne-Jones 
published the widely-read "Memorials" of her 
husband ; and now, with equal fidelity and equal 
charm, Mrs. Watts has performed a like service 
for her hero and for us. Her " Annals of an 
Artist's Life," in two stately volumes, are ac- 
companied by a third containing Watts 's writ- 
ings, published and unpublished. The text is 
supplemented by thirty-nine finely-executed 
photogravure plates portraits of Watts, photo- 
graphs of his homes, reproductions of his work, 
etc. It would be a great pity if the third vol- 
ume were not later reprinted in separate and 
cheaper form, that its sane and eloquent coun- 
sel might have the widest possible circulation. 
Although disclaiming even the most ordinary 
aptitude for literary expression, Watts yet wrote 
with a simple nervous force that some of the 
giants of literature might well have envied. The 
jargon and dogmas of the schools, the technical 
small-talk of the studio, were alike distasteful 
to him; in his writing, as in his art- work, he 
concerned himself only with the fundamental

Writings. With numerous illustrations in photogravure.

verities of art and life, dealing always with the 
two in relation to one great purpose the 
progress of humanity. 

Mrs. Watts did not come into the artist's life 
until that life had been more than two-thirds 
lived. Thus she has had to construct her record 
for the sixty-nine years previous to his second 
marriage from his own and others' recollections. 
Her first volume, covering this period, is conse- 
quently far less interesting than the second. The 
authentic man scarcely begins to emerge from 
her pages until the point where she began to see 
him in the intimacies of every-day association. 
But throughout she has acquitted herself well, in 
what we can readily believe was a task of much 
difficulty and delicacy. We can point to no 
graver faults than a haziness of chronology, and 
an mdefiniteness in the use of pronouns. It may 
seem to some readers that the tone of unvarying 
praise is maintained at too high a pitch. But 
to his wife, as to all who knew him well, Watts 
was "a spirit without spot"; and if there are 
no lower lights in these pages it is only because 
there were none in that life of radiant spiritu- 
ality which they record. 

Watts's history is in the main a long and out- 
wardly uneventful chronicle of laborious days. 
Whole-hearted devotion to work was the law of 
his being, and to that law all other considerations 
and interests were made to conform. His boy- 
hood was devoid of advantages or happiness. He 
had little schooling, save what he obtained for 
himself from Homer and Phidias. But a habit 
of settled perseverance in cultivating natural 
talents made his progress rapid. In his early 
twenties he carried off first honors in an import- 
ant competition, and with the proceeds was en- 
abled to go to Italy. Here he spent four fruitful 
and happy years, mainly in Florence, where he 
was admitted at once to that intellectual Olympus 
of which Lord and Lady Holland were the reg- 
nant deities. Later, both before and after mar- 
riage, he made an occasional journey abroad 
to Greece, to Egypt, and again to Italy. But 
tor the most part his life was that of his studio, 
either in London or in Surrey, where he painted 
or chiselled almost unremittingly from dawn 
until the failing of the afternoon light. Those 
who sought him out, as did all the choicest spirits 
of his time, found him prodigal of hospitality ; 
yet he rarely appeared in society or in public. In 
;his self-seclusion there was no slightest trace of 
doistered indifference to the ordinary concerns 
of mankind, few men, indeed, have been more 
: ully in touch with the spirit of their time. It 
was simply the necessary habit of a great worker 



12 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



sternly aware, on the one hand, of life's brevity, 
and, on the other, of the immensity and high 
seriousness of his task. To him the petty pull- 
ing and hauling of conventional "social duties 
were a self -sacrilege to which he would not and 
could not submit. Nothing chafed him more 
than the time, so sorrowfully great in the aggre- 
gate, which he was forced to waste " in being sick 
and getting well." Until within a few weeks of 
his death, at the age of eighty-seven, his working 
hours were those of the birds and flowers. 

" He was always so glad when the day of work began, 
and the duty of a night's rest had been got over. I often 
wondered at the quiet joy that seemed then to come to 
him ; but as the old Egyptian poet said, " That trans- 
porteth man to God even the love of the work that he 
accomplisheth.' ' A new day,' Signor said one early 
morning, ' let us begin our chant of praise for it and see 
how well we can praise.' On one cold December morning 
at five o'clock he awoke to say, ' Oh, I am so glad the 
night is passed.' ' Why?' I asked, seeing that he had 
slept like a child. ' Because I want to get to my work,' 
he answered, and then, if ever, I understood the life and 
hope there is in all creative work. Nearing eighty, frail 
and delicate as he was, neither creature comforts nor 
even necessary rest were grateful to him when compared 
with this work, that in its nature partook of the creative 
and of the eternal." 

"Signor," it should be mentioned parentheti- 
cally, was the name by which Watts was always 
known to his intimates. He disliked the harsh 
and unpoetic sound of his own surname, and it 
was rarely used in his hearing. 

It is remarkable that one so often considered 
chiefly or solely in the capacity of portrait- 
painter should have found this work repugnant 
and considered that his forte lay elsewhere. 
In refusing a portrait commission, Watts once 
wrote to Mrs. Cameron : 

"Nature did not intend me for a portrait-painter, 
and if I have painted portraits decently it is because I 
have tried so very hard, but it has ever cost me more 
labour to paint a portrait than to paint a subject- 
picture. I have given it up in sheer weariness; now 
come what may, my time must in future be devoted to 
the endeavour to carry out some of my large designs, 
and if I fail either to make a living or to do anything 
worthy of an artist (as I understand the term), I fail, 
but I submit to the drudgery of portrait-painting no 
longer." 

Happily, this resolve was not kept ; and though 
the subject-pictures were ever foremost in his 
thoughts, he yet came to consider portraiture 
as a not uncongenial interlude between his 
higher tasks. 

Passionate devotion to his work and to the 
truth, humility and simplicity and generosity 
of spirit, these are the dominant character- 
istics of the man, as revealed in Mrs. Watts's 
record. With whatever persistence he toiled, 



the largeness and splendor of his vision so out- 
distanced his achievement as always to leave 
him dissatisfied. "I wonder how it is that I 
cannot do what I want," he would say sadly, 
looking about his gallery at those marvellous 
portraits. Praise was distasteful and even 
painful to him. "I have no more wish to be 
praised for . my work than a bricklayer who 
builds a wall expects praise for his brick-laying. 
If the wall answers a good purpose that is 
enough; of course it should be built as well as 
possible so much a matter of course that 
praise should not be called for." But some 
lowly word of gratitude for courage and conso- 
lation derived from his pictures always touched 
him deeply. " The whole reward of my life lies 
just in those few sentences," he said of one 
such message. Determined that the magnificent 
series of "ethical reflections," as he called the 
subject-pictures which formed his principal life- 
work, should go as a heritage to the nation, 
he refused time after time the most extravagant 
offers from private sources; though he was 
never wealthy, or even what might be considered 
well-to-do. Yet the free and willing service 
of his brush could invariably be counted upon 
in any high disinterested cause. Twice he was 
offered a baronetcy, and twice he refused, feel- 
ing that to one of his ascetic ways the title was 
an incongruity. "So you won't let them make 
you Sir George," remarked one of his friends. 
" Well, never mind, you will be Saint George, 
anyway." And Saint George he will be, so long 
as nobility of character finds praise in the world. 
While the figure of her artist-husband is 
always to the fore in Mrs. Watts's pages, his 
great contemporaries pass in shining procession 
across the background. Tennyson is the one we 
see most of, but Ruskin, Carlyle, Meredith, 
Gladstone, Burne- Jones, Leighton, Rossetti, and 
a host of others show forth here and there in 
casual glimpses. Though he had always with- 
held from painting Ruskin's portrait through 
fear of not being able to do justice to his sub- 
ject, Watts's regard and respect for the Master 
were unbounded. "How earnestly he pleads 
for all that would develop the best in humanity," 
he said one day to his wife. " In another gener- 
ation he will be placed as the greatest thinker 
of the age." Early in life Watts had once, in 
a mood of depression, put the word " Finis " 
in the corner of one of his pictures. " But the 
challenge to despair was given by Mr. Ruskin, 
who, on reading the word, took up the charcoal 
and added beneath, ' et initium.' If the end, 
then a beginning ; and so it proved to be." It

is interesting to note the painter's dictum that 
of all his sitters our own Motley was by far the 
finest talker. Carlyle's inveterate contempt for 
art crops out amusingly in his opinion of the 
Elgin marbles " There is not a clever man 
amongst them all, and I would away with them, 
away with them into space." Here is a glimpse 
of " Signor " himself, as well as of others, as 
they appeared to a visitor (Lady Constance 
Leslie) at Little Holland House in the earlier 
days: 

" It was in 1856, when we were first engaged to be 
married, that John took me to what was to me a new 
world something I had never imagined before of 
beauty and kindness. I was a very ignorant little girl, 
and oh how proud I felt, though rather unworthy of 
what seemed holy ground. The Signor came out of his 
studio all spirit and so delicate, and received me very 
kindly as John's future wife. Thackeray was there with 
his young daughters, Coutts Lindsay, Jacob Omnium, 
and Lady Somers glorious and benevolent. Signor was 
the whole object of adoration and care in that house. 
He seemed to sanctify Little Holland House. I also 
remember well the Sunday, June 13, 1858, when we 
were dining with the Prinseps, Alfred Tennyson, Ros- 
setti, Tom Taylor, Adelaide Sartoris, Edward Burne- 
Jones, Coutts Lindsay, and Richard Doyle. Adelaide 
Sartoris sang his own poems to Tennyson. In later 
years arose the vision of beauty, dear May Prinsep, and 
I remember seeing Val carry young Philip Burne-Jones 
upstairs such a contrast ! Val as St. Christopher ! " 

And, for a final quotation, we select this char- 
acteristic anecdote of Tennyson, not long before 
his death, when poet and painter come together 
for the last time : 

" We were at Farringford by eleven. Lady Tenny- 
son greeted us as of old even more tenderly with 
eyes brimming with gratitude, and after a few minutes 
the poet joined us. There was talk of everything but 
painting, and later we all, save the dear lady on her 
sofa, walked back to the Briary through the sweet old- 
fashioned garden, gay with spring flowers. Signor and 
Lord Tennyson walked in front, falling naturally into 
their old habits, recalling old days and stories that made 
them laugh. But the poet had had a letter from a 
stranger which had touched him where he was made 
vulnerable because made poet; and he complained bit- 
terly of the intrusive writer, working himself up so 
much that in the end he exclaimed in answer to Signer's 
remark that ' such intrusions were but the cost of fame ' 
' I wish I had never written a line in my life.' Where- 
upon Signor took up his parable and remonstrated, ' Ah, 
now you would not have made your Arthur speak like 
that ! ' And the great man instantly turned penitent, 
and putting out his hand, said, ' Well, there, look at my 
hand ; it is the gout ! ' " 

Facing the beginning of each chapter 
throughout these volumes is a quotation, in all 
but two instances selected from Watts's own 
writings. One of the exceptions is this from 
Bacon: "Certainly it is heaven upon earth, to 
have a man's mind move in charity, rest in 
Providence, and turn upon the poles of truth." 



Such a mind, surely, was that of George 
Frederic Watts ; and it is the especial service 
of his wife's record that through it we come to 
realize that however great he may have been as 
an artist (and he was one of the greatest of any 
country and any time) , he was still greater as a 
man. His was the Greek conception of all life 
as an organic whole, to the advancement and 
enrichment of which art was the highest instru- 
ment. The old heresy of "art for art's sake " 
was never more effectually refuted than by his 
work and his life. In his old age he wrote : " My 
great and ever constant desire is to identify 
artistic outcome with all that is good and great 
in every creed and utterance, and all that is 
inspiring in every record of heroism, of suffering, 
of effort, and of achievement." It could not lie 
within the powers of any man to realize single- 
handed that splendid ambition which was his 
of creating a great pictorial House of Life, a 
temple in which should be visualized the entire 
story of man's ethical progress; yet he did at 
least succeed in raising a noble portico to such 
a temple, within whose shelter mankind will ever 
find much of its noblest inspiration and comfort.

Two 



ANTHOLOGIES.* 



Like the writing of history, the making of 
an anthology is a thing of chance and peril. It 
is a matter about which many people are almost 
vitally interested. We have been told that fam- 
ilies were broken up over the dispute whether 
Gray or Collins was the greater poet, and there 
is no doubt that the question of the supremacy 
of Goethe or Schiller has occasioned duels. The 
man who sets up as the arbiter of such matters 
makes himself a conspicuous mark for criticism. 
We may pity him as a martyr, but our hands 
instinctively proceed to pelt. 

It is a mark of a change in the temper of the 
times that the Universities have begun to patron- 
ize poetry. Mr. Quiller- Couch's " Oxford Book 
of English Verse " is succeeded by Mr. Louns- 
bury's " Yale Book of American Verse." Mr. 
Lounsbury has so many claims to distinction in 
other fields that reputation as the mere gatherer 
of a garland can mean little to him.

is this : to give nothing but the best, to give all 
the best, and not to be swayed by historic esti- 
mate. Modified a little by his wish to arrange 
his flowers effectively, that is the law which 
Palgrave followed in his " Golden Treasury." 
It can hardly be said that Mr. Lounsbury has 
been so guided. He seems a little afraid of the 
reputations with which he is dealing, or else in- 
disposed to let any two or three poets dominate. 
As far as the eight or ten best-known American 
poets are concerned, Mr. Lounsbury has given 
them about an even chance, given them equal 
compartments in his book. 

Our first protest must be in regard to the 
treatment of Emerson. There are hardly more 
than a scant half-dozen of Emerson's poems 
which have the completeness and concreteness, 
the movement and the atmosphere, of a genuine 
lyric. Two of the best of these, " Uriel " and 
" The Romany Girl," Mr. Lounsbury omits. 
" Brahma," " The Concord Hymn," " Days," 
and " Rhodora " are admitted. The rest of 
Emerson's poetry consists of bundles of gnomic 
sentences or almost unrelated gatherings of 
nature pictures. But many of these sentences 
are such as the Arabs would have written in 
gold on the walls of their mosques ; and many of 
the pictures have a grace and magic unmatched 
in our literature. The coldness of English crit- 
ical opinion as to Emerson's poetry, as distin- 
guished from his poems, is remarkable. From 
Matthew Arnold down to Churton Collins there 
seems to be but one opinion. Yet Arnold's say- 
ing that Longfellow's " Bridge " or Whittier's 
" School Days " is of more poetic value than 
the whole of Emerson's verse is one of his most 
extraordinary lapses of judgment. As well say 
that a symmetrical block of quartz is of more 
value than a spadeful of blue earth in which are 
embedded a hundred diamonds. Surely we can- 
not be wrong in America in recognizing the 
exultant and triumphant ring of so many of 
Emerson's lines and passages, the purity and 
perfection of so many of his pictures. For the 
glory of our poetry what is needed to do in an 
American anthology is to throw aside for the 
nonce any strict definition of lyric verse and to 
give these treasures, either in their shapeless 
mould or broken from the matrix. We need 
"Each and All," "Destiny," " Woodnotes," 
" Ode to Beauty," " Give All to Love," " Mer- 
lin," "Bacchus," "Fate," "Boston Hymn," 
"Voluntaries," " The Titmouse," "Terminus," 
and probably a good deal more. Mr. Louns- 
bury gives none of this. He does give " The 
Humble-Bee"! "I don't like 'The Humble- 



Bee,' " said FitzGerald, and we think he was 
right. He also gives " The Fable," which is 
pretty trivial, and " To Eva," which is abso- 
lutely bad. With the exception of Bryant in 
" O Fairest of the Rural Maids," the older New 
England poets never succeeded in pieces of love, 
admiration, or gallantry, and Emerson is the 
coldest of them all. 

Bryant is the second or third in rank of Ameri- 
can poets, and for Mr. Lounsbury's treatment of 
him we have nothing but praise. It is admirable, 
adequate, very nearly all-embracing. We might 
plead for the admission of a few more pieces, so 
that he should not be overtopped in number or 
quantity by Holmes and Whittier, but 't is very 
well as it is. 

Not so in regard to Poe. It is the bounden 
duty of an American anthologist to put his best 
foot foremost. To change the phrase, Poe is the 
best card he has to play. No contemporary in 
England or America quite matches him in emo- 
tional thrill, the secret of haunting cadence, 
verbal perfection, and newness of note. Of 
such things as these is lyric poetry made. We 
have pleaded for Emerson because of his nobility 
of thought and vividness of phrase. But in a 
lyric anthology the sermon must give place to 
the song. The eight pieces of Poe which Mr. 
Lounsbury gives are well enough selected, if we 
are to have no more. But we ought to have 
more, and the best critical opinion justifies the 
demand. Mr. Stedman apparently considered 
" Israfel " Poe's finest piece. Mr. Quiller-Couch 
includes in his "Oxford Book of Verse" the 
poems, "To Helen," "Annabel Lee," and "For 
Annie." Mr. Dawson and some of the younger 
English critics set up " The City of the Sea" as 
Poe's supreme poem. The early " Lenore " and 
" Bridal Ballad " are unsurpassed in melody and 
shot through with emotion. The lines "To 
Helen " perhaps taught Tennyson the secret of 
lyric blank verse. All these should be given, 
not for Poe's sake, but for the benefit of the 
anthology. 

We must question Mr. Lounsbury's award 
of fame, his roll call of titles, in the case of one 
more poet, and then we are done with cavilling. 
Aldrich is perhaps the surest classic of the more 
recent names. Mr. Lounsbury at most ignores 
the profounder side of his genius evidenced 
in the highly imaginative "Identity," and the 
pathetically thrilling "Prescience." He does 
not give the finely phrased "Memory," which 
Whittier insisted on Aldrich repeating to him 
again and again; nor the two sonnets, "Sleep" 
and "Enamour'd Architect of Airy Rhyme." 



1913.] 



THE DIAL 



15 



"Forever and a Day" has an exquisite lyric 
movement, and "Thalia" is perhaps Aldrich's 
masterpiece of gaiety ; yet neither is included. 

One considerable poet is entirely ignored. 
Bayard Taylor's " Arab Song "is the fieriest love 
poem in American literature. And his " Song of 
the Camp" has a charm and naturalness which 
have made it a general favorite. One suspects 
a slight preference in Mr. Lounsbury's mind for 
popular over classic verse. This comes out in 
the very full measure he has given to Whittier, 
Longfellow, and Holmes. It is equally evident 
in the preservation of many fugitive poems 
which have had a vogue in our country. Among 
these are Butler's "Nothing to Wear," Lucy 
Larcom's "Hannah Binding Shoe's," Lytle's 
"Antony and Cleopatra," Nora Perry's "After 
the Ball," and Emma Willard's "Rocked in the 
Cradle of the Deep." The collection is partic- 
ularly rich in war poems. Nearly all of the best 
martial verse written in America is enshrined 
here, including Halpine's "The Thousand and 
Thirty-Seven," Hoffman's "Monterey," Julia 
Ward Howe's " Battle Hymn of the Republic," 
McMaster's "Carmen Bellicosum," O'Hara's 
" Bivouac of the Dead," Palmer's "San Jacinto " 
and " Stonewall Jackson's Way," Randall's 
"My Maryland," Read's "Sheridan's Ride," 
Shanly's "Fancy Shot," and the anonymous 
" Home Wounded." We miss Timrod's " Little 
Giffen" and Stedman's "Ossawatomie Brown." 
As poetry can hardly do anything better than 
record and inspire heroism, so a national an- 
thology can serve no better purpose than in 
enshrining such poems of valor and devotion. 
Mr. Lounsbury is to be thanked for giving so 
many of them. 

He is to be thanked too, we think, for his 
decision to include humorous verse. There is, 
of course, a certain lowering of tone consequent 
on such inclusion, and the English anthologists 
have as a rule avoided it. Except in the work 
of Burns, humorous poetry rarely rises to the 
heights, and the very idea of an anthology of 
poetry is to keep in the region of the heights. 
But humorous verse is a strong feature of our 
literature. In what might be called team work, 
Holmes, Lowell, Aldrich, Bret Harte, and John 
Hay certainly outdo and outplay Hood, Praed, 
Tennyson, and Calverley. 

And that brings us to the final question, 
what is the value of American lyric poetry in 
comparison with the work of contemporary 
English authors ? In mass of good work and in 
the handling of large conceptions, the Victorian 
poets unquestionably surpass their American 



rivals. Not so in quality, in freshness of note, 
or in delicacy and perfection of handling. The 
Victorian age in poetry is itself secondary 
and immensely inferior to the Georgian epoch. 
Between two ideal anthologies, English and 
American, of the fifty years from 1830 on, we 
believe that the weight of merit would tremble 
in the balance. Mr. Lounsbury's collection is 
not an ideal one, but it approximates to what 
could be wished. 

To turn from this volume to Mr. Burton 
Egbert Stevenson's " Home Book of Verse " is 
like turning from a slender tributary into 
the main stream into a veritable Amazon of 
poetry. Here is the lyric work of eleven gener- 
ations of the English-speaking race. Thoughts, 
passions, deeds of uncounted myriads which 
have found embodiment in words of winged song 
are crowded between the covers of one book. 
Such a volume has long been desired. All 
previous single-volume anthologies have neces- 
sarily irritated by lack of completeness. They 
give us a gleaning, and not a full harvest. In 
this book, however, there is "God's plenty" 
the abundance of the earth and of the sea. 

The volume itself is one of the most compact 
and admirable ever issued from the American 
press. Printed on India paper, the text in clear 
type, it contains with introduction and indices 
nearly four thousand pages. One is tempted 
to quote after Macaulay the fable of the Peri 
Banou's tent. It opens up a vista of what may 
happen if this thin paper comes into general use : 
how libraries will shrink ; how we may almost 
be able to carry the literature of the world in 
one trunk. 

Of course the number of pages in the book 
is of less importance than what the compiler has 
done with them. The first question that comes 
up is his method of arrangement. Most pre- 
vious anthologies follow the plain and simple 
method of introducing the authors chronologi- 
cally, each one shepherding his separate flock of 
poems. This plan not only gives no scope for 
the compiler's artistic feeling, but it is annoying 
to the reader as well. The continued change in 
theme and style compels sudden alterations in 
the focus of the mind's eye. The original Greek 
Anthology made some attempt at groupings by 
kinds and subjects ; but we fancy that it was 
Wordsworth's arrangement of his works into 
Poems of the Affections, Poems of Fancy, Poems 
of Imagination, and so forth, which gave the 
idea of a new method. Bryant and Coates, in 
" The Household Book of Poetry," followed this 



16 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



system, and Palgrave used it in an infinitely 
more subtle and effective way. Mr. Stevenson's 
groupings are still more elaborate, and his head- 
ings and titular poems evince a high order of 
taste and poetic instinct. He begins with 
" Poems of Youth and Age," to which he pre- 
fixes Keats 's sonnet " The Human Seasons." 
The sub-titles of this section are " The Baby," 
" In the Nursery,"" The Road to Slumberland," 
"The Duty of Children," " Khymes of Child- 
hood," " The Glad Evangel," " Fairyland," 
" The Children," " Maidenhood," " The Man," 
" The Woman," " Stepping Westward," and 
" Looking Backward." We cannot follow him 
through the divisions of the other sections, 
the " Poems of Love," " Poems of Nature," 
" Familiar Verse," " Poems of Sentiment and 
Reflection," and " Poems of Sorrow, Death and 
Immortality." Enough to say that he has put 
a great deal of thought into the ordering of his 
selections, and has shown a nice sense of values 
in the juxtaposition of them. 

A burning question in regard to such a col- 
lection is the admission of living poets. Mr. 
Lounsbury put his foot down firmly. " Nobody 
shall enter here but the dead," he says, and this 
has been the general rule. That it is a correct 
one, can hardly be questioned. The living poets 
are unplaced they have no right to take their 
seats with the immortals. But popularity is the 
note of Mr. Stevenson's book: popularity is 
indeed necessary to support so expensive an 
undertaking. Novelty is a great spur to pop- 
ularity, and if the compiler is willing to risk 
his critical reputation in crowning or rejecting 
his contemporaries, we do not know that it much 
matters. That he has diluted his wine with a 
good deal of water we certainly do not doubt. 
Pip's friend in " Great Expectations " expati- 
ated to him on the advantages of " having a 
margin." Mr. Stevenson has been rather ex- 
travagant in the security which his margin of 
India paper gave him, and he has had to curtail 
sometimes to his cost. After all, the great things 
are mostly here. We get the central glowing 
core of English song, and if this is surrounded 
by a nebulous envelope why, this last may 
some time condense into planets. 

A certain lack of proportion is a more serious 
fault of the book. William Collins is given 
three selections, and Thomas Haynes Bayly 
seven. Allowing for all possible divergencies 
of taste, there is not that difference. Thomas 
Gray, also, is somewhat scanted in. his sizings. 
He has five poems, while Mr. Austin Dobson 
has thirty-one. James Russell Lowell has four- 



teen poems, and Elizabeth Akers Allen has 
eleven. James Clarence Mangan has only one 
poem to his credit, and Mr. Yeats is not any too 
well represented by eight. We do not believe 
that the latter, however, would endorse this 
comparative award. Chatterton gets one ticket 
to immortality, while Hartley Coleridge has 
eight a judgment which would make the elder 
Coleridge's hair stand up on his head. Eleven 
of Milton's poems and sonnets are quoted, and 
sixteen of Proctor's songs. Scott has seventeen 
pieces, and Thomas Moore thirty-three. We 
might go on to a considerable extent 'in exhib- 
iting these incongruities, but it is not worth 
while. They tend, we think, to show that Mr. 
Stevenson draws rather towards the light and 
trivial than to the grave and weighty things of 
poetry, which is probably all the better for 
the popularity of his book. 

Coming down to more specific inclusions or 
exclusions, Mr. Stevenson seems to be somewhat 
prejudiced against the ode as a form of poetry. 
Dryden's "Anne Killegrew," Gray's "Bard," 
Collins's " Ode to Liberty," " On the Poetical 
Character," and the great " Highland Ode," Cole- 
ridge's "France," "The Departing Year," and 
"Ode in Dejection," Byron's "Ode to Venice" 
and "Napoleon," Tennyson's "Death of the 
Duke of Wellington," and Lowell's " Commemo- 
ration Ode " are all omitted. That an American 
anthologist should fail to give the last seems 
almost incredible. 

Ballads fare better. Mr. Quiller-Couch's 
Oxford Book was overweighted with old English 
ballads. Mr. Stevenson gives quite as many of 
these, which his "margin " allows him to carry. 
He also gives a considerable number of modern 
ballads. Scott's "Cadyow Castle" and "Cara- 
doc " are missing, however, and Mrs. Browning's 
"Lady Geraldine's Courtship," "Rhyme of the 
Duchess May," and "Bertha in the Lane." 
Some of us are disposed to think these the most 
valuable part of her work. Rossetti's powerful 
ballad-poems are also omitted. 

Running over the greater poets of the book, 
we should quarrel with Shakespeare's represen- 
tation, especially in the sonnets. Fifteen are 
given, and two or three times that number would 
not have been too many, even if some of the 
other sonnet-sequences, old or new, had to be 
cut short. Only three of Milton's pieces of this 
kind are here. The two men are the supreme 
masters of the two opposed sonnet forms. They 
sounded all the notes of those instruments, and 
they are entitled to be heard in full. Burns 
may fairly claim to be the greatest lyrist of our 



1913.]

language. He is the only one whose lyrical poetry 
raises him to the rank of a great creative artist. 
But of course the poems in which he displays 
this power, "The Jolly Beggars," "The Holy 
Fair," "Holy Willie's Prayer," and pieces of 
that kind, are unsuited to a compilation of home 
verse. A whole side of Burns's genius is there- 
fore unrepresented by Mr. Stevenson, or repre- 
sented only by "Tarn O'Shanter." Of all the 
poets in the book, Wordsworth, Shelley, and 
Keats show forth most adequately. The selec- 
tions from each one may fairly be accounted 
perfect. This is hardly the case with Tennyson, 
though fifty of his pieces are quoted. But the 
philosophical turn of his mind is practically ig- 
nored. Nothing of the earlier pieces of thought, 
" The Two Voices," " Palace of Art," " Vision of 
Sin," is given, and nothing of "In Memoriam." 
As the great skeptical poem of the age, Fitz- 
Gerald's "Omar," is quoted in full, though 
only a translation, the utter rejection of "In 
Memoriam," the poem of struggling faith, seems 
somewhat remarkable. 

To deal with the entire mass of English 
lyrical poetry, satisfy the just claims of all the 
poets, and answer the expectation of all read- 
ers, would be a manifest impossibility. Mr. 
Stevenson has done better than anybody else. 
He has given us a body of verse such as has 
never before been brought together in one vol-

THE ^ESTHETIC SIDE OF BOOK-MAKING.* 

An impatient world can never quite under- 
stand the scholar's reasons for not being in 
haste to give forth the knowledge he has pa- 
tiently accumulated. No other man perceives 
the limitations of that knowledge so clearly as 
he who knows more about his chosen subject 
than anyone else knows. And if he have true 
scholarly feeling, he will want to take all the 
time that may be necessary to perfect his in- 
formation before spreading it broadcast. He 
realizes the importance of accuracy in the 
minutest details. Others may know far less 
than he, and lack his comprehending vision; 
yet happening to possess some scraps of know- 
ledge that he has overlooked, they are apt to 
test his work by these minor items, and finding 
it wanting, to distrust his conclusions accord- 
ingly. Beyond the desire to avoid this, he will

Sons. 



value accuracy for its own sake. To yield any 
satisfaction the work must stand the test of the 
most exacting and captious criticism. 

It is in this spirit that Mr. Alfred W. Pollard 
writes about "Fine Books." The treatise that 
he contributes to the excellent series known as 
"The Connoisseur's Library" has been ten 
years in preparation, and, within that period, 
much of it has been rewritten two or three 
times. The result of this scrupulous care is a 
volume which every collector of beautiful books 
and every student of the history of printing 
and of book-illustration must find indispensable. 
This, of course, is what might be expected from 
a scholar of Mr. Pollard's reputation. Of his 
qualifications it is hardly necessary to speak, as 
they are so preeminent and so widely known. 
Not only is his whole life spent among the fine 
books in the library of the British Museum, 
of which he is one of the Assistant Keepers, 
but he is consulted by other students throughout 
the world, his facilities for keeping informed of 
every new discovery, whether of past or present 
achievement, are unexampled, and he is the 
author of a number of books about books and 
book-making, all of which stand deservedly high. 

The aim of the present work is a survey of 
the whole ground from the beginning of print- 
ing and printed book-illustration down to the 
present day. So far as printing is concerned, 
this aim has been carried out ; very fully in the 
case of books published in the fifteenth and six- 
teenth centuries ; somewhat less so when dealing 
with seventeenth and eighteenth century books, 
because of the smaller number having conspic- 
uous merit ; and rather cursorily in the case of 
nineteenth century books. To the author's great 
regret, the survey of book illustration could only 
be brought down to about 1780. A chapter in 
which he intended dealing with the development 
of this branch of his subject during the succeed- 
ing one hundred and thirty years had to be 
abandoned, as the extent of the material made 
it impossible to describe it within the limits set 
for the volume, or to complete the task " during 
his working life." 

The plan of the book is most admirable. In 
a preliminary chapter on " Collectors and 
Collecting " some general considerations are 
presented, and a plea is made for intelligent 
collecting and specialization. " The bare plea- 
sure of collecting for the sake of collecting " is 
happily stigmatized as " an ignoble delight in 
indulging acquisitiveness, redeemed to some 
extent by the higher pleasure of overcoming 
difficulties and observing the rules of the game." 



18 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



This is well said, and we may commend also 
the statement that "the ignorant book collector, 
until he has educated himself, is like a rose- 
fancier who cannot distinguish one odour from 
another." That students' and collectors' pre- 
dilections for particular things should be some- 
what disproportionate to their intrinsic import- 
ance he regards as quite natural. "I myself 
am conscious," he tells us, "that I have looked 
at so many fifteenth century woodcuts, as com- 
pared with other works of art, that I distinctly 
overrate them." And to this he adds : " Mr. 
Robert Proctor, who knew more about fifteenth 
century books than any other man has ever 
known, or is likely to know, once said to me in 
all seriousness, that he did not think he had ever 
seen an ugly one." 

The contention that age and rarity can lend 
little or nothing to the attractiveness of books 
that are otherwise uninteresting is a point well 
taken. The qualities which ought to appeal to 
the collector are strength and beauty of form, 
and associations, historical, personal, or purely 
literary. All these furnish legitimate sources 
of delight to the cultivated mind. With the 
literary considerations that bring books within 
the collector's scope the author does not attempt 
to deal. Instead he confines his scrutiny, for 
the most part, to such volumes as are " prized 
either for their typographical beauty, their place 
in the history of printing, or the charm of their 
illustrations." 

With this brief introduction Mr. Pollard pro- 
ceeds to review the work of the printers who 
have turned out books of any distinction, and 
the various kinds of fine books that have been 
produced since movable types were invented. 
The classification is conveniently made by coun- 
tries and towns as well as by periods. Illustra- 
tion is treated in separate chapters, a method 
that involves some repetition but makes for 
greater clarity. There is a chapter about block- 
books, and several chapters are devoted to incun- 
abula. This slang expression and the selection 
of the purely arbitrary date 1500, "used to 
invest all fifteenth century impressions with a 
mystic value," Mr. Pollard properly character- 
izes as " misleading nuisances." His account 
of the beginnings of printing is a model of what 
scholarly writing should be. The evidences are 
presented succinctly and clearly, and while in- 
dicating his views regarding them, the reader is 
never in doubt as to his openness of mind. Con- 
clusions upon doubtful points are either avoided 
or expressed with extreme caution, as in the 
case of the Coster legend, which is examined at 



some length. Despite the untrustworthiness of 
the evidences upon which it is based, Mr. Pollard 
finds it " difficult to dismiss it as less than a 
legend which must have had some element of 
fact as its basis," and considers it probable that 
some kind of printing was practiced in Holland 
" not long after 1440." Strangely he omits any 
notice of the contracts discovered at Avignon 
in 1890 by the Abbe Requin, in one of which, 
dated July 4, 1444, a jeweller of Prague, named 
Procopius Waldfogel, then living in Avignon, 
mentions two alphabets in steel, two iron forms, 
one iron vise or press, forty-eight forms in pew- 
ter, and various other forms necessary for the 
art of " writing artificially." 

Mr. Pollard's account of the development of 
printing is in sufficient detail to indicate clearly 
the various influences that gave it direction. The 
extraordinary quality of the printing done by 
Fust and Schoeffer he attributes to their deter- 
mination to rival the best shop-made manuscripts. 
When the printed book displaced the work of 
the scribe, the printers no longer had the same 
standard for a guide, and commercial reasons 
soon brought about a rapid deterioration of the 
product of their presses. "One of the legacies 
which the early printers received from the 
scribes," as Mr. Pollard is careful to point out, 
"was the art of putting their text handsomely 
on the page, and the difference which this makes 
in the appearance of a book is very marked, 
little as many modern printers and publishers 
attend to it." He might, indeed, have put the 
case even more strongly. It is not too much to 
say that no book can be regarded as " fine " unless 
the margins are right. The proportions which 
the author gives for the relation between the 
printed text and the page upon which it appears 
are excellent, though he does not attempt more 
than a general statement, and he does not indicate 
the necessity that the diagonals should coincide, 
perhaps for the reason that they must do so if 
the rule that he lays down be followed. 

Regarding Mr. Pollard's dictum that " one of 
the chief charms of the books of the fifteenth 
century is that they are so unlike those of our 
own day," opinions may well differ. No person 
of taste will question, however, the justice of his 
condemnation of the types used by Aldus, and of 
the mischievous effects that followed the intro- 
duction of italics by that printer. Similarly his 
strictures upon the defects of Estiennes's royal 
Greek types, and upon the evil influence exer- 
cised by Plantin, will meet with hearty approval. 
In regard to book-illustration the author has 
somewhat pronounced views. Without doubt

he is right in feeling that if a book is to be in 
any sense a work of art, unity of effect is an 
essential. This rules out all plates and illustra- 
tions of any sort except such as can be printed 
with the text and are so designed as to harmonize 
with it. But as to this it is well to remember 
that the primary function of books is not to de- 
light the eye, and that illustrations of the sort 
Mr. Pollard approves must of necessity be decor- 
ative rather than informing. " Graingerism " 
comes in for unqualified contempt. When a 
book has been loaded with extra illustrations it 
truly "ceases to be a book at all and becomes a 
scrap-album of unharmonized pictures." 

Much of the value of Mr. Pollard's text is due 
to his catholicity. He has not confined himself 
to descriptions of notably fine books, but has 
covered the whole field of book printing and 
illustration, even noticing the books printed by 
Stephen Daye and others at Cambridge, Massa- 
chusetts, in the seventeenth century. In his 
enumeration of several broadsides printed in 
1643, 1645, and 1647, and the almanacs for 
1647 and 1648, as the only known "remnants of 
this stage of the press " he has overlooked one 
important item, " The Book Of General Lauues 
And Libertyes Concerning The Inhabitants of 
The Massachusets," which was printed at Cam- 
bridge in 1648. A copy of this book turned up 
several years ago and was described at the time 
in the columns of " The Nation." 

In one respect only does Mr. Pollard's book 
invite criticism : the index is not as ample as it 
should be. 

It may be regarded as an amusing commen- 
tary upon the author's dislike of "plates" and 
their protecting "flimsies" that both of these 
features should find a place in his book. The 
forty excellent collotypes, however, which repro- 
duce noteworthy examples of typography and 
early forms of illustration, will be appreciated 
by all who have occasion to consult this most 
excellent volume. FREDERICK W. GOOKIN. 



A PL.EA FOR INDIVIDUALISM.* 



Born in 1859 in Scotland, the son of a battle- 
scarred survivor of the Indian Mutiny, and one 
of twelve brothers early forced to make their 
own way in the world, Mr. James O. Fagan, 
after a considerable experience of travel and 
adventure and a variety of bread-winning occu- 
pations in South America, South Africa, and the 
United States, will readily be believed to speak 

*THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF AN INDIVIDUALIST. By James 
O. Fagan. Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. 



from earnest conviction when he protests, as he 
does in " The Autobiography of an Individual- 
ist," against that curbing of personal initiative 
which necessarily makes itself increasingly felt 
as a country grows older and its governmental 
machinery and code of laws and system of 
accepted conventions become more complex. 
His previous books, " Confessions of a Railroad 
Signal-Man " and "Labor and the Railroads," 
have marked him as a man not afraid to do his 
own thinking and to speak his mind after he 
has done so. 

An anecdote from Mr. Fagan's school days 
in Manchester will illustrate his early advocacy 
of fair play and equal opportunity for all. In a 
competitive examination that was to determine 
the ranking of the members of his class he was 
dumfounded, as he tells us, to see his most 
feared rival deliberately " cribbing " from a half- 
concealed translation under his desk-cover ; and 
as this was not only a piece of unfairness and 
dishonesty, but also directly opposed to the spirit 
animating the class as a whole, he at once rose 
in his place and asked the master whether it 
would be in order to expose a case of cheating. 
"Most certainly," was the reply, whereupon the 
culprit was named, and without a word of excuse 
he bluntly and frankly acknowledged his guilt. 
His immediate expulsion from the room was 
followed by the cheering of the class, which, 
concludes the narrator, "gave me instantly to 
understand that I had not been mistaken in my 
estimate of the class spirit." The story reads a 
little like "Tom Brown at Rugby," but one is glad 
to accept it as a real incident of school life. 

Mr. Fagan wishes it understood that he is 
endeavoring "to write not simply the ups and 
downs of a somewhat adventurous career, but 
the plain history of a passion." Illustrative of 
that passion is the following passage from the 
account of his life in the Transvaal in the days 
of the first Boer war for independence: 

" For reasons, then, which may or may not be apparent 
to my readers, I was in sympathy with those dissatisfied 
Boers and those heathenish Kaffirs. In my ignorance 
of, or dissatisfaction with Society, I suppose I failed to 
appreciate the forced relationship that, practically speak- 
ing, existed and exists between profession and expediency. 
My mind, at the time, was honestly crammed with pre- 
cepts, proverbs, texts, and old saws about liberty, the 
pursuit of happiness, human rights and property rights; 
and with these fundamentals forever buzzing in my brain, 
I could not, for the life of me, account for the conduct 
of Europeans in Africa. From my point of view, then, 
with Christianity as a background, the excuse for the 
African wars was reduced to the simple objections of 
the ordinary traveler, that the Kaffir, as a rule, lacked 
soap, and the Boer forgot to shave." 

It is the latter part of the book, dealing with 



20

the author's life in Massachusetts as a railroad 
man, that is of especial importance and interest. 
First as a telegraph operator in a railway station, 
then as switchman in a tower of the " interlock- 
ing " sort at West Cambridge, afterward as 
office assistant in Boston, with sundry other 
duties and interests interspersed, he lived a 
busy life and evidently kept up a tremendous 
amount of thinking the while, with eyes and ears 
open to gather material for these excogitations. 
A self-imposed drill in the written expression 
of his thoughts and an occasional appearance in 
print were among the natural attendants and 
consequences of all this intellectual ferment. As 
a matter of course, the strenuous individualist 
in him protested against the increasing use of 
red tape and office machinery in railroad man- 
agement. The elimination of human personality 
and the substitution of a soulless system did not 
strike him as likely to make our railways more 
efficient or safer for public travel. Labor 
unions, too, he characteristically found to be 
more restrictive than helpful to the laborer. One 
pregnant paragraph well states his conclusions. 

" From the point of view of the individualist, then, 
the tendency of modern industrial methods and legis- 
lation is to reenslave the world. To a great extent this 
conclusion is arrived at from a study of the excessive 
demands and unfair policies of organized labor. The 
first item in this modern industrial programme is the 
surrender of the individual workinginan. He is called 
upon to sink his industrial personality and to stifle his 
industrial conscience in the interests of his union or his 
class. This class doctrine is not hidden under a bushel. 
It is proclaimed at every labor meeting, you read it in 
countless books, it is openly preached on street corners 
and in all public places of assembly. Finally the move- 
ment receives support from an army of well-meaning 
reformers, the victims of imaginative sociology, who 
are next in turn to be doctored personally and profes- 
sionally by some of their own theories." 

A knotty problem, surely, is this question of 
just how much external control is good for 
a person and for society in a civilization of 
twentieth-century complexity. Those who think 
we are suffering from over-legislation will enjoy 
much that Mr. Fagan the individualist has to 
say in his book ; and they should also at the 
same time read, in the current " Hibbert 
Journal," Mr. L. P. Jacks's leading article on 
" Democracy and Discipline." 

Mr. Fagan 's book, treating intelligently as it 
does questions of present concern and growing 
importance, and written in a frank and engag- 
ing style that reveals in a most interesting way 
the dominant traits of a strong personality, is a 
refreshing and invigorating contribution to auto- 
biographical literature. p ERCy R BlCKNELL> 



THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY.* 



The third volume of Professor Edward Chan- 
ning's "History of the United States" brings 
the narrative from the quarrels over the "writs 
of assistance" in Massachusetts and the "Par- 
son's Cause" in Virginia through the American 
Revolution to the end of the government of the 
United States under the Articles of Confedera- 
tion. The treatment as a whole is developed 
from the thesis laid down at the conclusion of 
the second volume : that differing environment, 
acting upon an English stock already strongly 
affected by foreign admixture and by dissent 
from the established church of the home country, 
produced a second nation, which the imperialist 
ideals that dominated the British official circles 
of that day were not great enough to hold under a 
common government, and which was sacrificed to 
the commercial selfishness of the English people, 
in the narrower sense of that term. 

It is in. the emphasis which Professor Chan- 
ning gives to this element of commerce and in 
the freshness of his treatment that this exposi- 
tion of the principles and acts of the Revolution 
is most strikingly differentiated from the other 
general histories of this period. This may be 
deduced by comparing with the older accounts 
Professor Channing's discussion of the Towns- 
hend Acts, the commerce of the colonies in 1771, 
Lord North's Tea Act of 1773, and, above all, 
the trade of the. colonies and States with the 
West India Islands. This last topic is made 
prominent more than once: and of particular 
interest and value are the facts derived from the 
author's exploitation of the shipping-lists of St. 
Eustatia and St. Martin, fortunately preserved 
at The Hague. Nowhere are the commercial 
power of England and her vexatious use of it 
brought out more clearly, and the influence of 
economic considerations in bringing the war to 
an end. 

In many histories of the Revolution written by 
American authors, military affairs have loomed 
over-large. To this failing Professor Channing 
in no wise yields. The pages which he gives to 
the war on land and sea constitute something 
less than one-third the volume, and his handling 
of this theme is characterized by a judicious 
restraint. His most sweeping generalization we 
quote, and leave judgment thereon to the mili- 
tary critics. " The military annals of the Revolu- 
tion," writes Professor Channing, "are devoid

of the spectacular. . . . No remarkable soldier 
emerges from the conflict, for Washington was a 
moral force rather than a general ; and of second- 
rate characters Nathaniel Greene, alone, shines 
conspicuous. On the British side, Howe, Clin- 
ton, Burgoyne, and the rest were mediocre men." 

As between North and South, there is happily 
no sectional bias. Of the first attack upon the 
South, Professor Channing says : " At Moore's 
Creek and Sullivan's Island the Carolinians 
turned aside the one combination of circum- 
stances that might have made British conquest 
possible." It may be questioned, however, 
whether the war in the West receives quite its 
fair share of notice. To the battle of Benning- 
ton, Professor Channing devotes three pages, 
and ten more to the rest of the Saratoga cam- 
paign : but the description of the battle of King's 
Mountain, which Professor Channing calls "the 
severest action of the war since Bunker Hill," 
fills but twenty-five lines. In the former case the 
movements of Colonel Seth Warner and John 
Stark are duly particularized; but as to the 
latter, the reader is left to guess who " Sevier, 
Shelby, and Campbell" may have been, for 
nothing more is told of them, before or after. 
Equally indefinite is the account of Lord Dun- 
more's War. 

The importance of the work of George Rogers 
Clark is, indeed, made clear by Professor Chan- 
ning, who calls attention, however, to the fact 
that, in the negotiations which led up to the 
treaty of peace, he has found no allusion to this 
conquest of the western country. As to those 
negotiations, the author holds that the American 
commissioners were entirely justified in break- 
ing their instructions and in proceeding to the 
separate treaty with England, and that Jay was 
rightly suspicious of the designs of France and 
Spain. For the presentation of the opposite 
view Professor Channing refers the reader to 
Professor McLaughlin "in his volume in Hart's 
American Nation Series," which, somewhat 
curiously, appears to be the only mention of 
that important work in any of Professor Chan- 
ning's ample and helpful bibliographical notes. 
Finally, in this connection, it may be noted 
that Professor Channing opposes the traditional 
view that the "three remarkable Americans" 
outwitted "the complaisant Oswald and the 
second-rate Strachey," and points to the very 
apologetic tone adopted by the commissioners 
themselves when they communicated the Treaty 
to Livingston. 

Having disposed of the Treaty and the dis- 
banding of the army, the author passes to an 



enlightening account of the economic adjust- 
ment necessitated by the Revolution, emphasiz- 
ing, as we have said above, the activities of 
commerce. The succeeding chapters are devoted 
to political and constitutional developments, and 
here one begins to feel a sense of compression 
and omission which accompanies one to the end 
of the book. The analysis of the State constitu- 
tions and the Articles of Confederation is brief, 
as is that of the financial history of the Confeder- 
ation and the effort to invest Congress with a 
power to regulate commerce. The author then 
proceeds to a longer detailed narrative of the 
events which led up to the meeting of the Con- 
vention at Annapolis and to that at Philadelphia 
the next year, devoting some space to Pelatiah 
Webster's pamphlet, to the ideas of Madison 
and Washington, and to the stern realities of 
Shays's rebellion. The entire account of the 
Constitution, the Convention which framed it, 
and the struggle to secure its ratification by the 
States, is compressed within the limits of a 
single chapter. Ten pages of this, or quite one- 
third of the whole, is taken up with the Supreme 
Court and its right to declare void statutes 
contrary to the Constitution. Much of this 
discussion, a reflection, without doubt, of that 
which has lately been evoked by Dean Trickett 
and Mr. Justice Clark, might well have been 
relegated to a foot-note or deferred until the 
occasion shall arise for an account of the case 
of Marbury vs. Madison, for there remains to 
Professor Channing but little space in which to 
tell of the chronology and the inner workings 
of the Convention. Somewhat unusually, the 
treatment of the Northwest Ordinance is taken 
up after that of the Constitution, an arrange- 
ment which would be entirely justified if the 
account of land matters in 1783 and 1784 
were given more space and greater clarity. The 
explanation of the differing land-systems of the 
East and the South is, indeed, quite sufficient, 
but the relation of the land question to the 
general political and economic situation is not 
so fully brought out. 

In his final chapter, as is his wont, Professor 
Channing sums up the results attained during 
the period covered by the volume, with an 
interesting series of notes upon the social rela- 
tions of the new United States. He thus 
passes in review the topics of immigration, 
slavery, religion, education, and penal reform, 
closing with a very proper tribute to the great- 
ness of the accomplishments of the men of the 
generation which he has been describing. Thus 
is brought to its end another instalment of a

notable contribution to American history, the 
chief shortcoming of which is that, through the 
limitations of space and human ingenuity, not 
every part will seem to every critic to be quite 
so good as the best that the author has given.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Again has Dr. Carl Lumholtz 

Explorations 

in the wilds yielded to the lure or the Mexican 
of Mexico. wilds ; and as a result we have what 

might be regarded as a continuation of his "Un- 
known Mexico," published in 1902, though it bears 
the title "New Trails in Mexico" (Scribner). In 
the region between the Colorado River and the Gulf 
of California, including the northwest corner of the 
Mexican state of Sonora and the southwestern bor- 
ders of our state of Arizona, the distinguished au- 
thor spent twelve months in 1909-10. The region 
has heretofore appeared a blank on the maps of the 
country, and was popularly supposed to be scarcely 
more than arid desert. It was known in the vicin- 
ity as Papagueria because the home of the Papago 
Indians. Dr. Lumholtz visited the region chiefly 
for the purpose of reporting upon its economic 
possibilities, and his report on these conditions is 
hopeful. The mineral prospects are great ; more of 
the region could be brought under cultivation than 
people now realize, and the problem of water could 
be readily solved as soon as the need arose. While 
making these observations he frequently refers to the 
extraordinary adaptation of the plant and animal life 
to the arid conditions of the region, and notes certain 
indigenous edible plants which might be success- 
fully introduced into other arid countries. Among 
these is the " root of the sand," which is especially 
grateful to the thirsty man and quickly appeases 
his hunger. Dr. Lumholtz's chief delight seems to 
have been his life in the open, and he imparts to his 
reader some of his enthusiastic love of nature even as 
exhibited in desert places. To him "the desert is 
radiant with good cheer ; superb air there certainly 
is, and generous sunshine ; and the hardy, healthy 
looking plants and trees, with their abundant flowers, 
inspire courage. One feels in communion with na- 
ture, and the great silence is beneficial." That this 
writing of trees and flowers in desert places is no 
contradiction in terms, Dr. Lumholtz clearly shows 
in his botanical notes upon no less than twenty-five 
indigenous flowering plants. Scarcely less keen is 
his delight in being able to study the Papago and 
Pima Indians. He "again enjoyed," he tells us," the 
gentle and sympathetic manners" of the Indians. 
As with the Tarahumaras ten years previously, he 
entered fully into their life, worked his way into 
their method of thought and feeling, attended 
their great annual festival when the sahuara wine 
is made, talked with their medicine men, visited at 
some personal risk many of their secret places, and 



enlarged his collection of ethnological specimens. 
He regrets that in the contact with the higher 
civilization to which the Papagos are now being 
subjected, they are suffering deterioration both mor- 
ally and physically ; and he cites the fact that in a 
certain school for Indians, ninety per cent of the 
children have tuberculosis, in a region where, be- 
fore the effort to educate the Indians in insanitary 
school-houses, tuberculosis was unknown. The book 
contains numerous maps and colored plates, besides 
photographic illustrations to the number of a hun- 
dred or more. The vocabularies of the Papago, 
Pima, and Cocopa Indians are of great scientific 
value; while the text as a whole is written in such 
pleasing style as to make it of deep interest to the 

general reader. 

Small talk Madame de Hegermann-Lindencrone, 
of a woman wife of the Danish minister to Ger- 
of the world. many, has published, under the title 
"In the Courts of Memory" (Harper), a series of 
letters which she wrote to relatives between the years 
1858 and 1875. She is a native of Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, and was married in 1861 to Charles 
Moulton, a wealthy banker's son resident in Paris. 
Possessed of a remarkable singing voice, a charm- 
ing personality, and a great love of society, Mrs. 
Moulton was a social favorite in half a dozen coun- 
tries. Lowell, Longfellow, Garcia, and Delsarte 
were her teachers ; Massenet was a protegk of hers ; 
Auber was her intimate associate; Liszt, Wagner, 
Jenny Lind, Nilsson, Gounod, Rossini, Coquelin, 
Metternich, Gustave Dore', Prosper Me'rime'e, Sir 
Arthur Sullivan, William Wetmore Story, and a be- 
wildering list of other celebrities were her friends ; 
The'ophile Gautier and Prince Oscar of Sweden were 
admirers who celebrated her beauty and talents in 
verse ; Napoleon III., Garibaldi, and Bancroft were 
her hosts. From the first page of her book, in which 
we find Professor Agassiz lecturing on "trilobites 
and different fossils " in his private school in Cam- 
bridge, while the young ladies "try to imitate his 
funny Swiss accent," to the last, in which we find 
Sarah Bernhardt, dressed in white trousers and 
jacket and smoking cigarettes constantly, engaged 
in modeling a bust of Mrs. Moulton's little daughter 
("not a very good likeness"), we are continually in 
the presence of notables, viewing them, however, 
always somewhat ironically and as material for bans 
mots. There are many professional humorists who 
might envy Mrs. Moulton's happy style and quick 
instinct for the ridiculous. Letters which lay such 
stress on the cheerful side of life naturally pass by 
the serious, much more the melancholy, with as 
little attention as possible. These memories cover 
the period of the American Civil War, the ill-starred 
expedition of Maximilian, the Austrian and Franco- 
Prussian Wars, not to speak of greater movements 
which touched her world less closely ; yet only two 
of these are mentioned, she speaks of the siege of 
Paris because she was a resident of the city when 
that unfortunate affair interfered somewhat with 
her social arrangements, and of the Mexican cam-

paign because one of her friends had amused her 
with highly colored accounts of his experiences in 
that country. Thus her volume is not, in even an 
approach to the degree in which such books usually 
are, an inside view of great events ; it is small talk, 
pure and simple, though always vivacious and usu- 
ally interesting. Charles Moulton died in 1871, 
and the gentleman who became Mrs. Moulton's 
second husband first met her in Washington when 
he was Danish minister to the United States. 



More of Mr. 
Chesterton's 



"A monstrously lazy man lives in 
South Bucks partly by writing a col- 
deiectabie trifles. umn in the Saturday Daily News." 
Thus Mr. Chesterton describes himself in "The Real 
Journalist," one of the several delightful papers of 
his new volume, "A Miscellany of Men" (Dodd). 
Thousands of lazy busy men rejoice that one lazy 
man has the congenial task of writing such fetching 
discursions as these. In the preface to his new col- 
lection of mots, Mr. Chesterton, though flashing and 
dimpling as ever, shows some inclination to regard 
his work more seriously than has been his wont. He 
seems to feel the necessity of offering excuses for his 
polemics, saying there are three kinds of writers: 
those who write superlatively well, those who write 
abominably, and those who write, to which latter 
class he says he belongs. He writes just because he 
can. Now the reader is inclined to differ on two 
counts. Mr. Chesterton does not merely write : he 
writes unusually well. He is too modest and minifies 
his style, that is the reader's first point of order. 
The second is that he magnifies his themes. No one 
would suspect, from reading these sketches, that the 
author was trying to do anything more serious than 
play the wise delicious fool in his old fashion. It 
must be admitted, however, that the polemic spirit 
here and there manifest does prevent "A Miscel- 
lany of Men " from attaining the uniform charm of 
"Alarms and Discursions," for instance. Some of 
the papers, like " The Man Who Thinks Backwards," 
"The Poet and the Cheese," "The Architect of 
Spears," and "The Medieval Villian," show Mr. 
Chesterton at his best. Others, like "The Aristo- 
cratic 'Arry," fall decidedly below his best, and serve 
as a reminder that even Mr. Chesterton is no better 
than Homer. Possibly this master of Topsyturvy- 
dom would be surprised and not entranced at being 
placed in the literary pigeon-hole with Milton and 
Bunyan ; still his readers will not be startled at the 
comparison. He, like those mighty Puritans, is ever 
an Allegorist. The formula for almost every essay 
in the present volume is the same : a story, an ex- 
perience, and the deeper meaning. Sometimes that 
meaning is fanciful and vague ; sometimes it is child- 
ish ; but always it is surprising and suggestive. One 
other thing perhaps the critic of the future will point 
out. Mr. Chesterton has performed a mighty feat 
of literary construction. He has carried the formula 
of the story over into the essay. In these sketches 
it is surprise, contrast, aposiopesis, the distinctive 
weapons of fiction, that compel us willy-nilly. 



Octogenarian 
reminiscences 



Caustic comment on men and insti- 
tutions as he has seen them in a long 

and reflections. and unusua ll y act i ve life is found in 
abundance in Mr. Hubert Howe Bancroft's " Retro- 
spection, Personal and Political" (Bancroft Co.), 
which, whether by chance or design, came from the 
press in the very month that marked its author's 
completion of his eightieth year. That he is fearless 
and outspoken in this as in former utterances, his 
readers hardly need to be assured. A few of the 
topics and headings noted in the table of contents 
will indicate the book's character. History, auto- 
biography, political philosophy, prophecy, and much 
else, go to make up the five hundred and fifty 
compactly printed pages of this noteworthy volume, 
whose chapters deal with such themes as the dark 
age of graft, the injustice of law, the evolution of 
high crime, the vagaries of society, waste in educa- 
tion, modern journalism, the throes of labor, Asia 
and Africa in America, progressive government, and 
the significance of the Panama Canal. On the ques- 
tion of admitting cheap labor from Asia the author 
expresses himself at some length in its favor, remark- 
ing near the end that " anything is better than the 
continuation of this dog in the manger policy of union 
labor, which will neither do the necessary work of 
the nation and of its people, nor permit others to do 
it." The best things in the book, unless one's chief 
delight lies in controversy and caustic criticism, are 
the pages from the writer's own life, telling of his 
birth in Ohio, his migration to California, his build- 
ing up of his famous library there, and the planning 
and writing of his long series of western- American 
histories. The vastness of this latter undertaking, 
and the amount of labor and travel and gathering 
of material that it involved, impress the reader and 
hold his willing attention. The chapters treating of 
the California gold-mining days, of the settling of 
Granville, Ohio, by some of the author's progenitors 
and others, of his experiences as " an artless adven- 
turer " in the far West, of the evolution of his library, 
and his methods of writing history, are well worth 
reading. The style is that of a rapid and prolific 
writer, effective for the ends in view, and having 
the admirable qualities of strength and clearness. 
Its occasional defects of sentence-construction are 
readily pardoned in one who obviously has no time 
to waste in pondering his periods. " Retrospection " 
is as rich and enjoyable a volume of its sort as one 
could reasonably desire. A good portrait of its author 
faces the title-page, and a fourteen-page index closes 
the book.

At ten, she looks back on this "past," and even

" People must think this is a nice place for children, 
for they had eleven of their own before we came. 
Mrs. McCoe was here to call this afternoon and she 
looked at us and said : ' It must be a great respon- 
sibility, Mrs. Beals.' Grandmother said she thought 
' her strength would be equal to her day.' This is 
one of her favorite verses. She said Mrs. McCoe 
never had any children of her own and perhaps 
that is the reason she looks so sad at us." At the 
age of eleven, the diarist makes acquaintance with 
"Gulliver's Travels," but under certain restrictions. 
"There is a gilt picture on the green cover of a giant 
with legs astride and little Lilliputians standing 
underneath who do not come up to his knees. 
Grandmother did not like the picture, so she pasted 
a piece of pink calico over it, so we could only see 
the giant from the waist up. I love the story of 
Cinderella and the poem "Twas the night before 
Christmas, and I am sorry that there are no fairies 
and no Santa Claus." A good many dignified, 
amusing, and remarkable personages, the school- 
girl's contemporaries, teachers, or friends, are pic- 
tured in these pages, in a manner at once artless and 
shrewd; and when we recall how eventful were 
the two decades between 1852 and 1872 there is a 
special satisfaction in seeing the spirit of that time 
so skilfully set forth in the record of this quick- 
witted young person who is so very different from 
her prototype of to-day. 

There is scarcely another practical 

p roblem in social c . ontro1 . that de - 

serves a larger consideration and a 
truer scientific understanding than the problem of 
alcohol; and there is none that receives less, none 
that is more beset with prejudice and ignorance and 
mis-statement and all the evils of irrational prop- 
agandism. For this reason alone Dr. G. E. Part- 
ridge's " Studies in the Psychology of Intemperance " 
(Sturgis & Walton Co.) deserves a large circulation. 
May it receive the benefit of the feeling of good 
will which its appearance at this time invites ! It is 
composed of one-fifth practical advice, and four-fifths 
investigation of the facts of the case for and against 
alcohol. This is quite the reverse of the usual pro- 
cedure, which upon slight basis of knowledge and 
that both selected and distorted grows eloquent in 
prescription and proscription, intolerant of opposi- 
tion, and suspicious of motives. It becomes evident 
from Dr. Partridge's volume that the craving for 
alcohol is largely a myth, and its relation to moral 
obliquity a distortion. Its use is no more a besetting 
sin than is its avoidance an index of virtue or capa- 
city. The leading nations are the largest consumers 
of alcohol. Even more fundamental is the fact that 
the alcohol habit represents an inherent expression 



for the life abundant ; an understanding of the prac- 
tical problem of its regulation must not ignore nor 
yet distort the actual facts of its use and abuse. This 
refers not alone to the stultifying inclusion of a chap- 
ter on alcoholic abuse in text-books for babes, but to 
the equally intolerant attitude of reformers impressed 
by evils which they do not understand. To one and 
all a volume of this kind has an important service to 
perform. As an antidote to the unreason circulated 
in regard to alcoholic poisoning, this book may be 
highly recommended. It is important not because 
it offers a new view of the effects or a new remedy 
for the abuses, but because it offers the basis for an 
understanding of the problem, whatever may be the 
solution in this or that environment. It also pro- 
vides for a reasonable attitude towards regulation, 
which means that it is an instrument of sanity and 
not of prejudice. 

Adventures and Life is tame and monotonous in our 
explorations in well-regulated civilization when com- 
oia Babylonia. p are( j w ith such experiences as those 
described by Dr. Edgar J. Banks, in his "Bismya, 
or The Lost City of Adab " (Putnam). After a 
most extraordinary game of battledoor and shuttle- 
cock with the Turkish government for three exas- 
perating years he finally secured in 1903, practically 
at the demand of an American battleship, a permit 
to excavate for two years in Babylonia. He went 
out as Field Director in Babylonia of the University 
of Chicago. Such a story of Turkish intrigue, offi- 
cial graft, chronic dilatoriness, and resourcefulness 
in piling up obstructions, has rarely appeared in 
print. Dr. Banks had to encounter almost incredible 
cunning and duplicity on the part of many of the 
persons and officials with whom he had to deal. 
After some months of hard desert travel and Turk- 
ish official delays, he reached Bismya, the old Baby- 
lonian ruin which he was to excavate, in December 
1903. It lies about eighty miles southeast of the 
site of old Babylon, and about 120 miles nearly south 
of Bagdad, and about twenty-eight miles southwest of 
Nippur where the University of Pennsylvania has 
been digging up treasures since 1888. Bismya is a 
collection of mounds about a mile long by half a mile 
wide. Dr. Banks, with his company of officials, 
attendants, and workmen, prosecuted excavations in 
this mass of ruins for nearly six months in 1903-4. 
He brought to light some notable archaic remains, 
particularly a marble statue of very ancient type, 
though this is not, as he claims, " the oldest statue 
in the world." He likewise uncovered quantities of 
cuneiform tablets from the Sumerian age, many of 
them "contracts," and also seal cylinders, rings, 
vases, pottery, tombs, drains, and small statues. The 
temple foundations were also laid bare, revealing 
one of the primitive types of that important part of 
an ancient city. We must challenge the ancient 
name of the city in the sub-title; the real name 
found in the inscriptions is Ud-nun(-ki), not Adab. 
The book is most interestingly written, and is illu- 
mined by numerous illustrations.

AT^, . f The publication of "The Journals 
New pages from -,%.-.,.,, , 

Emerson's of Ralph Waldo Emerson, under 

Journals. t jj e care f u l editorship of Dr. Edward 

Waldo Emerson and Mr. Waldo Emerson Forbes, 
goes steadily forward, the latest instalment covering 
the years 1845 55 in two volumes of substantial bulk. 
In richness of thought and in freedom and beauty of 
expression these volumes, showing their author at or 
near the prime of his powers, are even more enjoyable 
than their predecessors. His second visit to Europe, 
184748, falls within the period covered by the first 
of these two volumes, and furnishes matter for note- 
worthy comment and shrewd observation. Of Carlyle 
he takes occasion to say, after renewing his acquaint- 
ance with the Chelsea sage: "An immense talker, and, 
altogether, as extraordinary in that as in his writing ; 
I think even more so. You will never discover his 
real vigor and range, or how much more he might 
do than he has ever done, without seeing him. . . . 
He is not mainly a scholar, like the most of my ac- 
quaintance, but a very practical Scotchman, such as 
you would find in any saddler's or iron-dealer's shop, 
and then only accidentally and by a surprising addi- 
tion the admirable scholar and writer he is." Note 
also this: "Carlyle and his wife live on beautiful 
terms. Their ways are very engaging, and in her 
bookcase all his books are inscribed to her, as they 
come from year to year, each with some significant 
lines." A chance definition that catches the eye on 
a later page is worth quoting : " Culture teaches to 
omit the unnecessary word and to say the greatest 
things in the simplest way." Illuminating and often 
amusing are Emerson's keen criticisms of his inti- 
mate friend Alcott, to whose foibles he was by no 
means blind, highly though he esteemed that inef- 
fectual genius. Of Thoreau, too, he has considerable 
to say, and of Ellery Channing, and others whom we 
are glad to look at anew through his eyes. Six por- 
traits add to the interest of these volumes ; they show 
us Emerson himself in 1846, Carlyle in the same year, 
Samuel Gray Ward, Ellery Channing, Margaret Ful- 
ler Ossoli, and Charles King Newcomb. The syn- 
optical tables of contents and the page-headings serve, 
as in the earlier volumes, to direct the reader quickly 
to what will most interest him. 



It may come with a sense of surprise 
TWO histories ^ many readers that the discipline 



. . 

with which we associate the novelty 

of experimental investigation by laboratory methods 
should have a history that requires volumes to set 
forth. Yet here are two works (and others are 
announced) dealing with the historical aspects of 
Psychology. Mr. G. S. Brett's "History of Psy- 
chology " (Macmillan) is confined to the ancient 
and patristic field, and reaches nothing later than 
Augustine. The other, a translation of Professor 
Max Dessoir's "Outlines of the History of Psy- 
chology (Macmillan), though it spans the ages from 
the beginning of thinking to the present in the com- 
pass of 250 pages, is itself an abridgment of a much 
larger work. The two books are clearly not com- 



parable in any manner. Yet they both reflect a 
growing interest in the historical antecedents of 
present-day interests. It cannot be said that the 
genealogy in the direct line is clearly determined. 
The records are very largely devoted to collateral 
issues. The psychological eddy is commonly lost 
in the philosophical stream. This is less notable 
near the sources, and particularly in the refreshing 
Greek sources where psychological interests emerge 
clearly, and are often prophetically suggestive. For 
the most part the interest in such volumes as these 
must be sustained by the collateral interest in phil- 
osophy ; and the message for the modern student of 
psychology remains incidental. But history is ever 
dominant because irrevocable, and the development 
of the human interests of which we are the heirs 
whatever our specialties is a matter of moment. 
It is fortunate that records of this kind are now 
available to English-reading students. True to their 
several traditions, the native English product is more 
readable, is addressed more to the scholar, and re- 
flects a more sensitive sense of proportion ; while 
the translated volume is more in the nature of a 
student's manual with didactic intent, overrates the 
Teutonic contributions, is less catholic, and less 
attractive in its presentations. 

Gleanings from Mr - Lawrence J. Burpee is the com- 
the literature piler and sympathetic editor of six 
of Canada. ii tt j e volumes published by the Musson 
Book Company of Toronto, "[Canadian Eloquence," 
"Canadian Essays," "Canadian Sonnets," "Flowers 
from a Canadian Garden," "Songs of French 
Canada," and "Fragments of Sam Slick." The 
contents are apparently well chosen that is to say, 
they include representative work of the Canadian 
writers with whom an American reader is likely to 
be familiar, and a considerable number of interest- 
ing selections from men less widely known on this 
side of the border. Thomas Chandler Haliburton, 
the only author who is awarded an entire volume, 
occupies a place in all discussions of American 
humor, yet the "Sam Slick" sayings here collected 
may surprise many readers by their variety and their 
cleverness. The songs of French Canada are inter- 
esting for their content, but they suffer, as all songs 
must, from translation. Perhaps the least satisfac- 
tory volume is "Canadian Eloquence." Few of the 
orations by white Canadians are remarkable, and 
the speeches, or supposed speeches, of Tecumseh, 
Logan, and other Indian chiefs seem like padding. 
The sympathetic American reader of the series is 
likely to make two observations: that Canadian 
literature is strongly and frankly provincial, and that 
provincialism in literature is not, after all, such a 
bad thing. There is not a great poem in the "Cana- 
dian Sonnets " or the " Flowers from a Canadian 
Garden"; but, on the other hand, there is nothing 
of the "strain and rage," the obvious striving to be 
distinctive, which characterizes so much recent 
verse-making. One finds a quiet pleasure in reading 
these little anthologies which is notably different

from the effect produced by the writings of recent 
English or American poets of equal rank. The indi- 
vidual volumes are attractively printed and daintily 

bound. 

According to Dr. Samuel Crothers, 

New essays , __ . , . ,, 

bv the best of in his new book "Humanly Speaking 
our essayists. (Houghton), the true American is 
fond of superlatives. To assert our Americanism, 
let us hasten to say that Dr. Crothers has once more 
demonstrated that of all living American essayists 
he is the most delightful. Most humanly does he 
speak wisely and humorously. His range of 
topics, in his latest collection, is for the most part 
restricted (if that is the word) to the American 
temperament of our day and of the new day shining 
before us dimly and tantalizingly. "That the old 
order is passing is obvious enough. That a new 
order is arising, and that it is on the whole benefi- 
cent, is not merely a pious hope" with this inspir- 
iting conviction does Dr. Crothers write of modern 
America. Of the nine essays, we single out "In 
the Hands of a Receiver " as the freshest, wittiest, 
and most penetrating. (How insistent is that in- 
stinct for the superlative!) In this essay we are 
introduced to the inimitable Bagster, who is busy 
reforming everything and everybody save himself, 
who bids us " concentrate on every point," and who 
writes the " Song of Obligations," in the manner of 
Whitman, containg one perfect if unpoetic line: 
"The duty of doing your Christmas shopping early 
enough in July to allow the shop-girls to enjoy their 
summer vacation." 



NOTES. 

" Tradition, and Other One-Act Plays of American 
Life," by Mr. George Middleton, is announced by 
Messrs. Holt. 

. " The Harbor Master," a story of Newfoundland, by 
Mr. Theodore Goodridge Roberts, will be published this 
month by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. 

Among forthcoming volumes in the " Home Univer- 
sity Library " which Messrs. Holt promise for the latter 
part of January, is " The Victorian Age in Literature," 
by Mr. G. K. Chesterton. 

The first of what will doubtless be a plentiful crop of 
books dealing with the war in the Balkans is promised 
in the narrative of Lieutenant Wagner, to be published 
early this year by Houghton Mifflin Co. 

The well-known English surgeon and traveller, Sir 
Frederick Treves, has written an account of his recent 
visit to Palestine, which Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. will 
publish immediately under the title, " The Land That 
Is Desolate." 

The January publications of Messrs. Holt will include 
the following: " The Infancy of Animals " by Mr. W. P. 
Pycraft, " The World's Leading Conquerors " by Mr. 
W. Lloyd Bevan, and " Socialism and Democracy in 
Europe " by Mr. Samuel P. Orth. 

" Nogi: A Man against the Background of a War," 
by Mr. Stanley Washburn, is announced by Messrs. 
Holt for publication in February. Mr. Washburn was 
one of the few newspaper correspondents to be with 



Nogi throughout most of the war, and his book attempts 
to portray the general's character by pen portraits of 
him in typical scenes. The book will be illustrated 
from photographs taken on the spot. 

The Librarian of Columbia University has in prepara- 
ation a Bibliography of American college verse, and 
would be glad to receive information regarding printed 
collections of this class, especially those of early date 
and those printed in the smaller college communities. 

Will Carleton, the author of " Farm Ballads " and 
numerous other volumes of popular verse, died at his 
home in Brooklyn, on December 18. He was born in 
1845, and after some experience in school-teaching and 
newspaper work became a writer and lecturer of wide 
vogue. 

Four novels of considerable interest, to be issued 
shortly by the Macmillan Co., are the following: " One 
Woman's Life," by Mr. Robert Herrick; "Comrade 
Yetta," by Mr. Albert Edward, author of " A Man's 
World"; "Patsy," by Mr. S. R.Crockett; and "The 
Impeachment of President Israels," by Mr. Frank A. 
Copley. 

A Hawthorne memorial in Salem, the city where the 
author of " The Scarlet Letter " was born, and where 
that masterpiece itself was written, seems at last to be 
assured, in spite of the disfavor in which many old 
Salemites have long held " that lazy Nat Hawthorne." 
There are still standing in the " Witch City " several 
bouses that at different times served as home to the 
unappreciated genius; but the plan as announced is to 
pass these houses by and erect a monument in the shape 
of a statue of the man himself, the sculptor chosen for 
the occasion being Mr. Bela L. Pratt, whose qualifica- 
tions for the task are beyond dispute. 

For many years the late Professor George N. Olcott 
was keenly interested in the development at Columbia 
University of a small but well-selected collection of 
antiquities to aid the work of the department in Roman 
archseology. In almost every visit to Italy he secured 
for this purpose noteworthy specimens. At the time of 
his death there were temporarily included in the collec- 
tion a number of objects for the purchase of which no 
funds bad as yet become available. It is now proposed, 
if a sufficient amount shall be subscribed, to acquire these 
objects for the collection as a memorial of Dr. Olcott's 
tireless devotion. Contributions may be sent to Miss 
Helen H. Tanzer, The Normal College, 68th Street and 
Park Avenue, New York. 

An elaborate two-volume work on " Ancestral Re- 
cords and Portraits" will be issued by the Grafton 
Press from material compiled by Chapter I., The Colo- 
nial Dames of America. It contains the story of the 
ancestors of a number of the members of this Chapter, 
arranged in chronological order, beginning with an 
early progenitor and coming down to the present day. 
When a marriage into another line occurred, that line 
has been taken up at an early period and brought down 
to the time of the inter-marriage and then the main 
line is continued. As the members of the Chapter are 
descended from prominent families of New England, 
the Middle States, and the South, tbe work covers an 
unusual amount of territory, and shows the common an- 
cestry of the early settlers in America. An important 
feature of the book is the illustrations. These comprise 
over a hundred drawings of coat-armor, and nearly two 
hundred and fifty reproductions of old miniatures, por- 
traits, manor houses, family silver, etc.

Are you seeking instruction 
about the currency question? It will 
be one of the main features of the next 
session of Congress. Read "The Aldrich 
Plan in the Light of Modern Banking," by 
LUDWIG BENDIX. 

This book combines with a careful analysis of 
the bill proposed by the National Monetary Commission 
a study of the money and credit systems of the United 
States and of the leading European countries, knowl- 
edge of which is necessary for the understanding of our 
currency problem. Usually this question is treated 
technically in a manner scarcely understood by the lay- 
man and fails to arouse his interest. Mr. Bendix' book, 
on the contrary, is written in such simple style that 
every educated man may easily understand this currency 
problem and the problem is of first importance to 
every man in American business life. 



" By a writer at once temperate and well informed. . . . 
His discussions are worthy of careful attention."

SCANDINAVIAN CULTURE IN THE 
UNITED STA TES. 

We are always glad to welcome any move- 
ment which has for its object the furthering of 
intellectual and artistic relations between the 
American people and the peoples of the Scandi- 
navian countries. The mutual reactions of such 
efforts cannot fail to be helpful and salutary on 
both sides, for each has much to offer by which 
the other may profit. Readers of modern Scandi- 
navian literature are constantly apprised, by 
apposite allusion and stated fact, of the appeal 
which our republic makes to the Scandinavian 
imagination, of the frequency with which our 
example is made to point a moral or adorn a 
tale. Those Scandinavians who have visited us 
and those who have observed us only from afar 
have alike felt the American influence, and 
reflected it in the expression of their literary, 
social, and political thought. As far back as 
1865, Ibsen was moved by the death of Lincoln 
to the composition of one of his most striking 
poems, in which " the shot heard yonder in the 
West " was invested with a portentous signifi- 
cance for European culture. In later years 
many of the most eminent Scandinavian men 
of letters have sojourned upon our shores and 
explored our Hinterland, with results that have 
impressed themselves upon their writings. Such 
men as Bjornson, Kjelland, Hamsun, Nansen, 
Kristofer Janson, and Holger Drachmann have 
made their report upon us, and brought home the 
message of the gospel of freedom to the peoples 
who of all those who dwell upon the Continent 
have been perhaps the most eagerly receptive 
listeners. This is not surprising when we con- 
sider the extent to which the Scandinavian strain 
has entered into our population, and the millions 
of individual and family relations that have thus 
been established between the two countries. 

Symptomatic of these relations are such 
matters as the recent exchange of lectureships 
between the United States and Denmark, and 
the dedication of a Danish-American park in 
the neighborhood of Aarhus. We were informed 
not long ago by a Danish publisher that one of 
Mr. Robert Herrick's novels was a "best seller" 
in Denmark. A less felicitous illustration of 
American influence was gleaned from a casual 
acquaintance on a railway journey, who informed 
us proudly that he had introduced American

chewing-gum into Norway, and had just built a 
house out of the proceeds of the nefarious busi- 
ness. We suppose that countries which come 
into relations with each other must trade their 
vices as well as their virtues, although this partic- 
ularly disgusting vice is the last we would have 
thought likely to find a foothold on European 
soil. In the matter of travel between the Scan- 
dinavian countries and the United States, the 
long-established Danish line of steamships has 
won cordial commendation from the tourist 
public, and it is soon to have a rival in the 
Norwegian company which is about to put two 
magnificent new steamships into the trans- 
atlantic service. 

We commented in 1911 upon the organization 
at Chicago of the Society for the Advancement 
of Scandinavian Study, which has already held 
two annual sessions of great interest, and has 
just issued the third series of its Proceedings. 
This organization of Scandinavian scholarship 
is evidently in the field for good, and much may 
be expected from its activities. Its objects in- 
clude both publication and propaganda, the latter 
meaning a persistent effort to further American 
interests in the literature of the Scandinavian 
countries, and to secure for the Scandinavian 
languages the recognition that is due them in 
our schools and colleges. That these languages 
have a high cultural value is evident to all who 
are acquainted with them, and it is gratifying 
to learn that an ever-increasing number of col- 
leges are offering courses in them, and even ac- 
cepting them for the entrance-requirement. It 
seems proper to say that only French and Ger- 
man among modern languages exceed them in 
cultural significance for education, and that they 
hold the balance fairly even with Italian or with 
Spanish. Of the wisdom of the effort to make 
them elective subjects in high schools we are 
somewhat in doubt. Our high schools cannot 
do very much, at best, with modern language 
study, and we should be sorry to find any num- 
ber of students substituting them for the French 
and German which are so absolutely essential 
to culture. And there is always the danger of 
their being elected as "snap courses" by lazy 
young people who are left to shift for themselves 
in planning their high school work. 

We have just received the initial number of 
" The American-Scandinavian Review," a mod- 
est but exceedingly interesting bi-monthly pub- 
lished in New York. There have been other 
ventures of this sort, notably the " Scandinavia" 
of the late Professor N.C. Fredriksen which ran 
its course of nearly three years in Chicago in 



the eighties, and the demise of which we deeply 
regretted. The new periodical seems assured 
of better support, being published by the 
American-Scandinavian Foundation, a corpora- 
tion which has the pleasant duty of administer- 
ing, for the purpose of a better understanding 
between the countries concerned, a bequest of 
more than half a million dollars made by the 
late Niels Poulson. Another enterprise under- 
taken by this trust is the notable exhibition of 
Scandinavian painting and sculpture, represent- 
ing some one hundred and fifty artists, now in 
New York, and soon to be sent to Chicago 
and other cities. Still other purposes are the 
granting of travelling fellowships to students 
from both sides, the publication of Scandinavian 
classics, and the establishment of institutes and 
reading-rooms in the chief Scandinavian cen- 
tres of this country. 

Working with this Foundation is an Amer- 
ican-Scandinavian Society which already num- 
bers nearly a thousand members, and with which 
all Americans interested are invited to affiliate^ 
The stated objects of this organization are 
" To cultivate closer relations between the people of the 
United States of America and the Scandinavian coun- 
tries; to strengthen the bonds between Scandinavian- 
Americans ; to advance the knowledge of Scandinavian 
culture among the American public, particularly among 
the descendents of Scandinavians." 
The last point seems to us of vital importance. 
Qur Scandinavian immigrants, in their eager- 
ness to make Americans of their children, are 
too apt to withhold from them the noble heritage 
of history and literature which is their birth- 
right. All over this country, young Swedes and 
Danes and Norwegians are growing up in ignor- 
ance of the language and deeds of their ancestors. 
This wanton waste of cultural opportunity should 
be severely condemned. It is perfectly easy to 
keep a child in full possession of his racial heri- 
tage without in the least impairing his command 
of the English language, or making him any 
the less a good American citizen. We owe much 
to the sturdy qualities of our Scandinavian im- 
migrants, but we would owe them much more if 
they were made to recognize as a sacred obliga- 
tion the preservation of their own cultural char- 
acteristics. We trust that the Society will place 
all the stress possible upon this obligation, to 
the end that the rising generation of Scandi- 
navians, when they make the acquaintance of 
Shakespeare, shall not be allowed to forget 
Holberg, the glory of their own race, to say 
nothing of such other significant figures as those 
of Oehlenschlager, Ewald, Tegner, Runeberg,. 
Bjbrnson, and Ibsen.

THE METAPHYSICAL AND THE 
HISTORICAL MIND. 

Strictly speaking, Hindoo literature owns no 
histories. The few facts that loom up from that 
race's antiquity or middle past are in a welter of 
confusion as to date, place, and personage. The 
most important events and works cannot be placed 
with any certainty in century or period. Conversely, 
Hindoo thought, perhaps the most penetrating and 
most affluent the world has ever known, rises from 
the springs of the Rig- Veda in ever-increasing flood 
and buries the monuments and ruins of empires in 
its path. India let the jewelled reigns of her kings 
slip through her listless fingers, while she turned her 
solemn eyes out on the Universe or inward to her 
brooding soul. 

" She let the legions thunder past, 
And plunged in thought again." 

What is apparently the earliest creative work of 
Hindoo literature the Ramayana may have some 
historic import, may in a remote way record the 
movement of the ruling race toward the South. But 
the love-story of Sita, the reincarnation of Krishna 
in Rama, his alliance with the monkey hordes, and 
the Lucifer-like character of Ravana, have less rela- 
tion to reality than the characters and incidents of 
early European epics. And the Mahabharata is 
an immense mingling of mythology, metaphysics, 
and confused and cloudy wars, threaded through 
with a very human story. 

What is true of India is mainly true of all Asia. 
Mother of mysteries religion after religion, phil- 
osophy after philosophy, has issued from her womb. 
But human history she has disdained. She has held 
her myriad races cheap, and thought only the eter- 
nal important. She has furnished the ore which 
European artists have reduced and refined ; she has 
supplied the matrix studded with precious stones for 
the miners and lapidaries of the West to pick out 
and cut and polish. 

The historical instinct first rose clear and keen in 
Greece. It held there, for a while, a perfect balance 
with the metaphysical mood; and between them 
were evolved the literature, art, and science which 
make modern culture. To Rome, history ^was more 
than thought, and as a result a certain hardness was 
impressed upon all the products of its life and mind. 
Afterwards for nearly a thousand years the historical 
sense was swept aside by the irruption of religions 
and philosophies from Asia. In recent times, the 
historical side of the human mind has again become 
dominant. Man and his doings have become all in 
all, and God has retired into the background. Mod- 
ern science is almost wholly an historical affair. It 
not only works in a utilitarian spirit, but it reads the 
records of the rocks, writes the romances and novels 
of the elements, the plants and stars. 

Yes, the historical mind has had its innings with 
a vengeance during the last hundred years. Things 
hold together. Like Wordsworth's cloud, the human 
mind "moves altogether if it moves at all." It has 



marched directly away from its cosmogonies, its 
divinities, its high imaginations and great exception- 
alities; it has marched toward the common, the 
usual, the trivial, and the apparently explicable. 
Literature no longer "begins from Jove," but from 
the grocer at the street corner. 

It is delightful to know that we are all equally 
important that we are all going to the heaven of 
fame, and that Mr. Howells is of the company. But 
the historical method run "mad defeats itself. We 
cannot see the forest for the trees. And when every- 
thing is recorded everything is soon forgotten. The 
people of the future will have their own interesting 
selves to think about, and they will have little time 
to waste on the interminable records of to-day. The 
greater part of our present literature will soon be 
like yesterday's newspaper. 

But the people of the future will doubtless recur, 
as we do, to the large-featured typifying represen- 
tative literary creations of the past. Art, which is 
kneaded with thought shot through with philosophy, 
must hold its own. If there were no sorrow or 
dreams or death in the world, the historical mind 
might very well always be regnant. Human vanity 
might always be satisfied with seeing its actions as 
in a mirror. " Go write a play about myself and 
my son-in-law," says the French bourgeois to the 
dramatist, " and I will come to see it." But to the 
poorest mind there come moments when the usual 
round of existence fails to satisfy : when the great 
realities of sorrow and death press upon it. Then 
is born the metaphysical mood. 

It would be foolish to say that the vivid spectacle 
of life its carelessness, gayety, sensuousness, 
charm is not worthy of any artist's skill ; that 
we ought not to take delight in its representation. 
I suppose there are few of us who do not read ten 
trivial novels to one great piece of literature. We 
read them, but we forget them and we do not 
forget the masterpieces. 

Even great comedy is profound. Its flowers 
spring from a volcanic soil; its dazzling frost-work 
is broken by crevasses, abysses that go straight down 
to the centre of things. Aristophanes opposes the 
world-wisdom of the sophists with a wisdom of 
poetry. Rabelais makes the Schoolmen look fool- 
ish with their own science. Cervantes mocks the 
ideal of chivalry with an ideal of superior merit. But 
it is the poets, tragedians, and philosophers, who are 
at furthest remove from the mere historical outlook 
on mankind, who are least the chroniclers and cata- 
loguers of fact. The hymns of the Rig-Veda, the 
Book of Job, the Biblical Prophets, the Prometheus 
and Agamemnon, the Divine Comedy, Shakespeare's 
great tragedies, Paradise Lost, Faust, and Manfred, 
all these are almost pure products of the meta- 
physical mind. Aye, and the briefer strains of the 
Muse the poems of Pindar and Horace, the son- 
nets of Petrarch and Shakespeare, the odes of Gray, 
the songs of Burns, the lyrics of Shelley, are all 
pregnant with philosophy. Metaphysical thought is 
a normal necessity of man, and when expressed in 



38

poetry it comes as near to being immortal as any- 
thing in our shifting world can reach. The sciences 
are not soluble in poetry as metaphysics are. The 
fact, however, that great poets are most greatly 
moved by the profundities of life does not preclude 
them from dealing with it in a lighter fashion. Their 
comedy, as we have said, is apt to be dark under its 
dazzle, but they can turn their hands to mere chroni- 
cling. But this is not their mitier, otherwise it 
would be difficult to explain the dulness of JEschy- 
lus's Seven against Thebes in comparison with the 
Prometheus, Agamemnon, or even the Persians ; 
or the inferiority of Shakespeare's histories to his 
tragedies, romances, and best comedies. The water 
simply was not deep enough for them to swim in. 

While the historical mind has been dominant for 
the last two or three generations, yet the importance 
of metaphysics is enough evidenced by the fact that 
Schopenhauer and his pupil Nietzsche are a fair set- 
off in influence and power to Darwin and his whole 
school of scientists. This may seem a strong asser- 
tion, but it will hardly be contradicted by anyone 
who is familiar with the trend of European thought. 

We have associated the modern scientific move- 
ment with the historical mind ; and, in fact, it is a 
phase of that side of man's nature. There are not 
wanting signs that the scientific movement is wear- 
ing out. It is not so confident, so dogmatic, as of 
old. Many of its best exponents are taking the back- 
track to metaphysics and religion. It has ceased 
to satisfy human needs, as for a time it seemed to 
do. Its very development is fatal to it. Everywhere 
it is up against an impasse. It looks out at the 
Universe and it cannot explain Gravitation ; the 
Nebular Theory breaks down; it is in doubt about 
the Wave Theory of Light ; it is not sure as to the 
Conservation of Energy. And the Ether what 
of that prodigious problem ? Hydrogen gas weighs 
something like three hundred thousand tons to the 
cubic mile ; yet if the ether only weighs one grain 
to the cubic mile, there is enough of it within the 
bounds of the known stars to make three hundred 
million Universes as great as ours is supposed to be. 
And the best scientific opinion says that its density 
is far beyond that of lead. The stars are merely 
fragile far-scattered foam-flecks on this immense 
ocean. Or turn to the other end of the scale. In- 
vestigate the littleness of things. Try to arrive at 
the size of the ultimate atom. The discovery of 
radium startled the world, and it is at least question- 
able whether its action is explainable by any atomic 
theory. But before it was known, there were facts 
that made material atoms seem impossible. Take 
the classic chemical example of a small quantity of 
musk perfuming a large chamber for years, yet los- 
ing no appreciable part of its weight. That was a 
radium of the nose. Or take the well-attested fact 
of a dog's scent. It is beyond question that certain 
dogs can, on being given a man's shoe or glove to 
smell, track the person for miles, through crossed 
tracks or amid crowded streets. If they are guided 
by a material effluvium, this must exist in a state of 



incredible tenuity. But these wonders are merely 
trifles. The thirtieth trituration of a drug is in 
common use in homoeopathy. But the thirtieth trit- 
uration would have to be expressed by a decimal 
point with thirty ciphers, in others words, a single 
drop of the original drug is, roughly speaking, diluted 
in a body of water equal to the orbit of the moon 
around the earth. And the drug tinctures and affects 
the whole mass, so that a portion of the mixture pro- 
duces certain and definite results. But far " higher 
powers," as they are called, than the thirtieth tritu- 
ration are used in homoeopathy. There is a story 
of a Philadelphia physician who started as a young 
doctor with his vials filled with the regular dilutions 
of the drugs, and who never renewed them during 
a practice of sixty years. As his bottles began to 
ebb, he filled them up with water, shook them, and 
went on prescribing. The amount of the original 
drugs in final use could not be expressed in "num- 
bers which have name." Hahnemann, in his 
"Organon," gives a recipe for a very powerful 
homoeopathic dose. "Take a single pellet of a high 
potency of the required drug," he says, " place it in 
a vial, leave it tightly corked for a few hours, then 
unstop the bottle, place it to the nostril and inhale 
a single whiff of the medicated air." 

But all these matters of terrestial experience leave 
us only on the threshold of the possibilities of the 
infinite divisibility of matter. There are nebulae in 
the sky which, from their distance and apparent size, 
must be billions of miles in bulk; yet, plunged in 
the centre of these vast fields, a focal star or nuclei 
sends its light undimmed by any opposing obstacle. 
The matter in those prodigiously extended nebular 
clouds must be immeasurably more rare than that 
in a Crookes's vacuum tube. Yet their dreamy light 
has place and persistence in the universe. Is the 
world a spirit, or a thing of sense? The greatest 
English chemist recently said, " There is no matter," 
formulating thus the dogma on which is founded 
the most amazing religious cult of modern times. 
What wonder, then, that men are again preparing to 
turn to metaphysics for something that may satisfy 
the reason and the soul?

CASUAL COMMENT. 



MISTAKES OF BROWNING'S BIOGRAPHERS, with 
characteristic details of the poet's habits and family 
life, as communicated to Professor William Lyon 
Phelps by Mr. Barrett Browning at the latter's home 
near Florence in 1904, furnish matter for an inter- 
esting article in the January "Century." With 
Mrs. Orr's "Life and Letters" of the poet, says Mr. 
Phelps, the son and the sister " were both bitterly 
disappointed, and corrected the worst and most glar- 
ing mistakes, and made many suggestions. Mrs. 
Orr brusquely replied, ' I cannot change the proofs.' " 
Of Mr. Chesterton's book the poet's son "said the 
work was filled with errors ; the mistake that appar-

ently perturbed him the most was the statement that 
Browning was in weak health and ' declining ' in the 
last years. On the contrary, he insisted that Brown- 
ing was tremendously vigorous up to the last; that 
no change had taken place in his appearance, man- 
ner, or habits. . . . During the last few days he told 
many good stories and talked with the utmost vivac- 
ity. There was never any 'decline,' and the son 
seemed almost fiercely to resent Mr. Chesterton's 
statement." With some surprise one learns of 
Browning's increasing hatred of his pen. In later 
years "his work became so distasteful to him that 
he would rather do almost anything else. He rose 
early, before his son; they had coffee together; then 
the father was never visible till lunch. He did all 
his composition and letter-writing in the morning. 
After lunch, he would not touch a pen if he could 
help it, and seemed always immensely relieved to 
have the morning's work over. He gave the impres- 
sion of liking many things in life much better than 
poetry or literature." In the course of his talk the 
son justified his action in publishing his parents' 
love-letters. Mr. Phelps's incidental citing of "the 
uproar occasioned by Froude's printing of all the 
Carlyle letters" prompts one to remind him that 
Froude's error was one of exclusion rather than of 
inclusion, of misleading omissions and wilful distor- 
tions rather than of wholesale publication of the now 
famous letters, many of which have been given to the 
world since Froude's death and in consequence of 
his unfair suppressions and omissions. Mr. Phelps's 
excellent article appears to have been held back until 
after the death (last July) of him whose geniality 
and hospitality it so pleasantly pictures. 


A NOBLE MONUMENT TO LINCOLN, which the 

world at large knows too little about, was recently 
erected by the State of Illinois in the fine Lincoln 
Hall, dedicated to the study of the humanities, at 
the University of Illinois. To be accurate, the 
dedication has not yet formally taken place, but is 
appointed for the coming anniversary of Lincoln's 
birthday. A " provisional program " of the dedi- 
catory exercises, with a handsome illustrated pam- 
phlet describing the new building, has already been 
sent out. Among the expected speakers are Pro- 
fessor Bliss Perry, of Harvard, Professor Frederick 
J. E. Woodbridge, of Columbia, Dr. Albert Shaw, 
Editor of "The Review of Reviews," Dr. Hugh 
Black, various officials of the State and of the Uni- 
versity, and, finally, in the place of honor at the end 
of the programme, Bishop McDowell of Chicago, 
who will make the address of dedication. It was 
four years ago, in the Lincoln centennial year, that 
the Illinois legislature appropriated a quarter-million 
dollars for the purposes of this Lincoln memorial, 
and to-day it stands, in the words of the official de- 
scription, " one of the noblest monuments thus far 
erected in this country to our martyred president." 
Among its notable features are the ten terra-cotta 
panels across the front of the building, giving sig- 



nificant scenes from Lincoln's life, the Gettysburg 
address in brass letters sunk in the floor of the 
entrance hall, the numerous and well equipped study 
and class rooms, each with its special library and 
other aids to research, and the two museums, of 
classical archaeology and art, and of European cul- 
ture. Lincoln's expressed wish that his labors might 
conduce " to the preservation of those institutions 
under which alone we can expect good government 
and, in its train, sound learning and the progress of 
the liberal arts " finds in this building promise of a 
gratifying degree of fulfilment. 



COLONEL ROOSEVELT ON THE HISTORIAN'S ART 
had things of moment to say in his late address 
before the American Historical Association at its 
annual convention in Boston. As was to have been 
expected from one whose veins pulse so ardently 
with life, whose zest for all that human experience 
has to offer of a wholesome sort is so keen, he dwelt 
especially on the "human appeal" (to use a hack- 
neyed phrase) of the drama of history, and dispar- 
aged the strictly scientific school of historical research. 
"The true historian," he declared, "will bring the 
past before our eyes as if it were the present. He 
will make us see as living men the hard-faced archers 
of Agincourt and the war-worn spearsmen who fol- 
lowed Alexander down beyond the rim of the known 
world. We shall hear grate on the coast of Britain 
the keels of the low-Dutch sea-thieves whose chil- 
dren's children were to inherit unknown continents. 
We shall thrill to the triumphs of Hannibal." In 
this vein the speaker continued at some length. 
Multitudes of readers will join in the applause at 
the following passage : " Many learned people seem 
to feel that the quality of readableness in a book is 
one which warrants suspicion. Indeed, not a few 
learned people seem to feel that the fact that a book 
is interesting is proof that it is shallow. This is 
particularly apt to be the attitude of scientific men. 
Very few great scientists have written interestingly, 
and these few have usually felt apologetically about 
it. Yet sooner or later the time will come when the 
mighty sweep of modern scientific discovery will be 
placed by scientific men with the gift of expres- 
sion at the service of intelligent and cultivated 
laymen. Such service will be inestimable." All 
honor, however, to the hardy pioneer in science, 
whether the science of history or astronomy or chem- 
istry or whatever other department of learning, 
who has neither time nor talent for being popularly 
interesting. ... 

GREEK TRAGEDY IN THE GREEK MANNER, or 
what the best modern scholarship assumes to have 
been the Greek manner, has been delighting appre- 
ciative audiences at Cambridge, England. From 
the published accounts of the recent performance 
there of the "CEdipus Rex," it would seem that 
moderation, restraint, and a noble simplicity char- 
acterized the staging and acting of that fine drama.

blinded eyes was free from disagreeable or exag- 
gerated detail, and his crouching on the steps with 
his little daughter, while Creon, the new ruler of 
Thebes, stands above him, was an effective as well 
as somewhat novel bit of stage "business." Yet, 
as the London "Times" remarks, there was color 
and life in it all, as well as dignity. Costumes were 
rich and at the same time archaeologically correct; 
"The lighting," continues this account, "is cleverly 
and simply managed. While the protagonists main- 
tain the degree of stillness which the conditions of 
Greek tragedy demand, a certain amount of fluidity 
is attained by the movements of the chorus. There 
is no dancing ; no waving of arms ; none of the exper- 
iments that we have recently seen tried in London ; 
but there is an almost constant gentle circulation 
of all or part of the chorus. And the chorus is so 
important a feature of a Greek play that we make no 
-apology for putting them first among the players." 
The division of the play into three so-called acts, 
with a rather meaningless lowering and raising of 
the curtain to mark this division, was a concession 
to modern custom that must have seemed to many 
rather out of harmony with the spirit of the presen- 
tation as a whole. 

WRESTLING WITH RHYME and telling off his 
syllables on his fingers, the poet, however inspired, 
must become conscious at times that even his loftiest 
strains have something of verse-carpentry about 
them. This prosaic necessity of paying careful heed 
to rhyme and rhythm forms the subject of an enter- 
taining article from the pen of Professor Charles F. 
Richardson in the current "Yale Review." "The 
Morals of the Rhyming Dictionary," as he heads 
his remarks, gives many instances of oddities in 
English rhyme, and may well make a modern poet 
envious of the laxities freely allowed themselves 
by the elder bards. Herrick, for example, could 
rhyme Julia with say, but one must now be a very 
great poet indeed to escape censure for so compar- 
atively slight an offense (more to the eye than to the 
ear) as the rhyme, sister, vista. In a piece of verse 
at this moment before us in a daily newspaper, 
occurs the rhyme, lies, paradise, which would have 
excited no remark in a Wyatt or a Waller, but to- 
day grates on the critical ear, although even Ten- 
nyson permits himself a similar license in rhyming 
face with gaze, and peace with seas. From the 
revolt against the tyranny of rhyme headed by 
Roger Ascham in 1570, and ended in 1603 by the 
publication of Samuel Daniel's "Defence of Rhyme," 
we have now reacted to what might seem the ex- 
treme limit. Is the pendulum likely to swing back 
again before long, and will assonance and other sub- 
stitutes for the ear-tickling rhyme once more enjoy 
any degree of favor ? 

A PIECE OF LITERARY PORTRAITURE of Unusual 

charm is among the good things in the current num- 
ber of "The Harvard Graduates' Magazine." The 
grandson of her whose Shakespeare readings fired 
him who was to become the foremost of Shakespeare 



scholars to enter upon his "New Variorum" edition of 
the plays, draws in a few firm but delicate strokes the 
living likeness of his famous fellow-townsman, lately 
deceased. Mr. Owen Wister, Harvard '82, contri- 
butes a half-dozen most enjoyable pages on Dr. 
Horace Howard Furness, Harvard '54. Referring 
to the deaf scholar's keen appreciation of such apt 
colloquialisms as reached him through his silver ear- 
trumpet or in his reading, the writer says : " What 
breadth and liveliness of taste does this not show in 
a scholar whose early education and fifty years of 
deafness had given him an English by-gone, nearest 
kin to Charles Lamb's ! For through the ear-trumpet 
talk was condensed and abbreviated of necessity, 
and thus from fifty years of never hearing the light 
turns of contemporary speech, his own quite special, 
quite charming, phraseology had about it something 
of lavender, something of mahogany." And of his 
relish for the humorous we read: "Some people do 
not laugh well, there is in their make-up something 
askew, and their performance is harsh, thin, or false; 
Dr. Furness laughed with a whole soul, musically 
and contagiously ; I am sure that this cheered him 
often in his struggle through dark ways. He could 
tell anecdotes at his own expense until he and the 
listener would be rocking helplessly, tears of mirth 
coursing down their cheeks." Then follow a few per- 
sonal anecdotes, mirthful and serious. Those who 
fail to read Mr. Wister's sketch will miss a treat. 


HENRY CAREY BAIRD, nephew and disciple of the 
noted economist, Henry Charles Carey, and himself 
a prolific writer on subjects of finance and political 
economy, as well as a publisher of such works, de- 
parted this life with the going out of the old year. 
Philadelphia was the scene of his activities through 
a life of eighty-seven years. There he was born in 
1825, there he went to school, and there at sixteen 
years of age he entered the publishing house of Carey 
and Hart, of which his uncle, Edward L. Carey, was 
head. In 1849 he established the house of Henry 
Carey Baird & Co., which he conducted to the end 
of his life. A zealous and well-informed advocate 
of protectionism, he was at the same time (as read- 
ers of Mr. George Haven Putnam's life of his father 
will have noted) strongly opposed to that full pro- 
tection of authors' and publishers' interests which 
only adequate legislation, of international scope, can 
secure. He was one of the founders and leaders of 
the once vigorous Greenback Party, and he wrote 
"Fiat the Sign and Token of Real Money." Also 
to be credited to his pen are " American and English 
Banking Contrasted," "John Sherman A Critical 
Examination of his Claims to Statesmanship," 
"The South Shall it Ever Become so far Civilized 
. . . ," "The Supreme Court of the United States on 
the Law of Association," and other pamphlet trea- 
tises. With us his memory lingers as of one who 
always had the courage of his convictions, however 
mistaken some of those convictions may have been ; 
perhaps the more mistaken and the more hopelessly in 
the minority he was, the more resolute his stand.

THE DIAL

A SCHOOLBOY'S PITIFUL PLEA, tending to show 
that not yet is there everywhere a perfect cooperation 
between public school and public library, appears in 
" The Chronicle " of Augusta, Georgia. These are 
the lad's words: "Why not the city of Augusta or 
the schools of the city have a large library ? There 
is not a school in the city, grammar or high, that 
has a good library for their pupils to refer to. All 
that any of them have is an encyclopedia. Instead of 
having several books by different authors concerning 
one thing, they have an encyclopedia of five or six 
volumes concerning thousands of things. How do 
you expect us children to learn when we have noth- 
ing to learn from ? What libraries we have contain 
more cheap novels and plays than anything else. I 
have not been able to find the needed books con- 
cerning the scientific departments and English and 
American literature anywhere in the city. I have 
seen several boys in the school I attend given zero 
by their teacher in the last three weeks for failing 
to bring in information they could not find. Why 
do not the schools of the city come together and 
erect a good library for the use of the school chil- 
dren if the city will not? I hate to find fault, but 
I hate to see a city as large as Augusta expect her 
-children to become educated and do wonders in their 
schools when they have nothing to do with. Why 
not somebody make a move?" This ought to wake 
up the city fathers of Augusta, and, if given wider 
than local publicity, the governing bodies of other 
cities also. . . . 

THE BREAKING OF VIRGIN SOIL IN BIBLIOGRA- 
PHY must be credited to Mr. Charles Evans, whose 
" American Bibliography," now in its seventh 
volume, presents in scholarly and handsome form a 
chronological list of " all books, pamphlets, and peri- 
odical publications printed in the United States of 
America from the genesis of printing in 1639 down 
to and including the year 1820, with bibliographical 
and biographical notes," and also with a statement 
of the " auction value " of each extant publication, 
so -far as known. A circular from the compiler to 
librarians sketches the origin and growth of this 
.monumental work. The need of such a bibliog- 
raphy was felt by Mr. Evans thirty years ago when 
he was himself engaged in library work, and he 
applied himself to the task of meeting the need, 
until at last, with a great mass of material collected, 
no new items were discoverable, and he became con- 
vinced of the approximate completeness of his data, 
so far as completeness was humanly possible. The 
volume just issued covers the years 1786-1789. 
Librarians and others interested in the work and 
not yet acquainted with it, should communicate with 
Mr. Evans at 1413 Pratt Avenue, Rogers Park, 
Chicago. ... 

THE SALE OF ANDREW LANG'S BOOKS, or of 
such of them as were not retained by the family, 
is reported as having taken place at Sotheby's in 
London, with the result that something short of 
nine hundred pounds was realized for three hundred 



and one lots, the highest price paid for any one 
book being forty-one pounds for Keats's "Lamia and 
Other Poems," first edition, with a slip inscribed by 
Lang, "The generous gift of a lady unknown to the 
beneficiary." Of books from his own pen, "The 
Black Thief " elicited the highest bid, eight pounds. 
"Very rare indeed; the author's only dramatic 
work," he had written on the catalogue slip. His 
" Ballads in Blue China," first edition, brought only 
thirty shillings. Of course there were many books 
on Scottish history, and others about the Maid of 
Orleans; but all these, pathetic reminders of his 
labors in his chosen fields, were sold at prices repre- 
senting their intrinsic rather than their sentimental 
or associational value. The scattering of an author's 
library, especially its sale under the auctioneer's 
ruthless hammer, always seems a sort of sacrilege ; 
and in this instance the books seemed to carry with 
them more of their former owner's personality than 
in the case of many a larger and more famous col- 
lection. . . . 

MILITANT METHODS OF SPELLING-REFORM are 
urged by the managing editor of the " Standard 
Dictionary," who believes the time has come for the 
reformers " to profit from the experience of their 
more aggressive sisters, the suffragets." This calls 
up fearful visions. Shops displaying signs or an- 
nouncements in unreformed spelling, publishing 
houses unconverted to the phonetic faith, bookstores 
selling literature in the orthography of our fathers, 
schools teaching the said orthography, restaurants 
offering on their bills of fare " doughnuts " instead 
of "donuts " these and a hundred other innocently 
offending establishments would become the scenes 
of window-smashing, head-breaking, and other angry 
antics. Peaceful citizens, suddenly challenged on 
the street to spell pharyngitis or pharmacopoeia, 
would be liable to phrensied (or, rather, frenzied) 
assault with the first stammered ph from their 
trembling lips. Marching brigades of spelling- 
reformers would make the night shuddersome with 
their shrill slogan, and at all hours of the day the 
welkin might be subjected to the indignity of being 
made to ring with ear-piercing campaign songs, 
which would naturally take the form of stridently 
chanted spellings after the rules in force at No. 1 
Madison Avenue. Truly, a terrifying prospect ! 

* 

THE LURE OF THE SHOW-WINDOW, as utilized 
by booksellers as well as candy-dealers and haber- 
dashers and others, might be made contributory to 
the public library's greater usefulness. Indeed, one 
such library in a certain large city St. Louis, to 
be specific before moving into its present palatial 
building (palaces have no show-windows) exulted in 
the possesion of six large plate-glass windows in a 
row, on the ground floor, looking onto the sidewalk ; 
and these splendid display spaces were turned to 
good account for the exhibition of all sorts of tempt- 
ing literary wares, with results gratifying to the 
head of the circulating department. But with the

library's removal to more stately quarters it neces- 
sarily ceased to lure the sidewalk-saunterer in the 
old way; and now Dr. Bostwick, the librarian, as 
quoted in the "Library Notes and News" of the 
Minnesota Public Library Commission, sorrowfully 
asks: "When, oh, when shall we have libraries 
(branches at any rate, if our main buildings must 
be monumental) that will throw themselves open to 
the public eye, luring in the wayfarer to the joys of 
reading, as a commercial window does to the delights 

of gum-drops or neckties?" 



AN IMPENETRABLE LITERARY MYSTERY Or, at 

least, impenetrable until the Psychic Researchers 
shall succeed in getting into undoubted communica- 
tion with the disembodied spirit of Charles Dickens 
is the "Mystery of Edwin Drood." Many have 
essayed a solution of the problem how the unfinished 
novel was meant by its author to end ; and Wilkie 
Collins's published attempt to answer the question 
is familiar to the reading public. The latest notable 
essay in the same field is that of Dr. W. Robertson 
Nicoll, who is reported to have had access to new 
material bearing on the question, and he has writ- 
ten a book entitled "The Problem of Edwin Drood," 
which has just appeared on both sides of the Atlantic. 
It will find eager readers among those who delight 

in literary knots and tangles. 



THE DISCOVERY OF UNPUBLISHED TURGENIEFF 

MANUSCRIPTS of considerable importance is reported 
from Russia. A close friend of the Russian au- 
thor has recently died, and an examination of his 
personal effects reveals the existence of two unsus- 
pected products of Turgenieff 's pen, one a drama 
without title, the other a novel bearing the name, 
"The Adventures of Captain Bubnof." The latter 
is described as "representing in a Romanesque fash- 
ion a true adventure taken from Russian low life," 
which may mean that here we have something in 
an entirely new vein from the author of "Spring 
Floods." At any rate, curiosity waits on the appear- 
ance, in print and in translation, of one or both of 
these unearthed treasures. 



COMMUNICATION. 

ILLINOIS HISTORY IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA 

BRITANNICA. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

May I take advantage of your space to correct some 
misstatements which I have found in the article on 
"Illinois " in the new (eleventh) edition of the " Ency- 
clopedia Britannica " ? 

In the account of the discovery of the western coun- 
try given in the course of the article it is said that " in 
1672, Jacques Marquette, a Jesuit father, . . . explored 
the country around Chicago." This passage is followed 
by the account of the expedition led by Joliet and Mar- 
quette in the next year (1673). The writer thus states 
as a fact that Marquette had visited this region in the 
year previous to that in which the discovery of the Upper 
Mississippi and the " country around Chicago " was 
made. There is no hint of such a visit by Marquette 



given anywhere in the " Jesuit Relations " ; Parkman 
makes no mention of it; and even J. G. Shea, whose 
exhaustive investigations concerning the activities of 
the missionaries is well known, seems to be unaware of 
any such visit in 1672. Indeed, the article entitled 
" Marquette " in the " Britannica " refers to the part 
taken by the missionary in these words : " In 1673 he 
was chosen with Joliet for the exploration of the Mis- 
sissippi," etc., there being no mention whatever of a 
previous visit to the regions discovered. In Volume 
LIX., page 87, of the " Jesuit Relations " it is said that 
Father Marquette had long premeditated making a 
journey of discovery and exploration, having heard from 
the Indians who visited him at his mission on Lake Su- 
perior of the Great River and the nations of the West, 
and he had made " several efforts to commence this 
undertaking, but ever in vain" and then follows the 
account of the expedition of 1673. 

It would also seem that the name of Marquette is 
made unduly prominent in the account of the discovery, 
the impression being given that he was the leader; 
whereas it is a fact that Joliet was the officer in com- 
mand and Marquette the accompanying missionary, in 
accordance with the custom in all such expeditions sent 
out by the French. There was, indeed, " glory enough 
for both " in this great achievement, but the order in 
which their names should be given is to place Joliet's 
first. Shea, quoting Father Dablon, says that both 
Frontenac and Talon had " selected for the enterprise 
the Sieur Jollyet, whom they deemed competent for so 
great a design, wishing to see Father Marquette accom- 
pany him." 

Further on in the course of this article on Illinois it 
is said that the explorers Joliet and Marquette (the 
writer of the article invariably places Marquette's name 
first), on their return from the discovery of the Missis- 
sippi, "ascended the Illinois river as far as Lake Peoria; 
they then crossed the portage to Lake Michigan." But 
surely they ascended the Illinois river to a point much 
farther north than Lake Peoria. Marquette himself in 
his journal says that the party found a village of Illinois 
Indians called Kaskaskia, a name, by the way, which 
was afterwards transferred to another locality in the 
southern part of what is now the state of Illinois. This 
village was situated about where the town of Utica now 
stands, and from thence the explorers were guided by 
Indians to Lake Michigan. Of course it was possible 
even from the village mentioned to reach the lake over 
at least three different portages, though it is generally 
believed that they entered the lake by way of the 
Desplaines-Chicago portage. The statement, therefore, 
that the party made a portage into Lake Michigan from 
Lake Peoria cannot be correct. 

It is said again that in the War of 1812 the Indians, 
owing to their dissatisfaction with the treaties of 1795 
and 1804, espoused the cause of the British, " and in 
1812 they captured Fort Dearborn on the present site of 
Chicago, and massacred many of the prisoners." This 
gives a distinctly wrong impression, and it would seem 
that an equally brief statement (if brevity was neces- 
sary) might have been made conveying a more accurate 
description. The fort was abandoned, not captured, and 
the garrison was massacred after it had left the fort. 
Neither the men composing the retreating force nor the 
women and children accompanying it were prisoners at 
any time previous to the attack, and only those who sur- 
vived became prisoners. j SEYMOUR CURREY.

THE AUTHOR OF " IJAVENGRO." * 

On a cursory view, and from the standpoint 
of the average man, George Borrow's life 
seems curiously and unnecessarily disappoint- 
ing. With an extraordinary facility in ac- 
quiring languages, with an intense enthusiasm 
for everything romantic, with the restlessness 
of the born wanderer, with a physique that 
allowed him when past seventy to swim in the 
icy waters of the fen ponds in Richmond Park, 
and with a marvellous knack of getting on 
terms of intimate intercourse with the romantic 
flotsam of a dozen races, he found only two 
opportunities for real service. The first was 
when the Bible Society sent him to Russia to 
edit a Manchu version of the New Testament. 
After his return from Russia he was sent to 
Spain to print and distribute the New Testa- 
ment in Spanish. In both these enterprises 
Borrow showed such zeal, coupled with extraor- 
dinary business sense and ability in overcoming 
all the obstacles which those two dilatory and 
unfriendly governments could devise, that one 
can only marvel at the blindness of that agent 
of Providence, the British and Foreign Bible 
Society, in leaving "the door shut" upon such 
a signally gifted servant as George Borrow. 

While at St. Petersburg, Borrow printed 
"Targum : or Metrical Translations from Thirty 
[actually, thirty-five] Languages and Dialects," 
a book remarkable for its wide range of sources, 

o 

but hopelessly mediocre in metrical charm, 
and unfortunate in its place of publication, if 
Borrow had any idea of reaching an English 
audience. On his return from Spain Borrow 
made, in 1841, a moderate but promising be- 
ginning of literary fame by his "Zincali, or The 
Gypsies in Spain" a venture along hitherto 
untra veiled byways. This auspicious opening 
he followed up in 1842 by The Bible in Spain," 
which was immediately and satisfyingly popular. 
Thus prosperously started on his career as man 
of letters, he disappointed the public of his own 
day by " Lavengro " and " The Romany Rye"; 
did not increase his popularity by "Wild 
Wales"; and brought ridicule upon himself by

his last venture, the " Romano Lavo-Lil," in 
1874, which revealed the seeming paradox that, 
as Mr. John Sampson phrases it, "A great but 
careless linguist, Borrow was assuredly no phil- 
ologist." After that he dropped out of sight so 
completely that the announcement of his death 
in July, 1881, startled people who knew his 
books, for they had thought him long since 
dead. Even Mr. Theodore Watts-Dun ton, 
whose veracity has not usually been called in 
question, " lost caste " in the late seventies be- 
cause he brazenly maintained that he had re- 
cently been in the company of Borrow and of 
Robert Latham, both of them men " who were 
well known to have been dead years ago." 

On the face of the returns, then, George 
Borrow gave to the Bible Society seven years 
of his life, and for seventeen thereafter was 
engaged in writing books profitable to himself 
and delightful to the public ; but the last fifteen 
years of his life, like the first thirty, were spent 
in aimless, discontented, unaccomplishing rest- 
lessness. Nevertheless, though the fact remains 
that the seven happiest and fullest years of his 
life were those he spent in the service of the 
Bible Society, his work has proved astonishingly 
permanent, and his fame and popularity have 
been steadily growing. The Manchu version 
of the New Testament which Borrow edited 
nearly ninety years ago is still in use. His 
" Zincali " attracted to the gypsies and to the 
study of Romani the very men who thirty years 
later were horrified by his " Romano Lavo-Lil." 
The German scholars have confined themselves 
to irony and exclamation points when dealing 
with Borrow's philology, but the English gypsy- 
scholars have all recognized and praised the won- 
derful sureness with which Borrow " sensed " 
gypsy ways and gypsy thought ; in the words of 
"that perfect scholar-gypsy and gypsy-scholar," 
Francis Hindes Groome, "he communicates a 
subtle insight into Gypsydom that is totally 
wanting in the works " of others. Moreover, the 
books which disappointed Borrow's own gener- 
ation have been steadily growing more popular. 
Sufficient evidence of the truth of this state- 
ment may be found in the fact that to-day seven 
British publishers issue complete editions of 
Borrow's works, and a half dozen others have 
on their lists " Lavengro " and " The Bible in 
Spain." It is not surprising, then, that in this 
year of grace thirty-odd years after Borrow's 
death, and seventy years after the first appear- 
ance of "The Bible in Spain" we have his 
" Letters to the Bible Society," and two new 
biographies, with a third in prospect.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



A glance at Sorrow's bibliography will suffice 
to show that few men have been as successful 
as he in throwing about their simplest annals a 
veil of mystery. After his death in 1881 three 
friends Whitwell Elwin, A. Egmont Hake, 
and Theodore Watts sent to "The Athe- 
naeum " articles about him ; and Mr. Hake later 
wrote for the " Dictionary of National Biog- 
raphy " a brief sketch, based on personal ac- 
quaintance, but with little access to material, 
and consequently furnishing only meagre de- 
tails, some conjecture, and some positive misin- 
formation. The first extended biography was 
Dr. William I. Knapp's " Life, Writings, and 
Correspondence of George Borrow," in two vol- 
umes. This appeared in March, 1899 eighteen 
years after Borrow's death, and was issued ap- 
propriately in England by the house of Murray, 
which had published Borrow's seven chief books, 
and in America by the Putnams, who in 1843 
had re-issued " The Bible in Spain." Dr. Knapp's 
equipment was in many ways exceptional. He 
was himself a good deal of a linguist, had trav- 
elled extensively in Spain, and was able to 
devote himself for several years to following in 
Borrow's footsteps. He had access to the con- 
siderable material in Mr. Murray's possession, 
acquired many MSS.,and met many of Borrow's 
kinsmen and acquaintances. Unfortunately, 
Mrs. MacOubrey, Borrow's step-daughter, re- 
fused to communicate with him, and the officials 
of the Bible Society were unable to find Borrow's 
letters to them until (the bitter irony of it is 
almost tragic) a week after Dr. Knapp's book 
appeared ! 

In spite of this failure to get hold of some of 
the important documents, however, the book is 
likely to remain the basic life, because Dr. 
Knapp spoke with many people now dead, and 
visited many spots now changed, and because his 
pioneer work in tracing Borrow's wanderings, 
checking up his chronology, and running down 
his etymologies, is subject only to minor correc- 
tion and revision. The defects of the book are 
that while it is elaborately and usefully doc- 
umented, its procedure is analysis and dissection, 
so that we do not get as a total result a vivid- 
ness or clearness of impression quite in keeping 
with what the real George Borrow indubitably 
was. 

The next attempt at a life of Borrow was 
made by Mr. R. A. J. Walling of Plymouth, in 
1908. His " George Borrow : The Man and His 
Work" gathers up a few sources of information 
denied to Knapp, but its chief service is in clear- 
ing the memory of Sir John Bowring from the 



mud with which Borrow's hatred had so liberally 
plastered it. 

Now at last, some dozen years after their 
rediscovery, appear the "Letters to the Bible 
Society." This volume comprises 106 letters 
and four reports addressed to the Society or to 
its officials from Russia and Spain, connected 
and explained by much transcript from the rec- 
ords of the Society and from its letters to Bor- 
row. Borrow's communications are given entire ; 
one could wish that the Society's letters to him, 
especially the Rev. Andrew Brandram's, had not 
been condensed. Mr. Darlow says very truth- 
fully that "certainly no other society ever pos- 
sessed such an astonishing correspondent," and 
calls Borrow "this most remarkable of its ser- 
vants." As Mr. Jenkins says: 

" In all probability the Bible Society has never had,, 
and never will have again, an agent such as Borrow, who 
on occasion could throw aside the cloak of humility and 
grasp a two-edged sword with which to discomfit his 
enemies, and who solemnly chanted the creed of Islam 
whilst engaged as a Christian missionary. There was 
something magnificent in his Christianity ; it savoured of 
the Crusades in its pre-Reformation virility. Martyr- 
dom he would accept if absolutely necessary, but he 
preferred that if martyrs there must be they should be 
selected from the ranks of the enemy, whilst he, George 
Borrow, represented the strong arm of the Lord." 

The effect which Borrow had upon the Rev. 
Andrew Brandram, as we see it reflected in this 
volume, excites both to mirth and to melancholy. 
The reverend Secretary was exactly what one 
would expect the holder of such a position in 
the thirties of the last century to be: sincere, 
zealous, rather obtrusively pious in manner and 
speech, without much imagination or ability to 
understand a man so entirely unconventional 
and untamed as Borrow. One of the many 
" tongues ". to which Borrow turnjed his attention 
was the religious lingo current in Bible Society 
circles, and it is highly diverting to see the way 
in which Brandram was often moved to prayer 
and reproof by Borrow's imperfect mastery of its 
idioms. In his biography, Mr. Jenkins repro- 
duces a capital silhouette of Brandram, which 
so exquisitely corresponds with the personality 
revealed in his letters that we suspect the Bible 
Society did not care to print it with the "Let- 
ters." Still, even when we put silhouette and 
correspondence together, we think the candid 
reader must agree with Mr. Darlow's carefully 
qualified statement that "though there was con- 
siderable demand on both sides for patience and 
tolerance, yet as a whole the relationship proved 
creditable to all parties concerned." But if we 
were called upon to characterize the Society's 
action in depriving itself of the further services

of Borrow, we hardly think our choice would 
fall upon the word "creditable." 

It is difficult to say which section of these 
letters is the more absorbing, those from Rus- 
sia, which cover new ground for Borrovians, or 
the others, which furnish so much comparison 
with " The Bible in Spain." It is enough to say 
that Borrow made use of not more than one- 
third of the material of these letters, and that 
they corroborated by the records of the Bible 
Society show us not only Borrow the restless 
adventurer, with his strange and dramatic alter- 
nations of agonizing melancholy and hilarious 
exultation, but a Borrow hardly glimpsed else- 
where, a skilful diplomat, an expert man of 
affairs, possessed of almost superhuman energy 
and resourcefulness in carrying through the 
work of the Society. 

Although Mr. Herbert Jenkins's " Life of 
George Borrow " appeared only a few weeks 
after the " Letters,'' Mr. Jenkins fortunately 
had free use of typewritten copies of them. In 
addition he unearthed much material in the 
Public Record Office, and received generous 
help from many Borrovians, a number of whom 
were able to get for him hitherto unpublished 
letters. All of this new material made it 
possible for Mr. Jenkins to write a Life which 
both corrects and supplements Dr. Knapp's, 
especially in the chapters on Borrow in Russia 
and in Spain. To this part of Borrow's life, 
indeed, Mr. Jenkins devotes nearly half his book. 
In truth, those seven years were the only ones 
in which Borrow put forth all his energies in 
successful effort "concentrated" years, his 
biographer calls them. The pity of it is that 
from all accounts Borrow might just as well 
have had twice as many more like them. 

The second biography is Mr. Edward 
Thomas's " George Borrow : The Man and His 
Books." Mr. Thomas claims to offer no new 
information about Borrow, and attempts " only 
a re-arrangement of the, myriad details access- 
ible to all in the writings of Borrow and about 
Borrow." Nevertheless Mr. Thomas has done 
at least two things that his fellow biographers 
have tried to do only incidentally : he has given 
a full-length portrait of Borrow, very largely 
in Borrow's own words, and on the background 
of the romantic and the unusual on which 
Borrow loved to present himself as the domi- 
nating figure; and he has analyzed Borrow's 
mind and style. Since in these two respects 
the book is a new departure in Borrovian liter- 
ature, and since it finds ample justification in 
its success, let us quote a few sentences. 



Of Borrow's style Mr. Thomas says (pp. 
195-6): 

" Very little of Borrow's effectiveness can seriously 
be attributed to this or that quality of style, for it will 
amount to saying that he had an effective style. But 
it may be permissible to point out that it is also a style 
that is unnoticeable except for what it effects. It runs 
at times to rotten Victorianism, both heavy and vague, 
as when he calls El Greco or Domenico ' a most extra- 
ordinary genius, some of whose productions possess 
merit of a very high order.' He is capable of calling 
the eye the ' orb of vision,' and the moon ' the beauteous 
luminary.' . . . The beauteous luminary ' vein and the 
Biblical vein may be said to be inseparable from the long 
cloak, the sombrero, the picturesque romance of mystery 
of Spain, as they appeared to one for whom romance 
and mystery alike were never without pomp. But with 
all his rant he is invariably substantial, never aerial, 
and he chequers it in a Byronic manner with a sudden 
prose reference to bugs, or a question, or a piece of 
dialogue. 

" His dialogue can hardly be overpraised. It is life- 
like in its effect, though not in its actual phrases, and 
it breaks up the narrative and description over and over 
again at the right time." 

Of Borrow himself and the way he puts him- 
self into his books, he says in his Conclusion 

(p. 317): 

" He sings himself. He creates a wild Spain, a wild 
England, a wild Wales, and in them places himself, the 
Gypsies, and other wildish men, and himself again. His 
outstanding character, his ways and gestures, irresistible 
even when offensive, hold us while he is in our presence. 
In these repressed indoor days, we like a swaggering 
man who does justice to the size of the planet. We run 
after biographies of extraordinary monarchs, poets, ban- 
dits, prostitutes, and see in them magnificent expansions 
of our fragmentary, undeveloped, or mistaken selves. 
We love strange mighty men, especially when they are 
dead and can no longer rob us of property, sleep, or life : 
we can handle the great hero or blackguard by the fire- 
side as easily as a cat. 

" Borrow, as his books portray him, is admirably 
fitted to be our hero. He stood six-feet-two and was 
so finely made that, in spite of his own statement which 
could not be less than true, others have declared him 
six-feet-three and six-feet-four. He could box, ride, 
walk, swim, and endure hardship. He was adventurous. 
He was solitary. He was opinionated and a bully. He 
was mysterious: he impressed all and puzzled many. 
He spoke thirty languages and translated their poetry 
into verse. 

" Moreover, he ran away. He ran away from school 
as a boy. He ran away from London as a youth. He 
ran away from England as a man. He ran away from 
West Brompton as an old man, to the Gypsyries of 
London. He went out into the wilderness and he 
savoured of it. His running away from London has 
something grand and allegorical about it. . . ." 

In addition to the general mystery with which 
Borrow surrounded himself by vague allusions 
and by shuffling dates and incidents, he has left 
two special mysteries for Borrovians to speculate 
upon. One of these is the " veiled period " from 
1825 to 1832. Dr. Knapp was able to show that 



46 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



Borrow was in London and Norwich at various 
times during these seven years, so that he could 
not have been wandering all the time. Mr. 
Jenkins gathers up Borrow's various allusions 
to places which he visited, if at all, during these 
years, and comments (p. 77): 

" It may be argued that Borrow was merely posing 
as a great traveller, but the foregoing remarks are too 
casual, too much in the nature of asides, to be the utter- 
ances of a poseur. A man seeking to impress himself 
upon the world as a great traveller would probably have 
been a little more definite. . . . There is every prob- 
ability that he roamed about the Continent and met 
with adventures he was a man to whom adventures 
gravitated quite naturally. . . ." 

But Mr. Jenkins goes on to remark that, as the 
Foreign Office Records show, if Borrow went 
abroad, he certainly did so without obtaining 
a passport. Mr. Thomas thinks that 
"A little too much has been made of this 'veiled 
period,' not by Borrow, but by others. It would have 
been fair to surmise that if he chose not to write about 
this period of his life, either there was very little in it, 
or there was something in it which he was unwilling 
perhaps ashamed to disclose ; and what has been dis- 
covered suggests that he was in an unsettled state. . . . 
Borrow himself took no great pains to preserve the veil." 

If we know all that we are to know, then it 
seems that Mr. Thomas's surmise is the right 
one that "there was very little in it," for it 
seems incredible that "a man to whom," as Mr. 
Jenkins has reminded us, " adventure gravitated 
quite naturally," should have done very much 
wandering in those years without finding mate- 
rial for more than vague allusions; and that 
there was anything in them of which he was 
" ashamed " except because of lack of romantic 
adventure is extremely unlikely, when we re- 
call how clean the rest of his life was, and espe- 
cially how, in all his association with the riff-raff 
of Europe, he never descended to their level of 
speech or conduct, but maintained always his 
own respect and theirs. 

The other mystery is the question, Did Bor- 
row actually write in seven days the "Life and 
Adventures of Joseph Sell, the Great Travel- 
ler"? Or is it merely one more of the "ghost 
books" that haunt our literature? Knapp 
thought it a short story; Mr. Jenkins believes 
in it. He comments (p. 55) : 

" In favour of the story having been actually written, 
is the knowledge that Borrow invented little or nothing. 
Collateral evidence has shown how little he deviated 
from actual happenings, although he did not hesitate to 
revise dates or colour events. The strongest evidence, 
however, lies in the atmosphere of truth that pervades 
Chapters LV-LVII of Lavengro. They are convincing. 
At one time or another during his career, it would appear 
that Borrow wrote against time from grim necessity; 
otherwise he must have been a master of invention, which 



everything that is known about him clearly shows that 
he was not." 

Mr. Thomas says that "There is no evidence 
except that the account sounds true, and might 
very well be true." Inasmuch as Mr. Thomas 
has found "The Dairyman's Daughter," which 
Sir Richard Phillips commended to Borrow's 
attention, someone may some day find a copy of 
"Joseph Sell." Mr. John Sampson, it may be 
added, is entirely sceptical. In his Introduction 
to "The Romany Rye" he writes: 

" The name ' Sell ' which in some curious fashion 
seems to carry conviction to Professor Knapp's mind, 
seems to me a singularly inauspicious one, especially 
when coming from a writer who, like Pakornovna, was 
' born not far from the sign of the gammon,' and who 
boasts in his appendix of having inserted deliberate 
misstatements in his books in order to deceive and mis- 
lead the critics." 

For further light upon Borrow's life there 
seem to be left just two possible sources of 
information. No one has thus far been able 
to trace Borrow's letters to the one man with 
whom he seems to have been really intimate 
the Dane, John Hasfeldt, whom he first met in 
St. Petersburg. Are those letters still in exist- 
ence? If they are, they should be almost worth 
all the rest. The other source is in what may 
have been left in the hands of Borrow's step- 
daughter Henrietta, Mrs. MacOubrey. She died 
at Great Yarmouth in 1904, and in 1907 Mr. 
Clement Shorter announced that "All her lit- 
erary effects, including many interesting MSS., 
have been passed on to me by her executor, Mr. 
Hubert Smith, and these will be used in my 
forthcoming biography of Borrow." This biog- 
raphy was announced for issue a year ago. but 
Mr. Shorter has written that it will not appear 
before next spring at the earliest. He does not 
divulge what light these MSS. may throw upon 
the questions we have touched on ; but if he 
makes as good a biography as either of the two 
here reviewed, he will have the gratitude of all 
good Borrovians a tribe that increaseth daily.

A GREAT ART GENIUS SELF-REVEALED.* 



Although there have been six French editions 
of Rodin's "Conversations," the "most impor- 
tant art work of years," it is only now that we 
have the book in an English translation. Rodin, 
greatest of the moderns though he is, has until 
recently been very inadequately appreciated in

of Paul Gsell by Mrs. Romilly Fedden. Illustrated. Boston :

England and far too little known in America. 
Now at last we have a fine collection of his most 
representative sculpture in the New York Met- 
ropolitan Museum, and through that and the 
present book we can begin to study the man 
and his work as both deserve. 

The volume just published in so magnificent 
a dress consists of a series of talks between the 
master and his admiring disciple, Paul Gsell, 
conversations delightfully set, sometimes in 
Rodin's old chateau at Meudon, sometimes in 
Paris either at the Louvre or at the studio in the 
Hotel Biron. The sculptor does what few artists 
have been willing or able to do, he analyzes his 
own impulses and ideas, explains their formula- 
tion in his works, and indicates their relation to 
modern life and to the art of other periods. This 
unusually frank and generous self -revelation is 
of course the most interesting element in the 
book. 

The man appears as a vehemently sincere 
and philosophical student of reality, the centre 
of whose belief is in constant work carried on by 
the inspiration of a universal sympathy and by 
a method which is an unexhausted probing of 
surface actualities in the search for their subtlest 
meanings. As Mr. Bernard Shaw says, in a 
recent witty review in the London "Nation," 
" Rodin . . . knows what is important and what 
is not, and what can be taught and what cannot ; 
. . . apart from the acquired skill of his hands, 
which he shares with any stone mason, he has 
only two qualifications to make him the divinest 
workman now living. One is a profounder and 
more accurate vision than anyone else's. The 
other is an incorruptible veracity." The vision, 
Rodin insists again and again, is the result of 
the veracity. If the first commandment of an 
artist's religion is, he says, to understand thor- 
oughly the modeling of a leg or an arm, it is 
because without ceaseless striving for an exact 
knowledge of forms the artist can never hope to 
convey successfully the significance of his work, 
his own sense of its inner spirit. Nature, tire- 
lessly watched and questioned and interpreted, 
makes it possible for the sculptor or the poet or 
the musician in his poem, whether the medium 
be bronze or words or tone, to raise the veil a 
little from the face of life, and in particular to 
show us something of the value of the emotions 
that are our deepest experiences. And it is by 
this illumination cast fearlessly into every nook 
and cranny of our world, that the artist group 
serve their fellow-men. 

The philosophic theory touched upon through- 
out this sesthetic is as alive and modern as the 



figures in which the sculptor has best ex- 
pressed it and himself. Instinct and intuition, 
those long-despised human tools which specula- 
tion is only just beginning to rank equally with 
intelligence, are understood as playing an im- 
portant part in our comprehension of reality. 
Something very like the "will to power" of 
Nietzsche, the elan vital of Bergson, is con- 
ceived as working itself out in the complex unity 
of our struggling life, giving to its every mani- 
festation an infinite value, and apprehended by 
us through our warmest feelings quite as in- 
tensely, indeed more intensely, than by our 
coolest thoughts. It is because to a passionate 
sympathy nothing is meaningless or ugly that 
Rodin so emphasizes tolerance of judgment, so 
insists on a broadening of our appreciations that 
will compel us to see a terrible beauty even in so 
deformed a wreck as "Le vieille Heaulmiere." 
Surely her creator has shown that the old woman 
carries a poignant history in herself, not only of 
her own career but of the age that made her pos- 
sible. His mission (the religious term is not 
ill-applied to an ideal envisaged with so much 
fervor) Rodin describes as this apprehending of 
individual values and the attempt to commu- 
nicate them to his contemporaries. Since he 
sees further than he has yet taught most of us 
to see, his work, like that of every other seer, 
has naturally been regarded askance by his 
generation and labeled ugly and immoral by 
those who do not understand it. Everything 
new is strange and uncomfortably puzzling to 
us habit- ridden and unad venturous creatures, 
every unaccustomed freedom, especially of 
bodily pose or motion, is by the majority eyed 
suspiciously when not hastily covered up or 
severely frowned down. From this public 
conservatism springs the ancient and yet ever- 
fresh controversy over the relation of art to 
morality. But the old problem never troubles 
a creative genius ; he leaves its solution to the 
critics and is content to go on formulating truths 
as he grasps them, sure that from the new paths 
he is hewing out, our view of nature will slowly 
widen and deepen. 

If Rodin had his way we would all be artists. 
His Utopia, like William Morris's, is founded on 
a vision of universal creative joy. Would it not 
be delightful, he says, if every man could take 
the pleasure in his particular task that the artist 
takes in his ? Then we should have carpenters 
who rejoice in the sawing of beams, masons revel- 
ling in the cutting of stones, teamsters finding 
satisfaction in treating their beasts well. If more 
of such joy-bringing enthusiasm for individual

work were prevalent, more of us would " walk 
the earth like gods," with eyes for the number- 
less marvels before us ; to more of us would be 
given the sympathy and the vision that are the 
essence of the artist's mind. 

It is impossible in the brief compass of this 
notice to suggest more than the central point 
of view of this wonderfully stimulating and sug- 
gestive book ; the artist will find in the volume 
itself endless delight, and to the layman it will 
open many fresh interests. The very beautiful 
illustrations, which include two portraits and 
numerous reproductions of small studies not 
found in the French editions, add great value to 
the text ; the half-tones are perhaps not so suc- 
cessful as those in the less pretentious Paris pub- 
lication, but the photogravures are much finer. 
Unfortunately, the English text has none of the 
charm of the original ; it is a literal rendering 
of M. Gsell's lively idioms, but so faithful to 
Gallic turns of phrase as to sound foreign in 
English and not a little stiff and ungraceful. 
Delicate shades of meaning, playful turns of wit, 
exuberance of enthusiasm, all these qualities 
of the original are here levelled into the some- 
what plodding style of a conscientious linguistic 
student. Yet even through so disappointing a 
medium there glows the spirit of the book's 
author, his whole-hearted worship of life and its 
beauty, his undaunted devotion to his difficult

LOUD BYRON AS A SATIRIST.* 

The "noble minor" whose "Hours of Idle- 
ness" received the lash in the "Edinburgh 
Review" of 1807, and who was stung by the 
censure (of Jeffrey, as he thought) into becom- 
ing a poet more worthy of consideration, had 
enjoyed little training of the proper sort for 
the career of letters as indeed he afterwards 
disclosed : 

" And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame, 
My springs of life were poisoned." 

It is common to make a sharp antithesis between 
"life" and "books" between the discipline in 
school and the discipline without ; but it is also 
vulgar, and we cannot justify the antithesis by 
reason. Unfortunate in his early surround- 
ings, unsettled in his schooling, Byron grew up 
an omnivorous and uncritical, though biased, 
reader, with a long memory for the substance of 
history, epic poetry, and the drama; but he had a 

*LORD BYRON AS A SATIRIST IN VERSE. By Claude M. 
Fuess, Ph.D. New York: Columbia University Press. 



slipshod verbal memory that interfered with the 
precision of his acquirements, and he lacked the 
fine sense for the use of words which represents 
an inner clarity of thought and definiteness of 
emotion, and which distinguishes the poet from 
the occasionally felicitous rhymster which dis- 
tinguishes Horace, whom as a boy he " hated so," 
from the author not only of "English Bards 
and Scotch Reviewers," but of "Beppo," "Don 
Juan," "The Vision of Jiidgment," and even 
"Hints from Horace," written at a time when 
the Roman poet had become an object of Byron's 
admiration. If one's springs of life are so 
poisoned as to be permanently vitiated, if mind 
and heart are so undisciplined that the brain at 
length becomes 

" In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought, 
A whirling gulf of phantasy and flame " 

(whatever that may mean), the flow of language 
from such a well is unlikely to be English pure 
and undefiled. 

The truth is, even when he has become more 
stoical, Byron is no literary artist ; he often loses 
control of his medium, and of ten carelessly abuses 
it. If Tennyson and Milton, for example, in the 
use of words and figures, and indeed in every 
element of style, exhibit the sureness of touch 
that characterizes a great painter like Rembrandt 
or Da Vinci in the laying on of pigments, or a 
great composer such as Beethoven in the choice 
and arrangement of musical notes, Byron by 
comparison is wholly lacking in sensitiveness as 
to the details of the English language and its 
syntax. Now, to return, this sensitiveness is 
largely a matter of early discipline of heart and 
head, and in the mature writer is an element of 
his personality. It is an element in Swift, as 
in Juvenal or Horace. It is an element in the 
character of a great satirist, as it is in that of a 
tragic or an epic poet. Even though the satirist 
debases his medium, and for his own purposes 
departs from the accepted usage, he must do so 
with a full, and not a fumbling, sense of what 
is right. 

And yet, if he was trained for anything, Byron 
was trained for the writing of satire. His poetry 
has its immediate roots in the poetry of "The 
Anti- Jacobin "; its models, so far as the native 
literature is concerned, are to be found in Pope 
and Dryden ; his best efforts sprang from the 
influence, direct or indirect, of the Italian school 
of Berni and Pulci ; he was not untouched by the 
severer part of Dante ; and he ultimately harks 
back to Juvenal and Horace. With the main 
body of European satire, outside of the Middle 
Ages, Byron was more or less familiar; some 



1913.] 



THE DIAL 



49 



authors, as Horace and Pulci, he studied with 
attention. Nor is it without significance that the 
opening of "English Bards and Scotch Review- 
ers " is an imitation of the first two lines in 
Juvenal. Byron had also seen the world, as the 
say ing goes not Plato's world, nor more than 
a third of Dante's, and hardly so much as the 
world of Lucian. He knew "life " not an abun- 
dant life, not life seen steadily and as a whole, 
but life externally diversified and shifting. He 
knew men, including certain good men like Scott 
and Moore, and was interested in them though 
not in Christian men as such nor in virtuous 
women. In the region where satire has interests 
in common with literary criticism (which is also a 
criticism of life), Byron eventually gained some 
special knowledge. He is not unacquainted with 
certain documents of great significance in poeti- 
cal theory. He translated and adapted the " Ars 
Poetica" of Horace, and can speak jocularly of 
the treatises of Aristotle and Longinus. At the 
same time, he regards the theory of literature 
as a set of arbitrary rules and precepts, not as 
a body of living principles ; and his own critical 
estimates and predictions in "English Bards 
and Scotch Reviewers " turned out to be mainly 
wrong as Aristophanes 's criticism of ^JEs- 
hylus and Euripides did not. Nevertheless, 
Byron is in vital contact with literary tradition 
in many important ways ; and in respect to his 
satiric vein particularly he merits special study. 

Such study has been accorded him by Dr. 
Claude M. Fuess, whose work, entitled " Lord 
Byron as a Satirist in Verse," is an outgrowth 
of certain investigations pursued at Columbia 
University in the field of English satire, especi- 
ally that of the eighteenth century. His book 
appears in the series of " Columbia Studies in 
English and Comparative Literature." 

In his collection of facts relating to the 
activity of Byron as a satirist Dr. Fuess has 
shown commendable industry ; nothing of great 
importance seems to be omitted. Moreover, 
the material has been arranged in good order ; 
and the style of the monograph, if it betrays no 
unusual distinction, is clear and straightforward, 
and is pleasant to read. Direct references to 
Byron and his works are adequately supplied 
in the footnotes. One could wish that all refer- 
ences to other matters of fact, and to various 
authorities consulted, were given as fully. The 
allusion to Professor Tucker on page 2 is in- 
sufficient; the attribution of " The Simpliciad " 
to Richard Mant, on page 62, needs substan- 
tiation from a recent article on the subject 
if there is a reference to that article elsewhere 



in the monograph, I have missed and cannot 
find it, for the Index is inadequate ; and there 
are other small defects of a like nature. The 
Bibliography " includes only the more import- 
ant sources of information" for the treatise. It 
does not include " La Legende de Don Juan " 
by Georges Gendarme de Bevotte, which ought 
to have been consulted. Chapter XI. of that 
work is indispensable to every student of Byron, 
and bears directly upon the subject of investi- 
gation selected by Dr. Fuess. Nor does the 
list include the " Studien iiber Byron und 
Wordsworth " of F. H. Pughe, which contains 
something to the purpose. In the main, how- 
ever, this number of the Columbia Studies may 
be characterized as honest, painstaking, and 
substantial. 

When we come to the more philosophical 
aspects of the subject, Dr. Fuess leaves some- 
thing to be desired. They who wish to under- 
stand Byron as a satirist must possess a first-rate 
acquaintance with Latin satire, above all with 
that of Juvenal, if not with Greek satire and 
Lucian ; and they who, in particular, would like 
to set a value on the satiric literary criticism of 
Lord Byron, or any other modern poet, had best 
begin by studying Aristophanes, especially in 
the " Frogs." In the work of Dr. Fuess there 
is no indication that he has properly considered 
Byron with reference to a classical background. 
Two or three allusions to the Roman poet are 
not enough to put the modern in a due per- 
spective. And there is no mention of Aristo- 
phanes. Now Byron may or may not have 
undergone much influence from the Greek, 
though he personally knew two translators, 
Frere and Mitchell, of "a certain comic poet," 
regarded the version of Mitchell as " excellent," 
and at least on one occasion borrows from the 
"Clouds"; there is some evidence, too, of his 
interest in Lucian. If we divided all the 
English poets according to their tendencies and 
likings into Greeks and Romans (and it is no 
bad division for the comparative study of liter- 
ature), Byron, of course, would be labelled a 
Roman. But whatever his bias, and whether 
he has read Greek or Latin, or both, or neither, 
in the observation and comparison of literary 
types we are bound to examine him primarily 
with reference to ultimate rather than proximate 
standards. Dr. Fuess has carefully followed 
out the indebtedness of Byron to the mock- 
heroic verse of Pulci and the rest of the Italians 
a task well worth doing in detail, although 
the French work on Don Juan, noted above, 
sketches the topic in a masterly fashion. Yet 



50 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



this is not enough. We must have a standard 
for Berni and Pulci, too. And, not to trench 
upon the disputed question of the Greek or 
Latin origin of satire, we must draw our stand- 
ard in the main from classical writers, and, of 
these, in the main from Juvenal not because 
he was " conventional," or had followers who 
were uninspired, but because he marked out 
certain lines which satire must take, so long as 
human nature remains the same. 

In Roman satire, these lines are unmistak- 
able, hence we find in Juvenal the topics, 
treated with some regard to unity and coherence, 
to which Byron continually returns since it 
is his misfortune never to have done with a given 
phrase or subject. But more than this, we find 
in Roman satire that the nature of the type is 
not alone what Dr. Fuess seems to think it. 
The essence of satire is not alone to be destruc- 
tive. The proper effect of it is also partly in- 
dicated by the familiar Latin term, satura lanx, 
suggesting the full platter of various comes- 
tibles, including things tart, and savory, and 
even sweet and not all bitter. Such are the 
sights and sounds of a monstrous city, though 
we must confess there is little that is savory in 
Juvenal's description of Rome. Yet one may 
compare Byron's representation of London in 
Canto 11 of " Don Juan " with the third satire 
of Juvenal, or indeed with one or other of the 
modern imitations of that famous dish John- 
son's " London," for example, or perhaps Book 
Seventh of Wordsworth's " Prelude." If Canto 
11 of "Don Juan" shows Byron at or, near his 
best as a satirist (and Dr. Fuess thinks well of 
this and the following cantos), it must be con- 
fessed that he is far behind both Johnson and 
Wordsworth not only in power of construction 
but also in wealth and choice of detail. 

Turning to one or two minor points, we may 
say, first of all, that Dr. Fuess clearly under- 
rates the mock-heroic "King Arthur and his 
Round Table " of Hookham Frere as Byron 
did not underrate it. In point of time, we must 
remember, it lies between the brilliant work of 
Frere for " The Anti- Jacobin " and his even 
more brilliant translation of Aristophanes. Nor 
does there seem to be any good reason for going 
behind Byron's own opinion that his reading of 
" the ingenious Whistlecraft " (i. e., Frere) led 
him to write in the vein of Berni and Pulci. 
In fact, to the present writer it would seem that 
the supple spirit of Frere has better adapted 
itself to the mock-heroic ottava rima of the 
Italians than either Merivale or Byron. Even 
so, if one had not read Whistlecraft, one might 



credit the following stanza to Byron himself, 
except that the style is more correct than is 
usual with him. Incidentally it helps to illus- 
trate the theory of satire : 

" We must take care in our poetic cruise, 
And never hold a single tack too long; 

Therefore my versatile ingenious Muse 

Takes leave of this illiterate, low-bred throng, 

Intending to present superior views, 
Which to genteeler company belong, 

And show the higher orders of society 

Behaving with politeness and propriety." 

Compare also the delicate irony at the beginning 
of Canto 3 : 

" I' ve a proposal here from Mr. Murray " 

which has quite the tone of Byron's communi- 
cations to the same publisher. 

Again, Dr. Fuess is unable to see why Byron 
continued to attach so much importance to his 
"Hints from Horace"; but to me, at all events, 
this adaptation constitutes one of the permanent 
gifts of Byron to English literature. 

Finally, I cannot help believing that Dr. 
Fuess on the whole has rated Byron's satire too 
highly, partly because of a conventional attitude 
to the poet which has arisen on the Continent. 
There, Byron has been overpraised, simply be- 
cause very good critics who speak and think in 
another language cannot have a sure feeling for 
the niceties of English, and are unaffected by 
such a manner as would disgust them in their 
own tongue. As for his substance, or what 
underlies it, his standards of judgment, Byron, 
after all, as Dr. Fuess remarks, is negative. He 
whips hypocrisy and vice, but does not by impli- 
cation magnify virtue. His saeva indignatio 
is not, like that of Juvenal, supported by a basic 
love of rectitude and decency. One could not 
say of Juvenal what Praed makes Byron say of 
himself properly enough in the very stanza 
which Byron took from Whistlecraft and the 
Italians : 

"But I have moved too long in cold society, 
Where it's the fashion not to care a rush; 

Where girls are always thinking of propriety, 
And men are laughed at if they chance to blush; 

And thus I 've caught the sickness of sobriety, 
Forbidden sighs to sound, and tears to gush; 

Become a great philosopher, and curled 

Around my heart the poisons of the world. 

" And I have learnt at last the hideous trick 
Of laughing at whate'er is great or holy ; 

At horrid tales that turn a soldier sick, 
At griefs that make a Cynic melancholy; 

At Mr. Lawless, and at Mr. Brie, 
At Mr. Milman, and at Mr. Croly; 

At Talma and at Young, Macbeth and China 

Even at you, adorable Corinna !

THE LIVING MACHINE.* 

Everyone who undertakes to philosophize, 
even mildly, about biological matters is pres- 
ently compelled to make up his mind about a 
very puzzling question. Of course, nobody 
settles the question by making up his mind. 
But everyone can, and in fact does, settle what 
shall be his attitude or point of view respecting 
this fundamental question of the form of the 
vital equation. There are three, and essentially 
only three, possible decisions. Either 

Life = Inorganic matter + physico-chemical 
energy and forces + nothing more what- 
soever, 

which is the mechanistic conception of life ; or 
Life = Inorganic matter 4- physico-chemical 
energy and forces 4- a special vital element 
different in kind, and in toto, from every- 
thing not living, 

which is the vitalist's rendering of the equation 
of life ; or, finally, 

Life = Inorganic matter -f- physico-chemical 
energy and forces +f (cc), where x denotes 
the great unknown beyond the bound- 
aries of the meagre store of knowledge of 
life which biological science has so far 
accumulated, 

which is the position of the rational agnostic, 
who simply believes that the present state of 
knowledge does not warrant him in definitely 
asserting that x is what either his vitalistic or 
his mechanistic friends say it is. 

The distinguished biologist Jacques Loeb is 
one of the most ardent and uncompromising 
of living advocates of the first rendering of the 
equation. As such, he was invited to address 
the First International Congress of Monists held 
in Hamburg in September, 1911. His paper, 
" The Mechanistic Conception of Life," gives 
the title to a book which brings together ten 
papers and addresses originally published at 
various times during the last twenty years. The

Essays. By Jacques Loeb, M.D., Ph.D., Sc.D. University 
of Chicago Press. 



general purpose is to furnish a popular presen- 
tation of some of the chief results of the author's 
investigations. The essays touch more or less 
closely upon all the great fields of biology. The 
Monist Congress address serves as a general 
introduction and survey of the problems. The 
next three papers deal with the functioning of 
the nervous system and psychology. Then fol- 
lows a lecture on experimental morphology, first 
printed in 1893, in which experiments are de- 
scribed to show that the laws of form production 
and organization are derived "from the common 
source of all life phenomena, i.e., the chemical 
activity of the cell." The next three essays 
deal with different aspects of what are perhaps 
Professor Loeb's most brilliant investigations, 
those on artificial parthenogenesis, which is an 
intensified way of speaking about the causation 
of the development of offspring without pater- 
nal participation. The ninth essay belongs 
essentially in the same group as the preceding 
three, though it deals specifically with "Role 
of Salts in the Preservation of Life." The con- 
cluding address, on the " Influence of the Envi- 
vironment on Animals," was delivered at the 
Darwin Celebration in Cambridge. It is in- 
cluded, no doubt, to show us how the mechanist 
looks at the broad problems of evolution. 

While this book thus ranges well over the 
whole field of biology in its subject matter, it 
attains a degree of unity not to be found in 
many works of much more limited scope. This 
comes from the insistent maintenance of the 
same viewpoint, regardless of what may be the 
problem attacked, or what may have been the 
conventional way of looking at it before. Pro- 
fessor Loeb states at the beginning of the first 
paper that its object is "to discuss the question 
whether our present knowledge gives us any 
hope that ultimately life, i. e., the sum of all 
life phenomena, can be unequivocally explained 
in physico-chemical terms." It might with 
equal fairness be said to have been the object 
of the author's working life to answer this same 
question. Every experiment has been planned 
to bear on this problem. 

With such a whole-souled devotion to a basic 
leading idea it could but be expected that results 
would follow. Such, in fact, has been the case 
to a remarkable degree. However much one 
may disagree with Professor Loeb as to the gen- 
eral and fundamental conclusions to be drawn 
from his experimental results, and some biolo- 
gists do disagree, no one can deny that his work 
has had a profound influence on the progress of 
biological science during the past twenty-five

years. It has opened up new fields of research, 
and has given new angles of approach to old 
problems. His first work on the reactions of 
organisms to stimuli may fairly be said to have 
given the start to the modern development of the 
analytical study of animal behavior and com- 
parative psychology. His theory of tropisms, to 
which one chapter of the present book is devoted, 
has been a Streitfrage,\n the battling over which 
a host of new facts about how animals actually 
do respond to forces has been brought to light. 
The researches on the causation of the develop- 
ment of the egg through chemical and physical 
means have given an altogether new conception 
of the fundamental nature of the process of 
fertilization. The investigations regarding the 
influence of the chemical elements singly and in 
various combinations on the vital processes of 
living tissue have had far-reaching consequences 
for scientific medicine and experimental physi- 
ology, not only on account of the novelty and 
value of the results obtained, but also because 
they have furnished a new way of attacking 
problems. The salient results of all this research 
when looked at as a whole, as is possible in such 
a book as the present one, certainly make an 
imposing record of achievement. 

As has been intimated above, there are per- 
haps fewer who will follow to the end Loeb, the 
philosopher, than will gladly go with Loeb, the 
biologist, and indeed wish for the indefinite ex- 
tension of so profitable a journey. The difficulty 
is that to many minds the step from the utmost 
that is now known of the physics and chemistry 
of living material to the somewhat bitter end of 
the mechanistic philosophy, which avers that 
"we ourselves are only chemical mechanisms," 
is too wide to be gracefully accomplished. The 
contentions of the mechanist may be entirely 
true, but to some it seems wiser to wait a bit, 
without in the least prejudging the case to the 
detriment of either the mechanist or the vitalist. 

EAYMOND PEARL. 



To THE rapidly growing literature on eugenics Mrs. 
La Reine Helen Baker contributes a small volume with 
the title, "Race Improvement or Eugenics: A Little 
Book on a Great Subject " (Dodd, Mead & Co.). In eight 
short chapters dealing with such topics as " Heredity 
and Environment," "Marriage," "The Possibilities of 
Race Improvement," etc., she gives a distinctly readable 
introduction to 'the subject, and makes a forceful plea 
for the wider extension of eugenic ideals. The object 
of the book is frankly to win converts. Its appeal, in 
consequence, is quite as much to the emotions as to the 
intellect. Two appendices deal respectively with " Ma- 
ternity Maintenance " and " Sterilization of the Unfit." 



THE PLAYS OF STRINDBERG.* 



To understand and appreciate to the full 
Johan August Strindberg, one should be a late- 
nineteenth century Swede, an habitue of Paris- 
ian society, a dabbler in all sciences, something 
of a genius oneself, and more or less divorced. 
Failing in all these qualifications, the present 
writer approaches his task with a humble spirit. 
He might even have been catalogued by Strind- 
berg among the "right-minded," though I trust 
not. One may still love his wife (at least in 
America), and entertain an old-fashioned enthu- 
siasm for marriage without deserving the epithet 
of "right-minded." In the worst event, I have 
the virtue of my defects, that is, I am con- 
scious of them and can be on my guard. 

In the first place, no one can read a play of 
Strindberg's without receiving an intellectual 
jolt. There comes the startling conviction that 
here is the transcript of a great mind. One may 
or may not agree that what one reads is great 
drama or great literature ; but there is no doubt 
that the big, restless, cutting, probing spirit of 
the man who wrote it is a stupendous human 
spectacle. It is common for critics to see in 
Strindberg a type the restless, honest pessim- 
ism of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, 
an epoch recognized by most contemporaneous 
philosophers as a "transitional era." This is 
true in a very real sense ; and still I find Strind- 
berg, of all recent writers, sui generis. Nowhere 
else have I come upon such utter desolate pes- 
simism ; but it is an earnest pessimism : there is 
nothing of the fermentation of the cynic in it. 
On every page is the nervous anxiety to find 
happiness, joined to the rational despair of find- 
ing it. The writer does not seem like a man 
who has turned bitter because his own life disap- 
pointed him (though no doubt that was tragic) ; 
his pessimism is biological, and so complete. 
He feels that life has missed fire, that the 
Almighty, or whatever corresponds, made in the

beginning a miscalculation from which we shall 
all suffer to the end of time, guilty and innocent 
alike. It is the Slough of Despond into which 
his early materialism dumped him, and from 
which his later Swedenborgian mysticism was 
powerless to extricate him, apparently driving 
his feet deeper into the slime. He reached the 
rock-bottom of despair, the antipodes of faith. 

It should not be inferred from what has been 
said that there is no pleasure in the reading of 
these plays. "The pleasure, I assure you, is 
negligible," as Mr. Queed said to Sharlie when 
her big mastiff was rolling him around in the 
street ; but nevertheless it is real. The student 
of life must ever find the entertainment satis- 
factory when a big man like Strindberg gives 
the world what "is coming to it," and more. 
Even though the beating may seem undeserved, 
it is impossible to withhold admiration for the 
honesty and courage behind the blows. Karl 
XV. admired the viking spirit of "The Outlaw," 
and no one can miss the same god- defy ing inde- 
pendence and solemn man-reliance throughout 
all the work of this mighty modern Swede. For 
all that, he is intensely vulnerable at one point, 
which shall be touched later. 

"The Stronger," an episode in one scene, 
seems to me the strongest dramatically of the 
plays here considered. The target is neither 
high nor low nor far, but the scene hits the 
bull's-eye. It is a small thing, and the form is 
a dramatic miniature ; but its perfection makes 
it notable for all that. Its simplicity is unique : 
a waitress brings a cup of chocolate, Mrs. X 
speaks and Miss Y remains silent. That is all ; 
and anything more would be too much. 

" The Outlaw " is a scene from the early con- 
flict between Paganism and Christianity in the 
North. It shows promise of the author's later 
and better historical work in its considerable 
dramatic intensity. But all the figures, with 
the exception of the outlaw, are "lay" fully as 
wooden as the figure-head on the viking's ship. 
The daughter's independence toward her lover, 
an important bit of the complication, is belied 
by her frightened subservience to her father; 
and all the action at the last becomes muddy and 
unconvincing. Moreover, it is difficult to dis- 
cover any meaning to the whole, for the attitude 
of the young writer shifts with the wind, now 
directing a satire against Christianity, and now 
subscribing conventionally to its faith. But the 
sketch of the Outlaw is good, and very likely one 
should ask nothing more of this kind of play. 

" The Father " and " Miss Julia " are the most 
important of the works under discussion; in 



fact they are usually regarded as Strindberg's 
greatest plays. The extravagant encomiums 
bestowed upon the former will prove somewhat 
of a bewilderment to many readers in America, 
especially those of the "Philistine" "right- 
minded" type. The play is saturated with the 
darkest misogamy. The theme, that no father 
is sure of his own fatherhood, is the final cause 
of the Captain's madness. The wife, who shows 
traces (but only traces) of a type, is a creature 
who appears to believe genuinely that she is jus- 
tified in her persecutions and harassments. Mr. 
Edwin Bjbrkman, the translator, in one of his 
admirable introductions, says that Strindberg 
placed woman midway biologically between the 
man and the child. In this I do not seriously 
question his science. But Laura, who unques- 
tionably represents Woman Fighting for her 
Offspring, is not midway bet wen the man and 
the child ; she is somewhere between the ape 
and the tiger. The whole thing lacks edifica- 
tion, and fails to convince that there was ever 
such a silly strong man as the Captain, or such 
a good devilish wife as Laura ; and it is at least 
an open question whether the play possesses 
enough general truth to give it literary value. 

"Creditors," belonging to the same middle 
"Naturalistic" period of Strindberg's work, 
presents the like wholesale strictures on woman. 
Tekla is a chameleon, taking character from the 
lapel of the coat of him on whose breast she 
happens to be leaning. Even Mr. Bjorkman 
doubts if there ever was a Tekla in real life. 
There is a word of wisdom in this play which 
Strindberg must have written under a spell, for 
throughout his work elsewhere he appears un- 
conscious of it: 

" Tekla. What you mean with all this, of course, is 
that you have written my books. 

" Adolph. No, that's what you want me to mean in 
order to make me out a liar. I do n't use such crude 
expressions as you do, and I spoke for something like 
five minutes to get in all the nuances, all the halftones, 
all the transitions but your hand-organ has only a 
single note in it. 

" Tekla. Yes, but the summary of the whole story 
is that you have written my books. 

" A dolph. No, there is no summary. You cannot 
reduce a chord into a single note. You cannot trans- 
late a varied life into a sum of one figure. I have made 
no blunt statements like that of having written your 
books." 

One cannot escape the feeling that Strindberg's 
powerful instrument reduces the chord of Tekla 
and Laura to a single note. 

" Miss Julia," as far as construction goes, 
deserves all the praise it has been accorded. Its 
unity and mass are admirable in their art,

[Jan. 16, 



even if, like all art, they are a bit unnatural. 
The long and famous introduction by Strind- 
berg is extremely interesting, and pregnant with 
practical suggestions in stage-craft. The trans- 
lator, too, deserves the grateful homage of an 
English-reading public for an extraordinarily 
brilliant translation. I judge little or nothing 
is lost in bringing the work to us from the 
Swedish. Take it all in all, " Miss Julia " 
represents Strindberg's peculiar genius in one 
of his most successful climaxes, so it is signifi- 
cant. Still, even " Miss Julia " does not quite 
bear out the promise of the elaborate introduc- 
tion and the play's immense reputation. Strind- 
berg admits, or announces rather, that he has 
made Julia an " exception to prove a rule " 
a sort of thing, by the way, that seems difficult 
to square with pedestrian logic. She decidedly 
impresses us as an exception, and there are so 
many contributing causes suggested for her 
lapse and consequent tragedy that we are be- 
wildered and chagrined. Her mother's shady 
past, her father's foolish ideas of education, her 
own complex nature, her insulation against de- 
cent marriageable men, the license of the Mid- 
summer's Night dance, her father's absence, 
Jean's superficial gentlemanliness, all these 
things, we are asked to believe, combined and 
brought it about that Julia most brazenly threw 
herself into the arms of an unimaginative boor, 
and was afterward shaken by alternating cur- 
rents of remorse, passion, ecstasy, and hatred, 
ending in the deepest self-loathing and, presum- 
ably, suicide. We agree that it may be true, but 
what of it ? It merely goes to show that nature 
and chance and the author can form a combin- 
ation too much for a human girl. Miss Julia is 
honorable, nay more, noble. It is because of 
her nobility that her tragedy is a real one. 
Nevertheless, it is difficult to sympathize with 
those who find this play " too sad." Julia is 
too great an exception to feel sad over. It is 
very good realism, but it is not reality. 

This brings us to the touch-stone. Is there 
nothing but sex, sex, sex to write about ? Why 
do all roads in modern fiction and drama lead 
into lovers' lanes? It would seem that we are 
more primitive than our ancestors, who could 
find pleasure in tales of friendship and heroism, 
sometimes omitting, as in Beowulf (a Swedish 
hero, by the way) the lady in the case. Our 
age has been sex-mad, and Strindberg is a 
symptom. 

There is still an other, and more vital, criticism, 
the vulnerable point I have above alluded to. 
Strindberg is big, but not big enough. He is 



courageous, but singularly fearful about the pain 
in the world. Without aiming at being philoso- 
phical, I should call him an extreme Hedonist. 
Pleasure to him is a serious End and a Good 
in Itself. He never learned the lesson Carlyle 
beat into the head of the nineteenth century, 
that Duty, and not Pleasure, is the chief end of 
In his later semi-mystical plays partic- 



man. 



ularly, such as " There Are Crimes and Crimes " 
and "The Dream Play," the hedonistic philos- 
ophy is responsible for the pessimism. The 
tragedy of " The Dream Play " is the endless re- 
currence of duties. Personally, I shall reserve 
my pity for the man or woman who does not have 
this endless round of duties. God have mercy 
on the victims of the drug, dilettantism. The 
philosophy which cannot understand pain and 
suffering and duty in the world, but merely 
inveighs against them, is not big enough. 

One play from his third, or "Symbolistic," 
period stands almost alone. This is "Easter." 
There is a sweeter, saner, more life-giving spirit 
about it. I should like to believe that it repre- 
sents without irony the older and riper Strind- 
berg; but it seems to have been nothing more 
than an eddy, a moment of spiritual rest in his 
tumultuous life-and- thought stream. In this 
Swedish "Vicar of Wakefield," where every- 
thing comes out right in the end, Strindberg 
says to the little child, the world: "Here's a 
quarter for you. Run along and buy some 
sweets with it. I know they will make you 
sick, but I don't care this time." 

Somewhat similar in tone, though belonging 
among Strindberg's early work, is " Lucky 
Pehr." It is an allegory that brings up many 
associations, chief among them being Ibsen's 
" Peer Gynt," Maeterlinck's " The Blue Bird," 
and Balzac's " The Wild Ass's Skin." " Lucky 
Pehr " is not unpleasant reading, but it con tans 
no large or vital truth except perhaps the in- 
cidental one that happiness comes from striving 
rather than wishing. 

This sentence from Nietzsche appears at the 
head of a biographical note in the volume trans- 
lated by Edith and Warner Oland : " I tell 
you, you must have chaos in you if you would 
give birth to a dancing star." This is altogether 
apt for a volume of Strindberg's plays. You 
feel the whirling chaos in him, and he does give 
birth to occasional dancing stars. But the domi- 
nant impression one has on closing the book, 
on capping the telescope after a survey of the 
Strindberg firmament, is that a vast lot of star- 
dust in chaos remains merely nebular.

FORCE AND FINANCE vs. HUMAN 
FRATERNITY.* 



The ten articles contained in Captain Mahan's 
new book, " Armaments and Arbitration," have 
previously appeared in the magazines, and are here 
assembled with immaterial alterations. The position 
of Captain Mahan maybe surmised from his previous 
works. He perceives that arbitration, which origin- 
ally was merely a tool in the hands of diplomatists, 
has gradually developed in scope until by reason of 
" the coercive influence of public emotion, perhaps 
more in love with the name than comprehensive of 
the facts," governments find themselves losing their 
freedom to reject arbitration at discretion. To this 
tendency Captain Mahan raises a series of objections. 

To begin with, he urges that the triumphs ac- 
credited to arbitration are in many cases deceptive, 
as arbitration was not accepted by the disputants 
from "love of right or of essential justice, but from 
a wish to escape the material damage of war." Be- 
cause the states were nearly equal in strength they 
accepted arbitration, which would have been rejected 
had either state possessed superior force. It is fur- 
ther objected that the ideal implied by the expres- 
sion, "law in place of war," is impracticable. The 
law can settle only questions which involve the prin- 
ciples of law, and which are covered by existing 
legislation ; whereas international differences are 
often questions of policy, involving claims which 
have no recognition in law. Law is, therefore, 
inadequate. 

" Law could not have abolished slavery ; could not have 
given the impetus which achieved German unity ; could not 
have dispossessed Turkey of her misgoverned territories, nor 
Spain of hers ; could not have extorted from the Kriiger 
regime fair treatment for the foreigner, nor established equal 
rights in South Africa as it was ; could not have vindicated the 
natural rights of Japan against the encroachments of Russia 
in the Far East. Diplomacy using force accomplished in these 
instances results to which law was unequal. . . . The great 
objection to law, however, is not merely that it is inadequate, 
but that in most of the above cases it would have been in- 
equitable would have perpetuated injustice by sanctioning 
outworn conditions or inapplicable principles." 

Force or the threat of force, which is the same 
thing, can, in Admiral Mahan's opinion, alone 
settle questions like these. 

It is also objected that the schemes to enlarge the 
scope of arbitration especially those which would 
make arbitration compulsory at the demand of one 
of the parties, besides depriving governments of 
their former freedom, tend to undermine the prin- 
ciple of independent nationality, to modify the

sovereignty of the state upon which all present in- 
ternational relations rest. Nations as nations have 
materially aided progress ; the principle of nation- 
ality " has for the past four hundred years been the 
dominant factor in the development of Europe." 
Therefore, it should be preserved at all odds against 
the encroachments of arbitration, on the one hand, 
and of socialism and kindred schemes, on the other, 
which would break down international boundaries 
and substitute internal and class struggle. This 
latter, for some reason, Captain Mahan thinks would 
be a relapse to conditions of the middle ages a 
period, by the way, in which force, though not always 
national, was paramount. 

National boundary lines must not be disrupted 
because Europe will need all the strength she can 
muster in the coming struggle with Asiatic civiliza- 
tion. " This not only impends, but has begun, and 
in it the strength of Europe is the principle of nation- 
ality, developed as it is now." Now, if this " prin- 
ciple of nationality" is so sacred and so necessary, 
why do European nations themselves respect it so 
little ? They, as much as the proponents of arbi- 
tration, have drawn national integrity into question : 
they have violated the sovereignty of Turkey, Persia, 
and China. And by so doing they have set Asia an 
example which they may have occasion to regret. 
It may presently appear that the promotion of arbi- 
tration is a less objectionable way of infringing upon 
national sovereignty than the armed intervention of 
a strong state in the affairs of another without other 
sanction than that of force. 

To Captain Mahan the very circumstance that a 
nation cannot avert invasion is in the last analysis 
the justification of the invasion. "Armament is 
the ultimate exponent of national independence and 
power." It is a fault to be weak, and the penalty 
for weakness is oppression. This militarist is not 
one of those who would advocate peace even if he 
believed peace to be practicable ; he believes in force. 
"The existing political status of the planet rests, 
and in my judgment rests beneficially, upon force." 
With these views upon the finality of force, the 
reader must wonder why Captain Mahan takes such 
great pains to justify the action of the United States 
in Panama both legally and 'morally, as he does in 
his last chapter, entitled " Panama : A National Dis- 
honor?" Why talk of law and morals if force is the 
ultimate test? The only dishonor possible for the 
United States would have consisted in lacking force, 
or in failing to use it effectively. 

In general the views of Captain Mahan seem to 
rest on local and one-sided considerations. He rea- 
sons from the basis of a single nation, whereas the 
world contains many nations; and he assumes that 
nation to be victorious in its enterprises, whereas if 
there is a victor there must also be a vanquished, 
a plain fact which is here simply ignored. In short, 
this military philosophy cannot be final or universal, 
for it leaves one half of the problem, and the more 
damaging half, out of account. A nation must 
possess force in order to repel some possible foe;

[Jan. 16, 



but where lies the advantage of force if that foe, 
acting on the same philosophy, also acquires force? 
Clearly what we need is not force, but more force ; 
and our possible foe, still actuated by the same 
views, also acquires more force! Now who is the 
visionary, the peace advocate who avers that this 
increase of force cannot continue indefinitely, or the 
militarist who insatiably calls for greater force, but 
has never explained how it is possible to increase 
armaments perpetually without drifting into finan- 
cial difficulties which will make war the very evil 
armaments are said to be preventing the lesser of 
two evils? 

The financial difficulties of militarism are so ob- 
vious and already so real that every rational man 
must wonder why we have been blind to them so 
long. This phase of the matter is treated by Dr. 
David Starr Jordan in his little book, "The Unseen 
Empire," which undertakes "to tell in part the 
story of the bondage of the nations due to the cost 
of war and of war preparations." It aims to show 
"that civilized nations are one and all in their 
degree under the dominion of a power stronger 
than Kings or Parliaments, more lasting than 
Armies and Navies, that is, the Unseen Empire 
of Finance." 

War and armaments cost vast sums of money, 
which must be raised by governments in some way. 
Taxes and tariffs have long since proved insufficient, 
and governments are led by military rivalry to make 
loans. These loans may properly be called "war 
debts," because had it not been for war and war 
preparations the natural income of the nations would 
have easily paid off all indebtedness, including that 
borrowed for industrial and commercial expansion. 
The objection of President Jordan to these war debts 
is not primarily that they are unethical in placing a 
burden on coming generations, or that they are part 
and parcel of a system of living beyond national 
means. He is not opposed to deferred payments, as 
such; there are proper loans which do place a bur- 
den on a coming generation. The test of a proper 
loan is the purpose for which it is made, whether 
for banking or for " pawnbroking." 

" Banking, properly speaking, deals with ' going concerns.' 
It is a provision by which free or idle money may be gath- 
ered together and converted into active capital. Through the 
banker, money on deposit is placed in the hands of those who 
by industrial or commercial enterprise can make it grow. 

" ' Pawnbroking,' broadly speaking, deals with failure or 
waste. Its usual function is to afford means for some act of 
extravagance, or escape from some complication of past folly 
or misfortune. The extravagance, folly, and misfortune 
among nations is summed up in war. Pawnbroking among 
nations thus concerns itself mainly with past war or future 
preparation, in either case withdrawing the revenues con- 
cerned from all productive use.'' 

In this respect Dr. Jordan is at complete variance 
with Captain Mahan, who writes: "It is also per- 
haps worth noting that the immense debt of Great 
Britain was contracted in establishing, by military 
means, the territorial, commercial, and industrial 
conditions which underlay her long continued su- 



premacy; that debt was in the nature of an invest- 
ment, not barren of returns." To this Dr. Jordan 
would, among other things, reply that the returns 
came to the wealthy classes and not to the average 
Englishman, who was little the better for the debt. 
It may also be inquired whether England's debt 
would have been a good investment had she been 
defeated? And what kind of an investment was the 
debt contracted by England's vanquished foes? 

Still, wastefulness is not the greatest harm com- 
ing from public debts. That harm is the dominance 
which debts give to the nation's creditors, who are 
the kings of finance. These, to be sure, do not hold 
all or even a majority of a nation's bonds ; but they 
do control the financial institutions and the media 
sometimes even the officials through which govern- 
ments must float bonds if they place them at all; 
and, therefore, they control a state's credit. 

" The control of a railway system does not necessitate 
ownership, but simply the control of its debt and its needs 
at critical moments. Just so with nations. It is the need 
for more borrowings that makes the old loans dominant. In 
proportion to the bulk of their debts and the acute character 
of their need for money are they subject to dictation. The 
ordinary creditors or bondholders have little to say. It is 
the necessity for further loans which places control in the 
hands of the financier. This may be exercised quietly as 
befits the business of the banker, but it is none the less 
potent and real." 

The "Empire" which dominates governments is not 
a well defined organization; it is rather a loosely 
coordinated system, the parts of which, by virtue of 
a far-reaching family relationship, as in the case of 
the Rothschilds, and by virtue of a common aim, 
cooperate for their mutual gain. It is privilege, and 
privilege everywhere affiliates with privilege. It does 
not stop at controling a nation's credit: it largely 
dictates a nation's policy for good or ill ; it is inter- 
ested wherever large capital is required, and hence 
in armament manufactories and syndicates. How 
detrimental this may be to a people is patent. 

" It is a fact, more or less well known, that the arguments 
that ' expansion of armaments is necessary to insure peace/ 
that ' big armies and navies are the insurance premiums of 
peace,' and that ' to insure peace a nation must always be 
prepared for war,' rest heavily on the desires of the arma- 
ment syndicates to keep up their business. The armament 
lobby of Europe is the most powerfully organized instrument 
of its kind in the world. Its operations are consciously and 
carefully planned. 

" The chief weapon of the Armament Syndicate, because 
the most effective one for persuading a nation to go more 
and more deeply into debt, is the ' war scare.' Always the 
one nation is pitted against the other. Always there is 
imminent danger from our neighbors." 

The criticism may be leveled at Dr. Jordan's little 
book that it makes assertions which it does not prove, 
and the criticism seems to be just. However, this 
does not prove that the author's contentions are un- 
true. Ludwig Pfeiffer has just come forward with 
a three- volume work entitled " Kriegsgeist " which 
attempts to prove the existence of the "Unseen 
Empire." Whether proved or not, there is still evi- 
dence that such an empire exists, and every attempt 
to expose it is commendable.

The attack upon war in literary form, first made 
popular by Baroness von Siittner in " Die Waffen 
nieder!" is revived in "The Pride of War," trans- 
lated from Gustav Janson's Swedish story, "Log- 
norna." By abandoning the form of a personal 
narrative employed in the earlier work, the argu- 
ment becomes natural at all points, and is free from 
the outbursts of sentiment which fill the pages of 
" Ground Arms ! " Indeed, as literature, " The Pride 
of War " is much the superior of the two ; the chap- 
ter "Hamza and Hanifa" is idyllic in its perfection, 
and is the one part of the book in which the trans- 
lation is so excellent as to pass unnoticed. And yet 
the work is not fiction in the conventional sense: 
there is no dominant character, and the love theme 
is absent. It is a series of connected studies in story 
form of the way the Turko-Itaiian war is imagined 
to have affected typical individuals engaged in it. 
That the author had some personal and intimate 
knowledge of the opponents in this struggle is mani- 
fest ; and his project of showing how the strife affects 
the individual man touches the very core of the op- 
position to war. The bravery and patriotism, the 
noble action and splendid unanimity, which form 
the staple of most writers about war, fade when the 
individual soldier, as Janson pictures him, comes to 
be considered. 

The characters upon whom are hung the argument 
are not caricatures, but real personalities. Captain 
Vitale, who as much as anyone is the central figure 
of the book, personifies war. He unthinkingly ac- 
cepts the traditional views respecting national rivalry 
and war as the means of progress. Implicit obedience 
to military discipline is his ideal, and the soldier 
who renders it fares well at his hands. All individ- 
ual initiative must, however, be surrendered. Hence 
he acts as a blight upon all who come under his 
sway. The Anarchist, Alfonso Zirilli, who repre- 
sents the reflective peasant, loses his individuality 
and becomes a cog in a machine. Hamza, the non- 
combatant, who asked no more of the world than to 
be allowed to dwell in peace under his desert palms, 
is caught in the maelstrom, and, though innocent 
and ignorant of the why of it all, is heartlessly 
killed. The Turkish officer, Assan Bey, discovers 
in the lawlessness of war a chance for exploitation 
and self-enrichment which peace had not afforded. 
The Bedouin, Djafar, finds the troublous times well 
adapted to political treachery and the acquisition of 
power over his fellows. Rivarato, the dashing young 
Italian lieutenant, who had gone to the front with 
high hopes of the future that lay before him, emerges 
a physical wreck a bit of the waste of war, used 
up in his prime and destined to be a burden instead 
of a prop to society for the remainder of his days. 
The Italian scholar, Pietro Fontanara, is the strong- 
est character in the book. He had lived among the 
Moslems, engaged in studies which promised great 
benefit to men. His breadth of experience, his knowl- 
edge of the Turk, had given him something of what 
has been called the international mind. To him war 
against men whom he had come to regard as equals 



and brothers was hateful ; but the sense of duty to 
his country impels him to abandon his work and to 
enlist. The acclamation of the press at his act makes 
him wonder, "If there was really something worth 
recording in the fact that a strong man, healthy in 
mind and body, hurried to the aid of his country, 
then it was proof that war was an out-of-date ideal." 
This is only the beginning. Every day has its 
experiences, every experience its revelation, until 
finally he sees the sordidness and falsehood of it all ; 
and he becomes the chief spokesman of the book 
against war. The chapter entitled " Lies," in which 
he speaks, is an indictment of warfare which the 
militarist, who distinguishes truth from policy, will 
have difficulty in answering. 

European civilization must rest on force, says the 
militarist, if it would successfully resist Asia in the 
conflict which has already begun. Eesisting is not 
the same as attacking, and Janson thinks the 
European has been the aggressor and has left the 
Asiatic no alternative but retaliation in kind. Using 
Dajfar as his mouthpiece he says : 

" Civilization ... I scarcely know what to answer you. 

" I ask for thoughts, and you give me a name, Civiliza- 
tion, as if I, too, had not turned the word over and over 
with my tongue. It has a vile taste and I spit it out again. 
Civilization is your answer. When the Italian ironclads 
cast anchor outside the roadstead off Tripoli, civilization 
ordered that the Turkish garrison should leave the town 
without striking a blow. But it in no way prevented the 
Italians from shooting its houses in pieces with their can- 
nons, or from slaying the people to whom the houses be- 
longed, if any were still there. I have a feeling of nausea 
every time I hear the word ' civilization.' What I know of 
it is, that it bestows excellent weapons on the Unbelievers, 
together with the power of making the most reckless use of 
them, whenever there is anything to be gained. . . . 

" For all their disunion the Europeans are not afraid of 
acting all the world over in the same fashion. Civilization 
has never stood in the way of their slaying and plundering. 
It is in every respect a boon for them, but in most cases an 
evil for others. The good it bestows namely, the quick- 
firing guns and far-reaching rifles we can turn to our own 
use. Whether we like it or not, we must take that course. 
The nations of Europe cannot ask us to treat them otherwise 
than they are treating us. . . . Do you now see what I am 
driving at ? Very well, then ! The sons of the Prophet 
outnumber the Europeans. . . . Get us weapons and also 
men to teach us how to use them that is your job. . . . 
There is really a God Turk. And righteousness is no empty 
word, as is the civilization of the Europeans." 

Dr. Butler's new book, " The International Mind," 
consists of the addresses delivered by the author as 
Chairman of the Lake Mohonk Conferences on Inter- 
national Arbitration. As such they are naturally 
general in character, and are good summaries of 
progress rather than original contributions. Pres- 
ident Butler believes that for the present the ques- 
tion of disarmament should be wholly avoided. He 
prefers to work for a restriction of the further growth 
of great armies and navies without impairing the 
efficiency of those that exist. Though this appears 
to be conceding a vital point to the militarist, it is 
for the present only. In the meantime, law and a 
sense of justice must be developed. High confidence 
is placed in these.

THE DIAJL 



[elan. 16, 



" Even if we speak in the most approved language of 
militarism itself, it is apparent that a fleet a mile wide will 
not long protect England from attack or invasion, or from 
starvation, if the attacking or invading party is in command 
of the full resources of modern science and modern industry. 
But if justice be substituted for force, England will always 
be safe.'' 

" To say that men have always, as a last resort, settled 
their differences and difficulties by force, and that therefore 
they will always continue to do so is simply silly. To say 
that a nation's honor must be defended by the blood of her 
citizens if need be, is quite meaningless, for such a nation, 
although profoundly right in its contention, might be de- 
feated by a superior force exerted on behalf of a wrong and 
unjust view." 

Nations again and again yield to arguments that 
have no compulsion behind them other than public 
opinion; and public opinion is the final and the only 
means by which, in these days of popular sover- 
eignty, any law, national as well as international, is 
made effective. The growth of the power of the 
people is a disturbing factor to militarists, some of 
whom bemoan its tendency to weaken the ideals of 
military discipline and organization. Dr. Butler 
himself is not willing to trust the people altogether. 
"A judiciary made dependent on changes of popular 
temper or on varying, often contradictory, manifesta- 
tions of popular will, would become a mere adminis- 
trative device under the control and direction of the 
executive power of the moment." By taking this 
position he at least escapes the inconsistency of an 
age which seeks to develop an international judiciary 
at the same time that it is destroying popular faith 
in the national courts. Apart from the judiciary, 
Dr. Butler has great faith in the people. "Govern- 
ments, however popular and powerful, have ceased 
to dominate ; everywhere public opinion dominates 
governments." This steady development of popular 
sovereignty is more significant to the historian than 
force. Democracy is the foe of force and the cure 
for war. 

" The history of civilization might be written in terms of 
man's progress from fear to faith. As he has ceased to fear 
his neighbors and as he has come to have trust in them, he 
has been able to build up institutions that have lasted." 

" The international mind is nothing else than that habit 
of thinking of foreign relations and business, and that habit 
of dealing with them, which regard the several nations of 
the civilized world as friendly and cooperating equals in 
aiding the progress of civilization, in developing commerce 
and industry, and in spreading enlightenment and culture 
throughout the world."

IN THE same choice form given to several other of 
Emerson's essays by the Riverside Press, his " Success " 
is now added to the series. Mr. Ferris Greeuslet sup- 
plies a brief introduction, in which he emphasizes the 
peculiar f ele vancy of the essay to the present-day Ameri- 
can "scramble of business, big and little, tri-partite 
politics, conversational culture, science that is applied, 
education that is vocational, and a religion that ' pays 
dividends.' " It is, indeed, infinitely refreshing to turn 
from the blatant cant of the " get on or get out " sort, 
which is now so largely in vogue, to this noble plea for a 
success that has its home in the " tranquil, well-founded, 
wide-seeing soul." 



BKIKFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

The Chinese Among books purporting to give a 
people intimately full and elaborate portrayal of Chi- 
portrayed. nege jjf ^ f ew j laye a pp eare( J i n recent 

years more meritorious than Dr. J. Macgowan's 
"Men and Manners of Modern China" (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). The writer has spent fifty years 
as a missionary in China, and his interpretation of 
the people of that land bears abundant evidence 
of long-continued and acute observation. The 
book is remarkable for the abundance of its pic- 
turesque descriptive detail. The land and its gov- 
ernment, the ancient outworn military system, the 
literary degrees of the now defunct examinations 
for civil service, the classical books, schools, and 
school-masters of the old regime, ancestor worship, 
plays and play actors, punishments, lynch law, 
these and other topics are treated in chapters 
which gradually develop in the mind of the reader 
a lively image of the teeming and strange life of 
the old Empire. The author describes with quite 
unusual vividness such picturesque phases of exist- 
ence in China as river life, farmers and farming, 
doctors and doctoring, beggars, Chinese cities; and 
elucidates the obscure subject of home life and the 
still more hidden mysteries of "face." The book 
shows insight gained through long and intimate 
contact, and sympathy developed by the gradual 
revelation through these years of the best traits of 
Chinese character. The writer has found the ad- 
mirable virtues of the long-lived Chinese race, and 
arouses the respect of the reader for their patience, 
perseverence, fortitude, humor, and everlasting good 
nature. A sense of the teeming millions of the land 
engaged in their unremitting and age-long labor 
with muscles hardened by heavy loads and hearts 
subdued by long familiarity with the struggle for 
bare subsistence, and yet with laughter lying ready 
at the least provocation this feeling of the teeming 
life of China is very well conveyed by Dr. Mac- 
gowan's book. The grotesque, disgusting, and hor- 
rible lines in the portrait are also clearly marked, 
indeed so clearly that one doubts whether this is the 
best drawing of the Chinese for American readers. 
We have had only too much information that ele- 
vates our own race at the expense of the Asiatic 
peoples. To correct warped notions of these unlike 
nations it is safe to dwell even to some excess upon 
their virtues and attractions in portraying them for 
Anglo-Saxon readers. This is not done by Dr. Mac- 
gowan's book. Respecting the Chinese race as he 
does, the author yet constantly compares it with the 
English people to the advantage of the latter. The 
instances in which the scales are shown to tip the 
other way are too few to offset the total impression 
of the strange deficiencies of the Chinese as com- 
pared with the British people. But a cosmopolitan 
view of races cannot set up any one race as a norm 
to which all others must approach, and it is to be 
seriously doubted if comparisons of a foreign peo- 
ple with one's own nationality can ever be wholly

fair. Those books about foreign peoples do the best 
service which seek to explain and excuse, or at 
least condone, their obliquities, and to hold up all 
their virtues for the instruction of the home race, 
though one must, of course, endeavor, first and 
foremost, to tell the truth. Yet deviations from the 
path of charity and deficiencies in cosmopolitan 
breadth are, after all, not of so serious a character 
in "Men and Manners in Modern China" but that 
the book is to be heartily welcomed for its remark- 
able vividness of portraiture of a race destined to 
play a great role in future history. One must regret 
the serious crudities of composition and expression 
that occur rather frequently throughout the book. 

Denmark's ^ n ^ e eleventh century the life of 
greatest Christendom reawakened with a 

hero - great relief. With the passing of 

the year 1000 A. D., it was revealed that after all 
the heavens were not to be rolled up like a scroll nor 
the elements to melt with fervent heat; and men 
began once more to look round upon the kingdoms 
of this earth as desirable property ; the mighty game 
of conquest was once more worth playing. Of the 
figures stalking over the stage at that time, at least 
two men achieved careers which have not been al- 
lowed to sink into forgetfulness William the Nor- 
man and Canute the Dane. They shared the century 
between them, but their lives, so far as strenuous 
activity was concerned, did not lap or even touch. 
Canute, at the age of forty, was laid away at Win- 
chester thirty-one years before the battle of Hastings, 
but after winning an empire, with the triple crown 
of Denmark, England, and Norway. With what- 
ever truth our average readers can say "Saxon and 
Norman and Dane are we," they must confess a 
robust ignorance of the great Viking an ignorance 
usually lightened by only two legends. But Profes- 
sor Laurence M. Larson, of the University of Illinois, 
in the latest volume of the "Heroes of the Nations" 
series (Putnam), has left this ignorance without 
further excuse. With infinite patience and a fine 
historic sense he has assembled all materials deriv- 
able from the chroniclers, annalists, and sagas, and 
has blended them into a consistent and continuous 
narrative. How cautiously he handles his sources 
may be seen by his constant use of such restrictive 
phrases as "presumably," "possibly," "probably," 
"apparently," "appears to have accompanied," 
"almost certainly," etc. This makes his conclusions, 
when confidently asserted, the more trustworthy. He 
has had, of course, the aid of such modern Norse 
scholars as Vigfusson, the two Bugges, Steenstrup, 
and others; but he has used them with a healthy 
and detached judgment which sometimes differs 
with theirs, and helps his own book to the position of 
an original contribution to biographical literature. 
Out of the somewhat confused sources there emerges 
finally the figure of a man, not of the highest hero- 
ism, but a man who was quick to see and to seize 
every opportunity created by his own shrewdness or 
offered by the weakness of others. In the words of 



Professor Larson, " Canute possessed in full measure 
the Scandinavian power of adaptation, the quality 
that made the Northmen such a force in Normandy 
and Naples. He grasped the ideals of mediaeval 
Christianity, he appreciated the value of the new 
order of things, and undertook to introduce it among 
the Northern peoples. But he did not permit the new 
circumstances and ideals to control him ; only so long 
as they served his purpose or did not hinder him in 
the pursuit of that purpose did he bow to them. 
When other means promised to be more effective, 
he chose accordingly." Of the two legends above 
mentioned the story of the King's visit to the 
monks of Ely (" Sweet sang the monks of Ely, when 
Canute rowed thereby"), and the still more familiar 
one of his rebuke to the flattering courtiers before 
the resistless advance of the tide, Professor Larson 
remarks that the former is intrinsically probable. 
The latter is quietly dismissed as "a myth too patent 
to need discussion ; there was nothing of the Oriental 
spirit in the Northern court." We shall have to com- 
fort ourselves with the reflection that such stories 
retain their moral value long after their historic 
props have been knocked away. 

Early religious ? Ir ' Sidne 7 Heath's "Pilgrim Life 
pilgrims and in the Middle Ages " (Houghton) 
pilgrimages. was designed, the author tells us, " to 
serve and entertain the general reader who is inter- 
ested in the religious pilgrimages of olden days." 
If the general reader were himself on pilgrimage, 
and carried a scrip large enough to hold this sub- 
stantial volume, we can well believe that he would 
be served by it, for portions of it would make a use- 
ful guide-book ; but by no part of it would he be 
entertained. It abounds in information concerning 
the ancient pilgrim roads and shrines and customs 
of England ; but this information is so scrappy and 
incoherent, so intermingled with trivialities and 
errors, and expressed in such curious English that a 
sense of impatience rather than of entertainment 
accompanies the reader's progress through its three 
hundred pages. It is difficult, indeed, to treat with 
seriousness a historical work that gravely cites " an 
anonymous writer " as authority for a historical 
statement, and that quotes ' The Daily Mail " as 
one might quote Green or Macaulay. Moreover, for 
a writer dealing with mediaeval pilgrimages, Mr. 
Heath knows singularly little about Chaucer. He 
refers to the poet's career at Oxford and Cambridge, 
apparently unaware that Professor Lounsbury de- 
molished this part of the " Chaucer legend " twenty 
years ago. He naively remarks that, thanks to the 
labors of the Chaucer Society, the poet may now be 
" read fluently in his own language," and then pro- 
ceeds to interpret " burdoun " in the line, " This 
Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun," as " a long 
walking-staff," and "enclite," in the line, u He koude 
songes make and wel endite," as " recite." Nor does 
he use his own language with much more accuracy 
than he interprets Chaucer's. He talks of " an ex- 
pended force," when he means a spent one, of

of Chaucer's language being " partly Teutonic and 
partly Saxon," of science "scotching " the germ of 
faith, and he draws a most uncomfortable picture of 
"bands of people . . . praying and mortifying as 
they went," thus adding a new and unheard of ter- 
ror to the wayfaring life of the fourteenth century. 
A writer on the customs of the mediaeval Church 
might also be expected to know that St. Gudula of 
Brussels was not a man, and that a Franciscan house 
is not and never was called an abbey. In spite of 
these defects, the general reader will find some curi- 
ous and interesting items in these pages, if he have 
patience to hunt for them, among them, one that 
"will probably reconcile him to the martyrdom of the 
saintly Becket. We read that being " ' busie at his 
prayers in the garden at Otford, [he] was much dis- 
turbed by the sweet note and melodie of a nightin- 
gale that sang in a bush beside him, and in the might 
of his holinesse commanded all birds of this kind to 
be henceforth silent.' So the song of the nightin- 
gale was banished from Otford." 

A J anese The cheerful and amusinganddelight-

and youth, author who has caused hosts of read- 
ers on both sides of the Atlantic to smile and chuckle 
over his queer but always vividly picturesque English, 
offers them another book of personal reminiscence 
and reflection in "When I Was a Child " (Houghton), 
which opens with a most ingratiating portrait of the 
author, from a photograph, and is further illustrated 
with many admirable drawings from his own prac- 
ticed hand. In twenty chapters of incident and 
characteristic comment, Mr. Yoshio Markino tells 
the story of his early home life at Koromo (" a small 
mountainous village in Mikawa, and although the 
view is beautiful, no pilgrims ever stop their feet at 
Koromo"), of his adoption into another family after 
his mother's death, of his trying experiences at a 
mission school, his narrow escape from death in a 
terrible earthquake, his "stepping on the highroad 
to ambition," and finally his emigration to America 
and his hardships in San Francisco. Thus the ac- 
count of his life is brought to the point where "A 
Japanese Artist in London " begins. Two chapters 
of a philosophical and religious nature "Ethic and 
Religion " and " Science and Human Sense " close 
the book. The things told are interesting in them- 
selves, and the manner of their telling is now amus- 
ing, now pathetic, and always remarkable for its 
vividness and quaint imagery. A passage from the 
preface, describing the conflict of imagination with 
memory in the author, will remind the reader of 
another and more famous instance of this tendency 
to "remember everything, whether it happened or 
not." "When I was a child," says Mr. Markino, "I 
had rather good memory, and if my memory was 
absent there was only a dark blank in my brain. 
To-day it is different with my brain. Since I am 
grown I began to have such a great imagination. 
(I think I have got much imagination since I have 



become an artist. For artists are obliged to make 
pictures entirely from their imagination, especially to 
illustrate some fictions, etc.)." But he has tried to 
check this imaginative tendency by getting his facts 
from relatives at home. The book's title is a little mis- 
leading. The author, born in 1874, brings his narra- 
tive down to his twentieth year or beyond and we 
should have been glad to have him continue it to the 
present day.

ful explanatory notes, in a choice selection of eight 
public utterances, in a small volume adorned with a 
likeness of the speaker in his more vigorous prime. 
Judge Pryor, soldier, diplomat, jurist, statesman, as 
he must be styled by reason of the variety and 
importance of his activities, is a native of Virginia, 
where he began the practice of the law in 1849 ; was 
sent as Special Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece 
in 1855; sac in the Thirty-sixth Congress; was a 
member of the Confederate States Congress, and a 
brigadier-general in the Confederate States Army ; 
after the war he was admitted to the New York bar, 
and was appointed judge of the Court of Common 
Pleas and, later, justice of the Supreme Court of 
New York (1894-99). Among his speeches now 
published are to be especially noted his defense of 
Southern independence upon the report of the Reso- 
lutions of the Committee of Thirty-three, in the House 
of Representatives ; his address at the first reunion 
of Federal and Confederate soldiers; and his dis- 
course on "The Influence of Virginia in the Forma- 
tion of the Federal Constitution." We are tempted 
to quote one paragraph of an address to law students, 
because of its charm of old-fashioned stateliness. 
" A lucid and logical arrangement of topics so per- 
spicuous as instantly to reveal their own significance 
and force ; a diction choice but not fastidious, rich 
yet not redundant ; an exhibition of learning short of 
pedantry, but sufficient for information ; a concate- 
nation of argument, compact and convincing; and 
an elocution graceful, animated, and earnest these 
are the qualities of speech by the concentrated spell 
of which even the most austere and impatient court 
will be fascinated into an involuntary thralldom." 
Could a Burke or a Webster have done it better? 

Dr Hosmer's ^ r ' J ames -K. Hosmer's reminiscent 
gleanings from volume, "The Last Leaf" (Putnam), 
many fields. chapters of which have already de- 
lighted readers of the "Atlantic," the Boston "Tran- 
script," and the New York " Evening Post," owes 
much of its breadth of interest to the number of 
vocations successfully followed by its author in the 
course of his four-score years. As minister of 
religion, soldier, author, college professor, lecturer, 
librarian, and what else beside we will not attempt 
to say, he has seen life in many aspects and rubbed 
elbows with men of many sorts and conditions.

THE DIAL,

Patted on the head in his infancy by Lincoln, he 
communed with Emerson in his prime, and but to 
mention other names after these great ones would 
be to incur the risk of an anticlimax. His war mem- 
ories and his experiences in Germany and France 
at the outbreak of the conflict between those two 
countries are just sufficiently stirring to make doubly 
,agreeable by contrast the record of his intercourse 
with the illustrious men of peace, the scholars and 
writers and statesmen, whom it was his fortune to 
meet from time to time. The style of these chapters 
from a richly varied life pleases by its apt allusion, 
its well-chosen phrase, its quiet humor, and its play 
of fancy. Of his intercourse with Simon Newcomb 
at Harvard, he says : " We became very good friends. 
He was a genial fellow, capable as I have said of 
taking or making a joke, yet his moods were prevail- 
ingly serious, and he had already hitched his waggon 
to a star." The following bit of literary autobiog- 
raphy is of especial interest: "In 1857 I sent a 
poem to the Atlantic then just beginning under his 
[Lowell's] editorship. My poem came back with 
the comment, ' Hardly good enough, but the writer 
certainly deserves encouragement.' This frost, 
though not unkind, nipped my budding aspirations 
in that direction. I hung my modest harp on the 
willows and have almost never since twanged the 
strings." The book's closing pages contain some 
*' eupeptic musings " that show the author to be a 
determined optimist, as indeed was little doubtful 
before, and as might have been surmised from his 
portrait, which appears as frontispiece. 

A new volume In the volume entitled "Essays in 
of studies by Radical Empiricism " (Longmans) 
William James. Mr Ralph Barton Perry has col- 
lected a number of studies by the late William 
James which represent that part of his philosophical 
work which the author regarded as more funda- 
mental than his provocative theory of pragmatism. 
His radical empiricism, he felt, could be accepted 
by those who were not pragmatists, although the 
pragmatic theory involved an empirical attitude. 
The particular doctrine which James labelled radical 
empiricism was, however, more than the mere insist- 
ence upon the facts of experience, the determination 
to start philosophizing from particular facts and per- 
ceptions, which was insisted upon by the earlier phil- 
osophers of the school of Hume, Mill, and others. 
This doctrine not only says that the only things that 
shall be debatable among philosophers are things 
definable in terms drawn from experience, but the 
relations of things which the older philosophers 
explained by some such unexperienced thing as an 
Absolute or Unknowable are in this doctrine re- 
garded as themselves matters of direct experience. 
These essays, which are for the most part of a some- 
what technical nature, deal with the use of this 
theory in the consideration of various philosophical 
problems. The thought-economy of the theory is 
insisted upon, and Mr. James avows that it enables 
him to read the universe religiously and even theis- 



tically, though the god it enables him to postulate 
is not omni-anything, but simply "the experiencer of 
widest actual conscious span." The rather startling 
title of the first essay, "Does ' Consciousness ' Exist ? " 
simply implies that to this theory consciousness as a 
state is not a reality but that only thoughts in the con- 
crete are real, and that they " are made of the same 
stuff as things are." 

The sisters In Miss Sarah G. Pomeroy's series 

of some of sketches entitled "Little-known 

famou* men. Sisters of Well-known Men " (Estes) 
are depicted the lives of a few from among the many 
women who have renounced their own gifts and aspi- 
rations that they might better serve the interests and 
fame of their brothers. It is similar in idea and plan 
to the well-known book of many years ago, "Some 
Noble Sisters" by Edmund Lee, and the later and 
more familiar volume, "Famous Sisters of Great 
Men" by Marianne Kirlew. Although the studies 
were prepared (as we are told in the Introduction) 
for academic degrees, there is a deplorable lack of 
authentic information regarding sources of material. 
Far too many of the long extracts are uncredited; 
and in the Bibliography we note at least two errors 
in exact titles. But notwithstanding these flaws, 
and a painful effort to connect some of the sketches 
by "a chance bond of time or place," the book is 
interesting and appreciative. We look in vain for 
a few names, notably that of Caroline Herschel. 
After a general Introductory chapter, there are life 
stories of Mary Sidney, Mary Lamb, Dorothy Words- 
worth, Elizabeth Whittier, Sarianna Browning, Har- 
riet Macaulay, Sarah Disraeli, Sophia Thoreau, and 
Eliza Parkman. In tracing the devotion of the sis- 
ters of Sidney, Macaulay, and Disraeli, the author 
has given valuable glimpses of the home- atmosphere 
of these authors. Her attempt to portray the high- 
spirited, keen, but elusive Sarianna Browning has 
met with better success than previous essays; yet 
the outlines are still indefinite. The American 
women, Elizabeth Whittier, Eliza Parkman, and 
Sophia Thoreau, are treated with sympathy and 
insight. The fine mind, executive ability, and scien- 
tific knowledge of Thoreau's sister are duly ac- 
knowledged, sometimes in unassigned quotations. 
The lighter element in Elizabeth Whittier should be 
blended in memory with her earnestness and zeal. 

Speaking generally, the study of 

. fossils has <l uite 3 ustl y been regarded 
by persons who were not inspired 
devotees at the palaeontological shrine as a rather 
dull and dry sort of business. In " Evolution in the 
Past" (Lippincott) Mr. Henry R. Knipe, F.L.S., 
endeavors with fair success to show that if properly 
told the story of the orderly progression of living 
things in the history of the earth, as revealed by 
fossils, is not without interest. The tale begins with 
the lowly protozoa, sponges, jelly-fishes, and the like, 
in the Cambrian period of the Palaeozoic age. A 
clear account is given of what these creatures were 
like, how they lived, and what sort of a world it was

in which they found themselves. In succeeding chap- 
ters the fauna and flora of each geological era are 
treated in the same way. The birth, growth, and 
final extinction of some great groups of animals and 
plants are traced. Finally we are brought in this way 
down to the present age. The chief defect of the 
book is found in the fact that it includes too much 
detailed information. The forest is somewhat ob- 
scured by the luxuriant growth of trees. Further- 
more, it is difficult to conceive why it was thought 
necessary to give the scientific name of nearly every 
organism mentioned. The old lady's criticism of the 
dictionary as a piece of light literature applies with 
considerable force to the present work: there is an 
abundance of pleasant and informing words but the 
plot is a bit difficult to follow. The numerous illus- 
trations by Miss Alice B. Woodhouse and Mr. Ernest 
Bucknoll are a valuable addition to the book; from 
both the artistic and the scientific standpoints they 
are excellent, particularly those done by the first- 
mentioned artist. 

Outlines of Most histories of Italian literature 

modern Italian pay extensive attention to the great 
literature. writers of the classical period, and 

deal but meagrely with the writers who came after 
Ariosto and Tasso. In giving us a history of 
" Modern Italian Literature " (Little, Brown & Co.), 
Mr. Lacy Collison-Morley has supplied a real want 
of English students of the subject, and placed us 
considerably in his debt. His work is essentially a 
history of Italian literature in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries, with an introductory chapter 
upon the decadent period between Tasso and Metas- 
tasio. The writers who have chapters to them- 
selves are Metastasio, Goldoni, Alfieri, Manzoni, 
and Leopardi. Later writers who are considered 
at some length are Giusti, Carducci, d'Annunzio, 
and Fogazzaro. Of the latter, the author says: 
"The fact that we can close this book with such a 
writer makes us look forward with confidence to the 
future of literature in Italy," as well it may. Mr. 
Collison-Morley has much to say of the influence 
of English ideals on the Italian spirit, and his crit- 
ical outlook is philosophical. His book is a happy 
blend of exact information with intelligent criticism, 
and his illustrative extracts, although sparingly in- 
dulged in, are always well-chosen. His chapters on 
Leopardi and Manzoni are models of sympathetic 
exposition. The whole work is a compendium, of 
course, but a highly readable one ; and we would not 
know where in English to look for a more satisfac- 
tory account of the letters of modern Italy. 

Mid-Victorian Ifc has been said > Probably more than 
memories of once, that artists make the best sub- 
an art-critic. j ects f or biography. If that is SO, 
they should also be not bad subjects for autobiog- 
raphy as has been convincingly enough proved by 
Cellini and Haydon and Vedder, to name no others. 
Mr. Frederick Wedmore, though rather a critic than 
a practitioner of the fine arts, has certainly enough 
of the artist about him to bring him within this class 



of agreeable autobiographers. His " Memories" 
(Doran) will be enjoyed by all who take delight in 
the cultured expression of a mind stored with the 
remembrance of cheerful yesterdays. Artists, actors, 
authors, editors, preachers, and others, pass across 
his pages, each leaving the impression of a distinct 
individuality, each drawn for us in a few strokes by 
the hand of a literary artist. Dickens, Tennyson, 
Browning, Henry Irving, Walter Pater, Whistler, 
Henry Ward Beecher, and others too numerous to 
mention, give variety and interest to his brief and 
anecdotal chapters. An amusing story of a conver- 
sation between old Lady Southampton and Queen 
Victoria represents the former as saying: k 'Do not 
you think, Ma'am, one of the satisfactions of the 
Future State will be not only our reunion with those 
whom we have loved on Earth, but our opportunities 
of seeing face to face so many of the noble figures 
of the Past of other lands and times ? Bible times, 
for instance. Abraham will be there, Ma'am. Isaac, 
too, and Jacob. Think of what they will be like! 
And the sweet singer of Israel, He, too. Yes, Ma'am. 
King David we shall see." To which the Queen, 
after a moment's silence, and with great dignity and 
decision, replied: "I will not meet David." 

The origin and '.' Prophetical, Educational, and Play 
development of ing Cards" (Jacobs), by Mrs. John 
playing cards. jft n g y an Rensselaer, who twenty 
years ago wrote a book (now out of print) entitled 
"The Devil's Picture Book," is a study of a rather 
baffling subject, the origin and antiquity of playing 
cards having hitherto been enveloped in a cloud of 
much misapprehension and uncertainty. The pre- 
vailing notion that cards were first invented for the 
amusement of a crazy French king is of course dis- 
missed at once as absurdly erroneous by Mrs. Van 
Rensselaer, who carries back their origin to "the 
mysteries of ancient days," and assures her readers 
that "the heraldic devices of Mercury, which are 
the emblems of what has always been called, by his- 
torians, ' The Book of Thoth Hermes Trismegistus,' 
are in themselves mute proof of the connection of 
the Tarots (as they are now called) with the cult of 
Mercury." Many plates, of curious interest, are 
provided, and the writer makes good use of sources 
of information not accessible to earlier writers on the 
subject. But one is tempted to smile at the serious- 
ness with which the virtues of cards as aids to the 
revealing of the future are treated. At the very 
outset, the book (on its wrapper) professes its ability 
to teach any person the art of fortune-telling; and in 
the middle of the volume the invention of the French 
pips is spoken of as being " as well adapted for play- 
ing as were the original Tarots suited for divining 
the lives and characteristics of mankind." Neverthe- 
less the work is packed with unusual erudition, and 
will delight all who take their card-playing seriously* 
The addition of an index and of a glossary (ety- 
mological, if possible) of unusual and foreign terms 
would enhance the value of any subsequent re-issues 
of the book.

ago in Tennessee, studied at the University of Texas, at 
German universities, and at Oxford as Rhodes scholar, 
and saw some service as journalist on London papers. 



In 1908 he became editor of the magazine " Short 
Stories." He was the author of " Up from College "

at the Boston Latin School and Harvard College (class 
of '62) ; served in the Civil War as private, lieutenant, 
and captain of volunteers; engaged in the law-book 
business in St. Louis, afterward entered the publishing 
house of Little, Brown & Co., and in 1889 became 
president of the Boston Book Co., which he himself had 
organized. At various times he was a trustee of the 
Brookline Public Library, vice-president of the Amer- 
ican Library Association, member of its Publishing 
Board, of its Council, of the Institute, and trustee of 
the Endowment Fund. He made himself an expert in 
library-planning and acted as adviser on the subject.

Work," published last year, " Library Rooms and 
Buildings," " Reference Manual of Law Books and 
Citations," and, in earlier life, " Hamlet Revamped, 
Modernized and Set to Music," and " Romeo and Juliet:

The Masters 

of 
Modern French Criticism 

By IRVING BABBITT 

Studies the main trend of nineteenth century 
thought as revealed in the work of some of its 
most vital and significant personalities especially 
Madame de Stael, Joubert, Chateaubriand, Sainte- 
Beuve, Taine, Renan, Scherer, and Brunetiere. 

"Too frequently books about books, about writers 
of books, and about the critics of books, make 
rather dull and heavy reading. This is not true 
in the case of ' The Masters of Modern French 
Criticism.' The work, from first to last, has life 
and strength as well as insight and justice, and 
may be called without exaggeration a very 
entertaining as well as instructive survey of the 
intellectual life of France during the nineteenth 
century." Chicago Inter Ocean.

Important February Books 

Mr. Richard Pryce 

through the publication last Spring of " CHRISTOPHER," earned his position 
as one of the notable group of English novelists whose writings are so widely 
read on both sides of the water. 

As the London Book Lover says, " Mr. Pryce stands out as one of the 
happiest modern interpreters of female character." And the Chicago Inter 
Ocean calls him " a novelist of rare and most attractive quality." 

Three of his novels are now published, uniform with "CHRISTOPHER": 

JEZEBEL portrays a glorious compelling character, a young English girl, whose name leads her into 

unusual situations, but who finally takes her place in the circle to which she was born. 

ELEMENTARY JANE is a charming idyll against a vivid and effective background of music hall and 

lodging house life in the poorer quarters of London. 

THE BURDEN OF A WOMAN is a powerful story in which a woman of strength and gentleness, 

bravely enduring her own trouble, teaches fine moral distinctions to the man who loves her. A happy 

ending closes the years of pain and questioning.

THE HAPPY WARRIOR 

By A. S. M. HUTCHINSON 

HPHE reception accorded Mr. Hutchinson's new novel indicates that it is destined to be 
* as great a success in this country as it is in England. Five large printings have already 
been required and the discriminating critics are most enthusiastic. 

SOME TYPICAL ENGLISH OPINIONS 

" The outstanding novel of the season." Bystander (London). 

" ' The Happy Warrior ' is a book in a million." London Morning Post. 

"A very remarkable and a very impressive novel. A story of a very rare and beautiful order. It 
abounds in character, rings true at every turn of the sentiment, and brings the tears to the eyes by the sheer 
force of its sincerity. 'The Happy Warrior ' establishes Mr. Hutchinson among the artists." London 
Daily Telegraph. 

" It is Percival who exemplifies Wordsworth's conception of the Happy Warrior. His fight with Foxy 
Pinsent will always remain one of the notable fights of fiction. It is magnificent." London Times. 

" A great story and one which must surely win for its author a high place 
among the novelists whose work endures." From the Boston Transcript's London 
Literary Correspondent. 

SOME EARLY AMERICAN OPINIONS 

The Boston Transcript says : 

" A novel of exceptional merit and distinction. ... A narrative and descriptive style of writing that 
is as delightful and inspiring as the story itself. . , . Few novels exist in which the characters are as 
viable as Mr. Hutchinson's." 

The New York World says: 

"The young English author scores brilliantly again. . . . 'The Happy Warrior ' is a book of the 
out-of-doors and of the heart of youth. It is written in words that bound." 

James L. Ford in New York Herald says: 

" It is distinctly original in its plot. ... A very unusual piece of writing. . . . An extremely inter- 
esting novel of English life." 

Fremont Rider in Publishers' Weekly says: 

"A wonderful novel, of which it is only difficult to speak with moderation so fresh in phrase and 
style, so searching in analysis, so fine in spirit." 

The Bookseller, Newsdealer, and Stationer says : 

" Not since ' The Broad Highway ' has there been an English story of such 
marked merit." 

The Chicago Record- Herald says: 

" A fine novel, well planned, well executed, well characterized, unhackneyed, thrilling, wholesome, 
tingling with vitality yet deepened and calmed by quaint philosophy." 

The Boston Herald says : 

" In a word, it is a great book."

>"pHE NEALE PUBLISHING COMPANY, in celebrating its eighteenth anniversary this year, 
JL has established NEALE'S MONTHLY, a magazine of literature, science, art, and fundamental 
criticism, constructive, dealing with large questions in a large way, the interest always immediate 
and vital, and never merely academic. 



In the first number, January, 1913, six great 
serials were begun: "The Strategy of Robert E. 
Lee," by J. J. Bowen, an important contribution 
to the military literature of the world; "The 
Scuttlers," by Clyde C. Westover, the most not- 
able fiction that this brilliant author has written, 
a detective story, of the sea; "Wall Street as Our 
American Monte Carlo," by Franklin C. Keyes, 
of the New York bar, an intimate account of 
the operations of the greatest gambling structure 
ever erected; "The Monk and the Hangman's 
Daughter," by Ambrose Bierce, his greatest and 
his longest romance; " Forerunners of the Repub- 
lic," a series of biographical articles, by Archibald 



Henderson, of the University of North Carolina; 
and "Mrs. Kinney's Italian Reminiscences," 
edited by Laura Stedman and George M. Gould. 
Mrs. Kinney, the mother of the late Edmund 
Clarence Stedman, was the wife of the American 
minister at the court of Victor Emanuel. Her 
reminiscences make important contributions to 
the literature of the period, revealing, as they do, 
the two Brownings and other great personages 
of literature and of history, in a new light. The 
first instalment of each of these serials, with 
short stories, poems, articles, important depart- 
ments, and other literature of the best, make the 
first number of 



Neale's Monthly 



During the eighteen years that have passed since The Neale Publishing Company was founded 
it has contributed many notable volumes to American literature. Chief among them, perhaps, are 
the books that make Neale's War Library, which comprises more than one hundred volumes that 
relate to the Civil War, written by both Northerners and Southerners. But the Neale output is 
highly diversified. It consists of history and biography, fiction, poetry, politics, religion, general 
miscellany, and works of sheer literature. Among its great publications of sheer literature, "The 
Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce," in twelve volumes, was recently completed. 

The Neale output comprises hundreds of books of importance. They are to be found in homes 
of refinement everywhere, and in the great public libraries; they are frequently consulted by savants; 
they are used in the classrooms of important universities. Take your choice of this entire great 
output either one book or several at the low price at which the Neale publications are sold.

THE PUBLIC SCHOOL UP TO DATE. 



One of the most interesting educational pub- 
lications we have ever seen is the unpretentious 
pamphlet of thirty-two pages just issued by 
the Russell Sage Foundation, and entitled " A 
Comparative Study of Public School Systems 
in the Forty-eight States." Students of any 
particular phase of the subject of public educa- 
tion usually find themselves greatly handicapped 
by the difficulty of obtaining accurate statistical 
information upon current conditions, and can 
often do no better in their comparative showings 
than to set side by side variously dated figures 
from different parts of the country. This diffi- 
culty is due in part to the fact that many school 
reports are inexcusably belated in publication, 
and in part to the fact that the method of pre- 
senting reports is not standardized, thus making 
it extremely difficult to determine the relative 
efficiency of the school systems of the several 
states in some very important matters. Even 
the reports of the United States Commissioner 
of Education are made faulty by lack of time- 
liness, and by the fact that, in spite of their 
bewildering array of figures, they are frequently 
found not to contain the very things that the 
investigator most wants. The pamphlet now 
under consideration represents what must have 
been an enormous amount of labor, and for the 
first time presents in simple form what may be 
called a bird's-eye view of present conditions in 
all the essential phases of the subject. 

There are sixteen special showings in this 
pamphlet, each of them, as a rule, made by 
means of a graphic chart, a statistical column, 
and a few pertinent explanatory notes. Take 
the first of them, for example, which deals with 
" children in school and out," and it shows us 
at a glance the relation of the school population 
of each state to the total child population of 
school age. The display ranges from Vermont, 
with 92.7 per cent of her children in school, to 
Louisiana, with only 55.3 per cent, or a little 
more than half. A note suggests that " Ver- 
mont, Maine, and Connecticut, with more than 
90 per cent of the children of school age actually 
in school, are making better investments in 
future citizenship than Alabama, Texas, Nevada, 
and Louisiana, with from 35 to 45 per cent of 



82 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



their children of school age not receiving school- 
ing." We might easily devote an entire article 
to this subject alone, or to any other single 
exhibit of the pamphlet, but at present we can 
do no more than to pick out suggestive nuggets 
of fact here and there from this rich mine of 
pedagogical information. 

In the statistics of school revenue the range is 
from New York, with over fifty millions of annual 
revenue almost all of it taxes to Nevada, 
with about half a million, or approximately one 
per cent of what the larger state collects. This 
represents a far greater discrepancy than the rela- 
tive populations would warrant, which makes 
it evident either that New York exceeds its duty, 
or that Nevada falls short of it. It is interesting 
to learn that local taxation supports the public 
schools, from 97 per cent in the case of Massa- 
chusetts to only 2 7 per cent in the case of Georgia. 
It is highly desirable that the local communities 
should learn not to look to the state for aid for 
their schools, and in this matter Massachusetts, 
Rhode Island, and Kansas, who are above the 
90 per cent mark, furnish examples that the 
other states should seek to emulate. Six states 
get from 10 to 20 per cent of their school income 
from permanent land grant funds ; allowing for 
this, the honor list of states which do not lean 
heavily upon state taxation should be consider- 
ably increased. But there is not much to be 
said for the local governments of Kentucky, 
Georgia, and Alabama, which call upon the 
state to collect and distribute more than half 
of the funds applied to the purposes of the 
schools. 

There are no more vitally important figures 
in this statistical exhibit than those which give 
the investment in school plant, the expendi- 
ture per child of school age, the ratio between 
wealth and school expenditure, and the daily 
cost of the child's schooling. Massachusetts 
has put 115 dollars for each of her children 
into school buildings and grounds; Missis- 
sippi has provided the munificent sum of four 
dollars. This is the best available index for a 
state of the past educational interest of its 
people. The amount annually spent for each 
<?hild is from thirty-two to three dollars in 
Washington and South Carolina, respectively. 
A note points the moral: "In the long run, 
states, like individuals, purchase about what 
they pay for, not much more and not much less." 
For each hundred dollars of wealth in the state, 
the amount paid annually for schools is 75 cents 
in Oklahoma and 19 cents in New Hampshire. 



It would seem to be in order for the White 
Mountain State to quadruple its educational 
budget without delay, unless it is content to be 
permanently shamed by what was only a few 
years ago the Indian Territory. Nevada, which 
makes a rather poor showing in most respects, 
comes magnificently to the front in the matter 
of the daily cost per child in its schools, pro- 
viding no less than 39 cents, as against the 
seven cents of Georgia and the Carolinas. 
Low cost, of course, means cheap teaching, 
and the wages that we pay our teachers, the 
conntry throughout, are nothing less than a 
national scandal. 

This latter subject deserves a paragraph of 
its own, and the statistics of average salary in 
the forty-eight states show some surprising con- 
trasts. California and Arizona, with averages 
of 918 dollars and 817 dollars, respectively, set 
the pace for even New York and Massachusetts, 
whose averages are 813 dollars and 757 dollars, 
respectively. North Carolina is disgraced by 
the fact that its teachers receive salaries averag- 
ing only 200 dollars, and this of course means 
that there are thousands of individuals receiving 
far less than this average. The average for the 
entire country is only 485 dollars, which is less 
than the average for factory workers and com- 
mon laborers. " The fact that teachers' wages 
are lower than those paid for almost any other 
sort of service means that as a nation we are 
neither asking for nor getting a high grade of 
service, and that as a nation we place a low 
valuation on the teacher's work." It seems to 
be about time for public speakers to stop 
boasting about our national devotion to educa- 
tion. Stated in aggregates of millions of dol- 
lars, the figures are doubtless impressive; stated 
in any rational way, with reference to the num- 
bers of teachers and taught, or with reference 
to our resources in wealth and taxation, they 
constitute a pitiful exposure of our national 
niggardliness. 

We must pass over the exhibits concerned 
with days of schooling, with compulsory attend- 
ance, with school mortality, with illiteracy, with 
legislation upon building construction, with free 
text books, and with medical inspection, in order 
to reach the final showing, which judges each 
state by the ten most important tests of effi- 
ciency, and gives to each a general rank in 
accordance with the way in which it meets these 
tests, besides giving in separate columns its rank 
under each separate test. Taking as an example 
our own state of Illinois, we find that while its 



1913]

general ranking is eight, its special ranking is 

as follows : 

Children in school . . . . 14 

School plant 7 

Expense per child .... 8 
School days per child ... 8 
Length of school year . . .15 

Attendance 11 

Expenditure and wealth . . . 28 

Daily cost 13 

High schools ...... 20 

Salaries 11 

It obviously behooves us as a commonwealth 
to spend upon education something like twice 
what we now spend, which would give us third 
place in the scale, to do much more than we 
now do for high schools, to lengthen the school 
year in the rural districts (for it is they that 
now bring it down to 171 days), and to get 
more of our children into school. These are 
the reforms that are ear-marked for us by the 
pamphlet, and, effectively made, would enable 
us to feel fairly proud of our state. Of course, 
as a counsel of perfection, each state of the forty- 
eight should wish to get into the first place, but 
as this is obviously impossible, should aim to 
outdistance as many of the others as possible. 
" The object of this booklet," we are pithily 
informed, "is to make the indifferent different." 
It can hardly fail of this effect upon the mind 
of anyone who gives it an intelligent examina- 
tion. 



A LITERARY PEACE MOVEMENT, 

At a banquet recently held in Paris, when the 
spectre of a European war had barely been ban- 
ished, a German speaker proudly asserted that 
Maupassant was as familiar to German readers as 
any native modern writer; and a French speaker 
pointed with pride to the familiarity of French 
literati with the works of Sudermann and others, 
adding, with a shaft of sarcasm directed at his own 
people, that even the "Faust" of Goethe, long a 
favorite through the opera of Gounod, was being 
prepared for production by M. Antoine! 

There was enough, however, in the addresses of 
the evening that called to mind some remarks of 
Romain Holland, who perhaps knows his French 
and knows the Germans as well as any Frenchman 
or German living: 

" We must not indulge in illusions. We are at present 
more ignorant of the world than the men of the past. 
Translations of a few foreign novels and a rapid survey of 
the papers do not suffice to make one penetrate the genius 
of another people. They only relieve us too easily of any 
personal effort at knowing them first hand, they favor 
ignorance, vanity and laziness. Compare with that shabby 
curiosity the eagerness of mind and the untiring labor of a 



Voltaire, a Diderot, an Abbe Provost and their friends, not 
to mention Leibnitz or Goethe." 

There is little doubt that, notwithstanding the 
greater facilities of travel, the rapid interchange of 
news through the press and the telegraph, and other 
features of modern international intercourse, famil- 
iarity and sympathy with the intellectual achieve- 
ments of the neighbors across the Rhine were greater 
in the period of the Huguenot immigration into 
Germany, of the royal Francophile Frederick the 
Great, and of the French encyclopedists, than it is 
now. If, however, the Germans seem more familiar 
with French letters than the French with German 
literature, it is well to remember that the Huguenot 
element was so thoroughly assimilated in the Ger- 
man people that its influence lingers in many a 
German town, and in a part of Berlin which they 
had called Moabit, where French is to this day the 
dominant language in a college likewise dating from 
that period. But the violent reaction against any- 
thing French which succeeded the Napoleonic inva- 
sion of a century ago seems no less justified than the 
indifference of the French to-day towards German 
literature of the decades following upon the war of 
1870-1. For the patriotism of a people is ever at 
the beck and call of the powers who need the backing 
of the mass for the realization of their plans, and 
the chauvinism of a nation is rooted in ignorance 
and nurtured by misguided patriotism. 

Yet the tide of intellectual sympathies does not 
always swell and subside with the tide of political 
developments. Said Ludwig Borne in " Die Wage " 
in the year 1836: 

" The political history of a people is the biography of its 
egotism, but the literature is the history of its humanitarian 
life, for it does not stop before legal barriers, or geological 
frontiers, but leaps across laws, customs, antipathies, and 
prejudices." 

Thus in the wake of the post-Napoleonic Franco- 
phobia in Germany had come the romantic school, 
with its revival of a cosmopolitan culture which had 
distinguished the writers of the past. In France, 
Gerard de Nerval had translated " Faust," and had 
published an anthology of German verse embracing 
selections from Goethe, Schiller, Bttrger, Uhland, 
Korner, Jean Paul, and Heine. Heine himself had 
made Paris his home, and wrote for German maga- 
zines on French letters, music, and art, and for 
French reviews on German philosophy and litera- 
ture. In the course of the century many other less 
known writers served as mutual literary interpreters 
between the two politically hostile nations. Rudolf 
Lindau, the gifted though less popular brother of 
Paul Lindau, wrote in French and German. The 
polylingual feuilletonist, A. Mels, who died in Chi- 
cago a year after the Columbian Exposition, which 
he attended as foreign correspondent, had when a 
resident of Paris in his prime written for German, 
French, English, and Spanish papers. 

With the Franco-German war came a brief reac- 
tion against this literary internationalism in both 
countries. But the generation of Germans that grew 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1,, 



up after the glamor of military glory had faded again 
sought in France the source of much of its inspira- 
tion, and trained its literary talents upon the models 
of French masters, foremost among them Zola. Nor 
was the younger generation in France slow at recog- 
nizing the one great personality that rose above the 
horizon of the new German empire Nietzsche, 
who with the penetrating searchlight of his genius 
covered the world's culture, past and present, and 
found it '' all too human." Through him was revealed 
to independent French thinkers the intellectual re- 
valuation that had begun in Germany, when the glit- 
ter of the wealth acquired by the war had vanished 
and symptoms of intellectual stagnation and moral 
decadence had begun to appear. Nietzsche intro- 
duced the young Germans to the philosophy of 
Gobineau and to the subtle art of Stendhal-Beyle. 
He was an admirable mediator between Teuton and 
Gaul, and a light-bearer to both. 

But while the French intellectuals studied Nietz- 
sche's philosophy, the literature which followed in 
the wake of his iconoclasm remained practically un- 
known in France. Of that young Germany which 
gives such striking proofs of his far-reaching influ- 
ence, and of the lessons learned from Ibsen, Tolstoi, 
and Zola, only Gerhart Hauptmann has reached a 
French audience eager to know something of the 
forces at work in the literature of the so-called arch- 
enemy across the Rhine. Even of the extent of 
German interest in French letters, of the amazing 
number of German editions of French authors, the 
French themselves are supremely ignorant. For 
chauvinist currents are strong in the intellectual 
world of France. Even the faculty of German let- 
ters at the Sorbonne was made to feel these influ- 
ences a few years ago, when Professor Andler and 
a number of his students, returning from a journey 
to Germany undertaken for purposes of study, were 
made the butt of hostile demonstrations on the part 
of the "nationalist" students backed by Maurice 
Barres. 

Thus there is decided room for a propaganda of 
better mutual understanding, such as was inaugu- 
rated not quite a year ago and culminated in the 
banquet referred to at the beginning of this article. 
There was truth in the remark of one of the speakers 
that even though the achievements of the two nations 
were known and appreciated by a small minority on 
both sides of the Rhine, there was need of having 
the men and women behind those works meet face 
to face and found upon the basis of social relations 
the work of mutual understanding. That is one of 
the most practical aims in the programme of the 
society "Pour Mieux Se Connaltre," and of the most 
direct appeal. The number of Germans residing 
in Paris has been estimated at six thousand. A large 
percentage consists of members of various intellect- 
ual professions, teachers, students, artists, writers, 
whose opportunities for direct personal contact with 
their French colleagues are limited. There is the 
Alsatian element, whose position whether on this or 
the other side of the Rhine is surely not enviable. 



The very existence of these people is at all too fre- 
quent intervals menaced by the war-clouds that keep 
looming up on the political horizon of the two coun- 
tries. The mission of the society is of vast import- 
ance, and its possibilities are equally vast. For the 
French senator, Baron d'Estournelles de Constant r 
who said, " Le rapprochement franco-allemand est 
la condition de la paix du monde," has given voice 
to a sentiment the truth whereof can scarcely be 
doubted. Nor can this mutual approach be more 
successfully attained than by an inofficial intercourse 
between representatives of both nations and by the 
intellectual exchange which mutual familiarity with 
their science, art, and letters insures. For, after all, 
the world of intellect is neutral ground, and if repre- 
sentatives of both nations can meet at international 
congresses of science for the exchange of experiences, 
and by striving in common for the promotion of 
knowledge forget the barriers that separate them in 
the political arena, there is no reason why men and 
women in the world of art and letters should not 
meet for the purpose of personal acquaintance and 
a more intimate understanding of the foreign mind, 
and by mitigating the spirit of mutual distrust pro- 
mote the possibility of peace. 

The membership of the society bids fair to repre- 
sent that intellectual world which should know no 
national boundaries. Among its French members 
one notes Octave Mirbeau, Leon Frapie', Jean Rei- 
brach, Victor Margue'ritte, J. H. Rosny aine*, Re'ne' 
Ghil, Leon Bazalgette, Henri Guilbeaux, Gabriel 
Faur^, Claude Debussy, Charles Le'andre, Paul 
Signac, Leopold Mabilleau, Charles Wagner, Jean 
Richard Bloch, Paul Hyacinthe Loyson, and our ex- 
patriate Francois Vie'le-Griffin. The president is 
M. J. Grand-Carteret, a writer on problems of inter- 
national politics, such as the Alsatian and Moroccan 
questions, who is equally well-known in Germany as 
in France. The secretaries are Loyson, the son of 
the famous Pere Hyacinthe, who made his debut as 
dramatist some years ago and is now editing a mag- 
azine, and Guilbeaux, a Belgian by birth, and a poet 
and critic of rare ability, who writes on German 
letters for French and on French letters for Ger- 
man reviews. The list of German members shows 
the names of Ernst Haeckel, Wilhelm Ostwald, Karl 
Federn, Karl Lamprecht, KrOch Schmidt, Richard 
Dehmel, Ludwig Fulda, Clara Viebig, Carl and 
Gerhart Hauptmann, Karl Henckell, Felix Wein- 
gartner, Richard Strauss, Max Liebermann, Franz 
von Stuck, and others. There is an international 
committee to which belong, among others, Maeter- 
linck, Verhaeren, Edouard Claparede, A. Forel, the 
Baroness von Suttner, E. Jacques-Dalcroze, and 
Miss Anna B. Eckstein of the International Peace 
Society. 

The propaganda of this movement for an intellec- 
tual Franco-German "rapprochement" includes the 
arrangement of exhibitions of French art and con- 
certs of French music in Germany, the organization 
of travel-clubs in France for the purpose of visiting 
Germany, and the introduction into France of the

works of modern German writers chiefly those who 
have shown unusual familiarity with French history 
or a profound understanding of the French tempera- 
ment. Among the works of this kind to be presented 
in France is the monumental double drama by Carl 
Hauptmann, " Burger Bonaparte Kaiser Napo- 
leon." A review called "Cahiers Franco- Allemands " 
is the temporary organ of the society; but a large 
review, taking its name from the one dreamed of by 
Heine, " France- Allemagne," is to be founded, and 
will be devoted to the discussion of Franco-German 
problems and to the exchange between French and 
German letters. This propaganda of ideas, supple- 
mented by banquets and other social reunions, is 
likely to bring about relations between the French 
and the German members which will deliver both 
from the burden of preconceived notions and enlarge 
their vision towards an appreciative understanding 
of the spirit of the people whom the political machi- 
nations of the powers would make their enemy. The 
influence radiating from such a nucleus of unbiased 
minds seems one of the most promising factors in 
the propaganda for a permanent peace between the 
French and the Germans, whom Victor Hugo called 
" les deux nations maitresses " and whose perpetual 
misunderstandings disturb the whole world.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE LURE OF THE NOVEL loses nothing of its 
strength with the progress of the suns and the 
enormous increase in the number of novels. But 
it is encouraging to note at the same time an occa- 
sional sign of the increasing attractiveness of other 
departments of literature. In the city of Wash- 
ington, for instance, the people are learning, not to 
like fiction less, but to like history and science more. 
In the current yearly report of the Public Library 
of the District of Columbia, Mr. Bowerman, the 
librarian, records with satisfaction a nearly station- 
ary condition in the number of story-books circu- 
lated in recent years, with a marked increase in 
the circulation of more serious reading matter. In 
brief, the fiction figures for the last eight years 
show a relative shrinkage amounting to twenty-six 
per cent in the total circulation of to-day; that is, 
from a fiction circulation of eighty-four per cent 
in 1904, there has been a gradual fall to fifty- eight 
per cent last year. Without reference to a possible 
change in readers' tastes, the factors supposed to 
have produced this encouraging result are the per- 
sonal help and guidance given by assistants, pro- 
gressive extension of the open-shelf system, and 
special displays of works on various subjects in a 
case labelled " Some Readable Books " and holding 
about two hundred and twenty-five volumes, which 
need frequent replenishing. The library's plan of 
compiling its occasional press notices into a monthly 
bulletin, and of cooperating with other institutions 



or associations in the preparation of bibliographic 
aids, calls for commendation. 

A CHEERFUL PESSIMIST, facing unabashed the 
world's prone ness to evil, and having always as a 
final resource the courage of despair, is a more 
inspiring personage than the fatuously smiling op- 
timist, reiterating his optimism with the unconvinc- 
ing emphasis of him who protests too much. Mr. 
Alfred Russel Wallace, who has just completed his 
ninetieth year, declares with the Preacher: "I have 
seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and, 
behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit." Im- 
mense industrial and scientific progress has been 
witnessed by this eminent man of science, but he is 
reported as denying that man has advanced in 
morals or intellect in the last seven thousand years. 
" Everything is as bad as it can possibly be. From 
top to bottom our whole social system is rotten, full 
of vice and everything that is bad." Yet the outlook 
ahead seems to him hopeful, perhaps because of what 
the new science of eugenics, in which he is said to 
have great faith, is expected to accomplish. And to 
hasten the coming of the good time he has in pre- 
paration a work of which he says that it is " a book 
suggesting the necessary work for the labor party in 
its campaign against poverty, and laying down what 
I believe to be the fundamental principles and means 
by which continuous progress in the well-being of 
the community can be secured." Meanwhile, as a 
sort of counterpoise (however light) to the weight 
of this eminent thinker's utterances, the jocular Mr. 
Chesterton is declaring himself in the press a staunch 
unbeliever in the good things promised by the eugen- 
ists, and he has a new book about to be issued on 
" The Evil of Eugenics." But he will have abund- 
ant time and possibly sufficient cause to change his 
mind before he is ninety years old. 



POSTAL LEGISLATION FOR THE DISCOURAGEMENT 
OF EDUCATION now stands on the statute-book, and 
should receive early revision. By the terms of the 
new parcel-post law, potatoes and turnips and other 
produce may be mailed for local delivery at five 
cents for a single pound, or fifteen cents for eleven 
pounds, with corresponding rates between these 
weights ; but a book weighing a pound must bear 
eight cents in stamps, and no book exceeding four 
pounds may be sent by mail. Packages of books 
aggregating eleven pounds in weight would call for 
at least eighty-eight cents' worth of stamps as com- 
pared with fifteen cents for the same weight of 
bricks or cabbages or shingle nails. A public library 
or a bookshop may not supply its near-by patrons 
with reading matter through the mail at a lesser rate 
than eight cents a pound, but the grocer or dry-goods 
dealer is allowed to fill the orders of his customers 
throughout a fifty-mile zone at a postal rate varying 
from five cents for a single pound to thirty-five cents 
for eleven pounds. When the old rate on merchan- 
dise other than printed matter was fixed at one cent 
an ounce, it was considered a handsome concession 



86 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



to the cause of education and of literature to allow 
books to go by mail at one-half that rate. But now 
the general merchandise rate for short distances has 
been diminished about eighty per cent, while the 
book-rate remains as before. That this unfair dis- 
crimination may soon be corrected is the prayer of 
all who handle books or are interested in the spread 
of literature and learning. 



THE PASSING OF THE PERIOD, in sentence construc- 
tion, such as our ancestors knew it, is not cause for 
unmixed satisfaction. An impatience that cannot 
tolerate a period of more than twenty words, or of 
more than two clauses, is not an impatience to be 
humored. The present mode of cutting up one's 
written discourse into snippets, or ver bless interjec- 
tions, makes in reality hard reading and produces 
an unsightly page. In a recent piece of writing by 
an author of repute occurs one sentence of only ten 
words with three full-stops, two of which might much 
better have been commas. The mail has just brought 
to us an anonymous communication in the form of 
a copy of our sentence beginning at the bottom of 
the first column of page 40 of our last issue, with a 
parenthesized exclamation-point added, presumably 
in protest at the length of the sentence. Yet it con- 
tains only forty-five words. We have this moment, 
at the very first page turned up in opening Ruskin, 
chanced on a sentence of one hundred and seven 
words which is short for Ruskin. (The sentence 
is the second in the third chapter of "The Seven 
Lamps of Architecture.") It is true our own sen- 
tence contains a double involution, a relative clause 
within a relative clause ; but who with any head at 
all on his shoulders need get lost in so unintricate 
a maze ? After ten minutes' reading of Macaulay 
or Gibbon the offending passage might almost strike 
one as curt. Scott and Dickens and Thackeray, not 
to mention Meredith and Mr. Henry James, do not 
hesitate to pack into a single sentence all that it can 
comfortably carry. But those of us who cannot stand 
the strain of sentences more than ten words long can 
always go back to our primer and enjoy the brevity 
and lucidity of its style. " See the cat. The cat 
has caught a mouse. The cat will eat the mouse. 
Poor mouse ! " ... 

FICTION AS A PLEASANT POISON has withstood 
unnumbered attacks of the anti-fictionists, and will 
withstand unnumbered more. Canon Barry, writ- 
ing in "Everyman," is the latest bitter foe to the 
novel; and Temple Scott, in the Boston "Transcript," 
rushes valiantly to its defense. "The tyranny of 
the novel," avers the churchman, "betokens that 
faith has given way to feeling, and that feeling is 
debauched by excitement following on the loss of 
long-cherished ideals." "We cannot be so bad as 
the Canon pictures us," is the reply, "or he would 
not take this trouble to make us see the error of our 
ways. There must be a sense for the right in us if 
he expects us to respond to his appeal." Of course 
the whole discussion will only leave each side more 
firmly fixed in its opinion than before. Instead of 



wasting so much good printer's ink in obvious gen- 
eralities the contestants might wisely have come to a 
short and simple agreement to the proposition that 
there are novels and novels, the best of them good 
for the head and good for the heart, the worst too 
worthless to claim an intelligent person's attention, 
and the middling ones regrettably numerous and by 
no means tonic in their action on the reader, but less 
injurious than many forms of diversion or sensation- 
alism that lure those who know not the pleasures of 
reading. , . . 

THE INCINERATION OF " TOM JONES," which was 
solemnly performed the other day at Doncaster by 
order of the committee of the Doncaster Free Li- 
brary, will happily not deprive the rest of the world 
of the privilege of reading that masterpiece in early 
British fiction. It seems that one of the worthy 
Yorkshire men composing the committee or govern- 
ing body of the above-named library chanced to take 
the book home, having never read it before, and was 
scandalized at certain characteristics of the author's 
style. He reported the story an immoral work and 
thus precipitated a heated debate in the committee 
room, where, though one member staunchly stood up 
for the book as being superior to history as a faithful 
picture of Fielding's times, the prevailing sentiment 
was adverse to its retention on the shelves of the 
Doncaster library ; and so it was sentenced to death 
by fire, and met its cruel fate with the true martyr's 
noble fortitude. But, as hinted above, there are 
other copies of the famous work known to be still 
extant, and for the next few weeks booksellers and 
delivery-desk attendants are likely to note an in- 
crease, slight but nevertheless perceptible, in the 
demand for the book, because of the action of the 
Doncaster Corporation Free Library Committee. 
Thus it is that the cause of morality is advanced 
as they imagine in Yorkshire. 



A NEW "GAME OF AUTHORS " might take the form 
of preposterous proof that every writer's works were 
written by somebody else; that Wordsworth, for 
example, wrote Scott's novels, and that Lamb wrote 
Shelley's poems. The Baconians have led the way 
in this recreational exercise, and Mr. Chesterton 
hilariously follows suit in a late amusing contribu- 
tion to the " Illustrated London News." Under the 
heading "Who Wrote Bacon?" he proceeds to de- 
monstrate, in a manner calculated to convince those 
who have just indulged in "a heavy and Pickwickian 
Christmas dinner," that the author of Bacon's writ- 
ings was none other than Shakespeare. The histori- 
cal proofs are handled with masterly skill. After 
referring to the execution of Essex and Southamp- 
ton's imprisonment in the Tower, and to the friend- 
ship between Essex and Bacon and that between 
Southampton and Shakespeare, he concludes, with 
irrefutable logic: "Could anything in Baconian mud 
be clearer? Shakespeare in some state of penitence 
(or drink) told Southampton that he himself was 
'Bacon.' Southampton was just about to warn his 
friend Essex against the impostor, when the impos-

tor had the sense to strike first and kill the man who 
might know, and imprison the man who did know 
and only fawn on him when his tongue was free. 
Is it not a connected story ? Is it not a conceivable 
hypothesis ? Why, no ; it is a new Christmas game." 



"CUMULATIVE" BIBLIOGRAPHY, as devised and 
practiced by the H. W. Wilson Co. of Minneapolis, 
has its history related in an interesting illustrated 
pamphlet issued by the above-named publishing house. 
It was in 1889 that the first modest beginnings of the 
present business took shape in a partnership between 
two students of the University of Minnesota who un- 
dertook (on a capital of one hundred dollars, partly 
borrowed) to deal in students' text-books and supplies. 
This firm, Morris & Wilson, lost its senior partner 
when he was graduated in 1892, and since then Mr. 
Wilson has been head of the house, which is now 
an incorporated company. Its cumulative-catalogue 
work dates from 1898, and includes the now well- 
known and, to library workers and book-dealers, 
almost indispensable "Cumulative Book Index," 
"United States Catalogue," and "Readers' Guide 
to Periodical Literature," with an increasing list of 
other bibliographic aids such as "Library Work" 
(now taken over by the "Library Journal"), "Book 
Review Digest," a series of handbooks for debaters, a 
fiction catalogue, and a catalogue of children's books. 
The now large business and large body of employees, 
with their "cafeteria" lunch-room, their annual 
Christmas tree and summer picnic, and their evident 
esprit de corps, make an impressive appearance as 
the outgrowth of that tentative student enterprise of 
two youths working their way through college. 



A MEMORIAL TABLET TO THE AUTHOR OF "THE 

STAR-SPANGLED BANNER" was unveiled, with ap- 
propriate ceremonies, January 11, in the Mt. Vernon 
Place Methodist Episcopal Church, Baltimore, the 
site of the house in which Francis Scott Key died just 
seventy years earlier. The tablet was presented to 
the church by the Baltimore Chapter of the Daugh- 
ters of the American Revolution, and was afterward 
set in its permanent place on the corner of the build- 
ing, facing Charles Street. Mrs. Charles W. Bassett, 
honorary regent of the chapter, conceived and largely 
brought to accomplishment this tribute to Key, and 
the Baltimore sculptor, Mr. Hans Schuler, designed 
the tablet, a medallion portrait set against a partly- 
furled flag, with appropriate inscriptions and orna- 
mentation. In her address Mrs. Bassett called 
attention to the little-remembered fact that the 
Maryland lawyer, poet, and gentleman to whom we 
owe our national anthem, as many call the poem, 
was also a prolific hymn-writer, having produced, 
among others, the hymn beginning, "Lord, with 
glowing heart I praise Thee." 

A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF SHAKESPEARE against 

the assaults of the Baconians died at his home in 
Boston on the thirteenth of January. Judge Charles 
Allen, formerly of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, 
but latterly a gentleman of leisure devoting himself 



to literature and authorship and travel, uttered his 
protest against the Baconian madness in a volume 
modestly entitled " Notes on the Bacon-Shakespeare 
Question," which was published in 1900 and won the 
warm commendation of Sir Henry Irving and others 
whose praise was worth having. Judge Allen, as an 
experienced jurist, naturally devoted himself espe- 
cially to a refutation of the charge that the Shake- 
spearean plays contain such evidences of legal learning 
as Shakespeare could not have possessed. This and 
other points in the controversy are ably, succinctly, 
and interestingly treated. The combined brevity 
and cogency of the argument are in marked contrast 
to the diffuseness and inconclusiveness of the custom- 
ary Baconian contention. Judge Allen had attained 
the ripe age of eighty-five years and nine months 
(lacking four days) when he died. 


NEW BOOKS FOR OLD, if cried through the streets, 
might bring the crier not a few treasures almost 
as precious as Aladdin's wonderful lamp. A hasty 
and afterward much regretted exchange of this sort 
was not long ago made by Sir Herbert Maxwell, as 
report avers; and he is now cautioning others to 
learn a lesson from his experience. Desiring the 
latest edition of a standard work of reference, and 
feeling unwilling to pay out the thirty-five pounds 
demanded for it by the bookseller, he searched his 
library for something to offer in exchange, and 
chanced upon a set of "The Sporting Magazine" 
complete (1793-1870), which he innocently offered 
for the reference work. The offer was accepted 
without delay. Not many weeks afterward he ex- 
perienced a sensation upon reading that a set of the 
periodical in question had just been sold at auction 
for nine hundred and fifty pounds. And now he is 
advising deliberation and care in the weeding out of 
old books from one's library. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



WHY THE DIERESIS AND HYPHEN TO 

INDICATE PRONUNCIATION? 

CTo the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Will you not add your Amen in a tilt against the 
habit of attempting to teach the pronunciation, or for- 
mation, of words by means of the dieresis and hyphen ? 
Authors, editors, typesetters, proofreaders, and even 
general readers, will surely welcome the suggestion. 
Labor and worry will be spared all these classes, and a 
deal of expense to the community will be avoided. 

The dieresis and hyphen are almost the last of some 
five thousand symbols, contractions, or abbreviations of 
words, elisions of suffixes, etc., invented by the copyists 
of the middle ages to save labor and vellum. The 
palimpsest is an eloquent proof that the tax for vellum 
was severely felt. With the exception of a very few 
they suddenly disappeared when printing and paper were 
invented. In the French language a few were retained, 
but it is suggestive that often the modern French author 
does not write them in his copy, but leaves the typesetter 
to put them in according to old custom and rule. His

acute, grave, and circumflex accents indicate quality 
not emphasis, while we long ago gave up both attempts. 
The Germans still retain the umlaut, and we the dier- 
esis, hyphen, and, half ashamed of it, the ligature. This 
last, one may note in passing, by hurry and shortening, 
degenerated long ago into the dieresis and hyphen. We 
English have grown to disuse the ligature except in the 
antique ce and ce, rapidly now and at last passing into 
obsolescence. 

As to the dieresis, it is self-evident that printing is 
one art, pronunciation another, the two at best most 
awkwardly and ineffectively interrelated. The printed 
form of words inevitably drifts into fixedness and uni- 
formity, while pronunciation varies constantly in place 
and time. The labors of the mirthful bands of spelling 
reformers are in proof, and still more, the failure of 
their labors. 

Take a multitude of our words such as cooperate, 
coincide, zoology, zoophilist, reenter, reinter, reiterate, does 
the dieresis or hyphen iu the least aid a person of intel- 
ligence and education to write or pronounce them cor- 
rectly? If so it is plain that the rule should be observed 
in a thousand words not now so marked. Many of these, 
moreover, cannot possibly be given the dieresis, for 
instance, coincide, ptomaine, reiterate, etc., because three 
dots would be required over one i. If, also, the rule is 
necessary in one class of words, it should be in others, 
such as react, to distinguish it from other words of 
similar spelling but pronounced as one syllable. Extra- 
ordinary is another example, and so on indefinitely. Do 
rational folk believe that cooperation needs the dieresis to 
avoid confusion with the idea of the cooper, his barrels, 
or his trade ? A learned bookmaker once so contended. 

The linotype and other typesetting machines have 
recently revolutionized the typographer's business, and 
writers and proofreaders have already been tormented 
by the machines' omission of the dieresis as well, 
also, in the output of a million typewriting machines 
and, if dictionary slaves, they have been compelled 
to order the plaguey dots reinserted by hand. In 
oomycetes, oophorectomy, zoology, and scores more, are we 
in danger of pronouncing the first three or four letters 
as if they constituted one syllable? Gott bewahr! 

Lastly, why persist in the ludicrously unnecessary 
use of the hyphen to hold together parts of words which 
need not and should not be separated either a little or 
wholly ? Proofreaders and editors often seem to think 
that anti, for example, demands the hyphen before it 
can be joined to toxin, while on the same page they will 
omit the Siamese-twin ligament in antipathy, antimony, 
antinomy, and so on. Q^ ]yj Q^

ART IN THE MAGAZINES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the " Century " for January appears a colored 
picture named " The White Rose," after a painting by 
Henry Golden Dearth: one of a series representing mod- 
ern American art. I am assured on the best authority 
that this picture " is representative of one branch of the 
impressionist school," and that Mr. Dearth's work in 
this school " was considered last year the hit of the 
artistic season." So be it; but I do not know how to 
describe the effect it had on me by any word milder 
than disgusting. I felt quite upset for some hours. The 
feelings of a single individual, no expert in artistic mat- 
ters, are of little or no consequence in themselves ; but 
if (it is impossible to be original, even in one's distastes!) 



they are representative of any large body of opinion, or 
especially of any fundamental truths, they may be worth 
taking into account. Even speaking objectively, we may 
venture to maintain that a lady whose mouth, nose, and 
eyes are all awry is contrary to good anatomical princi- 
ples, and take some stand on this point, though our hatred 
of her expression and our abomination for the lurid un- 
natural colors be dismissed as psychological curiosities. 
It is impossible for an English-speaking person who 
reads at all not to feel some sense of proprietorship in 
the " Century." It is one of our great Anglo- American 
institutions, quite as much as if it were a public building, 

nay, more so, since a building cannot be on both sides 
of the Atlantic at once. It has published at different 
times many beautiful pictures, and to this extent has 
contributed to the general taste for good art. It there- 
fore follows that one who is convinced that this and 
other of our standard magazines are giving us some 
essentially bad, and therefore immoral, illustrations, has 
good cause to be alarmed. The particular picture now 
criticized would not be so distressing, were it not an 
extreme example of a general type. 

Our fiction, our drama, our presentation of life in all 
forms, suffers from the same disease. This is, perhaps, 
a desire to cheaply attract notice, a product of our 
modern commercialism. It is not true that all standards 
have been abandoned; on the contrary, the most offen- 
sive products exhibit a large amount of technical skill. 
This skill, however, is considered the chief thing, while 
good taste, based on fundamental morality, is forgotten, 

or perhaps not forgotten because never thought of. 
This description must not be taken as literally applying 
to every case; it merely indicates a tendency, which in 
itself justifies the language used, but which, as a matter 
of fact, varies through all degrees in its intensity. 
Creatures of our age, we who condemn it can perhaps 
not wholly avoid its influence. 

If this point of view is in any degree sound, it is use- 
less to argue that these things are produced because the 
public demand them. Those who control in these mat- 
ters are in the same position as teachers, whose duty it 
is to bring before their classes whatever is good, wise, 
and true. No practical teacher doubts the fact that it 
is more than easy to degrade the tastes and morals of 
his young people, he has seen it done in many a school. 
In the present state of education in this country, our 
adults are as children, the majority of them readily 
responding to degrading influences, while magazine 
literature also reaches the young. 

It has been suggested that we cannot successfully 
combat these tendencies. Whether we can do so depends 
on what we call success. There never will be a time 
when the struggle for good things can be abandoned, 
for lack, if you put it so, of windmills to tilt against. 
In a sense, all attempts at education are doomed to 
failure, but in another sense they are bound to succeed. 

I think it would be very interesting to know how 
" The White Rose," in the " Century," affected a num- 
ber of people. May I, with the Editor's permission, 
ask the readers of THE DIAL to send me postcards 
describing in a few words how the picture affected them 
when first seen? In addition, I should greatly like to 
hear what may be said in its favor by those who think 
well of it. Should I receive a number of communica- 
tions resulting from this request, I will prepare a sum- 
mary or abstract of them for THE DIAL.

THE CONQUEST OF THE SOUTH POLE.* 

Captain Amundsen and his book on " The 
South Pole " make their appearance among us 
at the same time, and both are cordially wel- 
come. The man is of as much interest to us as 
his gallant exploit in the Antarctic regions, and 
his engrossing account of that exploit is both 
a faithful picture of the author himself and a 
modest but detailed representation of the diffi- 
culties and dangers faced and overcome by the 
explorer and his trusty band of followers. 

That within three years of Captain Peary's 
attainment of the northern extremity of the 
earth's axis its southern end would likewise be 
reached, was probably expected by few familiar 
with the history of Polar exploration and the 
considerable intervals commonly separating one 
step of marked advance from the next. And, 
indeed, there is a good deal of what some might 
call lucky accident, but others would more truly 
call intuition and genius, to explain the quick 
following of victory in the South upon the heels 
of success in the North. Captain Amundsen 
was in the very act of preparing for his five- 
year drifting voyage across the North Polar 
Sea, which he still purposes accomplishing, 
when the telegraph flashed the news of the 
North Pole's discovery (if the word "discovery" 
is permissible in this connection), and he at once 
altered his plans, but kept his own counsel in 
the matter, so that not until the good ship 
"Fram" had touched at and departed from 
Funchal on her supposed voyage around the 
Horn to Alaska did he explain to his company 
as a whole that his destination was at the 
antipodes of the one attributed to him. This 
occurred in the summer of 1910. Early in Jan- 
uary of the following year the vessel anchored 
in the Bay of Whales, and after a whiter (our 
summer, of course) in camp at that point the 
polar party made its successful dash to ninety 
degrees south, and was back in camp on the 
twenty-fifth of January, 1912, the exact date 
set down beforehand in the leader's schedule. 

While every part of the programme may 
seem to the hasty reader to have been carried 
out with a happy concurrence of favoring cir- 
cumstances, and the final success may present

itself somewhat in the light of a lucky accident 
so little emphasis does the chronicler lay upon 
his far-sighted plans for the avoidance of un- 
toward conditions a careful study of the nar- 
rative reveals indications of forethought and 
generalship, and of reliance upon the prompt- 
ings of something very like genius, that greatly 
heighten one's admiration for the ability and 
courage of the Norwegian explorer. It was con- 
trary to the apparent teachings of Sir Ernest 
Shackleton's experience for Captain Amundsen 
to make the Bay of Whales his landing point 
and the site of his winter quarters. The great 
southern barrier of ice was supposed to be afloat 
there, with extensive tracts of the bay's borders 
continually crumbling away and drifting sea- 
ward. But by entering this inlet the "Fram" 
would be able to land the explorers nearer their 
destination than would elsewhere be possible, 
the leader had studied the problem and chose 
to take the risks, and the result showed the 
soundness of his judgment. Again, both Captain 
Scott and Sir Ernest Shackleton had declared 
against Eskimo dogs and in favor of Manchu- 
rian ponies as a motive power for the sledges 
in Antarctic exploration. Indeed, a motor car 
was taken along in the Shackleton expedition, so 
little confidence was felt in the traditional method 
of polar sledging. But here, too, the Norwegian 
trusted to his instinct, or to instinct and judg- 
ment combined, and provided himself with a 
hundred picked Eskimo dogs from Greenland, 
though the possibility of transporting them, 
alive and in a condition for service, across the 
equator was derisively denied by the wiseacres. 
It is true that Captain Amundsen was not with- 
out some experience of Antarctic conditions; 
nevertheless he showed remarkable prevision on 
this occasion. In respect to the time allowed 
by him for the work in hand we read in the 
opening pages of his narrative : 

" I worked out the plan as here given, at my home 
on Bundelfjord, near Christiania, in September, 1909, 
and as it was laid, so it was carried out to the last 
detail. That my estimate of the time it would take 
was not so very far out is proved by the final sentence 
of the plan: 'Thus we shall be back from the Polar 
journey on January 25.' It was on January 25, 1912, 
that we came into Framheim after our successful jour- 
ney to the Pole." 

Another rather novel item in the equipment 
of this expedition novel at least to readers 
of American and English accounts of polar 
exploration was the supply of ski instead of 
snowshoes for travel over the great white plains 
in the high latitudes. The advantage of this 
form of foot-gear to the Norwegian, who is used 



90 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



to it from boyhood, is apparent enough. Speed 
and a great extent of bearing surface on yielding 
snow, or on the thin crust bridging a crevasse, 
were thus secured. There were no leads or open 
channels of water to be feared on the final dash 
to the southward, as was the case in Captain 
Peary's strenuous race to the North Pole and 
back, with the ever-present danger of finding 
himself marooned on an ice-floe; but there 
were regions treacherously cut up by concealed 
chasms of unknown depth, over whose frail 
snow-bridges the Norwegian ski could carry a 
man much more swiftly and safely than the 
American snowshoe. 

What the expedition accomplished in addi- 
tion to the attainment of the South Pole should 
not fail to receive mention. While the leader 
with four companions made his dash for the goal, 
Lieutenant Prestrud and two others started on 
an eastward exploring journey to the little- 
known King Edward VII. Land which Captain 
Scott had discovered in 1902. A considerable 
section in the second volume of the book is 
devoted to Lieutenant Prestrud's narrative of 
this expedition and what it accomplished. 
Another section is given up to Captain Nilsen's 
account of what he and his shipmates achieved 
in the way of oceanographic research with the 
stout ship "Fram" during the long winter 
while the land party was reduced to com- 
parative inactivity at Framheim. The south 
Atlantic between Africa and South America 
was traversed and investigated, temperatures 
taken, specimens of the plankton collected, and 
much information added to the world's knowl- 
edge of that part of the ocean. Appended 
papers at the end of the book contain many 
details of meteorology, oceanography, and other 
matters interesting to the student. 

To return for a little to the more popularly 
pleasing sections of the work, one cannot but 
note the buoyant, high-spirited, adventurous 
tone of the narrative as a whole. There is more 
of frolic and fun in Captain Amundsen's pages 
than we are accustomed to in those of his north- 
polar rival, or colleague, Captain Peary which 
is natural enough, in view of the Norwegian's 
comparative youth. The entire expedition 
assumes something of the complexion of a grand 
lark in such passages as the following, which 
takes up the story immediately after the ship's 
destination had been made known to all on 
board, upon her departure from Funchal : 

" It was pure enjoyment to come on deck the morning 
after leaving Madeira; there was an added note of 
friendliness in every man's ' Good-morning,' and a smile 



twinkled in the corner of every eye. The entirely new 
turn things had taken, and the sudden change to fresh 
fields for thought and imagination, acted as a beneficent 
stimulus to those who, the day before, had contemplated 
a trip round the Horn. I think what chiefly amused 
them was their failure to smell a rat before. ' How 
could I have been such an ass as not to think of it long 
ago?' said Beck, as he sent a nearly new quid into the 
sea. Of course, it was as plain as a pikestaff. Here 
we are with all these dogs, this fine "observation 
house," with its big kitchen-range and the shiny cloth 
on the table, and everything else. Any fool might have 
seen what it meant.' I consoled him with the remark 
that it is always easy to be wise after the event, and 
that I thought it very lucky no one had discovered our 
destination prematurely." 

Then followed a great amount of reading-up 
in Antarctic literature on the part of these 
newly-enlightened members of the party. The 
ship's library numbered three thousand vol- 
umes or more, and from Captain Cook to Cap- 
tain Scott the Antarctic voyagers were well 
represented. "I considered it an imperative 
necessity," says oar author, "that every man 
should acquaint himself as far as possible with 
the work of previous expeditions ; this was the 
only way of becoming in some measure familiar 
with the conditions in which we should have to 
work." 

Wintering within the Antarctic Circle, in 
cold immeasurable by ordinary thermometers, 
' and in all but total darkness so far as sunlight 
is concerned, would not seem a very exhilarating 
experience; but the Norwegian party appears 
from the narrative to have taken it much in 
the spirit of a picnic, and to have found an 
abundance of both work and play ready to hand. 
Snow-tunnelling and cave-digging, to enlarge 
the available accommodations for the company 
of nine, occupied considerable time and energy ; 
and there was a great amount of preparation of 
sledges and dog-tackle to fill in spare moments, 
not to mention the daily routine of housework 
and mending or alteration of garments, and 
other humble tasks. The snug quarters at 
Framheim, cheerfully lighted and comfortably 
heated with petroleum, became homelike to the 
occupants, and with unlimited seal steak and an 
abundance of other good provisions the chief 
of the party avowed that he never before had 
lived so well. But now let us turn to some of 
the perils and hardships attending the great 
work of the expedition. After the start for the 
Pole had been made with five men and four 
sledges, trouble was encountered with crevasses, 
which revealed themselves unexpectedly be- 
neath the snow. At one moment a sledge broke 
through and threatened to drag all its thirteen 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



91 



dogs to destruction. But a rope and two pairs 
of strong arms saved the day while a cool- 
headed volunteer climbed down, with another 
rope around his body, to relieve the suspended 
sledge of its load, two of his comrades hauling 
up as he unlashed. 

"These two fellows moved about on the brink of the 
chasm with a coolness that I regarded at first with 
approving eyes. I admire courage and contempt for 
danger. But the length to which they carried it at last 
was too much of a good thing ; they were simply playing 
hide-and-seek with Fate. Wisting's information from 
below that the cornice they were standing on was only 
a few inches thick did not seem to have the slightest 
effect on them ; on the contrary, they seemed to stand 
all the more securely." 

A later passage gives an idea of the sufferings 
caused by the extreme cold and raging winds. 
When the mercury rose to zero, Fahrenheit, the 
hardy Norsemen called the temperature sultry 
and oppressive. We read, for example : 

" The warmth of the past few days seemed to have 
matured our frost-sores, and we presented an awful 
appearance. It was Wisting, Hanssen, and I who had 
suffered the worst damage in the last south-east blizzard ; 
the left side of our faces was one mass of sore, bathed 
in matter and serum. We looked like the worst type 
of tramps and ruffians, and would probably not have 
been recognized by our nearest relations. These sores 
were a great trouble to us during the latter part of the 
journey. The slightest gust of wind produced a sensa- 
tion as if one's face were being cut backwards and for- 
wards with a blunt knife. They lasted a long time, too; I 
can remember Hanssen removing the last scab when we 
were coming into Hobart three months later." 

In making this final dash, Captain Amund- 
sen adopted tactics quite different from Captain 
Peary's in his similar adventure at the North. 
The American had started with five detachments, 
sending back first one and then another until 
he with a single one of his company and four 
Eskimos were left to complete the perilous jour- 
ney. No tents were used, but igloos, or snow 
huts, were built at each stage. The Norwegian, 
on the other hand, pushed on with his original 
party, camped each night, or day, as the case 
may have been, under cover of a tent, celebrated 
(briefly) with his comrades the attainment of the 
Pole, and returned with no loss of life except 
the dogs killed and eaten on the way. The Pole 
was reached on the day planned long beforehand, 
December 14, 1911, and the return to Fram- 
heim, as already noted, was on schedule time. 

Captain Amundsen's book has a fulness and 
variety of interest, and is written in a bright, 
often amusing, style, that distinguish it among 
works of its kind. The translator, too, has 
done his part well. One would not suspect the 
book of being a translation, unless told before- 



hand. The many illustrations, maps, charts, 
and other subordinate features of the work help 
to make it the complete and satisfactory pro- 
duction it is found to be. The author's earlier 
account of his memorable Northwest-Passage 
voyage in the "Gjoa" had aroused expectations 
of a noteworthy book as the literary fruit of this 
more difficult undertaking, and these expecta- 
tions have not been disappointed. 

PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



THE BRILLAT-SAVARIN OF THE DRAMA.* 



When my attention was first attracted to Mr. 
Archer's new book, ostensibly dealing with the 
making of plays, I not unnaturally concluded 
that it would embody rules and precepts for the 
guidance of the beginner, the tyro, who wished 
to be given an adequate recipe for constructing 
a play. Perusal of the work itself quickly dis- 
pels any such notion. The title is at once allur- 
ing and deceptive. The discovery one speedily 
makes is that this is not, in reality, a book for 
the dramatic craftsman. Indeed, the author 
begins with the asseveration that there are no 
rules for the writing of plays, and even disclaims 
writing for the benefit of would-be playwrights. 
Confessedly, he writes for the "many people with 
moderately developed and cultivable faculty"; 
and modestly ventures the hope that "even the 
accomplished dramatist may take some interest 
in considering the reasons for things which he 
does, or does not do, by instinct." 

The reason for all this is not far to seek. Mr. 
Archer is a dramatic critic, concerned with plays 
not as a constructive craftsman, but as an analy- 
tical critic. It is inevitable that his treatment 
parallels the phase of his dominant interest. So 
we actually have, not a book on play-making, 
but an analysis of the made play. In a word, 
we have a book of definitions, of criteria, for 
analyzing plays. The real title of the book, I 
venture to suggest, might more fittingly be, 
"How to Write Good Dramatic Criticism." 

This is not, in any way, to minimize the value 
of the book, but simply to arrive at a just descrip- 
tion of its scope. At the same time, we shall 
find, on further examination, that in analyzing 
the structure of the drama, the author not only 
holds out sane standards for the observation of 
the dramatic critic, but often consciously, more 
often unconsciously, sets up warnings and pre- 
cepts for the instruction of the practicing craf ts-

man. This latter is the role in which Mr. Archer 
shows up to least advantage. Mr. Archer, ac- 
cording to his own admission, is lacking in the 
innate competency of the dramatic craftsman 
which, to be sure, in no sense invalidates his 
conclusions as a critic of the drama. Also, if I 
remember aright, the bureau for the purpose of 
advising budding playwrights, which Mr. Archer 
opened in London, was short-lived. As given 
in the present book, Mr. Archer's advice is, for 
the most part, either too general or too self- 
contradictory to carry with it the momentum of 
constructive helpfulness. An excellent example 
of Mr. Archer's weakness in this department is 
found in the following inimitable specimen of 
innocuous shilly-shally : 

" It might in many cases be wiser to warn the aspir- 
ant to keep himself unspotted from the play-house. 
To send him there is to imperil, on the one hand, his 
originality of vision; on the other, his individuality of 
method. He may fall under the influence of some great 
master, and see life only through his eyes; or he may 
become so habituated to the current tricks of the thea- 
trical trade as to lose all sense of their conventionality 
and falsity, and find himself, in the end, better fitted 
to write what I have called a quack hand-book than a 
living play." 

Apparently, it is the idea that the young aspir- 
ant has no power of originality, no strength of 
individuality, which prompts Mr. Archer's fears. 
Such an intellectual invertebrate as Mr. Archer 
posits may perhaps not be worth while worrying 
over. He goes on, however, to hedge with too 
facile glibness: "It would be ridiculous, of 
course, to urge an aspirant positively to avoid 
the theatre; but the common advice to steep 
himself in it is beset with dangers." It may 
well be that Mr. Archer is thinking of Ibsen ; for 
after a certain point in his career was reached, 
Ibsen absented himself deliberately from all 
contact with the playhouse. It must be clearly 
pointed out, however, as a fact of crucial signifi- 
cance, that Ibsen began his career with the most 
attentive and pertinacious study of all the actual 
details of the theatre, of production, representa- 
tion, the art of acting, in the playhouses of Eu- 
rope, as well as of Norway. It was only after 
he had acquired a mastery of the materials of 
his art, both by practice and by intensive study 
of the theatre itself, that he felt strong enough 
to assert and maintain his independence. 

It is just as well that Mr. Archer did not at- 
tempt to write a book of receipts for play-making. 
It is related of Bronson Howard that, on being 
asked to compile a book of rules for playwriting, 
he declined on the ground that he feared being 
tempted to follow them ! Mr. Archer has done, 



rarely well, something that needed to be done 
for our particular generation : the narration, in 
easily understood terms, of the structural history 
of the play, as it has developed, biologically as 
it were, up to the present time. As Mr. Archer 
wisely says: "One thing is certain namely, 
that if any part of the dramatist's art can be 
taught, it is only a comparatively mechanical 
and formal part the art of structure." Per- 
haps Mr. Archer somewhat underestimates the 
relative importance of the art of structure. Pro- 
fessor Matthews takes the view that anything 
which may be learned can be taught ; and if we 
carry this principle to its logical conclusion, the 
indispensable part of the art of playwriting, 
namely the art of structure, may be taught, 
since it undoubtedly can be and always must be 
learned. Dramatic genius the faculty for situ- 
ation, the sense for character, the stereoscopic 
imagination this is innate, and cannot be ini- 
tially imparted through any system of instruc- 
tion : it can only be strengthened and developed 
through exercise, furnished both by self-acquired 
knowledge of the conditions of dramatic repre- 
sentation and by practice in the making of plays. 
It will be recalled that Ibsen once violently ban- 
ished from his presence a young playwright who 
wished Ibsen to hear the reading of his latest 
play because, forsooth, the nincompoop had 
no scenario ! A study of the various drafts of 
Ibsen's plays, made at different stages in their 
evolution, reveals the truly remarkable way in 
which the structural broadening and deepening 
of the bases of a play forwarded the psychologi- 
cal purposes of the creator of character and the 
master of climax. 

Upon one occasion, Mr. Bernard Shaw was 
asked to define the precepts that govern the 
dramatist in his selection of themes and methods 
of treatment. In his reply to that question, 
which is too long to be quoted here in its en- 
tirety, he shamelessly confesses : " I find myself 
possessed of a theme in the following manner. 
I am pushed by a natural need to set to work 
to write down conversations that come into my 
head unaccountably. At first I hardly know 
the speakers and cannot find names for them. 
Then they become more and more familiar ; and 
I learn their names. Finally I come to know 
them very well, and discover what it is they are 
driving at and why they have said and done the 
things I have been moved to set down." I am 
not to be deceived into thinking this just a piece 
of Shavian fooling ; for I have often seen Mr. 
Shaw at work, in trains and elsewhere, doing 
just what he describes himself as doing. A

THE DIAL, 



series of conversations by imaginary characters 
not even fully individualized is the natural start- 
ing point for the dramas of a play writer who has 
invented the drama of dialectic and has the hardi- 
hood to label a play a " Conversation." A germ 
idea of general significance ; usually arising out 
of an incident in real life, experienced or, as 
Ibsen phrased it, " actually lived through," fur- 
nished the starting point for the majority of 
Ibsen's greatest plays such certainly is the 
evidence furnished by the volumes of his Nach- 
gelassene Schriften. Indeed, nothing so piques 
the fancy as the image of the master craftsman, 
whoever he be, spinning out the threads of his 
creative imagination and weaving the magic pat- 
terns of human life which shall enrapture mul- 
titudes in that palace of light and sound, the 
theatre. A profoundly interesting book on play- 
making yet remains to be written, embodying 
the true relation of the methods actually em- 
ployed by dramatists of rank in the writing of 
their plays. 

The significance of Mr. Archer's book the 
feature which constitutes it a popular substitute 
for any work on the technique of the drama 
now available rests in the fact that it is, for 
the most part, couched in simple and compre- 
hendable terms. It is a sort of Scotch Frey- 
tag, for the " man in the street." Dispensing 
with the horrible jargon of the academic student 
of the drama, Mr. Archer manages to put in all 
the essential facts in regard to structural detail, 
without expressing himself in "hifalutin" 
terms. We cannot blame him for coining the 
word " Peripety " (Greek, peripeteia) to indi- 
cate a complete reversal of fortune ; and we are 
grateful for the skill and perspicuity which char- 
acterize his definitions and distinctions, notably 
the distinction between " character-drawing " 
and ' ' psychology. ' ' Peculiarly clarifying are the 
chapters entitled respectively, " Foreshadowing, 
not Forestalling," and " The Obligatory Scene." 
Much profit may be derived from careful perusal 
of the chapter, " Curiosity and Interest." 

Mr. Shaw and I am sure some incidents 
narrated to me by Madame Ibsen justify the 
implication in regard to Ibsen once defined 
the drama, or at least the temperamental con- 
dition under which drama is created, as " sane 
hallucination." This, however, cannot serve to 
convey any working basis for an adequate de- 
finition of drama. The boldest of Mr. Archer's 
chapters is entitled "Dramatic and Undra- 
matic." Here he tilts squarely against those 
contemporary critics, with Brunetiere at their 
head, who see in drama a clash of contending 



wills. "The theatre in general," said Brune- 
tie"re, " is nothing but the place for the develop- 
ment of the human will, attacking the obstacles 
opposed to it by destiny, fortune, or circum- 
stances." And again, " Drama is a representa- 
tation of the will of man in conflict with the 
mysterious powers or natural forces which limit 
or belittle us ; it is one of us thrown living upon 
the stage, there to struggle against fatality, 
against social law, against one of his fellow- 
mortals, against himself, if need be, against the 
ambitions, the interests, the prejudices, the folly, 
the malevolence of those who surround him." 
Mr. Archer boldly denies that struggle is the 
indispensable differentia of the dramatic form, 
basing his denial upon the difficulty of forcing 
many plays to conform to such confinement of 
definition. He prefers to discover the marrow of 
drama in crisis. Such a definition, interesting 
though it be as a critical tentative, is far less 
comprehensive, it appears on reflection, than the 
definition of Brunetiere. It may be said with 
equal justice that crisis is a defining character- 
istic of the short-story. In the short-story, all 
the lines converge to a predestined end or crisis. 
When that crisis is reached, the story is com- 
plete. Mr. Archer's differentia thus breaks 
down for the drama. On the other hand, some 
of the greatest short-stories in the world are in- 
dependent of any conflict of human wills, and 
so fall outside the definition of drama as posited 
by Brunetiere. A crisis is a turning-point in 
the progress of a series of events ; and is as- 
suredly a concomitant attribute of drama, which 
is a series of events, physical or psychological, 
induced in general by a struggle of wills. In 
other words, Mr. Archer has made the rather 
trivial blunder of choosing for his differentiat- 
ing characteristic merely one phase, the culmi- 
nant phase, of that struggle which he maintains 
is not the quintessential attribute of drama ! 

In recent years, there has been a sharp 
break, among the younger playwrights, away 
from the restrictions of the ancient standards. 
Mr. Granville Barker, whose "The Voysey 
Inheritance" reads like a novel of the mid- 
Victorian era, has proposed the drama of the 
future as one which "leaves Aristotle out." 
So far has this new movement of secession and 
revolt progressed that many dramatic critics of to- 
day, suffering from no obsession by Aristotelian 
definitions, have frankly recognized that the so- 
called "laws" of the drama are nothing more 
than integrated formulations of the prevailing 
practice of dramatists up to any given date in 
the drama's history. There is certainly some-

[Feb. 1, 



thing to startle a Matthews or a Walkley in 
Mr. Archer's statement : " The only really valid 
definition of the dramatic is : Any representa- 
tion of imaginary personages which is capable 
of interesting an average audience assembled 
in a theatre." How broad, how marvellously 
inclusive, is this iconoclastic definition! Un- 
fortunately, Mr. Archer has been guilty of 
another of those lapses in logic which betray 
him always in the hour of his sorest need. 
Clearly, such definition fails to correspond with 
Mr. Archer's former definition of drama as that 
art-form the essence of which is crisis. It is 
patent that there is an infinity of " representa- 
tions of imaginary personages which are capable 
of interesting an average audience assembled 
in a theatre " which yet may be lacking in any 
form of crisis, physical or psychological. Nu- 
merous modern plays do actually interest an 
average audience in a theatre, and yet, it must 
be confessed, betray an almost total deficiency 
in either struggle or, its culminant phase, crisis. 
The genre is found in playwrights so funda- 
mentally dissimilar, in outlook and method, as 
Maeterlinck and Shaw. To be specific, one 
might cite Gorky's " Nachtasyl," Barker's " The 
Madras House," Hauptmann's "Hannele," 
Shaw's Socratic Dialogue in Hades from " Man 
and Superman," and Maeterlinck's "L'Intruse." 

Mr. Granville Barker has recently said in a 
public address which was subsequently printed, 
" A play is anything that can be made effective 
upon the stage of a theatre by human agency." 
This definition, which parallels Mr. Archer's in 
boldness and comprehensiveness of statement, is 
equally inadequate. For it throws into the class 
of the dramatic such a spectacle as a prize-fight. 
By the same token, Mr. Archer's definition per- 
mits the inclusion of so mechanical a perform- 
ance as a moving-picture show, since the films 
are made from photographs of the class which 
Mr. Archer labels "imaginary personages," 
namely, people playing parts in a coherent series 
of concocted events. 

The time is ripe for the critic who will bring 
clarity and convincing statement of the essen- 
tial meaning of the terms " drama " and " dra- 
matic " out of the present welter of confusion 
and chaos. If "dramatic " were accepted as a 
descriptive term for only a certain class of plays, 
and it were acknowledged once for all that there 
are other plays lacking in this specific character- 
istic which are nevertheless highly successful 
upon the stage, from both the artistic and box- 
office standpoints, a much-needed rebuke might 
thereby be given to the academic dogmatism 



which so unrelentingly endeavors to force the 
new art into the mould of antiquated conception. 
The dramatists of the contemporary era have 
constructively demonstrated one tremendously 
significant fact : that a play may be eminently 
successful in stage representation, judged by 
both artistic and commercial standards, and yet 
be intrinsically " undramatic."

THE GREAT HISTORY OF THE PILGRIMS.* 

Governor William Bradford's "History of 
Plymouth Plantation" has been described as 
" the chief book in our New England Old Tes- 
tament." It is the history of Plymouth Colony 
to 1647, a noble record of exile, suffering, 
and triumph. These sturdy, God-fearing Pil- 
grims, after many vicissitudes, crossed the water 
to lay the sure foundations of state ; and the 
human interest of their story, told in the living 
words of a leader, is second only to its historical 
importance. 

Although the "History" remained in manu- 
script for more than two hundred years, it con- 
stitutes the principal part of Nathaniel Morton's 
"New England's Memorial," first published in 
1669, and was also used by later historians 
notably Prince and Hutchinson. The precious 
manuscript was probably taken by an unknown 
person from the Old South Church in Boston 
during the Revolution, and was lost sight of for 
many years. It was thought by some to have 
shared the fate of other documents which were 
at that time carried away or destroyed. But a 
better destiny was in store for the "History," 
so carefully prepared by the second Governor 
of Plymouth Colony ; for it was finally located, 
in 1855, in the Library of the Bishop of Lon- 
don at Fulham. Dr. Charles Deane caused the 
manuscript to be carefully copied, and under his 
able editorial direction it was first printed by 
the Massachusetts Historical Society in 1856, 
with an introduction and notes. The work, how- 
ever, was not very freely annotated, through 
no fault of Dr. Deane, but rather in deference to 
the policy of the Society under whose auspices 
the book was given to the world. A facsimile 
of Bradford's beautiful manuscript in marked 
contrast to the wellnigh indecipherable chiro- 
graphy of his contemporary, John Winthrop,

was published in 1896, with an introduction 
by Mr. J. A. Doyle, who for many years was an 
earnest and able student of our beginnings. In 
1898, the year following the restoration of the 
manuscript by the ecclesiastical authorities of 
England, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
issued the "History" without notes, but with 
preliminary matter respecting the return of the 
document and addresses made upon that happy 
occasion. There was also published, in 1908, 
a reprint edited by the late William T. Davis 
of Plymouth, in the " Original Narratives of 
Early American History " series ; unfortunately, 
however, Mr. Da vis's notes do not adequately 
meet all requirements, to say nothing of im- 
portant omissions from the text. 

It therefore seems both fitting and wise that 
the present edition, in which the text is printed 
in full for the first time, should have been under- 
taken by the learned body that first gave Brad- 
ford in printed form to students of history; and 
wiser that the editing of these volumes was 
intrusted to the competent hand of Mr. Worth- 
ington C. Ford. Justin Winsor has said that, 
in later years, Mr. Deane was urged to recur to 
his work on Bradford's "History," and give a 
new edition "with all the amplitude of his eru- 
dition in commentary and note." While we 
cannot doubt Mr. Deane's great abilities and 
ripe knowledge of early New England history 
for much admirable work stands to his credit, 
he was perhaps, to a degree, disqualified for the 
undertaking by reason of certain mental char- 
acteristics which might have prevented him from 
seeing all things in their true perspective. How- 
ever this may be, one can hardly regret that the 
difficult task of preparing what possibly may be 
termed the final edition of Bradford was reserved 
for the present editor. Mr. Ford possesses the 
learning, the open mind, and the poise necessary 
to accomplish the best results ; and if he did not 
link his name with any other historical work he 
would have earned, by his edition of Bradford 
alone, a permanent place amongst the foremost 
editors of American source books. 

An advisory committee of three was appointed 
by the Massachusetts Historical Society to aid 
Mr. Ford in his work, consisting of Messrs. 
Charles Francis Adams, Arthur Lord, and Gam- 
aliel Bradford, Jr.; and it is safe to assume that 
these gentlemen lent something more than their 
names to the undertaking. Of the three, Mr. 
Adams has had by far the widest experience as 
historian and editor, having edited with great 
scholarship two books of the period covered by 
Bradford's "History" " Antinomianism in the 



Colony of Massachusetts Bay, 16361638 " and 
Thomas Morton's "New English Canaan" in 
addition to much other solid writing. Mr. Lord 
is an authority on Pilgrim history; and Mr. 
Bradford (of the ninth generation from the Gov- 
ernor), best known by his searching studies of 
Confederate leaders, must have taken keen and 
intelligent interest in the work. Mr. Adams, 
as long ago as 1883, expressed himself on the 
propriety of reproducing in print the pecul- 
iarities which abound in seventeenth-century 
manuscripts. Even then he had for years 
wished to see Bradford's "History" in "real 
seventeenth-century dress"; that is to say, as it 
would have come from the press of that day. 
This hope, however, has not been fully realized 
in the present edition, for it appears to have 
been thought best to follow Bradford's orthog- 
raphy, except in a few unimportant particulars. 
This will delight the historical scholar, and at 
the same time will not prove a hindrance to the 
general reader who has recourse to the volumes. 
Fortunately, Bradford's erratic and sometimes 
meaningless punctuation has not in all cases 
been preserved. 

The work is introduced by a brief " Note," 
signed by the Committee of Publication, in which 
it is truly stated that the story of the Pilgrim 
Fathers has been told in all necessary detail ; 
nevertheless, some will regret that the editor 
did not see fit to go over the ground once more 
and trace in a consecutive manner the Pilgrim 
movement. Certainly this would not have formed 
a useless complement to the " History." 

It would be difficult to praise too highly Mr. 
Ford's rich and copious annotation. In this 
respect he has left nothing to be desired. His 
notes, written with admirable lucidity, have been 
prepared with thoroughness and much learning. 
He seems to have overlooked nothing of value 
or interest, and it will perhaps never be neces- 
sary to add much of importance to his labors. 

The edition contains more than two hundred 
finely-executed illustrations many of them 
very rare, consisting of maps, views, fac- 
similes of manuscripts, etc. The frontispiece of 
the second volume is a beautiful reproduction 
of a portrait of Edward Winslow, attributed to 
Robert Walker, from the original in Pilgrim 
Hall at Plymouth, the only authentic likeness 
extant of any of the Mayflower company. In 
no other book of Pilgrim history can there be 
found such wealth of illustrative material. This 
feature of the work is attractive and important. 
The index is excellent. These handsome quarto 
volumes will warm the book-lover's heart. They

are well made in every particular, and will rank 
with the best work of a press which has for 
many years been noted for the superiority of 
its product. 

This edition of Bradford's " History " should 
find its way into every public library of the land, 
where it will not only be available to the student 
and scholar, but also to him who in these days 
of stress and turmoil cares to pause long enough 
to give thought to the old rock from which we 
are hewn. 

It will not be out of place here to say that 
Mr. Ford is said to have edited, in the manner 
of the present reprint of Bradford, an edition 
(soon to appear) of Governor John Winthrop's 
" Journal." Winthrop heretofore has had only 
two editors worthy of the name, Mr. James 
Savage, for many years the honored President of 
the Massachusetts Historical Society, and Dr. 
James K. Hosmer. Mr. Savage, however, though 
thoroughly steeped in the lore of his subject, 
was nevertheless far from being an ideal editor ; 
but withal he was distinctly and racily individ- 
ual. Dr. Hosmer's work is excellent, but not 
full enough to make it the final word. The 
Massachusetts Historical Society is indeed for- 
tunate in being able to connect its name with 
two great books, which will be read for all time, 
or at least as long as there shall survive an 
interest in the beginnings of this nation.

ANDREW LANG'S LAYING OF THE 
BACONIAN BOGIE.* 



Andrew Lang's book on the Baconian myth 
is his latest and we fear last service to litera- 
ture, though so versatile and industrious a 
writer may well have left other surprises behind 
him. Never, perhaps, in his career has he ex- 
hibited more engagingly his special qualities, 
his literary passion, his loyalty, and his light 
and dexterous handling of really wide scholar- 
ship. His book ought to be the last word on 
the subject ; but that, alas, is not to be hoped. 
The last word in this matter has been said before, 
by Richard Grant White, by Mr. Dowden, 
and by others. This is one of those questions 
where reason and authority speak in vain ; the 
realization of which fact leads to exasperation. 
Mr. Lang, for instance, begins in perfect tem- 
per, with courtesy and Christian charity ; he 
ends somewhat in the state depicted by " Punch " 

* SHAKESPEARE, BACON, AND THE GREAT UNKNOWN. 
By Andrew Lang. Illustrated. New York : Longmans, 
Green, & Co. 



in its study of " a gentleman disturbed by a blue 
bottle fly." What are you going to do with a 
theory that evades evidence, defies logic, and re- 
fuses to accept the credibilities of human nature? 
Against the Pyrrhonic attitude nothing can be 
proved. Archbishop Whately wrote " Historic 
Doubts about Napoleon Buonaparte." Suppose 
a case is tried where a witness for the defense 
swears that A is A ; and the opposing counsel 
blandly remarks to the jury : " Yes, I know he 
says so, but what he really means is that A is 
B." Another person deposes that he believes 
white to be white, and the same counsel declares 
that it is perfectly clear that he harbors a mental 
reservation that white is black. Then a witness 
is examined who is qualified by long acquaint- 
ance, comradeship, and rivalry to speak of the 
defendant, and who does speak of him again and 
again, sometimes in criticism, sometimes in un- 
bounded eulogy. The lawyer for the plaintiff 
listens and then smilingly declares that all this 
is only " Fanny's way," that it is quite evident 
that the gentleman has his tongue in his cheek ; 
that the very gruffness of his growling at and the 
ardor of his championship of one man, the per- 
fect applicability of every fact he adduces to 
him and to no other, is proof positive that it is 
another whom he is referring to all the time. 
This is a fair statement of the attitude of the 
latest anti-Shakespeareans. The mind reels at 
such treatment of the verities. Argument is 
impossible. All the external evidence and 
practically all the internal probability in the 
case are on one side. The Baconian or anti- 
Shakespearean theory is nothing but a suspicion 
backed up by a sneer. 

Mr. Lang does not trouble to treat of the 
crop of cryptogrammic phantasies of the past. 
These the neo- Baconians have themselves rele- 
gated to the limbo of the forgotten. Nor does 
he go into the so-called parallelisms of phrase 
between Shakespeare and Bacon. Richard Grant 
White and Mr. Dowden have thoroughly dis- 
posed of these. He dismisses any resemblances 
of thought as being part of the property of the 
age ideas in the air. It would not be difficult 
to make out a case for Charles Darwin's author- 
ship of " In Memoriam " and the early poems 
of Tennyson. As for basic philosophy, Shake- 
speare and Bacon are in antithesis. The one 
was an idealist and pessimist, the other an utili- 
tarian and optimist. Mr. Lang declines also to 
express an opinion as to Shakespeare's legal 
learning. He delivers him over to the lawyers, 
who, he says, agree as to the accuracy of Shake- 
speare's law allusions. Accurate they may be, 



1913] 



THE DIAL,

but they are drawn from a slender stock of 
knowledge. Shakespeare certainly did not know 
Littleton's " Institutes " or the earlier treatises 
of Bracton and Fleta. And these were the 
English law authorities of his day. When in 
1616, the year of Shakespeare's death, Ben 
Jonson published his " Works," he was univer- 
sally laughed at and regarded as an intruder in 
literature. 

"The silence about Shakespeare," that is 
one of the pet superstitions of the Baconians. 
Mr. Lang has no trouble in showing that we 
know more about Shakespeare than about the 
majority of the authors of that age. Here and 
there a man like Ben Jonson, who had the 
modern advertising instinct, or one like Mar- 
lowe, who got himself into picturesque embroil- 
ments, made his personality felt ; but in the main 
the Elizabethan literary group is a congregation 
of shadows. This is largely true of the men who 
were really considered poets in that day, 
Spenser, Daniel, Drayton. Playwrights were 
but little regarded. 

But, as Mr. Lang says, "Impossible" is the 
banner word of the anti-Shakespeareans. It is 
"impossible" that one of Shakespeare's birth 
and bringing-up should have risen to such 
heights ! Why ? Probably a good third of the 
greatest men of all time have come up from 
beginnings more inauspicious than were those 
of Shakespeare. To name only three English 
writers who have something of parity with 
Shakespeare in their genius, Burns, Keats, 
and Dickens came from a lower social strata, 
and had comparatively less opportunity for edu- 
cation than Shakespeare. When someone asked 
the elder Dickens where his son had been edu- 
cated, he answered, "Why ah, you may say, 
sir, that Charles educated himself." Latin was 
the only gate to learning in Shakespeare's time. 
There was a good Latin school at Stratford. 
Up to the time that Shakespeare was thirteen or 
fourteen his father was well-to-do one of the 
leading men of the village. If his son did not 
attend the school, whose sons did? But learning 
is a good deal like vaccination it may take or 
it may not. Or it is like the Scripture parable 
of the Sowing of the Seed, some of which fell 
on good ground and returned a hundred fold, 
and some of which fell on stony ground and did 
not come up at all. Granting the fertility of the 
ground, little seed might produce a great harvest. 
If Shakespeare was Shakespeare, it is hard to 
see what better preparation he could have had 
for the work he was to do. To spend his early 
years in rural England, in daily experience of 



those country scenes, customs, and characters 
which crowd his plays, and then at twenty-one 
or so to go up to the university of London life, 
with just enough schooling to appreciate and 
profit by the society into which he was thrown 
and the books by which he was surrounded, 
does not this seem far more consonant with the 
throb and vividness of the world which the plays 
exhibit than an exclusively scholastic training ? 
To seek for accurate and thorough scholarship 
in Shakespeare is, in Tennyson's phrase, "to 
milk a he-goat." 

Mr. Lang devotes a chapter to the First Folio. 
There are said to be twenty thousand palpable 
errors in this volume, besides a larger number 
of mere typographical slips. Bacon corrected his 
own works carefully enough. Did he who prized 
the "New Atlantis" and the "Apothegms" so 
highly, think the plays (assuming them for the 
moment to be his) unworthy of the slightest 
over-seeing ? The Baconians assert that he hired 
Ben Jonson to attend to this; but Jonson was 
too good a workman to have had a hand in such 
a mess as the first folio. A new theory is that 
the plays are the work of "a Great Unknown," 
neither Shakespeare nor Bacon, who, indifferent 
to money or fame, unrevealed to actors or pub- 
lic, took the trouble to go through all the stages 
of a playwright's novitiate and practice, and in 
the end was so sublimely careless as to let his 
works be published in such a shocking way. 
Stat magni nominis umbra. 

In his chapter on " The Preoccupations of 
Bacon," Mr. Lang gives a view of the business 
of this man's life a life so full and varied that 
James Spedding, who knew it best, said : " I 
think I am in a position to state that Lord Bacon 
did not write the plays." Mr. Lang refuses, 
however, to set any limits to the powers of gen- 
ius, whether in Shakespeare or Bacon. Genius, 
indeed, can do much. Bolivar in one of his cam- 
paigns captured a fleet of gunboats in a river 
by a charge of cavalry. If Bacon had stopped 
with his philosophical treatises, his essays, even 
his history, it would have been impossible to 
say what he might or might not have done in 
pure literature. But he furnished evidence 
against himself. He tried to write poetry, he 
tried to write a romance, he tried to retell 
humorous and witty stories. He did all these 
things so badly that to credit him with creative 
imagination or poetic expression is mere folly. 
In these matters he is like an elephant trying to 
play the part of an Ariel. 

It is impossible to do justice to all the points 
at issue which Mr. Lang meets and discusses.

[Feb. 1, 



The general aspects of the argument are all that 
we can attend to, but as far as we can see he 
weaves his minute web of scholarship without 
flaw. He writes as one of those who know, 
and, as he says in his opening paragraph, " the 
Baconian theory is universally rejected in En- 
gland by the professors and historians of English 
literature, and generally by those who have no 
profession save that of Letters." The same can 
probably be said for America. In other words, 
it is rejected by all those who are competent to 
judge. 

The conclusion of the whole matter but we 
fear there can be no conclusion, no speedy one 
at least. A vagary, a heresy has entered the 
world. It appeals to the iconoclasm innate in 
many minds, and it appeals somewhat to class 
prejudice. It will have to work itself out, as 
heresies do. We are sometimes told that having 
the Shakespearean work, it really does not mat- 
ter to the world who created it. Well, it is a 
poor world which refuses gratitude and honor 
to its greatest. And if robbing a writer of 
his reputation becomes the fashion it will react 
on the literary creators to come. Foolishly or 
not, an author is usually buoyed up by the hope 
of influence and remembrance. If he finds that 
he may be frustrate of the future, may very 
probably be cheated of his fame, he may turn 
his energies to other work, or do only what will 
suffice for his own day. 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



THE PHILOSOPHY OF WALKING.* 

The true devotee of walking, if he happens 
also to possess the knack of writing, will sooner 
or later betray his own most cherished prin- 
ciple. He knows beyond all other knowledge 
that walking is a gift of the gods, to be rever- 
ently enjoyed and not to be chattered about ; he 
realizes to the full the profanity of staining with 
inky words those memories of sun-saturated and 
wind-swept days that have been his upon the 
open road. But the very ardor of his gratitude 
for that high gift, the very intensity of his 
enthusiasm inspired by those beatific memories, 
seem to impel him irresistibly to utterance ; and 
sooner or later he becomes aware of something 
before him, the work of his own impious hand, 
a poem or an essay, perhaps even a book, in 
celebration of the mystic joys of the road. 

The latest of such apostates is Mr. Arthur 

* WALKING ESSAYS. By Arthur Hugh Sedgwick. New 
.York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



Hugh Sedgwick, the greatest, also, we might 
say, for his sin extends to an entire volume of 
duodecimo proportions. But Mr. Sedgwick is 
no callous or unconscious offender: he pleads 
guilty at the very outset, and makes a penitent 
appeal for absolution, in the form of a neatly- 
rhymed dedication. Here are two of its nine 
stanzas : 

" How vain my effort, how absurd, 

Considered as a symbol! 
How lame and dull the written word 

To you the swift and nimble ! 
How alien to the walker's mind, 

Earth-deep, heaven-high, unfillable, 
These petty snarls and jests ill-laid 
And all the profitless parade 
Of pompous polysyllable ! 

" But yet, I feel, though weak my phrase 

My rhetoric though rotten, 
At least our tale of Walks and Days 

Should not go unforgotten; 
At least some printed word should mark 

The walker and his wanderings, 
The strides which lay the miles behind 
And lap the contemplative mind 

In calm, unfathomed ponderings." 

All this is too deprecatory. There is really noth- 
ing whatever of the petty or the pompous in 
Mr. Sedgwick's pages, and his rhetoric is unim- 
peachable. Indeed, of all the fine fellows, from 
Hazlitt to Mr. Belloc, who have written of walk- 
ing, few have shown a neater facility of composi- 
tion, a fuller flavor of wit and high spirits, or a 
closer philosophic grasp of the subject. And it 
should be remembered that Mr. Sedgwick has 
had to sustain his pitch through eight chapters, 
whereas the others wrote only a single essay 
apiece. 

In his first paper, on " Walking and Conver- 
sation," while reasserting the basic truism that 
walking and talking are wholly incompatible, 
Mr. Sedgwick refutes for all time the superficial 
corollary that walkers are therefore by tempera- 
ment a morose and unsocial tribe. 

" Nothing can be further from the truth. Only by 
construing sociability in the very narrow sense of com- 
pliance with current social conventions, can you justify 
such a position; and even so, I would ask, are walkers 
the only men who have ever omitted calls or trifled with 
dance invitations? But if sociability is taken in its true 
sense as indicating a friendly attitude of mind, I say 
there is more of it between two walkers treading the 
eighteenth mile without a word spoken, than between 
any two diners-out talking twenty-four to the dozen, as if 
there were a tax on unaccompanied monologue, and a 
graduated super-tax on silence. When put to the ulti- 
mate test of fact this becomes clear. If you have walked 
with a man you will lend him tobacco, half-a-crown, nay, 
you will lend him your map; if you have only dined with 
him, I doubt if you would lend him a silk hat." 

Closely related in substance to this essay is 



1913]

that on "Walking as a Social Form." Con- 
scious of the fact that the walking fraternity 
pursue their joys under the shadow of a certain 
stigma, as enemies in a way to the recognized 
social forms dancing, teas, calls, dinners, and 
what not, Mr. Sedgwick proceeds to a close 
philosophic analysis of social forms in general. 
The result of his investigation is as revolution- 
ary and liberating to the walker as are the con- 
clusions of M. Bergson to the ordinary mortal. 
Instead of a cringing apologia or a dogmatic 
defiance, as were hitherto his only resources 
against the taunts of dancers and diners and 
tea-bibbers, the walker may now triumphantly 
refute the validity of that "futile decalogue of 
mode" to which society has so long given its 
sanction, and point with serenity to the not 
distant day when walking will be popularly re- 
garded as the only authentic expression of the 
social spirit. 

Greatly daring, though not without reluctance 
(for " controversy of any kind is naturally repug- 
nant to the amiable nature of a walker "), Mr. 
Sedgwick devotes a chapter to " Walking Equip- 
ment." Here are revived some mighty questions 
which have split the ranks of walkers from time 
immemorial, questions such as those of high 
shoes versus low, long trousers versus short, 
hats versus no hats, or (turning to the internal 
needs of man) of meat versus vegetables, beer 
versus water, and so on. Then there are the 
finer philosophic distinctions, such as the con- 
figuration of coats, the functions of waistcoats, 
the necessity of ties, and the moral value of 
walking sticks. Within this bristling palisade 
of problems Mr. Sedgwick walks with fine tact 
and conciliatory discretion ; though he does 
not hesitate upon occasion to record his own 
convictions, as witness the spirited denuncia- 
tion of beer. (It must be owned, however, that 
the force of this diatribe is much weakened by 
a prefatory note disclaiming any application of 
the remarks to Munich beer.) 

We wish that space were available for some 
indication of the wealth of good things in Mr. 
Sedgwick's other chapters, in that on" Walker 
Miles," the humble cicerone of Surrey highways 
and field-paths; on "Walking and Music," in 
which the iconoclastic digression on dancing is 
the best part; on "Walking in Literature," 
where we rejoice to see justice at last done to 
that " living embodiment of all that is best in 
walking," Vernon Whitford ; on " Walking 
Alone," with particular reference to walking in 
London ; and, finally, on " Walking, Sport and 
Athletics." But we can do no more than quote 



this concluding apostrophe of the essay last- 
named : 

" Poor, ill-used, neglected, misunderstood body ! Our 
ancestors soddened you with port: our grandfathers 
overlooked you while they muddled with the soul and 
mind which are bound up with you: ascetics starved 
you and hedonists cultivated you in patches: doctors 
analysed you till there was nothing left but a catalogue 
of inanimate fragments: economic forces penned you in 
dens and prisons : fashion clothed you in impossible gar- 
ments, and kept you up at hours and in atmospheres 
which outraged your most sacred instincts. And now I 
make you sit here writing writing! For heaven's sake, 
come out for a walk." 

It would be rather distressing to have to con- 
template the mental equipment of any true 
" companion of the boot " who did not find 
infinite relish in Mr. Sedgwick's pages. Many 
of the walking tribe will, with the reviewer, lay 
the book down at last in a mood of exalted satis- 
faction comparable only to that which comes to 
one after a long day's tramp in the open, when, 
over tea and a pipe in one of those enchanted 
gardens that hide so unsuspectedly behind the 
dusty road-fronts of certain well-remembered 
English inns say the " Burford Bridge " at 
Dorking or the "Rothay " at Grasmere one 
muses in vacuous complacency over the rosy 
aspect of things in general, and the celestial 
pleasures of walking in particular.

RECENT FICTION.* 

Mr. Theodore Dreiser has been long-winded 
enough in his two previous performances, but in 
his third novel, "The Financier," he has carried 
analysis and amplification to an extreme hitherto 
unattained. There are nearly eight hundred pages 
in this book, and the story that they tell might have 
been more effectively set forth with half the number 
of words. He cannot introduce a new character, of 
however minor significance, without telling us all 
about him, or a new situation without enveloping it 
in a cloud of comment and exposition. The details 
of Cowperwood's stock manipulations are explained 
in a manner that may be interesting to stock- 
brokers, but are unspeakably wearisome to the 
reader who is impatient for action and results.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



When the financier is on trial for embezzlement, we 
are given all the steps of the legal procedure, and 
even the twelve good men and true who act as 
jurors in the case are individually characterized. 
The fault of over-elaboration is much more grievous 
than it was in the case of Mr. White's "A Certain 
Rich Man," which the present novel resembles in 
both theme and construction. Mr. Dreiser gives us 
truth, no doubt, and in that fact is the defence of 
his method, but it is truth in conglomerate chunks 
such as the literary artist is under bonds to dispense 
with. Cowperwood, the chief figure in this narra- 
tive, is described as a man who "never gave a 
thought to the vast palaver concerning evil which 
is constantly going on." He is utterly without 
moral sense, and devoid of any principle other than 
expediency. Born in Philadelphia in the thirties, 
the son of a bank officer, his attention is early fixed 
upon the financial game, and he determines as a 
boy to get into it. While still at school, he carries 
out certain sharp business transactions, and thereby 
gets his start. After various experimental sallies, he 
gets into the stock exchange, and enters upon his 
real career. Every trick of manipulation seems to 
come to him intuitively, and he becomes an adept at 
juggling with values. He makes a specialty of trac- 
tion stocks, and drags the city treasurer a weak 
creature into his toils, acting as agent for the city 
loan, and borrowing the city funds to use in his specu- 
lative enterprises. His undoing comes with the Chi- 
cago fire of 1871 and the ensuing panic, and with 
the simultaneous exposure of his liaison with the 
daughter of an Irish contractor who has befriended 
him. The whole rotten situation is brought to light, 
and he is pursued both by the public clamor that de- 
mands a scapegoat and by the private vengeance of 
the outraged father. In spite of every legal subtlety 
that can be employed in his favor, he becomes a 
bankrupt and a convict with a prison sentence of 
several years. The actual term is cut short to about 
a year by means of a pardon, and Cowperwood, a 
free man, finds in the panic of 1873 and the failure 
of Jay Cooke & Co. the occasion for rehabilitating his 
fortunes through his knowledge of the stock market. 
Then he starts for the West to build up a new career 
in Chicago. Getting his wife to consent to a divorce, 
he takes his paramour with him, and there the story 
ends. Those who are familiar with the financial his- 
tory of recent times know what followed, for, while 
the study of Cowperwood is doubtless not an exact 
portrait, it presents so many points of similarity to 
the figure of a notorious buccaneer of recent days 
that the reader early entertains a suspicion of his 
identity. It becomes more than a suspicion when 
we read this note of his life in the penitentiary. 
"Every evening he had studied the sky from his 
narrow yard, which resulted curiously in the gift in 
later years of a great reflecting telescope to a famous 
university." The word "reflecting" may be inten- 
tional, but we imagine it to be a slip of a sort which 
the author frequently makes, as when (about 1840) 



Cowperwood is made to learn the difference between 
a state bank and a national one. One of the noticeable 
characteristics of the novel is a certain slovenliness 
both in the use of language and in the statement of 
fact. The following instances may be adduced : "The 
great Chicago fire, October 7th, 1871, . . . began 
on Saturday, October 7th, and continued apparently 
unabated until the following Wednesday." The fire 
began on Sunday evening, the 8th, and had spent 
its fury early Tuesday morning. Our other instance 
is in this description of a waltz: "He had put his 
hand to her waist. His right arm held her left ex- 
tended arm to arm, palm to palm. Her right hand 
was on his shoulder, and she was close to him, looking 
into his eyes." A waltz according to these specifica- 
tions would excite much admiration in the onlookers. 
The author of "The Financier" is committed to a 
method of unflinching realism which makes such an 
absurdity as this unusually conspicuous. His realism 
also leads him, on at least two occasions, to forget 
all the claims of reticence in dealing with the rela- 
tions between men and women. And we must say 
that the minute description of the costume worn by 
Cowperwood's paramour, given us whenever she 
makes an appearance, is calculated to get on the 
reader's nerves. 

Mr. Rex Beach has taken for the subject of his 
new novel the New Orleans riots some twenty years 
ago, the disturbances which subjected a number of 
Italians to the summary process of lynch law, and 
caused international complications, the echoes of 
which have not yet died away. To this theme as a 
climax he works up, beginning his tale in Sicily 
several years earlier, with the brutal assassination of 
a young landed proprietor, just about to become a 
bridegroom, through the agency of the Mafia. His 
betrothed, maddened by her bereavement, vows ven- 
geance, and her cause is also taken up by the Amer- 
ican friend of the murdered man, who has come to 
Sicily for the wedding. Then the scene shifts to 
New Orleans, where the American has his home, 
and whither the criminals flee for a refuge. The 
girl simply blots herself out of existence, becoming a 
nurse in a religious house in New Orleans, and even 
her collaborator in the plan of vengeance does not 
suspect that she is living in his own city. Then a 
series of crimes, presumably attributable to Italians, 
arouse New Orleans to indignation, and Blake be- 
comes instrumental in bringing them home. Build- 
ing better than he knows, he discovers that he has 
unearthed the man who had been guilty of the 
Sicilian crime of years ago, and reveals a wealthy 
and respected Italian merchant of the city as the 
secret head of the Mafiosi. Then comes the trial, 
in which a pusillanimous jury does not dare to con- 
vict, although the evidence furnishes unquestionable 
proof of guilt. The sequel is what history records, 
and, although we are no apologists for lynch law, it 
must be admitted that the author makes a case that 
works upon our sympathies. The whole story is 
melodrama of the better sort, moving steadily and

relentlessly to its tragic predetermined close. It is 
admirable in its construction, and every episode fits 
logically into the plot. Not upon a single page does 
the interest flag, and the situation is kept tense 
all the time. Moreover, the author displays more 
knowledge of life and more evident powers of char- 
acterization than we have hitherto found in his 
romantic inventions. In the end, Blake marries 
the girl, which has been a foregone conclusion all 
the time. 

When Kirby Trask starts from somewhere in the 
middle West to conquer the world, he takes with 
him the memory of a successful college career fol- 
lowed by a brief reportorial experience, and a letter 
of introduction to the magnate who controls the steel 
trust. The letter does him no particular good, but 
he has industry and willingness, and he obtains and 
holds several unpromising jobs until he feels himself 
on his feet. Eventually, he succeeds to the position 
of the steel trust magnate by the romantic process 
of winning the latter's daughter. He does not do 
anything in particular to deserve such a spectacular 
success, and when the story ends, he is well on the 
way to develop into the same sort of cold-blooded 
and unscrupulous man as the one who has unwill- 
ingly taken him for a son-in-law. The story of his 
rise to power is unconvincing, because it does not 
appear to be a triumph of either business genius or 
moral endowment. It is for the most part a " fluke," 
and there is about it no touch of that idealism which 
we have a right to expect in stories of the present 
sort. This rather unwholesome story is the work 
of Mr. James Oppenheim, and its title is "The 
Olympian." It is realistic and in many ways vital, 
but is rather common and uninspired in treatment. 

"A Comedy of assumptions" is Mr. Maurice 
Hewlett's description of "Mrs. Lancelot," his latest 
novel in the Meredithian manner. Among the 
assumptions not specified, which however are borne 
in upon the reader's consciousness, are the identities, 
respectively, of the heroine (here called Georgiana) 
with Sanchia, and of her poet-lover with Senhouse. 
As for the Duke of Devizes, we are compelled to think 
of him as no other than the Iron Duke, because the 
time of the story is that of the Reform Bill agitation, 
and there is no other possible Duke of that time whom 
we could invest with the powers and the qualities 
here attributed to the figure of Mr. Hewlett's por- 
trayal. The Duke's infatuation for Mrs. Lancelot fits 
perfectly with that well-known trait of his character 
which made him silly in the presence of a petticoat, 
and there is a certain piquancy in finding him here 
presented as the poet's rival for the affections of 
Sanchia-Georgiana. Mr. Lancelot is a third contest- 
ant for that prize, but being merely her husband, and 
a person so mean-spirited as to seek advancement 
through his wife's influence with the Duke, he gets 
considerably less than a third share of our sympathies, 
since we feel that he has brought the pangs of j ealousy 
upon himself. The story is animated by a spirit of 
delicious comedy, and is notable for its psychological 



discernment. But we must confess that the material 
is thin, and that the story (considered merely as such) 
drags not a little toward the end. 

Mr. Warwick Deeping is a novelist whose work 
is always interesting ; his situations are well con- 
ceived and firmly handled. It is not, then, greatly 
to his disparagement to say that " The Strong 
Hand " is an inferior example of his work. His 
story is that of an enemy of the people in Ibsen's 
sense the story of a physician in a country town, 
who sets the respectable villagers by the ears when 
he pokes into their wells and drains, and discloses 
the most shocking conditions of sanitation. The 
hero of this crusade is a young surgeon who comes 
to the village as assistant to the doddering old practi- 
tioner in whose hands the health of the community 
has hitherto been trusted. The practical investiga- 
tions and the blunt speech of the new-comer soon get 
him into opposition with his chief, and into disfavor 
with the propertied classes. It takes the horrors of 
an epidemic to show that he has been a prophet and 
to justify his actions. Meanwhile, dismissed from 
his post, he is forced to fight single-handed for 
decent conditions, and gains his ends only after a 
hard struggle. His triumph is a little qualified, for 
toward the end he is forced to make the hard choice 
between the claims of love and of duty, and love gets 
rather the better of it, thereby weakening his sense 
of responsibility, and making him a little less than 
the moral hero he has set out to become. 

" I had the mind of a monk, and you have put the 
passion of a man into me." This may be taken as 
the text or the programme of " The Lure of Life," 
the new novel by Mr. and Mrs. Castle. It is the 
story of a student, unexpectedly come into possession 
of fortune and ancestral acres, who is turned from 
the ways of scholarship by the attractions of a house- 
hold upon a neighboring estate. It is a Belgian 
household, established in England for a part of the 
year, and it consists of the Count and Countess de 
Braye and their niece Solange de Flodore. It is the 
Countess for whom Sir Ughtred first conceives a 
passion, although she is many years his senior, but 
he thinks to discern in her a soul-mate, until he 
makes the alarming discovery that she is only philan- 
dering with him, and she is by nature a mangeuse 
d'dmes, winning men's devotion for the zest of the 
sport, with no idea of playing the game to the limit. 
The complication resulting from this sentimental 
adventure leads him into a mariage de convenance 
with Solange, a farouche creature who has flouted 
him, but with whom he discovers himself on the 
honeymoon to be as deeply in love as the most 
sentimentally-minded young reader could wish. The 
story is wholly artificial, and, as knowledge of its 
authorship would lead one to suspect, positively reek- 
ing with sentimentality. It sets us wishing, as Mrs. 
Glyn's " Halcyone " did, that lady-novelists would 
not attempt to rhapsodize about Greek art and the 
Greek spirit; they do it so badly.

[Feb. 1, 



BRIEFS oisr NEW BOOKS. 



TWO French voluraes dealing respectively 

masters of the with Puvis de Chavannes and Edou- 
present day. ar( j Manet inaugurate a new art 
series, entitled " French Artists of To-day " (Lip- 
pincott), which promises to prove useful to Amer- 
ican lay readers as an introduction to contemporary 
French art. Paris is at present the eye of humanity, 
the place where fresh discoveries in vision and ex- 
periments in expression are most constantly being 
made, the most highly energized and vitalized centre 
of artistic production in the modern world. It is fit- 
ting that a set of handbooks interpreting to us a little 
of this intense creative activity should begin with 
studies of the two men who perhaps more than any 
others are responsible for the enthusiasm and the 
direction of its progress. Puvis de Chavannes and 
Edouard Manet, different as they were in experience 
and in method of expression, were alike in courage, 
in sincerity, and in power of inspiring their disciples. 
Puvis de Chavannes began his work much more imi- 
tatively than Manet, his early pictures as repro- 
duced here show little differentiation from the suave 
commonplaces of the academicians ; but he outgrew 
his training, he dared to analyze his own impres- 
sions at first-hand and to translate into quietly simple 
and exquisite idyls the results of his steady contem- 
plation of nature. There is something of Corot in 
him and something of Maeterlinck; not that his con- 
ceptions are not above all his own (the great series 
of frescoes in the Pantheon is original in every sense 
of the word), but it is easier in Puvis de Chavannes's 
work to find echoes of artistic influences than it is 
in such painting as Manet's. " I am myself alone," 
shrieked Manet in the face of his first mystified and 
disgusted public, as he presented to them veracious 
bits drawn from his own immediate surroundings. 
He chose to paint the actualities of city life and 
character, refusing to sentimentalize them as Dumas 
fils was doing in his plays, or, like Chavannes, to 
withdraw from them into woods and fields peopled 
by his transforming imagination. Look first at 
" Olympia," wonderful, tarnished, real creature of 
the cynical Paris streets that she is, and then turn 
to the nymphs of "The Sacred Wood," and you have 
the difference between the two men, the difference, 
moreover, between the pragmatist and the idealist 
in art to-day and every day. One kind of vision is 
as true and as fruitful as the other, certainly in the 
immediate instance each has proved as stimulating 
to the sight and imagination of the generation now 
working as the other, and both have pointed towards 
equally fresh possibilities in their medium. These 
little books will perform a valuable service if they 
rouse interest in such creators as Chavannes and 
Manet and their followers. Whether the black and 
white and not always very distinct illustrations, 
numerous and well-chosen though they are, can sug- 
gest at all adequately originals so remarkable for 
color, is more than a question ; Claude Monet and 
the later impressionists would surely lose most of 



their charm in similar reproductions. Yet the vol- 
umes pretend only to be introductory to a large field 
of study, and for that purpose they furnish necessary 
machinery ; the introductions and notes, translated 
from the French of excellent critics like Andre" 
Michel and Louis Hourticq, are refreshingly enthu- 
siastic and undidactic, and biographical and biblio- 
graphical details are sufficiently indicated. 

Whatever may be one's philosophical 
cMn e se f wo m en. presuppositions as to the relative 

excellence of Buddhism, Confucian- 
ism, Taoism, and Christianity, one can scarcely lay 
down Miss Margaret E. Burton's little volume, 
"Notable Women of Modern China" (Revell), 
with any heart left to quarrel with the missions that 
have produced these particular specimens of modern 
women. The book consists of sketches of the lives 
and characters of six Chinese women, all of them 
Christians. Three of the women are physicians, one 
is the widow of a mandarin of high rank, one was a 
teacher, and one a former Taoist nun. The sketches 
vary somewhat in interest, but no one of them is 
lacking in value as a document to those who desire 
to weigh dispassionately the achievement of Chris- 
tian missions in China. Readers who are at all 
familiar with the Chinese race will not be wholly 
surprised by the remarkable charm and attractive- 
ness of nature attributed to all the women depicted, 
but few will be prepared to discover in a Chinese 
woman capacity and ability of such extraordinary 
degree as seem to be possessed by two or more of 
the subjects of the volume, notably by Miss Mary 
Stone, the Kiukiang physician. The Chinese are 
frequently called a passive race, capable of moving 
only in masses, and wholly deficient in initiative. 
Either the characterization fails to take account of 
the influence of environment, and of the change in 
race habits with the change in environment, or else 
the Christian religion begets traits contradictory of 
the habits of the race to which the individual belongs. 
Only in one of these two ways can we account for 
the initiative and individuality which characterize 
the subjects of Miss Burton's sketches. The men 
who appear incidentally in the book share these 
traits with the women. The most remarkable person 
of the six studied is Dr. Mary Stone. The daughter 
of a Chinese pastor, herself thoroughly prepared by 
missionary teachers for an American college educa- 
tion, and graduated with honor from the medical 
school of the University of Michigan, Dr. Stone has 
demonstrated, according to the testimony of many 
capable witnesses, extraordinary gifts as a physician, 
surgeon, administrator, and teacher. Beginning 
with her friend Dr. Ida Kahn, who later instituted a 
new work in another city, Dr. Stone has for years 
conducted a hospital at Kiukiang, securing the funds, 
designing the buildings, training all the assistants, 
organizing the staff, and achieving remarkable suc- 
cess as physician and surgeon. But her ability as 
organizer, her achievement as a teacher of nurses, 
her sway over the extensive work that she has de- 



1913]

veloped, are no more impressive than are her per- 
sonal character and her social attractiveness. As the 
central figure in the book, Miss Stone is surrounded 
by almost equally pleasing personalities, one of the 
most winsome being her younger sister, victim a 
few years ago to tuberculosis, but leaving behind a 
record of unusual ability and achievement and of 
great sweetness of nature. Miss Burton's book 
should have a wide reading, and one may venture 
to hope that it will dispel at least a small part of the 
fog of misconception which clouds American thought 
in regard to the Chinese. 

Shakespeare Professor George H. Palmer's "In- 
n/id timations of Immortality in the Son- 
immortaiitv. netg of Shakspere " (Houghton) is 
the thirteenth of the series of lectures on immor- 
tality delivered at Harvard under the provisions of 
the Ingersoll Lectureship. It differs from most of 
its predecessors in abandoning the theoretic aspects 
of the subject in order to scrutinize the testimony 
of one whose unparalleled insight into mortality at 
least is universally conceded to examine, in the 
lecturer's own words, " an instance in English liter- 
ature where the massive truth naively discloses its 
varied meanings and practical import." Holding 
that we treat immortality too much as an abstract 
matter instead of something to be discovered among 
the concrete experiences of life, he regards Shake- 
speare as a peculiarly valuable witness because he is 
so little concerned with theology and so reticent in 
regard to his own beliefs. Though Professor Palmer 
cautiously shields his findings under the title of 
" Intimations," they are by no means insignificant. 
Accepting the order of the sonnets as substantially 
correct, he discovers the poet dwelling, in their three 
groups, upon three successive types of immortality, 
which may be designated as the Natural, the Ideal, 
and the Spiritual. The first two of these are perhaps 
sufficiently obvious ; it is not so clear that the third 
is present in the third group as a constituent or per- 
vading element, though it comes at least once, in 
sonnet one hundred forty-six, to very definite expres- 
sion. Historical criticism is not likely to abandon 
its attempts to solve the mystery of these baffling 
poems ; but so long as the mystery remains unsolved, 
a consistent reading of them in any aspect, such as 
is here offered, will be welcome. However, Pro- 
fessor Palmer set out upon a very different quest, 
and the particular thing which he has brought back 
is the fact that Shakespeare " once at least looked 
into immortality." 

An appeal for Mr " Anthony M. Ludovici has com- 
wistocracy bined two great subjects, " Nietzsche 
mart. an ^ Art" (Luce), and has written a 

provocative book on this double theme. But aside 
from the leitmotif and a few quotations, Nietzsche 
is in no way responsible for this study. " Ludovici 
and Art " would have been a more correct but less 
fetching title. Mr. Ludovici thinks as follows: Art 
is possibly the greatest thing on earth, for artists 
interpret the world, give values to things, adjust 



nature, and impose order upon chaos. But the art 
of to-day is in a pitiable plight. Confusion and lack 
of strong ideals prevail not only in politics and re- 
ligion but also in art. Artistically we do not know 
what we want ; we only know, if we have any artis- 
tic sense, that what we have is not good. Democracy 
is the ubiquitous demon which is responsible for the 
hopeless condition of modern art. Everybody feels 
called to paint preferably landscapes and portraits 
and attributes this calling to his artistic tempera- 
ment, whereas it is only a betrayal of his weak will. 
Therefore, to point out only a few of the decadents 
in Mr. Ludovici's estimation, Monet's pointillisme, 
Sargent's nervous strokes, Rodin's detailed anatomy, 
the Impressionists' atmosphere, Peter Graham's 
gauzes, Lavery's pale people, indeed the devotion 
of all modern artists to truth in the Christian and 
scientific sense, all these are indications of the 
general " funk " that has overtaken the art world. 
What we need is superman-art, the art that comes 
from one great commander with a host of merry 
followers, such art as built the Egyptian Pyramid 
and wrought the diorite statue of King Chephren at 
Cairo. We need aristocratic art, with symmetry, 
sobriety, simplicity, transfiguration, and repetition. 
Now, this book is the outcome of much study ; it 
scintillates about the Old Masters ; the author's point 
is clearly made; and that there is some ground for 
grievance in the world of art, all will admit. But 
only a negligible minority will say that the case of art 
is as bad as it is here painted. And practically none 
will ascribe any imperfect art that is being produced 
to-day to the Luthers and Humboldts and Bebels of 
this and other days. The situation is not hopeless. 
Where so many paint some will surely draw. And 
since this book is silent on Nietzsche's attitude to- 
ward literature and music, where he was so voluble, 
and since it is so voluble on painting and sculpture, 
where Nietzsche was practically dumb, the title is 
unfair all around : it flatters the writer, cajoles the 
reader, and mismates Nietzsche. 

AnEnaiishman's ^ r ' J a es M ilne ; following close on 
bachelor honey- the heels of Mr. Arnold Bennett, but 
moon in America.^ stepping in his very footprints, 
gives the world his impressions of America (that is, 
of the United States and Canada) in "John Jonathan 
and Company" (Macmillan), which purports to be 
"the full, true, and particular record, with observa- 
tions, reflections, and confessions, of a bachelor 
honeymoon over the Atlantic, through America and 
Canada, and home again to England, all duly set 
down in a proper manner." The narrator's sweet- 
heart is supposed to send him out to see the world 
and make sure of his own heart before the irrevo- 
cable word shall have been uttered at the altar. This 
playful conceit is happily handled, and the familiar 
letters written home by the traveller are excellent 
reading. There is more of graceful play of fancy, 
more of character-study and of quiet and meditative 
observation, than in Mr. Bennett's far-trumpeted 
volume. What should most interest a European in

America, is thus stated : " But if he thinks that man 
is man's most interesting study, that possible gleams 
into the future are as good to get as the lights of long 
ago, then assuredly he should try America. It still 
runs full-speed ahead, and it still has an open mind 
as to the goal, so here is a crying interest for you, 
who like to follow human progress even in my poor

ican more delightful than when he is an author, an 
artist, a journalist, a composer, a doctor, a lawyer, a 
professor, in a word when he is the professional man. 
As such he is not burdened with the hoary moss 
called etiquette, which clings to his calling in an old 
country." It is, then, the people and not the sky- 
scrapers and the Pullman cars and the mammoth 
hotels that interest Mr. Milne, and his interest is 
most agreeably and entertainingly expressed. On 
an early page the critic cannot fail to note in pass- 
ing an instance of that wilfulness of the personal 
pronoun to which Professor Lounsbury is just now 
calling attention. The author writes of the iceberg 
that wrecked the Titanic: "It rips her open, she, the 
unconquerable, the unsinkable, . . ." The reader's 
attention to what Mr. Milne has to say is undis- 
tracted by pictures, except that a frontispiece repre- 
sents " the spirit of the Atlantic " in a full-rigged 
ship drawn by Mr. Charles Pears. 

The heroic a a e The relations of Greek and Teutonic 
in Greek and heroic poetry offer a tempting theme 
Teutonic poetry. t o the archaeologist or litterateur; 
but the alluring path is bound to be thorny for the 
adventurer who dreams of definite conclusions. 
However, Mr. H. Munro Chadwick, Fellow of Clare 
College, Cambridge, has just written a large volume, 
"The Heroic Age" (Putnam), wherein he strives 
to bring these relations to light, or, as he mod- 
estly states, to make a start in that direction. He 
takes the Heroic Age of the Teutonic peoples as 
covering approximately three hundred years, and 
closing about the middle of the sixth century ; the 
Greek Heroic Age he regards as terminating with 
the series of movements traditionally known as the 
Return of the Heracleidai, and covering three or 
four generations. Mr. Chadwick believes that the 
resemblances between the Teutonic group of poems 
and the Homeric poems "are due primarily to 
resemblances in the ages to which they relate and 
to which they ultimately owe their origin. The com- 
parative study of heroic poetry therefore involves 
the comparative study of 'Heroic Ages,' and the 
problems which it presents are essentially problems 
of anthropology." In the earlier chapters the author 
treats of such subjects as " The Heroic Age of the 
Teutonic Peoples," "The Poetry and Minstrelsy of 
Early Times," and "The Supernatural Elements in 
the [Northern] Heroic Stories." Then he proceeds 
to the Greek period, and takes up corresponding 
topics. In the last hundred pages he becomes more 
definitely comparative under such captions as "The 
Common Characteristics of Teutonic and Greek 
Heroic Poetry," "Religion in the Heroic Age," or 



"The Causes and Antecedent Conditions of the 
Heroic Age." Obviously we cannot enter upon a 
detailed criticism, and it is with extreme reluctance 
that we record an opinion unsupported by evidence ; 
but we feel that the results attained in the volume 
are by no means commensurate either with the 
reputation of the distinguished author or the amount 
of toil he has cheerfully lavished upon his project. 
The material book will be a joy to any reader who 
appreciates good typography and presswork. 

A timel After the late visit among us of the 

collection of popular French author whom we 
Loti's sketches. ] inow j n literature as Pierre Loti, 
but who to his friends in daily life is Captain Viaud, 
there is a manifest timeliness in the issue of the 
little volume of brief miscellanies designated on its 
title-page as " Carmen Sylva and Sketches from the 
Orient" (Macmillan). These pieces, presented in 
an " authorized translation " by Mr. Fred Rothwell, 
were written twenty or more years ago, and thus 
their claim to favor must rest on a more substantial 
basis than mere novelty. More than a third of the 
book is devoted to the author's reminiscences of the 
Roumanian queen, whom he waited upon at her castle 
of Sinaia, later in Bucharest, and again in her com- 
parative seclusion at Venice after she had incurred 
the displeasure of her people by urging the marriage 
of her maid of honor, Mile. Helene Vacaresco, to the 
prince royal. It is a pathetic picture of a saddened 
and physically failing queen he leaves with us. 
"Constantinople in 1890," three short pages on 
"Serpent Charmers," some notes written in 1885 
and entitled "A Few Forgotten Pages of 'Madame 
Chrysan theme,'" and a skilful sketch descriptive of 
"Japanese Women in 1890," complete the volume, 
whose closing lines prove that his passion for the 
Orient has not blinded the author to the faults of 
far-eastern women or at least of some of them. 
He calls the women of Japan " affected and finical 
in mind and body, artificial and prim," their very 
souls "old and worn out," perhaps because, as he 
surmises, "their race has for so many centuries been 
separated from the other varieties of the human 
species, living on its own stock and never being re- 
novated." These well-translated sketches serve as 
fair specimens of Loti's style. A portrait of "Car- 
men Sylva" accompanies them.

among them, with judicious warming they will come 
out as good as new, and even if your hearers have 
heard them before in the dim and distant past, they 
will open long disused cells of association and recol- 
lection in the brain, just as those old-world smells of 
pot-pourri or of antiquated scents often bring back 
such floods of memory." Without weighting his 
book with bibliographical notes, the careful compiler 
has made it plain that he has sought the earliest and 
best available authorities for the utterances attributed 
to the "famous wits " of his volume. After an agree- 
able discussion of wit and humor in general, with 
incidental defense of the pun the lowest form of 
wit, and therefore, as Erskine maintained, the found- 
ation of all wit he introduces in chronological 
order, with brief biographical accompaniment, his 
celebrated fun-makers, from Queen Elizabeth's time 
to the present. A story not without its obvious 
bearing on the Shakespeare-Bacon question, though 
recorded without reference thereto, is that of the 
convicted criminal who appealed to his judge, Sir 
Nicholas Bacon, to spare his life on the plea of kin- 
ship between them. " How so ? " demanded Sir 
Nicholas. " Because my name is Hog and yours is 
Bacon ; and hog and bacon are so near akin that 
they cannot be separated." " Ay ; but you and I 
cannot yet be kindred," objected the judge, " for 
hog is not bacon until it be well hanged." Due honor 
is paid to Douglas Jerrold, whose best sayings are 
repeated, but his portrait is not among the dozen 
that fittingly adorn the work. It is an excellent 
book ; it stands the severe test of consecutive reading. 

Sketches of ^ r> Frederic Taber Cooper, whose 
the younger book entitled "Some American Story 
novelists. Tellers " is remembered as a refresh- 

ing presentation of information not readily accessi- 
ble elsewhere, has published a companion volume 
called "Some English Story Tellers: A Book of the 
Younger Novelists " (Holt). In view of the fact that 
this title was "deliberately chosen," one is somewhat 
surprised to find that the author has included Mr. 
De Morgan, who was born before the death of Frances 
Burney, and has excluded Mr. H. G. Wells, born 
over a quarter of a century later. Among the novel- 
ists discussed are Mr. Conrad, Mr. Hewlett, Mr. 
Kipling, Mr. Locke, Mr. Galsworthy, and Mr. Ben- 
nett ; and to represent the easy-going catholic tem- 
per of the author we might add Mrs. Dudeney, Mr 
Hichens, and Mr. Trevena. The treatment, in each 
case, involves a few words regarding the novelist's 
position, something of his life, and an expository 
account of his chief writings, with enough critical 
appraisement to make the reader glad that there is 
no more. This does not mean that Mr. Cooper is 
extraordinarily lacking in the critical faculty: he 
writes nimbly and sensibly, makes no palpable blun- 
ders of consequence, and, considering the difficulty 
of weighing the merits of living writers, rarely for- 
gets that the critic must have something to say. But 
beyond this faint praise one can hardly go. Aside 
from its critical aspect, the book is admirable enough : 



it is entertaining, it abounds in facts that are signifi- 
cant as well as unfamiliar, it contains a forty-page 
bibliography, and it is illustrated with a number of 
photographs that many devotees of the modern novel 
will scrutinize with sentimental satisfaction.

The second part, "Salve," of Mr. 
Moore continues George Moore's autobiographic tril- 
ls " Trilogy." ogy (Hail and Farewell ") is as ram- 
bling and varied and pleasantly haphazard as was 
the first part, "Ave," and as, doubtless, will be the 
third part, "Vale," now in preparation. Disap- 
proving England's attitude in the Boer War, our 
brilliant and impulsive author shakes off the dust 
of London from his feet and betakes himself to 
Dublin to become a "Gaelic League propagandist." 
And there of course he falls in with the celebrated 
Irish poets of the day, and with other celebrities 
and non-celebrities, with whom he has high and 
impassioned discourse on all imaginable topics, and 
a few others. In a passing reference to Mr. Ches- 
terton's classing of Francis Thompson with Shelley 
and Keats, he remarks, in aptly idiomatic phrase: 
"He must have been thinking with the surface of 
his brain when he compared Francis Thompson with 
Shelley; casual thinking always puts wrong words 
into our heads." A list of the great French writers 
of the nineteenth century which he gives omits 
Daudet and Dumas (both father and son), though 
it includes Zola and Maupassant and Gautier. Re- 
ligious controversy and all sorts of more or less 
heated debate are found in abundance in the book, 
and no reader of any convictions of his own can fail 
to find some one or other of his pet opinions rather 
unceremoniously handled which will impart zest 
to his perusal of the volume. The literature of 
autobiography can show nothing to match this 
trilogy of Mr. George Moore's. (Appleton.) 



A d vice for

"Simple Rules for Overcoming In- 
somnia" is the sub-title of Dr. 
Joseph Collins's brief discourse upon 
a vital subject, "Sleep and the Sleepless" (Sturgis 
& Walton Co.), which makes it plain that Morpheus 
is not to be wooed, but his adversaries overcome. It 
is an eminently rational book, and is addressed to 
those who are ready and able to direct the regimen 
of life by reasonable methods. It argues in com- 
monsense fashion, yet with the reinforcement of sci- 
entific data, for the removal of causes that disturb the 
recuperative functions and make the ills that mind 
is heir to. It sets forth briefly but emphatically the 
use of drugs and the larger abuse to which drugs 
invite, as well as the conditions of their wise appli- 
cation. It offers no secrets, because there are none 
to offer; it neither alarms nor seeks refuge in an 
ignoring bliss that postpones the day of reckoning. 
It advises expertly even to the character of literary 
companions to be chosen for their soothing effect in 
putting one to sleep. The whole forms so accept-

barest mention even in the literary journals of her 
own country. Yet by many discriminating poetry- 
lovers on both sides of the Atlantic the loss was felt 
in a keenly intimate sense. A " humbler poet " she 
assuredly was, with limitations which she would have 
been the first to admit; but nevertheless, few among 
her fellow-singers of the past quarter-century have 
been more adept in reaching and stirring the reflective 
heart. She handled a wide variety of metrical forms 
with facility and delicate grace. Her themes are many 
and various also ; but in most of her verse, whatever 
the subject, "the sense of tears in mortal things" is 
uppermost. This insistent note of sadness, this wist- 
ful preoccupation with the idea of death and trans- 
ition, has indeed greatly limited her appeal in a 
generation that is determined to be jolly at all odds. 
But she has found, and will continue to find, her fit 
audience, however few, by whom the five small vol- 
umes of her published verse will always be cherished. 
The contents of these five volumes have now been 
brought together in a collected edition (John Lane 
Co.), with the addition of a selection of new poems 
which it had been the author's intention to publish 
in a separate volume under the title, "The Lamp and 
the Lute." Some of the exquisite garden lyrics from 
" The Heart of a Garden " are also included in this 
section. Mr. H. B. Marriott Watson, the poet's hus- 
band, edits this collected edition. The volume is 
well printed and bound, and contains a photogravure 
portrait. _ 

All that filial devotion and the love 
and respect of friends could do to 
honor the memory of a man eminent in 
his calling of soldier, educator, and churchman, has 
been placed at the service of the biographer of "The 
Soldier-Bishop, Ellison Capers " (Neale). Mr. Wal- 
ter B. Capers, the late bishop's youngest son and 
president of Columbia Institute, at Columbia, Ten- 
nessee, has acted as scribe in the compiling of avail- 
able data concerning his father's life ; but the other 
six surviving sons and daughters, and many friends 
and admirers of the "soldier-bishop" have gladly 
assisted with letters and other contributions, and the 
journal and letters of the deceased have also been 
largely drawn upon. Ellison Capers was born at 
Charleston, S. C., Oct. 14, 1837 ; finished his school 
education at Arsenal Academy, Columbia, where he 
afterward taught until the outbreak of war called 
him to the service of his state ; distinguished himself 
notably at the battle of Jackson, Miss., was wounded 
at Chickamauga, promoted brigadier-general soon 
afterward, and was with Hood and Johnston in the

arduous campaigns of the Army of the Tennessee. 
In the ministry, which he entered not long after 
laying aside the sword, he became Bishop of South 
Carolina; and in 1904 he was elected Chancellor 
of the University of the South, at Sewanee, Tenn. 
He died in 1908. Tributes to his memory and selec- 
tions from his public utterances fill the last part of 
the volume. Portraits and other illustrations enrich 

the work. 

The Brothers of the Book is the name 
of an organization of literary ama- 
teurs which publishes quaint and 
curious little books from time to time for the delight 
of its members and a few favored outsiders. One 
of its recent issues is a pamphlet whose title runs as 
follows : " Campi Golfarii Romae Antiquae : De Ludo 
Antique Regalique Excerptum ex Actis Diurnis C. 
Cilni Maecenatis in Versum Modernum Convertit 
et Annotavit P. Sibleius Ferus" (Chicagine: In 
Linea Sartoris). Which being interpreted means that 
certain verses about the game of golf, written by Mr. 
Bert Leston Taylor for the column of whimsicalities 
which he edits in a Chicago newspaper, have been 
put into Latin by Mr. Payson Sibley Wild, and pro- 
vided with an imposing array of learned apparatus. 
The Latin text purports to have been discovered by 
Dr. von Aberwitz of the University of Hofbrau, 
and to reveal the fact that the ancient game was in 
favor with the Roman emperors, and was wellnigh 
the undoing of Augustus Caesar, driving him to 
strong language and to drink. 

" Nos modo Caudas Gallorum Martini, 
Modo lagenas arcessimus, vini." 

The note which describes the Martini runs as fol- 
lows : " Permixtio delicatissima mellis, malorum cit- 
reorum, amarorum, ' aquae igneae ' et olivarum pipere 
refertarum," attributed to Plinius Tertius, which 
seems to be an accurate and,workable description. 
It is all excellent fooling, and the conceit is worked 
out with wit and verve. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Rich's " Apolonius and Silla," edited by Mr. Morton 
Luce, and the " Mensechmi " of Plautus, with Latin

published by Messrs. Duffield & Co. 

Professor Egbert Ray Nichols has compiled a second 
volume of " Intercollegiate Debates," covering the year 
1910-11. It will, like its predecessor, find an enthu- 
siastic welcome among college and high school students. 
Messrs. Hinds, Noble, & Eldredge are the publishers.

apparatus of annotation. With this volume the author 
completes his design, begun in " Themistocles and 
Aristides " and advanced in " Cimon and Pericles," of 
presenting in popular form material for the critical 
study of "the greatest century in the history in Athens." 
The Messrs. Scribner are the publishers. 

Four volumes of the handsome library edition of Will- 
iam Sharp now being published by Messrs. Duffield & Co. 
are at hand. Two of them contain Mrs. Sharp's memoir 
of her husband; the other two are "Vistas " and " Lit- 
erary Geography and Travel Sketches." This series is 
in addition to the " Fiona Macleod " books, which are 
published in a separate collection. 

The " Scientific American Reference Book " for 
1913, published by Messrs. Munn & Co., is a compen- 
dium of useful information about such timely subjects 
as Antarctic discovery, the Panama Canal, wireless 
telegraphy, and hundreds of others. Its six hundred 
pages are crammed with facts, many of which are not 
accessible in the ordinary works of reference. There 
are also many illustrations. This book seems to supply 
a real want. 

The "Music Lovers' Cyclopedia" (Doubleday), as 
now issued, is a revised edition, in a single volume, of 
the work formerly published in two. The editor is Mr. 
Rupert Hughes, and he has spared no pains to make 
the work one which shall meet all the demands the lay 
lover of music may make upon it. There are diction- 
aries of composers and musical terms, plots of operas, 
essays on special subjects, and all sorts of other matter 
conveniently arranged for ready reference. It is pub- 
lished at a modest price, and contains nearly a thousand 
pages. 

In Dr. E. W. Scripture's little book entitled " Stutter- 
ing and Lisping " (Macmillan) is set forth the nature of 
one of the most common and distressing interferences 
with the normal life. The technical equipment of the 
author is unusual, inasmuch as he combines an early 
psychological training with many years of special re- 
search in phonetics, and is now a practitioner in the 
treatment of nervous disease. There is so little avail- 
able on this subject representative of modern views that 
the book will at once find its public. In a measure it 
attempts too much, since it aims at once to be a guide 
for the general practitioner, a record of the methods 
of investigation, and a manual of practical exercises in 
the cure of these impediments. Apart from the unavoid- 
able confusion in maintaining a coordination in so many 
directions, the volume meets its requirements. 

The aim of Dr. Peloubet's new " International Bible 
Dictionary " (Winston) is high, in that it endeavors to 
bring to the great body of teachers and readers the 
results of the latest modern biblical scholarship. The 
editor also deserves praise for omitting from its pages 
such speculative theories and hypotheses as overburden 
some of the larger dictionaries. The proper names of 
the Bible, which are always troublesome to students, are 
both marked for pronunciation and defined according to 
their derivation. Tables of money, weights, and meas- 
ures are prepared on the basis of the latest investigations 
of specialists. The chronological scheme adopted (in 
an Appendix) is that of the late Professor Beecher of 
Auburn Theological Seminary. The fourteen new col- 
ored maps of Bible lands are a splendid addition to any 
student's equipment. It is particularly gratifying to 
find one editor of a popular dictionary of the Bible who 
realizes the inherent value of ocular instruction. Dr. 
Peloubet illumines and decorates his pages by five hun- 



dred illustrations, nearly all of which appear here for 
the first time. The moderate cost of the book will put 
it within reach of many readers who could not afford the 
other more expensive single-volume dictionaries. 

When Mr. Lewis Melville was collecting material for 
his recent biography of William Beckford, he obtained 
permission of the Duke of Hamilton, a collateral de- 
scendant from Beckford, to examine the Beckford papers 
at Hamilton Palace ; and there, in two large chests never 
before explored by a man of letters, he discovered, amid 
other important documents, some large bundles of manu- 
script, written in French, which proved to be the unpub- 
lished " Episodes " of the famous oriental tale for which 
Beckford is chiefly remembered. These papers had 
hitherto been supposed to be lost. In a portly volume,, 
entitled " The Episodes of Vathek " (Lippincott), they 
are now given to the world, both in the original French) 
of Beckford, and in a flowing and readable translation- 
by Sir Frank T. Marzials. The English version is placed 1 
first, in large print; the French original next, in smaller 
type; and an introduction of some length, consisting; 
chiefly of extracts from the correspondence between 
Beckford and his friend Henley, is supplied by Mr. 
Melville. A photogravure portrait of the author serves 
as frontispiece. 

The " Text-book of Design " by Messrs. Charles 
Fabens Kelley and William Luther Mowll, is intended 
primarily for college students and others of equivalent 
training. It presents, in form at once attractive and 
studied, the concepts of design in fresh contact with 
nature and imagination as opposed to stylistic retrospec- 
tion, and of design organically expressive rather than 
merely " decorative." Although the text confessedly 
restates the theory of pure design now generally ac- 
cepted, the theory of expressive design is developed 
with a novelty and insight which makes the book an 
original contribution. The inevitable abstractness of 
the theoretical presentation is well relieved by constant 
references to practice, and the rich and judicious illus- 
tration from objects of the highest beauty supplies the 
atmosphere and stimulation which have been noticeably 
lacking in some previous books on design. For the- 
development of taste and imagination, the superiority 
of the analytic method here used over an organization- 
on the basis of " historic ornament " can scarcely be- 
overestimated. (Houghton.) 

The fifth section of the fifth part of " Modern Amer- 
ican Library Economy " (Elm Tree Press) considerably 
exceeds in size any preceding issue of the series, run- 
ning to the length of 134 pages and covering the import- 
ant subject of instruction to children on the selection" 
and use of books. " Course of Study for Normal School? 
Pupils on Literature for Children " is the title of the- 
work, its authors being Mrs. Julia S. Harron, Miss 
Corinne Bacon, and the general editor of the series, Mr. 
John Cotton Dana. Directions and suggestions, with 
booklists and prescribed readings, on all departments of 
literature within the juvenile scope (and perhaps some- 
what beyond it) are set down in methodic order pos- 
sibly indeed with so much attention to method as tcv 
cause some danger lest the student end by exalting the 
letter above the spirit. A parting counsel might have 
been useful, urging the prospective teacher of the book's, 
principles to assimilate all the excellent matter within 
its covers and then to let free initiative have rather un- 
restricted play. The wise person will do this in any 
event. Like its predecessors, the little manual is ad- 
mirably thorough and systematic.

NOTES. 

" English Cathedral Journeys," by Miss Kate F. Kim- 
ball, will be added soon to Messrs. Crowell's " Travel 
Series." 

" Modern Problems," by Sir Oliver Lodge, is an im- 
portant volume immediately forthcoming from George 
H. Doran Co. 

Mr. Henry Arthur Jones, the English dramatist, has 
a volume nearly ready for the press entitled " The 
Foundations of a National Drama." 

A series of pen-sketches by the German writer, 
Maximilian Harden, depicting various " Monarchs and 
Men " in contemporary life, is announced by the John 
C. Winston Co. 

A new book by Ellen Key, dealing with Rahel Varn- 
hagen as "a prophecy of the woman of the future," 
will be published this month by Messrs. Putnam in a 
translation made by Mr. A. G. Chater. 

" The Fear of Living," by M. Henry Bordeaux, which 
was " crowned " by the French Academy and has run 
through several editions in the original, is announced 
for publication by Messrs. Dutton in a translation by 
Ruth Helen Davis. 

Three novels announced for early publication by the 
John C. Winston Co. are the following: "Written in 
the Sand," by Mr. G. R. Duval; "The Reluctant Lover," 
by Mr. Stephen McKenna; and "The Mystery of 31, 
New Inn," by Mr. R. Austin Freeman. 

An interesting event in connection with the inaugura- 
tion of President Wilson will be the publication by 
Houghton Mifflin Co. of a limited Riverside Press edi- 
tion in one volume of three of his best-known essays, 
" Mere Literature," " The Author Himself," and On 
an Author's Choice of Company." 

Four novels appearing on Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell 
Company's spring list are the following: " A Superman 
in Being," by Mr. Litchfleld Woods; "The Debt," a 
story of South African life, by Mr. William Westrupp; 
and " Princess Athura," a romance dealing with events 
in ancient Persia, by Mr. Samuel W. Odell. 

" The Parasite " by Mrs. Helen R. Martin, which 
J. B. Lippincott Co. will publish at once, is said to be 
different in both setting and characters from this author's 
well-known Mennonite stories. Simultaneously with this, 
Messrs. Lippincott will publish a novel by Mr. Crittenden 
Marriott, entitled " Sally Castleton, Southerner." 

The eighth edition of the library-cataloguer's vade 
mecum, the " Decimal Classification " inseparably asso- 
ciated with Mr. Melvil Dewey's name and fame, is 
promised by the publishers for "early spring." Some of 
the chief collaborators in the work of revision have been 
unavoidably delayed in furnishing their " copy " to the 
printer. Hence the retardation. 

A volume of timely interest is Mr. Ernest Alfred 
Vizetelly's "Republican France, 1870-1912: Her Presi- 
dents, Statesmen, Policy, Vicissitudes and Social Life," 
which Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. will have ready 
shortly. Mr. Vizetelly's long residence in France and 
his relations with many distinguished Frenchmen have 
enabled him to write largely at first hand. 

" Neale's Monthly " makes its entry into the maga- 
zine field with a first (January) issue containing much 
interesting matter, presented in well printed and illus- 
trated form. Of chief importance among the contents 
is the first of a series of five papers embodying the 
Italian reminiscences of Mrs. Kinney, the mother of 
Edmund Clarence Stedmau, and published under the 



editorship of Miss Laura Stedmau and Dr. George M. 
Gould. Another valuable feature is Dr. Archibald 
Henderson's article on Colonel Richard Henderson 
the first instalment of a series dealing with " Forerun- 
ners of the Republic." 

Several volumes of decided interest to be published at 
once by Houghton Mifflin Co. are the following: "Irish 
Plays and Playwrights," by Mr. Cornelius Weygandt; 
" Field Days in California," by the late Bradford Torrey ; 
"A Wayfarer in China," by Miss Elizabeth Kendall; 
"Old Homes of New Americans," dealing with one phase 
of the immigration problem, by Dr. Francis E. Clark; 
and " Psychology and Industrial Efficiency," by Dr. 
Hugo Miinsterberg. 

Professor Josiah Royce, of Harvard, sailed recently 
for England where at Oxford University he will deliver 
a series of lectures on "The Real World and the Chris- 
tian Ideas." These lectures will later be gathered 
together and those which Dr. Royce delivered before 
the Lowell Institute on " The Christian Doctrine of 
Life " added to them, and the whole published in two 
volumes under the general title " The Problem of Chris- 
tianity." The work will probably appear in April. 

The rapidly-diminishing group of older American 
publishers has suffered another severe loss in the death, 
on January 9, of James W. Mclntyre, of Little, Brown, 
& Co. Mr. Mclntyre had been identified with the book- 
selling and publishing business in America for nearly 
half a century, all but one year of this period being de- 
voted to the service of the Boston firm in which he has 
been a partner since 1897. In addition to business 
ability of a high order, he was a capable literary scholar, 
and it is largely to his editorial skill and judgment that 
the various complete editions of standard authors issued 
by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. owe their wide success. 

The Library of Congress acquired in the year covered 
by its latest Report 120,664 printed books and pam- 
phlets, and has now 2,012,393 printed books and pam- 
phlets. The number of "bound volumes," by which the 
great libraries of the world are commonly ranked in the 
order of their size, is not given; but undoubtedly our 
national library is secure in its claim to stand third on 
the list, the Bibliotheque Nationale and the British Mu- 
seum Library being its only superiors in point of bigness. 
As an illustration of the astonishing cumulative rate at 
which a library almost invariably grows, we note that 
since the opening of the century the Library of Congress 
has more than doubled in the size of its collection, a 
somewhat alarming rate of progress toward congestion 
in the stack-room. 

The arrangement between the University of Chicago 
and the University of Cambridge, by which the latter is 
given the exclusive agency in the British Empire for 
the former's publications, is now being supplemented by 
a reciprocal agreement, the Chicago institution taking 
over the American agency for a number of the Cam- 
bridge publications. An arrangement has already been 
concluded for the Cambridge journals, and the follow- 
ing periodicals in the future will be issued in America 
under joint imprint: " Biornetrika," " Parasitology," 
"Journal of Genetics," "The Journal of Hygiene," 
" The Modern Language Review," " The British Jour- 
nal of Psychology," and " The Journal of Agricultural 
Science." Several new books from the Cambridge list 
are also to be taken over at once and published in this 
country under joint auspices. The list includes " The 
Life and Letters of Lord Hardwicke," by M. Philip 
Chesney Yorke; "The Duab of Turkestan," by W.

Rickmer Rickmers ; " The History of Romanesque and 
Byzantine Architecture," by Thomas Graham Jackson ; 
and " The Genus Iris," by William Rickatson Dykes. 
This movement toward a closer cooperation between 
the two universities is a matter that should be of in- 
terest to all who are concerned with the advancement 
of scientific and scholarly research and the preservation 
of its results. The difficulties involved in the publica- 
tion of such material are too obvious to need comment, 
and it is to be hoped that an arrangement that promises 
so much aid in this direction may be further extended. 

The Syndics of the Cambridge University Press pro- 
pose to publish a comprehensive History of India, from 
the earliest times to the present day, on the model of 
the " Cambridge Modern History." The work, as pro- 
jected, will be completed in six volumes of about six 
hundred pages, two volumes being devoted to each of 
the main periods Ancient India, Muhammadan India, 
and British India, under the editorship, respectively, 
of Professor E. J. Rapson, Lieut.-Col. T. Wolseley Haig, 
I.S.C., and Sir Theodore Morison, K.C.I.E. The vari- 
ous chapters in these sections will be entrusted to 
scholars who have made a special study of the period 
or subject; and the Syndics hope, in this way, to produce 
a history of the nations of India past and present which 
shall take its place as the standard work. 

Mrs. Julia Caroline (Ripley) Dorr, poet and novelist, 
died in her eighty-eighth year at her home in Rutland, 
Vermont, Jan. 18. She was born at Charleston, S. C., 
the daughter of parents formerly living in San Domingo, 
and there was French blood in her veins. Fond of writ- 
ing from childhood, Mrs. Dorr first appeared in print 
with a poem sent by her husband, the late Seneca R. 
Dorr, to the old " Union Magazine," a year or two after 
their marriage in 1847. In her list of works are found 
" Farmingdale," " Lanmere," " Sybil Huntingdon," " Ex- 
piation," " Friar Anselmo," " Afternoon Songs," " After- 
glow," " Beyond the Sunset," and many others. Mrs. 
Dorr held the degree of Litt.D. from Middlebury Col- 
lege and was well acquainted with the great nineteenth- 
century authors of New England in their time.

AMERICAN POEMS 

SELECTED AND EDITED, WITH ILLUSTRATIVE AND EXPLANATORY NOTES 

AND A BIBLIOGRAPHY 

By WALTER C. BRONSON, Litt.D. 
Professor of English Literature, Brown University. 

T)Y all students and teachers of English the announcement of Professor Bronson's new work, 
*-*. AMERICAN POEMS, will be received with interest. The wide recognition of the merit of his 
ENGLISH POEMS is of itself a guaranty of the appreciation which this author's work merits. In a 
volume of 680 pages the author has assembled a representative collection of the best work of 
American poets covering the period 1625-1892. The selection in each case has been governed by 
scholarly discrimination, and is designed to show the individual, representative work of each poet. 
The poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the minor poetry of the nineteenth 
century are included, although more than half the space is given to the greater poets. The broad 
view thus afforded of the entire field of American poetry will help the student to an understanding 
of American life from the earliest Colonial times and to a juster appreciation of the greater nineteenth- 
century poets.

A brave and discerning 
presentment of a prob- 
lem vital to everyone. 

THE PARASITE 

By HELEN R. MARTIN 

Author of 

"TilIie,AMennoniteMaid" 
Illustrated in color by FLAGG. 
$1.25 net. Postpaid. $1.37. 

This strong vital story of Joan Laird 
and Judge Randall married only in 
name, might well be termed " a novel 
of the unexpected." It is radically 
different from any of Mrs. Martin's 
former novels. Joan's unusual situ- 
ation in the family of the Judge gives 
rise to individual and social problems 
of deep interest which the author 
handles in a startling manner. The 
characters are intensely human and 
will live in the pages of this book 
as people you have known. "The 
Parasite" is a powerful revelation of 
human character and a phase of 
American social life. 



A Romance of

ByCRITTENDEN MARRIOTT 

Author of 

"The We of Dead Ships," 

Etc. 

Illustrated by N. C. WYETH. 
$1.25 net. Postpaid, $1.37. 

In this love story, brimming with 
action, the principal characters are 
Sally Castleton, the lovely daughter 
of a Confederate general, and Frank 
lladcliffe, a Northern spy, who 
penetrates the Southern lines on a 
dangerous mission. Under peculiar 
circumstances Sally becomes the cap- 
tor of Frank. Thereafter love and 
duty struggle for supremacy in the 
heart of Sally through all of the tense 
moments and exciting scenes leading 
up to the climax at theCastleton home- 
stead. The author has written of war 
times with true art, and has conceived 
a romance of indescribable charm in 
vivid contrast to the dark shadows of 
the Rebellion.

Recent Events and Present Policies in 



CHINA 



By J. O. P. BLAND, joint author with E. BACKHOUSE of 
China Under the Empress Dowager 

Profusely illustrated. Svo. Cloth, gilt top. $l l .00net. 
" This book is welcome for the sake of its sanity, its trained clearness of insight, 
and the impartiality of its outlook. . . . Amazingly comprehensive in its scope 
and convincing in its unmistakable note of competent, impartial authority." 

New York Tribune. 

China has been making history rapidly during this last year. Mr. Bland, who is 
now lecturing in this country, and whose reputation as an authority on Chinese 
affairs is unquestioned, finished this important work iu October. It is, therefore, 
the latest accurate chronicle on thmaking of the Chinese Republic. The problems 
with which China is now grappling are of vaster moment than those that any 
country has ever faced. Mr. Bland deals with the causes and symptoms of the 
Chinese unrest, the Passing of the Manchus, the Elements of the Republican 
Movement, the Policies of the Leading Powers, the Opium Question, etc. To those 
who fear a yellow peril. Chapter XIV. will be a revelation. No more interesting 
historical and economic study of the great changes through which the yellow 
races are now passing has ever been written.

PUVIS DE CHAVANNES

Other volumes will follow at short intervals. 

This attractive and artistic series of volumes, written by French critics, on the 
great painters of the Nineteenth Century, will be very popular, Each monograph 
will contain a short biographical and critical study of the master, followed by 
forty-eight plates, selected from his works. Each picture is described, its beauties 
are pointed out, its weaknesses discussed, and other incidental facts connected 
with it are briefly stated. The chronological order of the illustrations, together 
with the comments, make these volumes a valuable synopsis of each artist's career. 
Contemporary criticisms of the paintings are freely quoted and compared with the 
judgments of the present generation. The series will form a history of modern 
French art.

The first Complete Biography of Sardou, Containing also Narrative 
Analyses of His Plays 

Sardou and the Sardou Plays 

By JEROME A. HART 

Illustrated. Small Svo. Cloth. $2.50 net. Postpaid, $2.65. 

Of the life of Sardou very little has been written in either French or English. As 
Mr. Hart says, "Nearly all of our knowledge of Sardou's family and childhood, we 
owe to the veteran dramatist himself he confided to Adolphe Brisson, of Le Temps 
some of his earliest recollections." In this thorough and exhaustive study of 
Sardou's life and works, Mr. Hart has gathered apparently all of the available data 
relative to the great dramatist. It is replete with anecdotes, and tells of Sardou's 
youth and early struggles, his failures and eventually his great successes. The 
author has divided the book into three parts. The first is a biographical sketch ; 
the second is made up of analyses of some two score of the Sardou plays not 
critical but narrative analyses; and the third is devoted to the Sardou plays in 
the United States.

the part she played in destroying Troy. 
Several of the other longer poems, strik- 
ingly original in conception and form, 
show a living sympathy with the Greek 
spirit and view-point: notably, the Argive 
women and Hypsipyle. The " Fourteen 
Sonnets " are beautiful in form, idea, and 
feeling, and several of the brief visions 
called up in Epigrammata suggest the 
Japanese in purity, delicacy, and vivid- 
ness.

The Immigrant Invasion 

By FRANK JULIAN WARNE, Ph.D. 

Formerly Secretary of the Immigration Department of the National Civic Federa- 
tion, Secretary of the New York State Immigration Commission, and special 
expert of the United States Census Bureau on our foreign-born population. 
Author of "The Slav Invasion and the Mine Workers," "The Coal Mine Workers," 
etc. With illustrations from photographs, numerous diagrams, maps, charts, etc. 

One out of every seven of the 91,000,000 population of the United States was born in some foreign country. 
This book tells where this great foreign population of more than 13,000,000 came from, the conditions under 
which it has moved to the United States, its racial composition, and how it has distributed itself in this 
country. It points out some of the innumerable national problems, which its presence here has given rise 
to. Immigration of the present, which continues to make large additions to our foreign-born population, is 
contrasted with that of the past, and the differences in economic conditions pointed out. The newer immigra- 
tion and its characteristics are also distinguished as to races from the older immigration. The conclusions 
of the author are not superficial opinions, but have been reached after fourteen years of study and investiga- 
tion and are supported by an army of convincing facts.

A DREAM TO BE REALIZED. 

The action taken a fortnight ago by the direc- 
tors of the Art Institute of Chicago marks an 
epoch in the history of civic art, and the future 
will look back to it as one of the significant 
occurrences of the century. This action appro- 
priated the income of the Ferguson fund for an 
indefinite number of years to come, applying it 
to the materialization of the grandiose sculptural 
conception which Mr. Lorado Taf t has developed 
during many years of brooding upon the possi- 
bilities of the city beautiful. Since this project 
is of far more than local import, aiming at the 
creation of an artistic monument which shall be 
one of the most beautiful in the world, it deserves 
the widest publicity, and we take pleasure in out- 
lining the salient features of the undertaking. 

In the first place, the Ferguson fund is an 
endowment of approximately one million dollars, 
left in trust by the will of the donor, with the 
direction that the income be applied to the pur- 
pose of enhancing the attractiveness of Chicago 
to the lover of art and heaven knows that 
Chicago sorely needs this sort of assthetic stimu- 
lus or encouragement. Those who have lived 
here for twenty years or more cherish the mem- 
ory of the White City which rose as an exhala- 
tion from the soil in 1893, and drew all men's 
eyes to its beauty. But that beauty was evanes- 
cent, and only its recollection is left us. The 
creative work now to be undertaken will be of 
the imperishable sort, relatively speaking, and 
will stand for the delight and wonder of future 
generations. It is obvious that the income from 
a million dollars, applied year after year to the 
realization of a noble artistic dream, must accom- 
plish something noteworthy, and we may praise 
the wisdom of the trustees in thus deciding to 
concentrate their efforts upon a single great 
undertaking, instead of providing a picture or a 
statue here, and a park or a fountain there, in 
pursuance of the obligation laid upon them by 
the testator. They have clearly chosen the way 
to give the most impressive effect to the endow- 
ment under their charge. 

What is known in Chicago as the Midway 
Plaisance is a double boulevard, a mile in length, 
with a sunken lawn between the two drives, con- 
necting Washington and Jackson Parks. Orig. 
inally a link in the city's system of inner parks

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



it was diverted in 1893, when Jackson Park on 
the lake shore became the site of the White City, 
to the uses of the sort of annex which every 
Exposition feels bound to provide for its more 
frivolously-minded visitors, and became a mile 
of side-shows, and " villages," and other "attrac- 
tions" of the Coney Island type. "Doing the 
Midway" was at that time a popular diversion 
with old and young, and its entertaining devices 
were sharply contrasted with the educational 
exhibits and architectural glories of the White 
City proper. Afterwards, it was dismantled of 
its tawdry adornments, and restored to its right- 
ful uses. Meanwhile, the twenty years that 
have since elapsed have witnessed the growth, 
close upon its northern side, of the University of 
Chicago, which has acquired a large part of the 
frontage, and which has constructed, in a beau- 
tiful style of Gothic architecture, one of the 
most impressive groups of academic buildings in 
America. The Midway runs east and west, at 
a distance of about seven miles from the busi- 
ness heart of the city, and is, in its present un- 
developed condition, one of the most attractive 
sections of the Chicago parks. Of what it 
will become, when the project now in hand is 
completed, the following will convey some idea. 
Mr. Taft's plan for the lasting beautification 
of this mile of park driveway comprises the 
following essential features : 1. The sunken 
lawn between the two boulevards is to be 
flooded, an improvement of which the beauty is 
obvious, and of which the practical advantages 
for sport and recreation are by no means incon- 
siderable. 2. Three ornamental bridges are 
to carry the principal north and south avenues 
over the lagoon thus artificially created. These 
bridges are to be dedicated, respectively, to 
Science, Art, and Faith, and what can be done 
with them needs no explanation to those who 
know the famous bridges of Paris and other 
European capitals. 3. Flanking the line of 
driveway on either side, a series of statues of 
the great idealists of the world perhaps a 
hundred of them is planned, to make an 
Avenue of Fame, or a cosmopolitan Valhalla, 
and suggest to the most casual passer-by the 
thought of Thucydides : " For the whole earth is 
the grave and monument of heroes ; it is not the 
mere graving upon marble in their native land 
which sets forth their deeds, but even in lands 
where they were strangers there lives an un- 
written record in every heart, felt though never 
embodied." 4. At the eastern end of this mile 
of monumental beauty, there is to be a great 
fountain representing the creation of man as 



symbolized in the Deukalion myth. Here, in 
his embodiment of 

" The unwrought shapes, the unmoulded attitudes, 
The tongues of earth, the stony craving eyes," 

here, in this casting backward of 

" The big seed 

Deukalion and Pyrrha sowed in hope 
To reap in terror ; the scarce-featured sons 
Of stone, and daughters of the sullen glebe," 

Mr. Taft should have an opportunity worthy of 
the genius of Rodin. It was in Chicago, a few 
years ago, that a great poet clothed this myth 
with the glory of immortal verse, why may it 
not be given to a Chicago sculptor to achieve 
in his own medium an equal beauty of expres- 
sion ? 5. At the western end, matching the 
Fountain of Deukalion, is to be another colossal 
group a Fountain of Time. Here, Time, a 
rugged crag-like figure, will review the proces- 
sion of humanity, surging past him like the 
waves of the ocean, " hurrying and crowding 
toward a goal they cannot see." The sculptor 
has thus conceived this group : 

" A warrior on horseback, flanked by banners and 
dancing figures, forms the centre of the composition, 
which fades off at the ends into creeping infancy or the 
bent and withered figures of age. The procession will 
seem to rise from a great jet of water on one side and 
sink from sight at the other, Time meanwhile standing 
firm and immovable. There is a suggestion of joyous 
onward movement in this procession and of the splendor 
and pageantry which life has achieved since that first 
great day of creation which the other fountain cele- 
brates." 

And the spirit of it all is perfectly expressed by 
this motto from Austin Dobson : 

" Time goes, you say ? Ah, no, 
Alas, Time stays; we go." 

It will be many years before this vast dream 
can be realized, and possibly it may never be 
realized in full, but if it is, the eyes of the world 
will be drawn to the scene of so much beauty, 
and men will make toilsome journeys for the joy 
of beholding it. At present, the authorities 
concerned are not committed to the plan in its 
entirety, and only the Fountain of Time is im- 
mediately projected. But we can hardly believe 
that when that feature of the plan shall have 
become fact it will be left as a fragment of the 
larger scheme. What is more likely is that it 
will so impose itself upon the sense of its be- 
holders as to create an imperative demand for 
the completion of the whole work. That such 
may be the outcome is the hope of all those whose 
thought has penetrated the significance of Mr. 
Taft's creative conception, and who have confi- 
dence in his possession of the genius necessary 
to work it out.

MODERNITY IN LITERATURE AND 
THE NEXT MO VEMENT. 

The last great world-encircling " cry " in litera- 
ture is stilled. The tumult and the shoutings of the 
captains of " realism " have died away. Of course 
there never was any such thing as realism. The 
good books produced by that movement do not differ 
in essentials from the good books evolved by any 
other recipe or formula invented by men. But some 
formula seems always to be needed as a rallying cry 
for authors and artists. And readers are thrown 
into buzzing excitement, as bees are summoned to 
swarm by the beating of a brazen kettle. 

The world-wide roar of the realistic movement 
has broken up into a hundred, a thousand, noises 
and motions. We are in the midst of whirlpools 
and eddies and waters that sway back and forth and 
seem to have no order or discipline or determined 
end. It is a day of individualism, naturalism, neo- 
romanticism, symbolism, revolutionary nihilism, sex 
celebration and sex enmity, social frivolity and 
nature seriousness, all these doctrines and dogmas 
and a myriad more are cried up. The prophets of 
unrighteousness have their innings and the defenders 
of law are dumb. The most rapidly disseminated 
philosophy of recent times, that of Nietzsche, is an 
invocation to chaos. "Is civilization a failure and 
is the Caucasian played out?" 

In default of any better term, these whirlings and 
blind motions of literature and art in the present 
may be called modernity. Modishness is its note. 
It aspires to be " brand new," up to date, " right off 
the bat." More decisively even than realism it tries 
to break with the past. It has an utter lack of rev- 
erence for the great work or established reputations 
of the past. It says to Homer and Dante and Shake- 
speare : " Go to ! We are as good as you." Its atti- 
tude might be typified by the story of an old English 
dauber, an imitator of Titian, who, staring in ecstasy 
at one of his own canvases, exclaimed: "What 
would old Tit think of this ? " The most curious 
feature of our passing madness is that we believe 
we have recreated a whole world of art and art-forms 
out of our own heads. 

Yet the fact remains that nothing in our recent 
output is new. In spite of the contortions and 
struggles of our novelists and playwrights and poets 
to be strong, to be daring, to be extreme, there is 
nothing that they utter which will compare in these 
qualities with much of the literature of the past. 
Take the exploitation of sexual passion and vice by 
which our contemporaries try to shock us. "Mrs. 
Warren's Profession " is milk and water beside the 
strong meat of " Measure for Measure " or " Peri- 
cles." "Three Weeks" has no standing at all as 
an aphrodisiac compared with Afra Behn or Ca- 
sanova. The soiled heroes and heroines of Mr. 
Wells's later novels are mere doves compared with 
the people in Fielding and Smollett and the Restor- 
ation comedy. Or take the studies of extreme low 
life which have been vaunted as a novelty of late. 



The thing has been done far more vividly and ex- 
plicitly by Defoe, not to go out of a single age or 
country. It is hard to beat " Moll Flanders " or 
"Colonel Jack." As for revolutionary literature, 
literature which proposes to itself to upset old exist- 
ing laws and conventions, what is the matter with 
Schiller's " Robbers," or with a great part of Burns, 
Byron, and Shelley ? 

Turning to the initiation of new art methods, 
symbolism is of course as old as the hills. Europe 
was saturated with it in the middle ages, and it 
created in the "Divine Comedy," the "Faerie 
Queene," and the " Roman de la Rose " works more 
monumental certainly than anything of recent date. 
Even Novalis's "Blue Flower" of a century ago is 
less platitudinous than Maeterlinck's "Blue Bird." 
Our new romanticism, where it is suffered to bloom 
at all, is rather a frail offshoot of an older stock; 
and the return to nature was preached and practiced 
better in a former age. 

On the whole, modernity does not seem to be either 
greatly original or overwhelmingly powerful. Yet it 
has been of advantage to the world in breaking up 
the serried ranks of realism, scattering the varied 
talents and giving a loose to individuality. It might 
be compared to the "dynamite plowing" now com- 
ing into vogue, which brings up a new surface 
to our farms. But something more than mere dis- 
turbances of dirt is needed to produce crops. Sun- 
light, air, and rain are the permanent and universal 
factors in agriculture. Is it fanciful to suggest that 
there are spiritual analogues to these same factors in 
farming, that ideal elements enter into life and 
art from above; that beauty, grace, grandeur, and 
sublimity are some of these elements ; that they have 
been allowed little chance to work upon, to aerate 
and elevate modern literature ; and finally that there 
is a hope, almost a promise, that this ideal contin- 
gent is about to swoop down upon our art and carry 
it to new heights? 

The present writer has never been able to accept 
the theory that beauty is the be-all and the end-all 
of art. One of the earliest and best expositions of 
this theory is to be found in Schiller's "^Esthetic 
Letters." Briefly stated, Schiller's idea is that art 
springs from man's profound dissatisfaction with 
ordinary life. Because of this dissatisfaction he 
reverts to the play instinct, the make-believe of child- 
hood, and fashions for himself a world where every- 
thing is harmonious, where beauty reigns supreme. 
In the first place, to criticize this, it is remarkable 
how little the beautiful or the harmonious comes 
into the play instinct or make-believe of childhood. 
Children are little mirrors, they satirically mock 
the doings of their elders; and things of fear and 
horror have a fascination for them. You cannot 
please them better than to frighten them as a bear 
or wolf. Punch and Judy, with their hideousness 
and brutality, exercise a perennial charm over them 
which Greek statues and Shakespearean comedies 
would fail to rival. When they begin to read, the 
literature they affect is the odd, the quaint, the ex.

travagant, and the bizarre, as witness "Mother 
Goose," " Alice in Wonderland," and Grimm's Fairy 
Tales. No, the root of beauty is certainly not in 
the childish mind. 

In the second place, no sooner has Schiller set 
forth his position that beauty is the first and final 
cause of art than he is compelled to divide it into 
two kinds, a calm and graceful beauty, and a vivid 
and energetic one. A little later on he has to drag 
in the Sublime; and in his discussions with Goethe 
he comes to the conclusion that the characteristic 
and the significant are factors in art co-equal with 
beauty itself. He ends, therefore, with a complex 
with which he might as well have begun. All art 
appeals to the feelings, the emotions, and the im- 
agination. We feel, are moved by, and imagine 
many other things beside beauty. The majority of 
men are more profoundly affected by things of fear 
and horror than they ever are by those of beauty. 

Nevertheless, ideas of beauty, and the cognate 
ideas of grandeur and sublimity, are good for us to 
consider and to live with. Else there were no growth, 
no ascent in life, only a dull plodding on in a level 
round or a downward slope to the abyss. But mod- 
ern literature has done its best to banish these ideas. 
It has fashioned idols for itself as ugly as the fetiches 
of South Sea islanders. It has made a law that one 
subject is as good as another, and that only execution 
counts. It has gone further, and turned its back on 
all that mankind had previously judged to be attrac- 
tive and desirable, and has dived and delved into 
purlieus and places of no regard. It has pushed 
aside the palaces and gardens and brought forth the 
alleys and the tenements. Swamps, deserts, barren 
farmsteads, factory-ridden suburbs, are its delighted 
haunts. And the human creations with which it 
peoples these abodes are suited to their surroundings. 
Now execution, if it is the execution of a genius, can 
do a great deal, but it is just as well to have material 
to begin with. There are hierarchies and ranks and 
gradations of interest in both nature and humanity. 
A rich and varied life to deal with is half the battle 
in art. If a great writer cannot get anything better 
than Walden Pond to celebrate, he may yet make 
something of it; but there are more possibilities in 
Lake Como. But the trend of modern literature 
towards not only the second best, but towards the 
worst in life, is all but universal. A few poets and 
mystics have stood out for beauty, nobility, and 
charm, but the greater part of Europe and America 
has been submerged by the ugly, the abnormal, the 
unclean, and the merely dull. Dickens was the last 
absolutely great creative artist of England. But 
for beauty he substituted picturesqueness, for charm 
the unflagging vivacity of animal spirits. His defi- 
ciency in the higher qualities makes him lag second 
in the race with Scott for the primacy of the English 
novel, though probably dowered with greater crea- 
tive genius. 

In the modern world there have been two great 
epochs when the Spirit of Beauty waved its wand 
before the eyes of man and made him see visions 



and wonders. The first of these was the Renais- 
sance, beginning with Dante and Petrarch and cul- 
minating in Shakespeare, with its bead-roll of mighty 
painters, architects, and artists of all kinds. In this 
epoch what man woke to realize was his own beauty 
and splendor and magnificence. He peered deep 
enough into the glooms and shadows of his life, but 
he was chiefly interested in its glories. The second 
awakening began with Rousseau and was continued 
by Goethe, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, Keats, and 
a great line of landscape painters. It revealed the 
outward world of nature, and for a while humanity 
was intoxicated with the glories of its temporal 
home. 

Literature to-day has about exhausted the common 
and the chaotic. Pretty nearly all the dull and dis- 
agreeable places of the world have been discovered 
and exploited ; pretty nearly all the diseases and 
disgraces and brutalities and banalities of human 
nature have been tabulated and typified. It is time 
that the Spirit of Beauty should again put forth her 
power and impel art to a new advance. Ideals of 
harmony and happiness should be reinstated in the 
human mind as possibilities, at least, of possession. 
Design, order, distinction, should set their seals again 
on literary work. Will the Spirit of Democracy 
oppose the Spirit of Beauty? I do not think so. 
It was the mob of a democratic city which carried 
Cimabue's picture in triumph through the streets. 
It was the workers, craftsmen, masons, laborers, who 
gave the work of their hands and their means to the 
building of the cathedrals of Europe, and who felt 
repaid by the glory of the growing fanes. Democ- 
racy may have a passion for art ; and even if this 
were not so, we are not all going to be democratized 
into pigs. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



PLEASIXG THE PLAY-GOER is commonly the first 
object of the theatre-manager ; and the average play- 
goer's taste in drama is not accounted very refined. 
Yet there are not wanting signs that good, wholesome 
plays, plays even that are ranked as classic, are what 
the people really desire, if they are given a fair 
chance to indicate their preference. One recent 
noteworthy sign of this encouraging sort is found in 
the increasing success of the municipally owned and 
conducted theatre at Northampton, Mass., where the 
works of Shakespeare, Moliere, Ibsen, and other 
masters, are received with genuine enjoyment by the 
inhabitants of that New England manufacturing and 
trading town, which at the same time, it will not be 
forgotten, is something of an educational centre, 
with its Smith College, its Forbes Library, and other 
institutions of literature and learning. It is but four 
months ago that this first and only municipal play- 
house in America entered upon its present policy of 
appealing to the people for its support in maintain- 
ing a good stock company with a repertory of only

the best that dramatic literature has to offer ; and 
already the Northampton public has been educated 
up to the high purpose of this praiseworthy venture, 
and now the pecuniary receipts are exceeding the 
expenses of the undertaking, even with a very low 
scale of prices for seats. The play-goers themselves 
are consulted as to what plays shall be presented, 
and they are even invited to attend rehearsals and 
to go behind the scenes and make any useful sug- 
gestions. It is related, indeed, that when a fear was 
expressed lest too much expense was being lavished 
on scenery, the scene-painter transferred his canvas 
and colors to the open street and there demonstrated 
how quickly and cheaply a ball-room interior could 
be converted into a mountain landscape. The first 
families, we are told, vie with one another in offering 
the use of such properties and costumes as their an- 
cestral homes and well-filled wardrobes may contain. 
Really the whole thing is almost too good to be true, 
but our personal acquaintance with Northampton 
inclines us to believe it is true. Though not all 
towns can boast a population of so high average 
intelligence as is there to be found, yet it may be 
not too wild a dream to picture the municipal theatre 
as some day no rarer a sight, in cities of some size, 
than the public library, the art gallery, the museum, 
and the zo5logical garden. 



PROFESSOR EITCKEN ON GOETHE, as briefly re- 
ported by Mr. Frank B. Sanborn for the Springfield 
" Republican," will interest those who were unable 
to attend the eminent German scholar's Lowell Insti- 
tute lectures, just concluded. Mr. Sanborn writes: 
"Dr. Rudolph Eucken closed this evening his course of 
seven discourses on philosophic idealism and realism, 
in which two were especially noteworthy on Kant 
and Goethe, the latter considered as a philosopher, 
in which character he rather declined to appear. 
Goethe was fundamentally a poet, and only a philos- 
opher by his second intention, so to speak ; and nat- 
urally his philosophy was often poetically expressed. 
There was a broad field, however, outside of both 
poetry and philosophy technically considered, in 
which Goethe was both a 'Spazierganger,' or tourist, 
and a 'Lustwandler,' or park-prom enader; in this 
field many sciences and arts were included. In some 
of these he was a student, even a discoverer; in 
others merely on parade. Under all these, as under 
his verse and his dramatic and novel composition, 
lay his ground conception of the universe, of Nature, 
and of life ; and to these Professor Eucken gave his 
chief attention. Consequently the great variety and 
versatility of the poet were but glanced at ; his love 
of pleasure and of pleasure-giving, through art, were 
touched upon as parts of the apparatus for self-culture, 
to which he recalled the vaguely wandering enthu- 
siasm of Germany, while he delighted his country- 
men by songs and epigrams. Several of these the 
lecturer quoted in German, though the body of the 
lectures was in English, with which, as a language 
for reading, he is very familiar. He is not much 



accustomed to English elocution, however, and could 
not easily be followed, from his inflections and em- 
phasis, which were German rather than American. 
His voice is good, his presence attractive, with ruddy 
face, white hair and beard, and a quick, spirited 
manner of attacking his sentences." 



NOVELS READ BY NOVELISTS in their moments 
of leisure ought to bear some relation, if one knew 
what it was, to the novels written by them. Does 
the rule of the attraction of opposites hold here, or 
the law that "like will to like," or both, or neither? 
The London "Book Monthly" recently printed a 
collection of solicited communications on the subject 
of women novelists' favorite reading. Some of these 
letters, whose writers are themselves novelists of the 
fair sex, remind one of the self-sufficient young au- 
thor's declaration, " I do n't read books, I write 'em." 
But in general the correspondents show themselves to 
be great readers. Miss Elinor Glyn writes, "in great 
haste," that she hardly ever reads a novel from one 
year's end to another, and gives no indication that 
she is attracted to other forms of literature. Miss 
Beatrice Harraden reads "chiefly biography now- 
adays"; another professes herself "an incurable 
novel-reader," never tiring of Charlotte Bronte and 
Jane Austen, and able to read "Kim " over and over 
again with enjoyment; still another puts Fielding 
first among her fiction favorites, with Richardson a 
"far-away second," and Wilkie Collins's "Moon- 
stone" in the front rank as a "thriller." "But far 
above all novels," she concludes, "for pure interest 
and living excitement I put mental science in any 
shape or form, from Professor James's 'Varieties of 
Religious Experience' down to the proceedings of 
the Psychical Research Society. Particularly fasci- 
nating to me are all works dealing with the most 
uncanny subject in the world, multiple personality. 
For a sedative there is nothing better than a memoir ;. 
and for a tonic, Professor Bergson, or such a modern 
poet as Mr. James Mackereth. And when English 
sentiment is too luscious I turn to Anatole France 
and his 'Gospel of Irony,' but for a sense of space 
and peace to the Greek plays." Thus declares Miss 
M. P. Willcocks. 

USE AND ABUSE OF PRIVATE PAPERS deposited 
in public libraries are considerations governing the 
freedom of access allowed to such papers. In con- 
nection with the recent acquisition of important col- 
lections of this sort by the Library of Congress (we 
note especially the Louise Chandler Moulton papers, 
comprising letters from many famous authors, living 
and dead), a few timely words find place in the cur- 
rent annual report of the librarian. Good faith and 
seriousness of purpose must be evident in the appli- 
cant for permission to consult manuscripts. " Papers 
of recent date are naturally kept from general inspec- 
tion more rigidly than collections of very old manu- 
scripts. Letters of or concerning people still living 
are guarded with the greatest care, lest they be mis- 
used. . . . This policy is required, not only in the 



126 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



interest of sound historical science, as opposed to sen- 
sationalism, but also in the interest of the Library's 
efforts to obtain collections of historical papers. 
Owners of collections of family papers naturally feel 
a reluctance to part with them, if they believe that 
when deposited with the Library, they must become 
accessible to every enquirer. The reluctance disap- 
pears, however, when it is known that judgment is 
exercised in permitting entrance to the collections." 
It is to be noted that the custodian of these manu- 
script treasures at Washington is troubled with few 
applications from those whose discretion cannot be 
relied upon, and few complaints are made of undue 
severity in the restrictions none at all by scholars 
familiar with the rules governing the use of manu- 
scripts in other institutions. 



THE EDUCATIONAL USE OF CURRENT NEWS AND 

REVIEWS, as such news and reviews are to be found 
in some of the best of our periodicals, is gaining 
recognition in public schools of the higher grades, 
in schools of journalism, and elsewhere. One well- 
known weekly publication of this character takes 
justifiable pride in the fact that it has been selected 
as a means of instruction in current history and liter- 
ature by a number of teachers and school superin- 
tendents in various cities, and it issues an interesting 
account of the methods adopted in using this some- 
what novel form of textbook, with testimonials from 
a number of teachers. The superintendent of the 
New York City schools said lately in a circular 
letter to teachers : "It will be well for the teacher 
to make use of recent or contemporary literature. 
Many pupils have a not unnatural suspicion of 
* classics.' They have a natural interest in what 
other people are reading and talking about. They 
should be induced to read the better magazines."" 
A high- school teacher, after naming other good re- 
sults following upon the use of current periodical 
literature in the classroom, adds : " The dictionary 
and encyclopaedia are becoming live books because 
they help to throw light upon live questions. The 
real importance and meaning of culture is being 
appreciated because of the discovery of the bearing 
which the world's accumulation of knowledge has 
upon the everyday events of our own time." Incident- 
ally, action and reaction being equal and opposite, 
this educational use of periodical literature ought 
to lift the periodical press to a somewhat higher 
level and keep it there. 



THE TREND OF THE BRITISH BOOK-TRADE is Still 

upward, in respect to quantity, whatever its quality 
may be. Statistics for the past year show an increase 
of more than a thousand titles over the year before 
in the number of books published, or a sum total of 
nearly thirteen thousand for 1912. That the novel 
has not yet entered upon the decline lately predicted 
for it by certain would-be prophets, seems to be indi- 
cated by the presence on the list of nearly twenty- 
three hundred fiction-titles, an increase of about three 
hundred over the preceding year. Next to the novel 



the favorite with the British reader is the religious 
book, and he has had a choice of 934 such works 
among the year's new books, so that if he felt him- 
self undergoing moral deterioration from too much 
novel-reading he had at hand a ready antidote to the 
pleasant poison ; and, conversely, the sermon-reader, 
nodding at length over the " sixthlies " and " seventh- 
lies" of his favorite divine, had always within easy 
reach an abundance of lighter and livelier literature. 
The sciences, the arts, and the industries were all 
well represented in the twelve months' book-product. 
How long it will be before the tide turns and the pres- 
ent too-rapid rate of increase in book-manufacture 
gives place to a more wholesome retrenchment, re- 
mains to be seen. One good book issued in an edi- 
tion of ten thousand copies is, as a rule, of greater 
benefit to all concerned than ten books of lesser worth 
published in editions of a thousand copies each. But 
this curtailment of output may be a thing now past 
hoping for. ... 

ONE LIBRARY'S NEEDS, that library being the 
Enoch Pratt Free Library of Baltimore, are stated 
plainly and in some detail by Dr. Bernard C. 
Steiner, the librarian, in his annual report to the 
trustees lately assembled in yearly conclave. As in 
the case of some other public institutions, it might 
be shorter and simpler to state what the Baltimore 
library does not need than to enumerate its defi- 
ciencies of equipment. A new central building, or a 
very considerable addition to the present structure, 
will occur to everyone who has visited the library 
as its most urgent want. "The last year," says Dr. 
Steiner, "has brought nearer the time when it will 
be impossible to have any more books in the Central 
Library, which is greatly over-crowded. We do not 
see any possibility of placing a sufficient additional 
number of shelves anywhere in the building to 
accommodate any considerable number of books." 
New branch buildings are also wanted, and more 
money for books, and an increased appropriation 
for maintenance, and an extension of the open-shelf 
system, which will of course be another item of 
expense, and, in fact, quantities of things that every 
modern library needs and that every municipal 
appropriations-committee grudgingly grants. Will 
the progressive public library ever cease to remind 
us of the horseleech's insatiate daughters? Let us 
hope not. ... 

A YOUNG ENGLISH POET'S VISIT TO AMERICA is 
an occasion of interest to all concerned, especially 
when the poet is of the standing of the gifted Mr. 
Alfred Noyes, whose welcome to Boston is just now 
being planned by the Authors' Club and other soci- 
eties and individuals of that seat of culture and learn- 
ing. The Wellesley College students and faculty 
are to have the pleasure of hearing him read from 
his own poems on the twenty-seventh of this month, 
and other readings elsewhere are in prospect. Mr. 
Noyes's early attainment of recognition for his work 
is noteworthy. The magazines and reviews were 
hospitable to him from the first, and his initial vol-

ume of verse, "The Loom of Years," appeared when 
he was but twenty-two years old, soon to be followed 
by his "Robin Hood," "Flowers of Old Japan," and 
other works. The writing of the life of William 
Morris for the " English Men of Letters " series was 
assigned to him. ... 

COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL BOARD AND 
LIBRARY BOARD is becoming more and more the 
order of the day. An interesting account of what 
is effected in that particular at Grand Rapids is 
published by the public library of that city. In 
addition to the school collections of books for the 
use of the school children, there are now in operation 
six regular branch libraries in as many school build- 
ings, established by joint agreement of the two boards 
concerned, the one supplying the necessary quarters 
with heat, light, and janitor service, the other fur- 
nishing books, periodicals, card-catalogue, attendants, 
free lectures, and weekly story hour. Some of these 
branch libraries have as many as three thousand 
books on their shelves, with current periodicals to 
the number of twenty-five or thirty, and the com- 
bined circulation of all the school branches was last 
year nearly a third of a million. 

MR. HAROLD MONRO AND HIS POETRY SHOP are 
objects of interest in the London book world just 
now, and it is to be hoped by poetry-lovers that the 
interest will continue. Mr. Monro offers something 
novel in the bookselling business in the form of a 
bookshop devoted wholly to poetry a poetry shop, 
as he calls it off Theobald's Road, Bloomsbury; 
and one of his brother poets, Mr. Henry Newbolt, 
has wished the daring enterprise prosperity in a 
speech. In this interesting shop are to be found 
shelves devoted each to a particular poet of some 
prominence, while the lesser bards, the poets of a 
single slender volume, are, we assume, assembled in 
pleasant company. But no friend to the poets can 
wish these volumes a peaceful repose; rather, may 
they speedily give place to others, with an accom- 
panying transfer of the currency of the realm to 
Mr. Monro's cash-drawer.

THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS has been 
established by vote of the President and Fellows 
of Harvard University, and will devote itself to the 
publication of works of a high scholarly character, 
especially the products of the pens of Harvard men. 
For some time the University printing office has 
issued the annual catalogue and certain department 
pamphlets, with a number of learned periodicals. 
Now these publishing activities are to be reorgan- 
ized and enlarged, so that the Harvard University 
Press shall take rank with similar publishing depart- 
ments at other seats of learning. Incidentally the 
interesting fact is recalled that it was at Harvard 
College that the first printing-press in America was 
set up, in 1639, in President Dunster's house, and 
that from this primitive press came, among other 
books of more or less fame, the Bay Psalm Book and 
the Apostle Eliot's Indian translation of the Bible. 



COMMUNICATION. 

THE REFERENDUM IN ART. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I should like to say a word on one point in Professor 
Cockerell's letter in your last number. I must confess 
that I have not much claim to be heard, for I do not 
think the matter as important as he does. The picture 
made very little impression upon me when I first saw 
it, but it impressed him so that he was quite upset for 
at least three hours. I cannot claim his earnestness. 
Still, as he is going to make a mistake, I want to act 
the part of Cassandra. 

It will be for others to defend the picture if they see 
fit. Professor Cockerell thinks it immoral because bad, 
and bad because immoral (" essentially bad, and there- 
fore immoral"; "good taste based on fundamental 
morality "). This may be so, but the view expressed in 
Professor Cockerell's letter is not convincing on first 
thoughts. He thinks the features of the lady awry and 
the colors lurid and unnatural. But the features of 
almost everybody are a little awry, I am told, and the 
colors in many not immoral homes are a little lurid and 
unnatural. " The White Rose " may be exaggerated, 
but the old story in the Fourth Reader teaches us that 
exaggeration, even coarseness in execution, may be one 
of the necessities of art. 

The really important thing, however, is the summary 
of postcards. The result of this inquirendo will be as 
follows: There will be a number of persons with views 
like Professor Cockerell's who will write to him at once. 
There will be a slightly smaller number who are opposed 
to him who will write, on the whole, a little later. These 
two classes will be controversialists, and their opinions 
will not be of value, except for students of that branch 
of un-Systematic Zoology known as Human Nature. 
There will also be a number of genuine impressions 
from people interested in the question itself. There 
will not be enough of these to "be more than a contri- 
bution to aesthetic material, but the proportion will be 
somewhat in favor of those who do not like the picture. 

If one could get a really representative opinion, the 
inquiry would be of value. If Professor Cockerell 
desires a representative opinion, that is, if he thinks 
the question of importance, if he will be a scientist out 
of his chair as well as in it, if he is doing more than 
starting a magazine discussion, he should, I believe, 
go about it in another way. He ought to cut the 
picture out of the " Century " and stick it on a piece of 
paste board, with a pencil attached to it by a string, 
and then go about Boulder, and make a nuisance of 
himself by asking everybody to say how the picture 
affected them when first seen. Or he might show them 
the picture, and himself note their behavior. When he 
had five hundred or a thousand impressions he would 
have something unique in aesthetic, and of great value 
to anyone who knew how to use it. 

May I add that I approve highly of the general prin- 
ciple of the Referendum in Art, as well as in Politics. 
The true aesthetic value of anything must be measured 
by the permanent impression made upon the greatest 
number. (This, I believe, is the view of Marshall: 
"Pain, Pleasure, and Esthetics"; and Santayana: 
"The Sense of Beauty"; and also, with pragmatic 
attachment, of Walter Pater, at the end of his essay on 
Style.) EDWARD E. HALE.

[Feb. 16, 



THE KINGDOM OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IN 
AMERICAN LIFE.* 



Dr. Rauschenbusch's "Christianity and the 
Social Crisis," published some five years ago, 
met a need among thinking people so adequately 
that one was inclined to agree with the author 
that he had " said all that God had given him to 
say on our social problems." Yet his new book, 
"Christianizing the Social Order," proves a 
work of hardly less importance. 

The first book was an historic survey ; it re- 
viewed the roots in Judaism of a socialized 
democracy, the blossoming of the ideal in the 
Teachings of Jesus, the hampered development 
in Christian history ; and it led to a discussion of 
the modern duty to realize Christianity on the 
social side. Almost at that point the present 
book takes up the theme, expanding and sup- 
plementing the treatment of the ideas of Jesus, 
but carrying the fundamental theme of the 
Kingdom of Righteousness out into the very 
midst of our complexities and bewilderments. 
In some ways it is a better book than the other. 
The writing is more brilliant. The animus 
against a sacramental and sacerdotal form of 
Christianity which seemed to some readers to 
mar the impartiality of "Christianity and the 
Social Crisis " is less in evidence. There is 
persuasive sanity, force in concrete application, 
and uncompromising courage. Of the earlier 
work it has been said that it is a book without 
any hate in it. "So far as I know my own soul 
that is true of this book also," says the author. 
The claim is just. Yet many a page is aglow with 
the " wrath of the Lamb." Dr. Rauschenbusch 
has an exceptional command of sardonic speech. 
Perhaps it is a power given by fearless honesty. 
At all events, the trenchant phrases dissipate 
self-deception and dislodge conscience from 
many an easy refuge. The driving directness 
renders thought of literary qualities insignifi- 
cant ; yet the author is master of an individual 
style, admirable in cogency and actuality, rich 
in metaphor "pris sur le vif." In spite of an 
occasional lapse from dignity, the colloquialisms 
used are usually effective. Perhaps the book 
deals too much with transitory and technical 
matters to be literature in the highest sense; 
but many of the best qualities that create liter- 
ature are found in it. 

The recent awakening of nation and Church 

* CHRISTIANIZING THE SOCIAL OBDBR. By Walter 
Rauschenbusch. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



is first presented in a way that will bring home 
to many in and out of the churches how far 
organized religion has deliberately travelled in 
a radical direction ; how far it stands committed 
both to responsibility for social leadership and to 
a definite economic programme of an advanced 
type. "The social interest in the Church has 
now run beyond the stage of the solitary 
pioneer ; it has been admitted within the organ- 
izations." An inspiriting review, communion 
by communion, suggests both how general is the 
awakening and how great the waiting task. A 
note of suspense is struck with characteristic 
candor in the following: 

" I confess that my faith falters in the very act of 
professing it. The possibilities are so vast, so splendid, 
so far-reaching, so contradictory of all historic prece- 
dent, that my hope may be doomed to failure. The 
American Churches may write one more chapter in the 
long biography of the disappointed Christ, which our 
sons will read with shame and our enemies with scorn. 
But for the present the East is aflame with the day of 
Jehovah, and a thousand voices are calling. If failure 
comes, may it find our sword broken at the hilt." 

In Part II., "The Revolutionary Destiny of 
Christianity," we return to the firm foundation 
of the social teachings of Jesus. The facile 
platitudes to which these teachings are reduced 
by the sentimentalist meet with summary dis- 
posal: "Love," left in helpless liquidity, "It 
is indeed love that we want, but it is socialized 
love"; "Stewardship," calling for no change in 
economic distribution, but simply for faithful 
disbursement of funds ; " The Golden Rule," a 
span measure "hardly long enough to survey 
and lay out the building site of the New Jeru- 
salem"; the impossible call to literal imitation 
of the life of Jesus. The inadequacy of all 
these "truly religious ideas" leaves the demand 
for a religious basis to our task still unanswered. 
Such basis Dr. Rauschenbusch finds in the con- 
ception of the Kingdom of God. With fresh 
force, albeit traversing ground familiar in his 
first book, he points out the essentially social 
and practical nature of this ideal as it lay in the 
Mind of Jesus. Is it possible that he belittles 
unduly the Apocalyptic element in the Master's 
thought? Must we dismiss this element, so 
prominent in the Gospels, as a misreading of 
His mind or an unfortunate survival ? Or may 
we see here, under local limitations, a strangely 
wise perception that social development depends 
not only on quiet growth but on visible catas- 
trophe, and that as Kropotkin claims, revolu- 
tionary crises are a necessary part of evolution? 
Viewed in this light, the most perplexing factor 
in the faith of the early Church gains permanent

meaning and value. At all events, the idea of 
the Reign of Righteousness on earth shines out 
concrete and majestic from these pages. The 
eclipse of this idea, and the necessity that it be 
restored to the personal religion of the future, 
is then briefly sketched. 

How sharp the contrast between that social 
vision and the reality ! In Part III., " Our Semi- 
Christian Social Order," honesty as well as 
optimism have full sweep. It dwells first on the 
social domains which have slowly and painfully 
come under the sway of Christ's Law: the 
family, the Church itself, education, and save 
the mark! politics. "I confess to some mis- 
givings in moving that this brother be received 
among the regenerate, but I plead on his behalf 
that he is a newly-saved sinner." A good case 
is made out, by an interesting argument; yet 
the reader feels that the author has been hard 
put to it if he must adduce "this brother" as a 
witness. He is obliged to confess that " in prac- 
tice we are a nation of backsliders"; yet "these 
things are in the nature of a derailment of justice, 
the road bed and the trackage are still there even 
when the train is ditched." 

Fortified, we turn to the " unregenerate 
sections" of our common life. This book is con- 
structive, yet more than 160 pages go to pure 
indictment; and even when we turn from " The 
Invasion of God's Country" to "The Direction 
of Progress," indignation calls us back. In 
the attempt to write most positively, the pen 
lingers, tipped with acid or fire, over all that 
hampers our Christian will. The discussion 
covers sadly familiar ground, but in a manner 
so fresh and pungent that the most jaded mind 
finds its reaction from our modern sins sharp- 
ened and focussed. The point of view is Chris- 
tian, not economic: "Does our business system 
create sound and noble manhood ? Does it make 
it fairly easy to do right and hard to do wrong? 
Does it call men upward or tempt them down- 
ward?" Answers are obvious; the treatment is 
ironic^ unsparing, fully cognizant of individual 
helplessness, yet none the less never blinking 
the moral responsibility of each of us to help 
the collective action which shall release us from 
our collective chains. "Such power on the one 
hand and such weakness on the other constitute 
a solicitation to sin to which human nature ought 
never to be subjected." " A reign of competi- 
tion is a reign of fear. ... A reign of fear is 
never a reign of God." Such are some among 
the terse summaries of the outcome of capitalism. 
One, is tempted to cull quotations, to dwell on 
the caustic presentation of facts. Facts about 



adulteration: "A new process makes an emul- 
sion of skim milk for ice-cream that looks like 
the richest kind of cream. That ought to be a 
great saving to the country. But this is a hymn 
of many verses. We must chant the rest on the 
Day of Judgment." Facts about the muzzling 
of the press. And facts about education : " The 
great givers are acting like a soft pedal on the 
piano. There is probably not a teacher with a 
real message to our age who has not felt com- 
pelled by consideration for himself and his insti- 
tution to soften and dull down the very things 
that most demand utterance." These be plain 
words, my brethren : they afford pleasant read- 
ing, heart-breaking thinking. All is free 
from hysteria or over-statement. When Dr. 
Rauschenbusch has finished marshalling his 
evidence, "The Case of Christianity against 
Capitalism" is complete. 

It has been complete this many a year ; and 
one turns eagerly to the later constructive dis- 
cussion, as to how a Christian economic order 
should be constituted. Perhaps slight disap- 
pointment awaits one. There is a drop, as the 
author is aware, from the high levels of religious 
thought to schemes for protecting the laborer, 
socializing land, guaranteeing employment. 
These ideas, the usual programme of economic 
advance, are unluckily losing their freshness 
almost before they get out into life. But as the 
sure fight gathers round them they will regain it. 
Meantime, the descent from religious passion to 
a precise programme of reform is one phase of 
that voluntary self-humiliation of the divine 
which is the world's salvation. At least, the dis- 
cussion does not satisfy itself with easy truisms. 
The elasticity and modesty of mind are refresh- 
ing. "There is only one thing which I am pre- 
pared to assert with absolute confidence about 
coming events : that they will not happen in the 
way I expect them to happen." Yet the pro- 
posals are cheerily concrete, a true help to the 
necessary task of " translating the fundamental 
utterances of the Mind of Christ" into "terms 
large enough to make them fully applicable 
to modern social life." Like all of us, Dr. 
Rauschenbusch stands for the abolition of spe- 
cial privilege; like all good socialists, he vindi- 
cates the sacred rights of property, pointing out 
that "a condition in which millions of people 
have no share at all in the productive capital 
of the nation . . . debases humanity, under- 
mines the Republic, and desiccates religion."

Defense League," on page 351. There is plea 
for the indefinite enlargement of the collective 
form of property. " Economic Democracy " and 
"The Economic Basis of Fraternity" are two 
good formulae under which the discussion pro- 
ceeds. The last formula leads beyond detail 
into the demand for " the evolution of a coopera- 
tive economic organization as wide as society," 
which is obviously "the largest constructive 
moral task ever undertaken." Yet the next 
chapter shows the task to be no novelty, point- 
ing out in cogent fashion the transmission of 
this highest instinct for social organization down 
the ages, from the days of tribal communism 
through monasticism, to the expression of fra- 
ternal ideals in the collegiate communities 
of our own day. Having then reached "The 
Powers of the Coming Age" we review modern 
tendencies in the same direction. The coopera- 
tive movement, organized labor, and single tax 
agitation prepare us for a fairly full consideration 
of socialism. The author's brotherly yet severe 
treatment of the false emphasis and the innate 
dangers of political and party socialism, renders 
all the more effective his grave and distinct align- 
ment of himself with the socialist movement in 
its broader but no less definite sense. 

We have been studying " The Direction of 
Progress "; we turn in conclusion to " The 
Methods of Advance." The finely democratic 
treatment recognizes the full value of that 
working-class movement on which philanthropy 
and reform too often look askance. Clever 
application of the Scriptures is a specialty of 
Dr. Rauschenbusch. He tells us that education 
has performed for the torpid classes of society the 
miracle Elisha performed on the Shunammite's 
son, when he warmed the dead body till the child 
sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. " The 
working class has sneezed seventy times seven. 
It looks like convulsions, but it means the awak- 
ening of life." And again in more sober vein : 
" If the banner of the Kingdom of God is to enter 
through the gates of the future, it will have to 
be carried by the tramping hosts of labor." 

Yet the book ends on the note of stirring 
appeal to the privileged and the religious in the 
name of the faith they profess. At the outset 
this note had been struck : " It rests largely 
with the Churches whether the emancipation 
of the working classes will come by a gradual 
and peaceful evolution of society or whether we 
are to have the folly and woe of the civil war 
over again." Now the note is repeated. The 
Marxian may be right in his cynicism. Perhaps 
no class will ever as a whole vote away its own 



privileges. Nevertheless " men and women of 
the wealthy class who have been converted to 
the people as well as to God can perform a 
service of the highest value by weakening the 
resistance which their classes will inevitably 
offer to the equalization of property." " In- 
dividuals will respond : more of them, I believe, 
than in any similar situation in history before." 
" Even a few renegades from the rich are inval- 
uable. It takes a sharp blow from the outside 
to crack an eggshell: the soft bill of a chick 
can break it from within." 

And the conclusion of the whole matter is 
that the Church " must send out men and 
women to finish up the work which Christ 
began. Is the Church supplying society with 
the necessary equipment of such personalities ? 
Let us grant that it can never reach all : but 
is it making Christian revolutionists of those 
whom it does teach and control?" 

Such a Christian revolutionist at all events 
is Dr. Rauschenbusch himself. " Those men 
who have kept their mental balance against the 
dogmatism of the cruder types of socialism, who 
have guarded the purity of their life against the 
looseness of modern morals, who have cherished 
the devoutness of intimate religion in the 
drought of scepticism, but who have also ab- 
sorbed the socialist analysis of our collective 
sins and the socialist hope of a fraternal democ- 
racy, stand as a class marked by God as his 
own." The writer of such a book as this is one 
of those heralds on whom he calls : 

" Trumpeter, rally us, rally us, rally us 
On to the City of God."

MODERN HTJMAXISM.* 



It was only a short time ago that John 
Addington Symonds, in his "Essays, Specula- 
tive and Suggestive," summed up with sanity 
and sweep the solemn function of the critic. 

" In order to profit by the vast extension of artistic 
knowledge in this generation and to avoid the narrow- 
ness of sects and cliques, the main thing for us is to 
form a clear conception of the mental atmosphere in 
which sound criticism has to live and move and have its 
being. 'The form of this world passes; and I would 
fain occupy myself with that only which constitutes 
abiding relations.' So said Goethe; and these words 
have much the same effect as that admonition of his, 
to live with steady purpose in the Whole, the Good, 
the Beautiful.' The true critic must divest his mind 
from what is transient and ephemeral, must fasten upon 
abiding relations, bleibende Verhaltnisse."

Irving Babbitt. Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co.

THE DIAL 



131 



If the critic is to accept such an exalted creed 
he can no longer live, as so many are doing, in 
dalliance with his own lawless moods. To be 
sure, Symonds's younger contemporary, Oscar 
Wilde, would have taken another path, and with 
clash of cymbal and riotous song would have 
led us along the path of "the great confusion" 
which Sainte-Beuve foresaw. But despite the 
fact that Wilde promised with his luxurious 
impressionism somehow to regenerate the world, 
despite the fact that the influence of " The Critic 
as Artist " tinges some of the soberest utterances 
of many later critics (such a penetrating essay, for 
instance, as Mr. Lewis Gates's "Impressionism 
and Appreciation"), Anglo-Saxondom has re- 
coiled from the gospel which would lead us to the 
flickering irony of Kenan's later years or compel 
us with Anatole France to "despise men ten- 
derly." With all his specious exaltation, Wilde 
could not in good faith have subscribed to the 
lofty yet tempered dictum of William Sharp : 

"When I speak of Criticism I have in mind not 
merely the more or less deft use of commentary or 
indication but one of the several ways of literature and 
in itself a rare and fine art: the marriage of science 
that knows and of spirit that discerns. The basis of 
Criticism is imagination, its spiritual quality is simpli- 
city, its intellectual distinction is balance." 

Here, without surrendering the new honors 
that the impressionist has claimed for criticism, 
is a sober ideal instead of smart paradox. 
Where, however, shall we seek for this balance? 
Just how may we occupy ourselves with the 
abiding relations of things? The historian of 
criticism will find several brilliant answers 
among latter-day American critics. He will find 
something of the wisdom of poetry in the essay 
of Mr. Gates, though he will note that "ap- 
preciation," however tempered by richness of 
historical equipment and sensitive knowledge of 
one's own age, loses sureness in its abnegation 
of the critic's memorial right to judge, and loses 
sweep and inspiration in consenting to be for its 
own age alone. The historian will be stimulated 
by Professor Trent's essay on " The Authority of 
Criticism," in which, with his characteristic keen 
sense of both sides of a question, the author maps 
out domains in which the criticism of tradition 
and the criticism of impressions may do their 
best work. But the historian may well wish that 
the two criticisms could have been more closely 
fused. The historian will enjoy the drastic 
iconoclasm of Professor Spingarn's "The New 
Criticism." But after the shouting and the 
tumult dies and he finds himself with only the 
talisman, " What has the poet tried to express 
and how has he expressed it?" which Professor 



Spingarn takes from the Germans and Carlyle 
as the sole vital and unifying concern of criticism, 
the historian will be fain to ask himself how such 
a slender relic will save him from "the great 
confusion." A few of Professor Spingarn's 
applications will make this danger clear. His 
assault on the criticism by genres is wantonly 
destructive of a method that has brought us 
views penetrating as often as pedantic.* In his 
repudiation of all moral judgment in literature 
he falls into the modern heresy of talking about 
things, including art, for their own sake, as if 
life were as staccato as an index. In his con- 
temptuous dismissal of all efforts at a theory of 
style he but sends us back to a rereading of a 
long line of great essays that make us, despite 
their inconsistencies, nod our heads and smile 
at the image-breaker and wonder whether such 
profound speculations are indeed never to be 
increased in the land. No, this talisman is too 
slight and too explosive. With less reservation 
we read Mr. Paul Elmer More's oracular utter- 
ances in the seventh series of the "Shelburne 
Essays." We find much to ponder in his tracing 
of a spiritual family, after the manner of a Sainte- 
Beuve, which includes Cicero and Erasmus, 
Boileau and Arnold, and which quietly sets the 
influence of these men above the fulminations 
of a Saint Paul, a Luther, a Carlyle. We ap- 
prehend the fine subtlety with which he seizes 
upon that theory of concentrated race-experience 
which set Walter Pater to dreaming morbidly if 
enchantingly over La Gioconda and with which 
Oscar Wilde would have freed his cult of sultry 
egoists from moral and social responsibility; 
and we follow the noble enthusiasm with which 
the American critic rescues this conception of 
an inheritance of "the unconquerable hopes and 
defeated fears of an immeasurable past, the trag- 
edies and the comedies of love, the ardent aspi- 
rations of faith, the baffled questionings of evil, 
the huge laughter at facts, the deep-welling pas- 
sion of peace " for a discipline making up its loss 
of original intensity with a significance and de- 
sign, a new unity in which ephemeral life is win- 
nowed and " fitted into that great ring of eternity 
which Henry Vaughan saw as in a dream." And 
having reached an apex in this hymnlike human- 
istic solution, we are prepared to consider Profes- 
sor Babbitt's " The Masters of Modern French 
Criticism," not as a climax after Mr. More's 
golden words, but as an elaborate and memorable 
case for humanism and the dignity of criticism.

mere's "The Popular Ballad " for some keen suggestions for

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



It is refreshing by contrast with the narrow 
view of criticism which stifles us for all Profes- 
sor Saintsbury's learning, taste, and exuberance 
in his massive History, to open a book which, 
from a most comprehensive survey of the bril- 
liant men who have done more than any other 
nation or age for criticism, ramifies in a set of 
doctrines which shape for us, at least in outline, 
a theory of conduct, a theory of education, a 
philosophy, along with a theory of criticism. 
Many of our readers are already familiar with 
Professor Babbitt's formula. In his " Liter- 
ature and the American College " and in " The 
New Laokoon " he assumed a role more dicta- 
torial than any English critic since Matthew 
Arnold, with the possible exception of Mr. 
More, and legislated with rich scholarship and 
an insight that has made his assurance at once 
impressive and natural. He would have us 
mediate between the romantic emotionalism 
that still flows strong from Rousseau, and the 
scientific naturalism that has swept over and 
dazzled all modern beliefs and aspirations, with 
a humanistic discipline that at present finds little 
voice, but which has claimed, since the days of 
Plato at least, an imposing minority of seers 
who have championed it more or less completely. 
To many of us so long attuned to the nineteenth- 
century philosophy of change this formula has 
an air of simplicity with sweep that has made its 
promise seem all too magical, all too facile, for 
a disease so deep-seated and fascinating as is our 
modern skeptical neurasthenia ; while Professor 
Babbitt himself has been tempted by its sov- 
ereign virtues into certain procrustean or at 
least over-hasty applications, as in his dubious 
comments on programme music in " The New 
Laokoon." But all friends and all foes worthy 
of the name will be delighted with the restraint 
and the sureness with which he uses his bright 
weapon in his latest volume. 

Let us approach him once more through an 
examination of kindred spirits. Symonds notes 
three types of critic : the judge, the showman 
(i.e. the impressionist), and the scientific analyst. 
" The true critic," he holds, " must combine all 
three types in himself, and hold the balance by 
his sense of their reciprocal relations." In a 
notable passage he applies this critical spirit to 
humanistic education. 

" Heraclitus has a weighty saying, which those who 
aim at sound criticism should bear in mind. ' It behoves 
us,' he remarks, to follow the common reason of the 
world; yet though there is a common reason in the 
world, the majority live as though they possessed a 
wisdom peculiar each unto himself alone.' 

" The object of education is to provide us in youth 



with a sense of this common reason a just if general 
view of what mankind as a whole is a notion of what 
has been thought and wrought by our race in its totality 
of what humanity at its best and strongest has achieved 
by interrupted yet continuous efforts of how we come 
to be what we are and to think and feel as we do. 
Humanism, the study of history and literature and art 
and law, suffices better than any other training . . . 
because its matter is of greater moral and mental im- 
portance to humanity. Such education prepares the 
specialist to judge with width and sympathy and due 
regard for relations, to overcome personal caprice and 
predilection and to survey the particular plot he selects 
for exploration as part of the great whole." 

Mr. More seems to have much in common 
with this, yet he touches upon the danger of 
using the past " too much as a dead storehouse 
of precepts for schoolmastering the present," 
and would be careful to ally judgment " to the 
indwelling and ever-acting memory of things " 
which consciously creates "the field of the 
present out of the past." The critical spirit 
becomes thus akin to " the guiding principle, 
itself unchanged, at work within the evolu- 
tionary changes of nature." " Might we not 
even say," continues Mr. More, " that at a cer- 
tain point criticism becomes almost identical 
with education, and that by this standard we 
may judge the value of any study as an instru- 
ment of education and may estimate the merit 
of any special presentation of that study?" 

Thus Mr. More makes Symonds's standards 
more flexible without losing his large control. 
With such men as these Professor Babbitt is, 
if I read him aright, in close accord. I am not 
attempting an Alexandrian study of his sources ; 
rather, I am attempting first to introduce him 
more powerfully with his shield locked with 
those of a noble phalanx, and then to show with 
a bare summary of his " Conclusion " how con- 
spicuously his own crest waves in the bright 
array. All our examination of other writers will 
but more sharply define his distinguished con- 
tribution to that synthetic thought that many 
youths (of various degrees of age) are dreaming 
of as the distinctive work with which the twen- 
tieth century will supplement the nineteenth 
century of analysis and expansion so courageous 
and so distressing. 

Here, then, follows Professor Babbitt's con- 
clusion in his own words, as far as I can manage 
it in a difficult precis of such condensed and 
close reasoning : 

" From the tyranny of the old neo-classical rules came 
the revolt of the romanticists in favor of wider knowl- 
edge and wider sympathy. But the romanticists forget 
that these are only the feminine virtues of a critic It 
is interesting to observe how Sainte-Beuve, as a ' doctor 
of relativity,' was partly responsible for this resultant 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



133 



anarchy from which, indeed, in his full maturity, he 
himself recoiled and enlisted himself with the great 
judicial conservatives. But in this doctrine of relativity 
both impressionist and scientific critic have united, the 
one prating eternally of books ' suggestive,' the other 
of books ' significant ' ; the one denying any impersonal 
standard, the other entrenched in his theory of the un- 
knowable. Neither method can lead to any sure dis- 
tinction between third rate work and a play of Sophocles. 
Many books once infinitely suggestive and still of the 
highest historical significance are now seen to be of very 
inferior value. From Rousseau to the impressionist has 
echoed < Man is the measure of all things.' But is one 
to interpret this in the spirit of the Greek sophists, like 
M. France who finds us but ' the sport and playthings 
of mobile circumstances,' or in the spirit of Socrates, 
like Emerson who so asserts the maxim as to attain to 
a new sense of the unity of human nature, a unity 
founded not on tradition but on insight? To Emerson 
the best books in the world seem to be the work of 
' one all-seeing, all-hearing gentleman.' The individual 
man is the measure of all things only in so far as he has 
realized in himself this essential human nature. If we 
learn to separate this from Emerson's conflicting ten- 
dency to encourage unduly the man who -is undisciplined, 
unselective, and untraditional we have the corrective to 
temper that immense relativism which almost paralyzed 
Sainte-Beuve himself. While the perfect taste thus 
formed may be a gift divine, inborn, or impossible, it is 
at least an ideal for humanistic self-discipline that 
should encourage any sincere and intelligent aspirant 
to raise himself above that acceptance of anarchy which 
the impressionist considers inevitable. It is well for us 
to awaken our senses with the impressionist, but only 
that we may the better judge. The problem is to avoid 
the extreme of the pseudo-classical critic who set up a 
standard entirely outside the individual and the extreme 
of the impressionist entirely within. We should seek 
a standard that is in the individual and yet is felt by 
him to transcend his personal self and lay hold of that 
part of his nature which he possesses in common with 
other men. To complete this standard, this judgment 
of the keen-sighted few in the present needs to be rati- 
fied by the verdict of posterity. Yet in our day the 
Rousseauist or pseudo-democrat would value a book 
not by its appeal to the keen-sighted few, but by its 
immediate effect on the average man, a humanitarian 
fallacy which fits in alike with impressionism and com- 
mercialism. Modern criticism, in getting rid of for- 
malism and in becoming sympathetic and comprehen- 
sive, has performed only half its task. The other half 
is to find some new principle of judgment and selection. 
We need a critic who rests his discipline and selection 
upon the past, but who by a constant process of hard 
and clear thinking is constantly adjusting the experience 
of the past to the changing needs of the present. Sainte- 
Beuve can give us a miraculous vision of the past but 
he is one of the victims of naturalistic fatalism. Goethe, 
in his humanistic period, is nearer to the ideal than any 
other modern. But Goethe has a weakness. Although 
he refused to enter into the deterministic maze that 
struck proud gloom into both the dogmatic superna- 
turalists, like Pascal, and our dogmatic naturalists, 
although he would have us turn from those ultimate 
problems which may drive us mad to man's works, he 
conceives of this work too much in terms of the outer 
world, too little in terms of the individual's inner life. 
For the man whose attention is exclusively on works is 



in danger of losing that humility which comes only from 
a sense of man's helplessness before the infinite. More- 
over Goethe, even in full maturity, was too full of 
admiration for unregulated sympathy. Thus his view 
tends to fly apart into the two extremes which baffle 
control the idea of work conceived, primarily in a 
utilitarian spirit, and diffusive unselective sympathy. 
As Emerson charges him, he fails to worship the high- 
est unity. We need a second Boileau, not with the old 
formalism but with the main results of the great ex- 
pansion of the last century, who would be further able 
to make keen discriminations between different degrees 
of merit and demerit. But we must select without 
sourness or asceticism. We must avoid the danger of the 
French reactionary who fajls, for instance, in a reaction 
against naturalism, to take up all that is legitimate in 
naturalism. We must not dream of an impossible re- 
turn to the past. Its forms of authority have become 
impossible for many moderns. We must substitute an 
intuition of something which imposes on man's whole 
being a controlling purpose. To the influence of Sainte- 
Beuve, then, the great doctor of relativity, we must bring 
the controlling influence of Emerson in so far as he ia 
the philosopher of the oversoul. The ideal critic would 
need to combine the breadth and versatility and sense 
of difference of a Sainte-Beuve with the elevation and 
insight and sense of unity of an Emerson." 

Professor Babbitt's formula is not without 
its dangers for its creator. It lends justification 
for that judicial faculty which Professor Babbitt 
would seem to be inclined temperamentally to 
over-emphasize himself in spite of his admirable 
analysis of its excesses in Brunetiere. It is in- 
teresting to see the working out of this influence 
on his style. He has an unusual command of 
irony. In his earlier volumes this is almost 
omnipresent. He seems to lunge with a rapier 
at once trenchant and unnecessarily envenomed. 
The wound festers. It is possible, we protest, 
to be a devil of a fighter without being so per- 
sistently belligerent. We recall Arnold's irony 
(which he was wont to use even in the face of 
charges of foppish strutting and triviality). 
But Professor Babbitt has not the gallantry of 
Arnold, who, with something of the versatility of 
Cyrano de Bergerac, bows and smiles as he runs 
you through. Professor Babbitt frowns a good 
deal and thrusts viciously. We must hasten to 
add that there is much more restraint in " The 
Masters of Modern French Criticism" than in 
the earlier volumes. But there is still, with an 
irony more restrained, a feverish quickstep that 
arises from almost an excess of earnestness. 
Besides the irritation caused by the cut and 
thrust manner there comes an allied annoyance : 
our stinging ears await the grateful cadence of 
a solemn and exultant period. But Professor 
Babbitt's own petulance, his own fine zeal, will 
not let him gratify us. This stylistic defect is 
likely to be the failing of the critic who remains 



134 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



essentially judicial, not with the ponderosity of 
Johnson but with the crisp proverb-manner of 
Boileau ; and who does not quite gain, much as 
he may desire it, the full elevation of the more 
irresponsible emotionalist. 

It is this excess of the long neglected judicial 
temper, too, that makes him distrustful, as 
Arnold was before him, of the identification of 
critic and artist so frequently urged by the im- 
pressionists. It is to be regretted that Professor 
Babbitt accepts the outworn antithesis, "criti- 
cal" and "creative." Surely the critic may be 
creative without admiring, as Victor Hugo would 
have it, "like a brute," without seeking to 
herald his new office with the insincere fanfare 
of a Wilde. It is interesting here to compare 
Mr. More, who brings critics at least very close 
to the creative manner but who would admit that 
" they are by intellect hesitators," a concession 
surely not wholly true of the greatest of them. 
Mr. John McKinnon Robertson ("Science in 
Criticism," pp. 144 seq.") , points out " the nullity 
of the proposition" that "criticism is a lower 
form of intellectual effort than those called 'crea- 
tive,'" and doubtless Professor Babbitt would 
find sufficient solace in such a contention to 
urge that my present jangling is to no purpose. 
There is no space for extended argument. But 
I would contend that there is something far more 
important than the gratification of individual 
vanity in the new conception of the critic as 
creator ; and that since criticism shows signs of 
marked new developments, since the number of 
sane critics who insist upon its creative character 
increases daily, I would repeat that an excess of 
the judicial temper may tend to deprive criti- 
cism of this last honor and range that is now its 
inspiring heritage. 

But we have quarreled overmuch. It is rather 
early to forecast a return to the judicial ex- 
treme. Surely Professor Babbitt's mastery of 
the sadly neglected judicial faculty has brought 
him striking results. In a style richly jewelled 
with choice quotations, a style which absorbs 
quotations with the art of Hazlitt, of Byron in 
"Don Juan," or of Thackeray, Professor 
Babbitt follows a method that has been called 
"collective criticism," a criticism which is too 
objective to have intolerable acidity, which re- 
quires toil too epical to appeal to one so-called 
critic out of a thousand, but which (as Profes- 
sor Brewster has well pointed out) is a rich field 
as yet but little trodden.* Professor Babbitt's 



* " Modern English Literary Criticism." Professor Brew- 
ster cites perhaps the best example : Mr. J. M. Robertson's 
essay on Poe, " largely an analysis of the collective estimate 
of Poe, with comments of his own." 



chapters on Sainte-Beuve, in particular, are an- 
alytic and synthetic work of a very high order. 
Other writers have had at best but partial suc- 
cess in constructing the necromantic method 
which Sainte-Beuve himself revealed so way- 
wardly. But Professor Babbitt has, with great 
knowledge, patience, and delicate acumen, found 
all the bright evanescent disclosures in the mas- 
ter himself and in his most cunning critics, and 
has woven them into a coat of mail. He has 
captured Proteus and compelled him to assume 
permanently his proper form. Such " collective 
criticism" as this is certainly an admirable ap- 
plication of Professor Babbitt's own large vision 
of a method that draws the best from impression- 
ist, scientific historian, and humanist, that goes 
to Sainte-Beuve, to Goethe, and to Emerson for 
a new eclectic philosophy. And we may add 
that such "collective criticism" as this is, in 
Professor Babbitt's despite, creative. From his 
pages those noble warriors of France, Sainte- 
Beuve, Taine, Joubert, Scherer, Renan, Bru- 
netiere, stand forth vivid, scarred. This is 
dramatic criticism in a new and in a very severe 
use of a much abused word.

THE BEFOGGED ELIZABETHAN STAGE.* 



From being the most neglected field of Eliza- 
bethan research, the subject of the conditions of 
stage presentation in Shakespeare's London has 
become in a single decade one of the most vio- 
lently debated qucestiones vexatce of recent 
scholarship. Mr. W. J. Lawrence lays claim, 
not without reason, to the distinction of having 
inaugurated this fresh trend of critical specula- 
tion ; and his handsome volume of eleven essays, 
originally composed at different times between 
1902 and the present year, offers an easy mea- 
sure of the progress which has been attained. 

During the period spanned by these papers, 
several thousands of pages, literally, have been 
published by some twenty writers, in England, 
Germany, and America, in the effort to eluci- 
date Elizabethan stage conditions ; and the end 
is assuredly not yet. The pelter of dissertations 
continues, but the first stage in the investiga- 
tion is giving place to a second. Instead of far- 
ranging inquiries, seeking to settle the entire 
question on independent and rather empirical 
lines, one finds to-day a close-locked battle waged 
about half a dozen shibboleths thrown up by the

conflict of opinion. It is less the Shakespearean 
or the Elizabethan stage as a whole which at 
present engages the attention of the students 
than such by-products of discussion as the " alter- 
nation " and the " plastic" theories, the prin- 
ciple of "multiple setting," and the "platform " 
or "picture," "corridor" or "alcove'' stage. 

The change is, of course, in many ways a 
mark of healthy progress an index of the 
closer range within which the investigations of 
some of the most acute modern scholars have 
brought the subject. The absolute results have 
been well set forth by one of the pioneers in the 
work, Professor G. F. Reynolds, in a paper in 
last year's "Modern Philology," " What We 
Know of the Elizabethan Stage." The advance 
is somewhat painfully brought home to the gen- 
eral public by the fact that the commentaries in 
even the most scholarly editions of the Eliza- 
bethan dramatists have in ten years grown quite 
superannuated in all that regards details of 
staging. It is no dispraise of Mr. Lawrence 
and such of his compeers as Archer, Albright, 
Wegener, and Reynolds, however, to say that 
the dispassionate scholar who gives up his days 
and nights for no small space of time to the 
careful reading of their treatises is likely to 
emerge with a sense of the vast preponderance 
of speculation and inference over established 
fact. The field whence evidence is to be culled 
is so broad, and the meagre individual hints 
so dishearteningly contradictory, that it is 
not surprising to find vague deduction running 
riot or chasing itself about in circles of vicious 
logic. 

On the principle which now obtains, it would 
seem essential that the theorist seeking to con- 
struct a mental concept of the Globe or Fortune 
stage be able to hold suspended in his mind a 
clear idea of the actual requirements of every 
scene of at least a hundred plays. But this is 
practically impossible. The most assiduous in- 
vestigators seem hardly to have done more than 
consider a single striking scene or two from each 
of thirty or forty plays. Hence, as each student 
inevitably remembers and stresses, out of the 
ungovernable multitude, the particular scenes 
which lean most toward his personal interpreta- 
tion, it is very natural that discordant views have 
been able to establish and maintain themselves. 
Thus the alternation theory, which postulates 
very precise care in the avoidance of incongru- 
ous effects, and the so-called "plastic" theory, 
which believes in the indifference of the Eliza- 
bethan public to what would be to-day unen- 
durable clashes of scenic atmosphere, have both 



been ably expounded on the evidence of the 
plays themselves. 

The first indispensable step in the investiga- 
tion of Elizabethan stage practice has consisted 
in the general survey of the entire field. Now 
that this difficult labor is accomplished and a 
number of general principles set beyond doubt, 
it should be possible to bring out the details 
more clearly by concentrating attention upon 
particular subdivisions of the province. To treat 
separately the productions of the different thea- 
tres, especially in the earlier period, is hardly 
possible on the basis of present knowledge. To 
begin with the consideration of Shakespeare's 
works, as Brodmeier did, is to court disaster, for 
Shakespeare's stage practice was doubtless as 
genially erratic and as arbitrary as his use of 
language. Shakespeare wrote with a superla- 
tive knowledge of the peculiar needs, and even, 
doubtless, of the undreamed potentialities, of a 
special company and theatre. To attempt to 
deduce from his practice alone an idea of the 
normal usage would be like inferring the char- 
acteristics of everyday Elizabethan conversation 
from the soliloquies of Hamlet. 

The besb means of bringing into clear outline 
the ground principles of Elizabethan staging 
will probably be to proceed, from the basis of 
the broad truths established by the researches 
of the last ten years, to a more minute study 
than has yet been attempted of the practice of 
the earlier playwrights, especially Greene and 
Marlowe. These poets seem to have had no 
intimate or exclusive association with any one 
play-house. They wrote normally, it is certain, 
for the public stage, but not with their eye upon 
the peculiar individual requirements of a single 
company or theatre. That is, they saw the stage, 
presumably, as the man in the street saw it in 
their day and as we should first try to see it 
in broad outline with a few salient universal 
features subject to infinite modification in spe- 
cial cases. When these simple fundamental 
characteristics have been elicited by microscopic 
study of the not overwhelmingly numerous dra- 
mas of the earliest writers for the public stage, 
we may hope to discover more easily the develop- 
ments and personal innovations which it seems 
certain that more advanced and technical artists 
like Shakespeare and Ben Jonson must have 
made. From these we may then probably trace 
the course of evolution through the work of 
the succeeding seventeenth-century playwrights. 
Assuredly, if there is any parallel between the 
progress of the early English stage and that of 
the dramatic literature with which it was so very

intimately associated, we must expect to find 
enormous differences of detail between the stage 
practice of Marlowe's plays, of Shakespeare's, 
and of Ford's. No wonder that the arguments 
which give identical value to evidence from 
"Alphonsus of Aragon," from "Hamlet," and 
from " The Broken Heart " leave us no means of 
distinguishing between the normal and essential 
and the purely exceptional. 

The various essays in Mr. Lawrence's book 
differ greatly in their importance to the student 
of stage conditions. "The Story of a Peculiar 
Stage Curtain" and "Proscenium Doors" are 
written in popular rather than scientific vein; 
and the same can be said of " The Mounting of 
the Carolan Masques," which contains, however, 
some valuable new matter. The treatment of 
"Early French Players in England" (mainly 
during the Stuart era), of Shadwell's putative 
"Tempest" opera, and of the authorship of the 
"Macbeth "music touches interesting side-issues; 
but Mr. Lawrence's claim to serious recognition 
as a purveyor of new light will depend mainly 
upon his introductory paper on " The Evolution 
of the Elizabethan Playhouse," with its supple- 
ment at the end of the volume, and upon the 
three careful inquiries regarding the situation 
of the "lords' room," the use of title and locality 
boards, and the place of music and song in the 
Elizabethan theatre. 

These essays, like the others, are written with 
verve and bear the mark of diligent preparation. 
That they lead to rather few definite conclusions 
is perhaps due more to the broad field they seek 
to cover than to any lack of critical acumen in 
the author. Very often one finds Mr. Lawrence 
slipping over the real difficulties of the problem 
before him with such lighthearted remarks as 
"There seems to be no valid reason for doubt- 
ing" (p. 23) and " Some slight evidence exists to 
show " (ibid). Near the beginning of his first 
paper (p. 5), Mr. Lawrence remarks that "Au- 
thentic details of the prime characteristics of 
the Shoreditch theatres (i.e., the 'Theater' and 
'Curtain') are almost wholly lacking." Yet in 
the same connection he states, on evidence which 
I am wholly unable to trace, that the " Theater " 
and " Curtain " were used for bull and bear bait- 
ings as well as dramatic performances. From 
this he infers that the theatres in question must 
have had removable stages; and later (p. 23) he 
suggests that " one invariable concomitant of the 
permanent (as opposed to the removable) stage 
was the oblique entering doors." Here a very 
interesting theory is built up almost without a 
prop. The difference in dramatic effectiveness 



between a stage on which actors may enter 
through doors set opposite each other toward 
the front of the platform and a stage where all 
entrances must be made through openings in 
the rear wall is of the utmost consequence. If 
Mr. Lawrence is right, then Shakespeare's com- 
pany must not only have made a very great ad- 
vance in the efficiency of their acting when they 
removed from the "Theater" to the "Globe," 
but they must also have relapsed periodically 
into cruder methods whenever they returned, 
during the years before 1600, from the "Rose" 
or "Globe" to the "Curtain." If true, this is 
highly interesting, but proof is lacking both for 
the conclusion and for the premises. Did the 
" Theater " and " Curtain " have movable stages ? 
Did movability of stage necessarily involve dif- 
ference in the shape of the tiring-house facade 
and consequently in the position of the stage 
entrances ? 

Another striking statement, for which one 
would like to have Mr. Lawrence quote satis- 
factory evidence, is his remark concerning the 
"remoteness and obscurity" of the inner stage, 
"which almost invariably demanded the bring- 
ing in of lights at the commencement of all 
inner scenes " (pp. 6, 7). The four cases cited in 
the footnote, where lights are called for by the 
nature of the scene, certainly prove no such prac- 
tice. Moreover, would not the contrast between 
illuminated back scenes and unlighted front 
scenes, if any authority for the practice could 
be found, rather serve to emphasize the separate 
identity of front-stage and rear-stage, which 
Mr. Lawrence, as a hard and fast opponent of 
"alternation," rigidly denies? 

Mr. Lawrence's discussion of title and local- 
ity boards is, on the whole, excellent ; but his 
solemn treatment of the alternative play titles at 
the beginning of " Wily Beguiled " and " The 
Knight of the Burning Pestle " (pp. 51, 52) 
seems much ado about nothing. Surely, nobody 
in the audience can have seriously expected to 
Spectrum " or " The London Merchant.' 



see 



The false titles were brought in with the privity 
of the audience, in the one instance as a humor- 
ous gibe at the much-acted " Spectrum," in the 
other for the purpose of motivating the outburst 
of the Grocer and his wife. 

In the paper just alluded to, and in the final 
section of the book, the author treats very well 
the essential principles of multiple setting, but 
grows vague in his deductions as to the extent 
to which multiple setting obtained on the public 
stage. " One has only to make minute examin- 
ation of the constructive system of Lyly," he 



1913] 



137 



says (p. 59), "to become convinced that the 
multiple setting held sway at court for more 
than a score of years after the erection of the 
Theater and the Curtain (i.e., till after 1596)." 
Later on, Mr. Lawrence contends very plausibly 
that Lyly's early court plays (produced circa 
1580-86) were acted according to the multiple 
setting principle (p. 237/f.). But does he really 
mean that this principle held sway " more than 
a score of years after the erection of the first 
theatres "; that is, till after Shakespeare's com- 
pany had begun to carry their plays regularly 
from the " Theater " and the " Globe " to the 
court? If Mr. Lawrence means this, proof 
would be most desirable. 

Similar vagueness appears in the discussion 
of the first Blackf riars stage, where it should be 
remembered in fairness that Mr. Lawrence is 
writing in haste and without the benefit of Pro- 
fessor Wallace's very informative recent book 
The Evolution of the English Drama up 



on 



to Shakespeare." Starting with the bold as- 
sumption that "all the court plays of the period, 
excepting pastorals, were provided with scenery 
of the multiple order" (p. 235), Mr. Lawrence 
infers that plays must necessarily have been 
similarly rehearsed at the Blackf riars. Yet, as 
the multiple scenery was court property, return- 
able after the royal performance, he suggests 
that all subsequent representations at Black- 
friars would follow the practice of the public 
stage. Surely, it is unlikely that a particular 
play would be acted in the same theatre by the 
same company before the same type of audience 
in one manner previous to a specific date and in 
an utterly different manner after. 

It is not with the idea of convicting Mr. 
Lawrence of ignorance or carelessness that these 
few instances out of a large number have been 
brought up. The rest of the learned world 
shares Mr. Lawrence's uncertainties, and all 
writers on the subject have not been as frank 
as he in avowing the weak places in their reason- 
ing. The fact is that what we know at present 
of the early court, private, and public stages 
immediately prior to Shakespeare is quite in- 
sufficient to support the amount of pure conjec- 
ture involved in any of the prevailing theories. 
To concentrate upon the real fundamentals of 
Elizabethan staging, as manifested in the earli- 
est and simplest theatres, the attention now 
roaming rather aimlessly over the entire pre- 
Restoration epoch might set investigation firmly 
on its feet. 

A few careless expressions and misprints mar 
the neatness of Mr. Lawrence's volume. Atten- 



tion is likely to be drawn particularly to the 
amusing misuse of italic type by which the 
Boswell-Malone Variorum Shakespeare is reg- 
ularly alluded to as Malone's Shakespeare by 
Bo swell. Of " Shakespeare by Bacon " we have 
all heard more than enough, but " Shakespeare 
by Boswell" strikes one as a delicious innova- 
tion. C. F. TUCKER BROOKE. 



CHINA AFTER THE REVOLUTION.* 

Not even the new era dawning for the Balkan 
States is of so great moment to the human race 
as is the emergence of China from mediaeval 
backwardness into modern aspirations, and her 
institution of a republican government. Friends 
of liberty and progress everywhere will share, 
indeed, in the triumphs of liberty and pro- 
gress in southeastern Europe, and will spare but 
little sympathy to the losing Turk, yet the rise 
of the Balkan States adds no distinctly new ele- 
ment to world civilization. Japan, on the other 
hand, brought into later nineteenth-century 
world culture an individual contribution, not 
only Japanese, but Asiatic ; and the great 
empire now following the lead of Japan will, 
presumably, offer to the family of nations per- 
plexities and gifts, not simply characteristic and 
unique, but also Asiatic. Since it is to be hoped 
that the world culture of the later twentieth 
century will be enriched by the equal blend- 
ing of elements from the two hemispheres, the 
revolution in China is therefore of the utmost 
significance. 

China's first steps along her present untried 
path are being watched by all the world, but 
not by all with like interest. Not even yet is 
the possibility of the partition of the old empire 
banished from the thought of certain European 
chancelleries, and it is scarcely cynical to believe 
that some of the Great Powers secretly rejoice 
at every sign of weakness, and regret every omen 
of success in her present endeavor. Whatever 
be the attitude of other nations, however, our 
own can scarcely be less than friendly. We 
have nothing to gain by China's failure, and 
much to hope from her success. Moreover, she 
is paying us the flattering tribute of at least 
partial imitation, and much of her present mo-

mentum in the reform movement is the result 
of American education imparted to her youth 
both here and in China. Indeed, in spite of 
the uncertainties that yet strew her path, many 
Americans marvel that our government still 
delays to recognize the Republic. 

These uncertainties are varied and serious. 
China consists not only of the eighteen prov- 
inces, but also of four great dependencies, loosely 
knit at best to the Middle Kingdom a total 
area one-third larger than all Europe. To in- 
stitute a novel form of government for the hun- 
dreds of millions of her people and yet hold 
these vast dependencies to their allegiance is a 
task of the greatest magnitude. Even without 
foreign foes, it would be almost impossible ex- 
cept by means of a great army, and that China 
does not possess. Nor is she without foes. 
Japan covets South Manchuria; Russia is 
greedy for North Manchuria, Mongolia, and 
Turkestan ; England will not stand by and see 
Thibet fall into Russian hands. 

Moreover, China is internally weak. She 
lacks railroads, revenue, and an army. Her 
administration has not yet proved its capacity 
for handling the vast sums needed for internal 
development, and she cannot, therefore, borrow 
money for the development of her wonderfully 
rich resources without submitting to foreign 
supervision. Such supervision may lead to riots 
and even the secession of provinces. At this 
critical juncture, when the old sanctions of 
Confucianism and the monarchy are destroyed, 
no new sanctions have been created upon which 
she may implicitly rely to hold her populace 
loyal, through severe tests, to the new govern- 
ment. Her internal problems accentuate the 
seriousness of the dangers which threaten from 
without. 

Friends of China who watch eagerly for every 
sign of hope will find much to encourage them 
and much to discourage in three recent books. 
The favorable view of China's prospects is pre- 
sented in Messrs. Cantlie and Jones's " Sun Yat 
Sen and the Awakening of China," and in Dr. 
Brown's "The Chinese Revolution''; the un- 
favorable in Mr. Eland's " Recent Events and 
Present Policies in China." 

The first of these books comprises a rather 
heterogeneous list of topics. A sketch of the 
character and career of Dr. Sun, together with 
certain other chapters, was written by Dr. Can- 
lie, former teacher of Dr. Sun at the Hongkong 
Medical School and his intimate friend for the 
past twenty years; the rest of the book was 
written by Mr. Sheridan Jones. The latter 



writer gives an altogether encouraging account 
of the great moral crusade in China, the fight 
against opium. The statistics advanced to prove 
that China has combatted the gigantic opium 
evil with vigor and at great sacrifice to the gov- 
ernment in revenue, and that British India has 
actually drawn a larger revenue, because of the 
rise in prices, from her greatly reduced export 
of opium, are indeed impressive. Likewise 
impressive is the forecast of China's future as 
a military power. The writer believes in the 
strength and efficiency of the new army of China, 
and maintains that the Republic will differ from 
the monarchy in nothing more strikingly than 
in the changed attitude toward the soldier, a 
change destined to mean eventually an enormous 
standing army. Will China in the near future 
require Japan and Russia to evacuate Man- 
churia? Mr. Jones believes she may. 

The value of Mr. Jones's prophecies depends 
largely upon the quality of China's present lead- 
ership, and as to this both Mr. Jones and Dr. 
Cautlie are agreed. The former speaks with 
assurance of the reformed bench of China, as 
consisting of an "unexceptionable personnel," 
and Dr. Cantlie holds Sun Yat Sen up to the 
world as a man of unique gifts and powers. 
According to Dr. Cantlie's first-hand sketch, 
Sun possesses remarkable magnetism, both with 
individuals and with audiences. His temper is 
pacific, his disposition remarkably unselfish, his 
interests very diverse, and his devotion to China 
absolute. Interesting incidents from his pic- 
turesque career serve to vivify the sketch and 
leave a very favorable impression of Sun as a 
man of ability and courage and a peculiarly sin- 
cere patriot. His power over men, the result of 
an open and generous nature, appears quite extra- 
ordinary. As to his statesmanship, Dr. Cantlie 
furnishes little evidence, since in this Sun is as 
yet untried. One is compelled to remark, more- 
over, that Dr. Cantlie largely defeats his own 
end by a certain lack of restraint and an undue 
laudation of his hero. Dr. Sun as the saviour 
of the Republic would be more reassuring if he 
were depicted as not quite so angelic. 

This lack of restraint contrasts unfavorably 
with the exceptional scholarship and thorough- 
ness of Mr. Bland's discussion of China's prob- 
lems, a discussion giving an altogether adverse 
view of her prospects. Joint author with Mr. 
Backhouse of " China under the Empress Dow- 
ager," Mr. Bland is eminently qualified to dis- 
cuss the political, economic, and social conditions 
in the Empire, and his entire treatment is gratify- 
ing in its thoroughness and acumen. The his-

tory of the new movement in China, the Young 
Ohina party, Cantonese leadership, the policies 
of each of the Great Powers, international poli- 
tical finances, these topics are treated with 
unusual ability and thoroughness of grasp. 
The selfish policies of European nations toward 
China, the shrewdness of Japan's far-seeing 
designs, the reckless extravagance of Russian 
ambition are exposed unsparingly and, one 
feels, with undue pessimism. Mr. Bland has 
great respect for the people of China, but little 
respect for their leaders. His analysis of the 
unrest goes back to the fundamental cause, 
the pressure of population on the means of sub- 
sistence, the philoprogenitiveness of the Chinese 
race ; and yet, though convincing as an explana- 
tion of one phase of the uprising, this analysis 
leaves out of account secondary causes too im- 
portant to be omitted. He feels this to be a 
blind movement of the hungry masses, and in 
his eyes those who have taken the lead in this 
movement are only a new type of the ancient 
Chinese revolutionist, and they are already dis- 
playing the worst traits of the greedy mandarin. 
The people are in the hands of ambitious and 
place-seeking leaders, devoid of sobriety, and 
wholly wanting in moral and religious depth 
and restraint. He foresees a brief life for the 
Republic, though he thinks the restored mon- 
archy or the despotism sure to follow will be 
modified for the better through the aspirations 
voiced in the temporary Republic. 

One questions whether Mr. Bland has not 
been too long in close and unfortunate contact 
with the old Chinese officialdom to view with 
open mind the present seemingly novel phe- 
nomena in Chinese politics. No one who has 
any acquaintance with the younger generation 
of Chinese will fail to recall men whose ability 
and patriotism inspire great confidence. It is 
wholly possible that the effervescence of youth- 
ful enthusiasms, which to Mr. Bland .indicate a 
heady, volatile, and unstable leadership, will 
leave behind the substantial Chinese virtues of 
common sense and reverence for law, to guide 
the nation through its crisis. Though possess- 
ing unusual value as a scholarly study, the 
discussion is too deeply tinged with pessimism 
to be convincing. 

Such an impression of Mr. Bland's unfavor- 
able prepossession is strengthened by the peru- 
sal of Dr. Brown's " The Chinese Revolution." 
After describing briefly the outbreak and back- 
ground of the revolution, Dr. Brown discusses 
-concisely the various influences that have pre- 
pared the way for this outbreak, steam and 



commerce, diplomatic and warlike relations, the 
gradual intellectual awakening resulting from 
these stimuli and from Christianity and foreign 
education. He concludes his study with a sketch 
of the two foremost leaders of China, Sun and 
Yuan, and a forecast of the future of the 
Republic. Dr. Brown's tone, though sane and 
not lacking reserve, is strongly optimistic. He 
believes that moral and spiritual elements have 
entered largely into the making of the present 
situation in China, and urges the necessity of 
strengthening as rapidly as possible these con- 
servative influences at this time of swift tran- 
sition from the old to the new.

A LIBRARY OF GREEK AND 
CLASSICS.* 



Xenophon in his Memorabilia of Socrates 
reports the sage as saying that friendship is 
sustained and promoted by reading the master- 
pieces of old: "We turn over the recorded 
thoughts which the wise men of antiquity have 
left to us ; and if we find any noble sentiment, we 
cull it out and rejoice to think that our friend- 
ship is strengthened thereby." Towards the 
close of the fifth century B. c., when Socrates 
may be supposed to have made this remark, the 
available stores of Greek literature were already 
sufficiently imposing. Homer and Hesiod, 
Archilochus and the lyric poets, the great trio of 
tragic dramatists, Aristophanes, the historians 
Herodotus and Thucydides, with others of minor 
note, were all in hand, and affecting the thought 
and life of Hellas. It was quality rather than 
quantity that told: little need for winnowing 
those treasures ; and there was added the su- 
preme advantage of not having to translate, as 
nothing worth translating existed outside of 
Greece. 

For Americans and Britons of this speeding 
century, the treasures of Greek and Roman lit- 
erature, like some other fine old things, have 
largely become shelved and labelled. We con-

Plutarch's men." Emerson in one place con- 
tends for the use of translations ; in another, he 
says : " When a thought of Plato becomes a 
thought to me, time is no more." To be con- 
sistent, he must have taken his Plato via Jowett ; 
but as the same Emerson elsewhere pleads for 
inconsistency as the real jewel, we may fall back 
on the assurance that he got as much training 
in the Greek language as the early nineteenth 
century afforded. 

However this may be, it must be with some 
sense of interest, pleasure, and gratitude that 
thoughtful men up and down the land have 
heard of the purpose of Mr. James Loeb, the 
well-known banker, to stay the slow progress of 
oblivion that seemed waiting on the classic 
literatures by subsidizing the publication of 
translations of the great and less great Greek 
and Roman writers, from Homer down to the 
fall of Constantinople. To the undertaking of 
his praiseworthy enterprise Mr. Loeb was 
impelled by his own enthusiasm for classical 
subjects and the encouragement of M. Salomon 
Reinach ; and for its supervision he has called 
in the aid of an advisory board, including such 
names as Edward M. Capps of Princeton, Will- 
iam G. Hale of Chicago, John Williams White 
of Harvard, Maurice Croiset of Paris, Otto 
Crusius of Munich, Hermann Diels of Berlin, 
J. G. Frazer of Cambridge, A. D. Godley of 
Oxford, and Sir J. E. Sandys. The immediate 
editors of the series are Dr. T. E. Page, for- 
merly of the Charterhouse school in London, 
and Dr. W. H. D. Rouse, Litt.D., of Cambridge. 
For the actual work of translation, the editors 
have enlisted the services of recognized schol- 
ars in England, the Continent, and America. 
Jowett and Jebb are gone, so, alas, are Sey- 
mour and Wright and Goodwin; but from 
Phillimore, Way, Postgate, and Mackail in 
England, W. C. Wright of Bryn Mawr, A. M. 
Harmon of Princeton, and Horace White of 
New York, something more than respectable 
translations may be expected. It would seem, 
indeed, as if the work had been triply guarded, 
by translators, editors, and advisory board. 

The series is to consist of about two hundred 
volumes, somewhat more than a five-foot shelf, 
though not exhaustive of the available riches. 
In the selection of authors no chronological order 
will be followed, but the choice will be made so 
as to include considerable variety each year. 
Major and minor authors are brought out am- 
icably together, and it is left to our latter-day 
acumen to determine their respective merits: 
Sophocles is elbowed by Philostratus, Terence 



and the Apostolic Fathers have agreed together. 
Questions of Hellenism and Latinity are not 
discussed; yet, as the Greek or Latin text is 
placed on the opposite page from the translation, 
the scholar's eye will not fail of its critical 
office. 

The chief appeal is made, of course, not to 
scholars, but to the college graduate who wishes 
to keep up his reading, and who has forgotten 
much of the little Latin and more of the less 
Greek he once was taught ; and also to the intel- 
ligent layman, well-intentioned but innocent of 
either language. This appeal is helped out by 
the clear printing and neat form of the small 
octavos. The Latin volumes are bound in red 
cloth and the Greek in dark green. For the 
size, the price seems a little high. 

Philostratus of Leinnos (circa 175-200 A.D.) 
gained the favor of the learned empress Julia 
Domna, consort of Septimius Severus, and was 
persuaded by her to write the life of the sage 
and wonder-worker Apollonius of Tyana. As 
Apollonius had been dead about a century, 
there had been time for a fine haze of legend and 
tradition to gather round his name. During a 
long life largely peripatetic spent in visit- 
ing Persia, Babylon, India, Egypt, and the Hel- 
lenic world generally, he wandered and preached 
and wrought miracles, spoke boldly before kings 
and emperors, narrowly escaped death from Nero 
and later from Domitian, and finally died peace- 
fully under Nerva. Philostratus is thought to 
have exploited the career of Apollonius as a 
kind of counter-blast to that of Jesus ; but there 
seems little reason to believe this. The narrative, 
in eight books and broken into small chapters, 
is most entertaining; and suggests an Herodotus 
of the third Christian century, though of course 
lacking the historic substance. The translation, 
by Mr. F. C. Conybeare, is generally spirited 
and good ; although there are occasional infelici- 
ties and a few " Briticisms." 

For Euripides, the editors have wisely chosen 
to reproduce the fine verse- translation of Dr. 
Arthur S. Way, which has been admired by 
scholars and used by literary clubs for the past 
eighteen years. Dr. Way has thoroughly revised 
his former translation of the nineteen plays (he 
takes the "Rhesus" as genuine) with the "two 
especial aims of closer fidelity to the original 
and greater lucidity in expression." The Greek 
text of this edition is eclectic, being based on 
the soundest conclusions of previous editors and 
critics. The fresh virginal page is retained, with 
almost no footnotes on readings. In the excel- 
lent short introduction on Euripides, Dr. Way

gives us the following bit of comparative char- 
acterization : 

"^Eschylus sets forth the operation of great princi- 
ples, especially of the certainty of divine retribution and 
of the persistence of sin as an ineradicable plague-spot. 
He believes and trembles. Sophocles depicts great 
characters; he ignores the malevolence of destiny and 
the persistent power of evil; to him 'man is man and 
master of his fate.' He believes with unquestioning 
faith. Euripides propounds great moral problems; he 
analyzes human nature, its instincts, its passions, its 
motives; he voices the cry of the human soul against 
the tyranny of the supernatural, the selfishness and 
cruelty of man, the crushing weight of environment. He 
questions: ' he will not make his judgment blind.' " 

Among the Latin authors thus far selected 
for translation, one volume is devoted to the 
elegies of Propertius, whose four books have 
been done into English prose by Mr. H. E. 
Butler, of the University of London. The 
work has been carefully executed, his close 
adhesion to the Latin text being chosen by the 
translator even where, in his own words, "a 
free paraphrase would have been in many ways 
preferable." 

A single volume, also, garners the riches of 
Catullus, whose 116 poems and fragments are 
translated by Mr. F. W. Cornish, the Vice- 
provost of Eton ; of Tibullus, whose three books 
of elegiacs have found a scholarly interpreter 
in Professor J. P. Postgate; and of the little 
poem which has come down to us under the 
name of the Pervigilium Veneris. The two 
Latin poets are well known to all scholars and 
lovers of the genus lyricum; and it is safe to 
say that these two translations will widely and 
permanently extend the circle of their admirers. 
The Pervigilium, however, is a less familiar 
name even to the classically disposed reader. 
Its twenty-two quatrains, with their haunting 
refrain, exist in two MSS., one of the seventh, 
the other of the ninth century ; but its original 
date, authorship, and provenance are alike un- 
known. Professor J. W. Mackail, the transla- 
tor, has given to the title the felicitous English 
equivalent "The Eve of St. Venus"; and has 
done for the unknown poet of the fourth century 
a service worthy of being compared with that 
of FitzGerald for Omar. Though nominally 
composed as an official piece for the trinoclium 
or popular festival of Venus, Professor Mackail 
finds fantasy its prevailing motive, "a summons 
which evokes imaginative associations, and sets 
the rhythm of poetry in movement round nature 
and history, love and life." He regards the 
poem as the beginning of the romantic move- 
ment. "All the motives of the old classical 
poetry survive, yet all have undergone a new 



birth. ... Poetry has gone back to childhood; 
and has recovered, as though for one fleeting mo- 
ment and by the spell of a capricious enchanter, 
the key of spring, the freshness of morning, the 
innocence of youth." The opening line is used 
both as introduction and as refrain for the has- 
tening trochaic stanzas that follow; one of which, 
with Professor Mackail's prose-poetic version, 
may serve as an alluring specimen of the whole : 

"Cras amet qui nunquam amavit quique amavit eras amet : 
ver novum, ver jam canorum, ver renatus orbis est; 
vere concordant amores, vere nubunt alites, 
et nemus comam resolvit de maritis imbribus. 

Cras amet qui nunquam amavit quique amavit 
eras amet.* 

"Tomorrow shall be love for the loveless, and for the 
lover tomorrow shall be love. Spring is young, spring 
now is singing, spring is the world reborn. In spring 
the loves make accord, in spring the birds mate, and the 
woodland looses her tresses under nuptial showers. 

Tomorrow shall be love for the loveless, and for 
the lover tomorrow shall be love." 

Four of the six 'extant plays of Terence, pro- 
duced in the middle of the second century B.C., 
were frank adaptations of the comedies of the 
Greek poet Menander, chief representative of 
the third period of Attic comedy the "comedy 
of manners," which has remained to the present 
time the "jus et norma loquendi " of this form 
of drama. The translator, Mr. J. Sargeaunt, 
in his introduction, defends Terence from the 
charge of sameness in plot and characters by 
the natural observation that nothing else could 
be expected from plays dealing with "a single 
epoch in a city (Athens) where life went easily 
and great events had ceased to occur." This 
recalls Mommsen's words in speaking of the 
New Attic comedy : 

" The pieces are of tiresome monotony. Almost 
without exception the plot turns on helping a young 
man, at the expense either of his father or some leno 
to obtain possession of a sweetheart of undoubted 
charms and of very doubtful morals. Love or amorous 
intrigue was the very life-breath of the Menandrian 
poetry. . . . Persons and situations recur down to the 
very details like patterns on a carpet; we never get rid 
of the asides of unseen listeners, of knocking at the 
house-doors, and of slaves scouring the streets on some 
errand or other." 

The charge against Terence that he is not 
Plautus is also perhaps unnecessarily re- 
futed by Mr. Sargeaunt by pointing to the 
obvious fact that the Terentian comedy is in- 
tentionally sentimental, and that boisterous 
Plautine humor would be misplaced. He for- 
tifies this position by an apt reference to modern 
literature : " There is a likeness between Miss 
Bates and Mrs. Nickleby. We laugh louder at 



142

Mrs. Nickleby, but Miss Bates is more true to 
life." The stage directions, which of course are 
wanting in the Latin original, are supplied from 
the copy made for the Westminster boys' plays 
in London, and add much to the interest and 
usefulness of the translation. The version does 
not lack sprightliness ; by-words and colloquial- 
isms are supplied from copious modern British 
stores : e.g., " By Jove " for ercle, " Lor me " 
for ecastor, " Simple Simon " for miser, " Lord, 
Lord " for ei mihi, and so on.

RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LITER- 
ATURE OF EDUCATION.* 

It is worthy of remark that many persons with 
fine literary feeling and skill seem to approach the 
discussion of educational problems in a pessimistic 
mood. Usually they appear to be entirely out of 
sympathy with contemporary educational theory 
and practice. They praise the ideals of bygone 
ages ; they deplore the degeneracy of the present ; 
they prophesy disaster for the future. And still 
some of these writers present sane views of the 
educational process. All this is true of the volume 
entitled "A Valiant Woman." As one reads it, 
one is apt to feel despondent at times when the 
author points out what is regarded as the pathetic 
condition into which modern education has fallen. 
But at other times one feels hopeful and enthusi- 
astic, when the author depicts high ideals, and indi- 
cates what could be accomplished if we were rational 
and sincere in our treatment of the problems of 
studies, methods, and discipline. The anonymous 
author is apparently very well versed in educational 
classics, but seems to be entirely unfamiliar with 
present-day scientific writing on educational themes. 
He (or she) speaks in utter contempt of all " peda- 
gogy," and then goes on to quote a large part of the 
classic writings upon which modern " pedagogy " is 
founded. He condemns the study of the child mind

and of educational methods, but devotes most of the 
book to depicting child nature and methods of teach- 
ing in a keen, sane, and delightful manner. The 
" valiant woman " was a teacher, who early came 
into the life of the author. In the first chapter are 
depicted her characteristics and her methods in man- 
aging an ungraded school in a Middle Western com- 
munity. The author first shows that everything that 
had been done before her time was wrong, the 
teaching was crude, formal, mechanical, verbal. But 
this woman introduced fresh methods. She made 
her work concrete and vital, so that it was attractive 
to the pupils. She was plain of dress and of features, 
but noble in intellect and magnanimous in spirit. 
The chief virtue of the book is that it presents sound 
educational principles in an unusually virile and at- 
tractive style. If the author had not permitted his 
sensibilities to be irritated by imperfections (many 
of them imaginary) in the world around him, and 
if he had been more largely constructive without 
decrying the tendencies of the times, his work would 
be signally distinguished among modern educational 
books. But even with its imperfections, it is a con- 
tribution of merit, not because it offers anything 
new, but because it presents in a captivating way 
many of the views and principles which all present- 
day leaders are striving to get adopted in our 
educational system. 

Professor William Lyon Phelps, of Yale, is thor- 
oughly optimistic about the whole business of edu- 
cation. He is himself very fond of teaching. He 
says he would rather teach than do anything else 
he can think of. He derives inspiration from give- 
and-take experiences with his students in the class- 
room. Unquestionably he knows how to awaken 
interest in the subject he teaches English literature 
and he is never bored by the duties of the class- 
room. According to him, there is no dull routine in 
teaching when one is en rapport with subject and 
students. Indeed, to him there is "no profession 
more exciting, more stirring, more thrilling than 
teaching." Professor Phelps's book is considerably 
more intimate than the majority of works upon this 
subject. It is concrete, specific, and practical 
throughout. Many faults in teaching are indicated, 
but never in a mood of despair. Professor Phelps 
thinks that teaching to-day, in colleges especially, is 
very much better than it was formerly, with which 
opinion the reviewer heartily agrees. Persons 
who have not had technical training in educational 
sciences can read Professor Phelps's book with pleas- 
ure. Not having studied educational theory, the 
author is not tempted to use specific terms, which, 
while more precise than the terms of every-day 
speech, are nevertheless not attractive to some read- 
ers. There is good cause for rejoicing when a man 
who is master of clear and graceful English, who is 
genuinely honest and sincere, and who is a "born 
teacher," writes on the problems of the classroom; 
for he can appeal to the novice and to the man of 
the world as a student of the sciences underlying 
education usually cannot, because the latter con- 



1913] 



THE DIAL,

stantly feels the necessity of using terms which have 
come to have specific meanings for those who are 
specialists in the fields in which he works. 

Mr. and Mrs. Gesell have written an interesting 
volume on the training of young children. The 
authors are scientists in the best sense of the term. 
They have studied biology, evolution, and modern 
physiological and experimental psychology. They 
have also dealt directly with children, and have made 
numerous experiments in order to throw light upon 
some of the complex and peculiar traits of the char- 
acter and abilities of children. Unlike much of the 
study of children of recent times, the authors have 
confined their attention to the normal child. This 
does not mean that they think it possible exactly to 
define a "normal" child. They do not attempt to 
mark off precisely the normal from other kinds of 
children, and it is well that they do not worry over 
this problem. They say that of the (approximately) 
17,000,000 children in the public schools of this 
country, only a small percentage are in special classes 
for the backward and the defective, and that the rest 
may be considered as " normal." While this lacks 
precision, it is nevertheless the proper point of view 
to take in discussing the traits, abilities, and needs 
of the normal child. The book summarizes in an 
attractive way a considerable amount of modern 
science relating to child nature and child develop- 
ment. It is not an easy task, as anyone knows who 
has ever tried it, to present biological, evolutionary, 
and psychological sciences in dynamic and at the 
same time attractive English ; but the authors have 
succeeded in this in a large measure. Teachers of 
young children, even those who have not had much 
training in the biological sciences, might read this 
book with genuine pleasure and certainly with profit. 

There are some persons who claim that they can- 
not easily read President G. Stanley Hall's books, 
because of the bigness of his words and the complex 
character of his sentences. For this reason, doubt- 
less, Mr. G. E. Partridge has thought it advisable 
to present his writings in a denatured form for the 
"average reader." President Hall has himself 
endorsed this enterprise, and has said that Mr. 
Partridge has done his work well. The latter has 
certainly simplified the English of the original, and 
has undoubtedly managed in a skilful way to give 
his chief's views on a great number of psychological 
and educational problems of present-day interest. 
President Hall has been a leader among educators 
for twenty years at least. He has discussed practi- 
cally every question of general educational interest 
during this period. He has played a very important 
part in initiating reforms in teaching based upon 
biological and psychological principles. His views 
have been presented in several books and in a great 
number of magazine articles and addresses ; and it 
has been Mr. Partridge's work to digest all these, to 
get at the substance of each, and to present this sub- 
stance in as simple terms as he could. The book is 
designed for the layman, and for the novice in teach- 
ing who would not venture to read Hall in the orig- 



inal. The only fault the present reviewer can find 
with the book is that it seems a little monotonous ; 
but probably this defect could not be avoided, the 
author was compelled to confine himself to sum- 
maries and condensations. 

Many writers seem to find it impossible to treat 
the subject of education logically and comprehen- 
sively without being rather formal and schematic. 
But Professor Paul Klapper has achieved a large 
measure of success in avoiding this danger. He has 
discussed the meaning and function of education, 
and the physiological, sociological, intellectual, emo- 
tional, and volitional aspects of education as a pro- 
cess of perfecting adjustment to one's environment. 
He has produced a substantial volume, and a useful 
one. Its purpose is not to present new data for a 
science of education, but rather to organize existing 
data derived from the various sciences, and to show 
how they relate to problems of educational values 
and methods. This is now a favorite task of educa- 
tional writers ; they approach their subject from the 
standpoint of biological, evolutionary, sociological, 
and psychological science. Professor Klapper re- 
veals a familiarity with as much of these sciences 
as seems to bear upon the problems of making a cur- 
riculum, presenting studies effectively, and organiz- 
ing and disciplining a school properly. In an older 
day, educational writers assumed that the aim of 
education was to impart culture to the individual, or 
to discipline his mental faculties, or to develop his 
character, or to prepare him for earning his daily 
bread, or otherwise. But more recently students of 
education have been taking the view that the chief 
concern of a human being is to adjust himself har- 
moniously to his social and physical environment, 
and the whole business of education is to assist him 
in accomplishing this in the most complete and effec- 
tive way possible. Professor Klapper takes this view 
of the educational process. But adjustment means 
to him not so much that the individual should adapt 
himself to the world as he finds it at any time or 
place, as that he should transform it to minister to 
his needs. While the book deals with rather heavy 
subjects, and its logical completeness may cause the 
novice to suspect that it is not adapted to his needs, 
nevertheless the principles are presented in a simple 
and direct way, with only slight use of technical 
terms. The author has a happy manner of illustrat- 
ing his discussions with concrete examples, which 
will help the general reader and the novitiate to com- 
prehend what is being discussed, and also to enjoy 
it. At the same time, the book is designed primarily 
for the student, the one who has leisure to study the 
whole subject of education, and who can do consider- 
able parallel reading on the side. It is essentially a 
text-book. References are given at the end of each 
chapter to the most approved literature relating to 
the topics considered, and there is a good index at 
the close. 

Professor John Adams has set himself a difficult 
task in tracing the evolution of educational theory. 
The purpose of Professor Klapper's book, mentioned 



144 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



above, is to present current theory and the scientific 
principles upon which it is based; but Professor 
Adams takes us back into the ancient world, and 
even into pre-historic times, and shows us what the 
people of that remote era thought about education. 
His book is philosophical, not practical. He ranks 
education as one branch of philosophy, and he treats 
it as such. He has read widely in philosophical lit- 
erature, and he has quoted from it freely. While it is 
not his aim to introduce the reader to modern views 
in any detail, nevertheless he shows that he is in 
sympathy with many fundamental tendencies in con- 
temporary education. The various theories of educa- 
tion are grouped into the naturalistic, the idealistic, 
and the mechanistic types. While this grouping is 
open to criticism, it is nevertheless of service in classi- 
fying the great variety of theories that have been 
proposed by educational writers. Professor Adams 
endorses the naturalistic revolt against the conven- 
tionality and formalism which once dominated the 
educational world, and which still linger in some 
places. At the same time, he does not go to such 
lengths as does Rousseau in exalting Nature, mak- 
ing her the sole arbiter of educational curricula and 
methods. His book does not aim to be critical so 
much as descriptive, so that a great deal of material 
is presented without much comment. Professor 
Adams can, when he wishes to do so, make use of a 
spirited and brilliant style, as he has shown in some 
of his previous books. In the work before us, how- 
ever, he has chosen to employ a somewhat heavy 
style, in which technical terms are used frequently, 
-and in which no liberties are taken with direct pre- 
sentation of data. It is a book for the serious-minded 
student of educational philosophy. The general 
reader and the novice will probably not bring enough 
to the reading of the book to find it absorbing. It 
will make a useful text, to be worked through rather 
leisurely and in a thoroughgoing manner. 

There are certain fundamental principles of 
educational aims, values, and methods which are 
accepted to-day by all serious students of education 
in America. For the most part these principles have 
been worked out from the standpoints of modern psy- 
chology, biology, and sociology. Professor Edward 
L. Thorndike has played an important role in the 
development of these elementary principles. His 
approach to education has been from the standpoint 
of what one might call a psychological naturalist. 
His latest book is written from this point of view. 
His purpose is to discuss in the simplest way possible 
many of the problems in which educational people 
are interested to-day. He writes as one who is mas- 
ter of his subject, and who does not need to exhibit 
his learning in the use of technical terms or in a 
grand and formal style. The book reminds one of 
William James's " Talks to Teachers "; Professor 
Thorndike talks on education in much the same in- 
formal but helpful manner, so that even the novice 
may comprehend and enjoy what he writes. The 
volume is characterized not alone by simplicity, but 
also by a lack of positive dogmatic statements. There 



are two sides to every question in modern education. 
As a rule, Professor Thorndike presents in brief the 
arguments on both sides, and then suggests what is 
probably the right attitude for the teacher to take. 
The teacher who appropriates the contents of this 
book will understand modern tendencies in educa- 
tional theory and practice, but he will not be too 
dogmatic in his beliefs. 

Recently Mr. William H. Maxwell of New York 
celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his work 
as a superintendent. In commemoration of this 
event, a committee collected and edited a large num- 
ber of his reports and addresses, and these are now 
published in book form. They indicate the prom- 
inent part Mr. Maxwell has played in the improve- 
ments which have been introduced into the public 
school system of America during the last quarter of 
a century. They deal with a great variety of inter- 
esting and important topics. The hand of the practi- 
cal superintendent is apparent in them all. He has 
been charged with tremendous responsibilities in ad- 
ministering great systems of schools, first in Brooklyn 
and afterward in Greater New York. But while 
primarily an administrator, he has also been a stu- 
dent of educational principles and educational pro- 
gress. " A Quarter Century of Public School Devel- 
opment " is practically a r6sum6 of what has been 
accomplished in the schools of America during the 
past twenty-five years. Mr. Maxwell has been on 
the firing line all the time. He is a progressive 
who has been compelled to lead a great community to 
see the necessity for educational reform, and to make 
such reform feasible in an exceedingly complicated 
system of schools. This book will be illuminating 
to the layman who has not kept in touch with edu- 
cational development during the past quarter of a 
century, and it will also be of interest to teachers 
who are not familiar with the reforms wrought in 
school work during the past twenty-five years. 

Like the preceding book, Mr. B. C. Gregory's 
" Better Schools " is written from the point of view 
of the superintendent who is charged with adminis- 
tering a system of schools, and who is concerned 
solely with securing definite results from the teach- 
ing. The seventeen chapters in this book originally 
appeared in whole or in part as letters written for 
a newspaper in the city in which Mr. Gregory was 
chief educational officer. The purpose of these 
letters is to interpret the aims and methods of the 
public schools for the people of the community, and 
so the volume is unusually direct, concrete, and prac- 
tical. Mr. Gregory attempts to justify the up-to- 
date curriculum of the elementary schools, and the 
means and methods of presenting studies to children 
of different ages. The principles underlying his 
curriculum and his methods are not essentially differ- 
ent from those presented in the books by Professor 
Thorndike, Professor Partridge, Professor Klapper, 
Professor Adams, and Professor and Mrs. Gesell. 
Mr. Gregory presents his views for the most part 
in clear, intelligible, and attractive English.

Howe, Benjamin C. Tilghman, and Ottmar Mergen- 
thaler. It will be seen that no living inventor is 
included in the list. The amount of new informa- 
tion collected by the author gives his book special 
value and interest ; and the manner in which each 
life-drama is presented arrests and holds the reader's 
attention. Most moving of all the biographies is 
that of Goodyear, of India-rubber renown. Long 
years of persistent experiment and diminishing 
health and resources preceded the final discovery of 
vulcanization, without which rubber gum is about as 
useless for manufacturing purposes as so much tar. 
Goodyear at the lowest ebb of his fortunes is thus 
pictured for us : " Here, indeed, stood a hero, un- 
sustained by the excitement and pomp of a battle- 
field, continuing a fight as faithfully as ever did an 
enlisted champion. Day after day, cold and hungry 
in a dingy room, he kept up his tests of new com- 
pounds, sustained as firmly as if he distinctly beheld 
what the next few months would unfold to his view." 
As an instance of original research on the author's 
part, we may cite his unearthing of what appears to 
be the earliest record of the action of sand discharged 
in a jet of steam. It was Tilghman's chance wit- 
nessing of this accidental sand-blast that led him to 
perfect the process now so important in many in- 
dustries. Illustrations and diagrams elucidate the 
technical parts of the book, and portraits and other 
pictorial accompaniments add to its interest. 

FannvBurnev li j s less than a year ago that we 
a* a royal reviewed Professor Tinker's inter- 

maid of honor. es ting compilation of those passages 
in the diary and letters of Fanny Burney which 
relate to the association and intimate friendship of 
that vivacious and fascinating young lady and the 
always formidable, but in this instance the capti- 
vated and docile, Doctor Johnson. The next episode 
in this sprightly creature's rather notable career is 
now attractively set forth in a new work by Miss 
Constance Hill, entitled "Fanny Burney at the 
Court of Queen Charlotte" (John Lane Co.). This 
book constitutes a link between two other volumes 
by the same author: "The House in St. Martin 
Street" and "Juniper Hall." All of these books 
draw their material mainly from the famous diary 
and letters of Madame D'Arblay a work so volu- 
minous that the modern reader, even if not repelled 



by the old-fashioned formality of the title itself, is 
hardly likely to seek an introduction to "little 
Burney," charming though she is, through such a 
bulky medium. Miss Hill gives a complete and 
fairly definite narrative of Fanny's experience at 
court. Her picture of the royal household is a 
pleasing one. The gracious qualities of good Queen 
Charlotte are intimately described, the little prin- 
cesses appear most winsome, and George III. is 
presented in a very amiable light. The horrid 
Mrs. Schwellenberg, first lady of the wardrobe, 
"Cerbera," as Fanny nicknamed her, appears in 
colors appropriate to her reputation. If it had not 
been for her vixenish temper, Miss Burney's expe- 
riences as maid of honor might have been happy 
enough in spite of the strenuous programme and 
the tedious hours of her official position. It is 
impossible to read any of Fanny Burney's letters 
without being impressed by her dramatic skill in 
narrative: she vivifies every scene. Fanny herself, 
of course, is the interesting figure always, and she 
easily holds the centre of the stage. She is engag- 
ingly na'ive, though we wonder sometimes if her 
uncontrollable diffidence is not more or less a pose ; 
and we are justified, no doubt, in attributing the 
" sensibility" which she displays and laughs at so 
heartily in others to the sentimentalism of that 
period. Miss Hill gives some prominence to the 
incident of Warren Hastings's impeachment, and 
presents us with a dramatic picture of that famous 
trial in one of the most vivid chapters in the book. 
The illustrations are numerous and effective. In- 
cidentally we note an odd mistake in the mention 
of "John Adam [_sic], one of the founders of the 
Republic [the United States], and its first Envoy to 
the British Court." 

That wilderness sport may be gen- 
u j ne w ithout being bloodthirsty, is 
evidenced in Mr. A. R. Dugmore's 
" Wild Life and the Camera " (Lippincott), which 
recounts the successes (not without difficulties sur- 
mounted) which have rewarded the author's per- 
sistent efforts to record on photographic plates the 
forms and actions of beast and bird of our forests 
and streams. The book is a collection of essays 
portraying in so entertaining a manner the charms 
of this humane form of hunting that it is to be hoped 
it may be effective in turning many devotees of the 
rifle and shot-gun from these weapons of destruction 
to the camera. From his long and varied experience 
the author tells us of his success in taming and 
photographing bluebirds, chicadees, warblers, vireos, 
woodcock, mallards, geese, and the whistling swan, 
and of his efforts to photograph the porcupine and 
opossum. Other chapters recount his fishing ad- 
ventures with the sea-trout in New Brunswick, the 
salmon in Newfoundland, the yellowtail off Catalina 
Island, and the golden trout in the High Sierras. 
All lovers of the gentle art of angling will rejoice 
in Mr. Dugmore's too brief account of the superb 
attractions of the Kern River region, and the glori-

ous sport to be had there with the golden trout, which 
in point of beauty easily holds the palm against all 
competitors among the fresh water fish of America. 
Some minor statements in the text of this chapter 
challenge the attention of those familiar with the 
Sierras: for example, that no horse of the plains 
could do the work of the " mountain ponies," when 
as a matter of fact these latter are drafted every 
summer from the valley. Again, the author states 
that the golden trout is found in but one stream, and 
that it seldom weighs over half a pound ; whereas 
it has for years been distributed among a number of 
streams and lakes in the Mt. Whitney region, and 
records of not less than four pounds are known. The 
use of the term "median" for "lateral" line will 
trouble ichythyologists, and "lupin" for "lupine" 
will distress all lovers of these beautiful treasures of 
blue. " San Louis Bay " for " San Luis Rey " and 
Salmo iridens for Salmo irideus are doubtless typo- 
graphical oversights ; but " St. Joachim " for " San 
Joaquin " violates geographical, historical, and local 
canons of taste, and has neither custom nor euphony 
to defend it. The author's fine series of photographs 
of the migrating caribou of Newfoundland, secured 
on his sixth trip for the purpose, are unique and 
unusually interesting. Misdirections for bird photog- 
raphy, and for camping in summer and winter, 
will appeal to a wide range of enthusiasts ; and his 
revelations of snow-tracks should revive pleasant 
memories in the hearts of all lovers of winter woods. 
The illustrations, consisting of fifty full-page plates, 
are unusually fine. 

Ante leiium Since the appearance of George W. 
days in Cable's " Old Creole Days," in 1879, 

New Orleans. there has been a persistent interest 
in New Orleans, and a continued demand for stories, 
reminiscences, and serious history dealing with the 
life that was lived there. In many ways this interest 
has been met, though a second Cable has not arisen 
to re- work the old vein or discover a new one ; and 
the life of the most European of American cities, at 
least as it was in its most romantic epoch, still appears 
to the world just as Cable represented it. Mrs. Eliza 
Ripley, in her book entitled " Social Life in Old New 
Orleans" (Appleton), limits herself to a description 
of New Orleans society in the narrower sense, and 
thus her work cannot compare with that of her dis- 
tinguished predecessor, though it is both interesting 
and important, even to the serious student of history. 
There is a certain flavor and directness about the 
style that is most entertaining, reminding one of the 
writings of Mrs. Roger Pry or. Mrs. Ripley was a 
part of the life she deals with, and she loves the 
people, the ideals, and the antiquities of ante-bellum 
New Orleans quite as much as the charming Vir- 
ginian writer loved her "ancient Dominion." Both 
of these women are pleaders of causes, but those 
causes were so interesting and the manners of the 
long-since vanquished " lords and ladies " of the old 
South so attractive that one never wearies of reading 
and re-reading their story. Still Mrs. Ripley does 



not descend to mere eulogy and panegyric, though 
her love for the queer streets and strange ways of 
the " French quarter," for the unique markets, and 
the ever-present negro slave, often tempt her near 
to the border line. She delights to linger at old- 
fashioned places to reproduce for the reader con- 
versations with long-forgotten people, people " of 
quality " whose praises she never tires of singing. 
Most of the old families of New Orleans, at the time 
when negro slaves were many and negro manners 
were obsequious, appear in these chapters the 
Beauregards, Kennedys, Slidells, and many others. 
And the great balls, the elaborate wedding festivals, 
the whole procession of a luxurious (for that time) 
and thoroughly self-conscious life, are brought be- 
fore the reader. Children and their ways, boarding 
schools, mural decorations for the great houses, 
steamboats and hotels, plantation life, and the sad 
tale of war and exile, all have their place. There 
are many wood-cuts, engravings, and daguerreotypes 
to vivify the unconventional narrative. Though the 
value of the book as "source material" for the his- 
torian is somewhat weakened by the absence of 
actual and authenticated facts of social and political 
importance, there is much that will enable the dis- 
criminating student to obtain a fairly correct view 
of old New Orleans life in the days " before the 
deluge " as many Southerners still term the war 
between the states. 



Thefaiiacu entitled "The Dem- 

of short ocratic Mistake" (Scribner), Mr. 

political tenures. Arthur George Sedgwick, Godkin 
Lecturer at Harvard in 1909, attacks-the old Demo- 
cratic fallacy of Jefferson and his followers, that 
the best means of securing responsibility in govern- 
ment is through frequent elections and short terms. 
On the contrary, says Mr. Sedgwick, such a system 
in practice produces the machine and leads to 
irresponsibility and inefficiency. You cannot get a 
responsible man for a post involving the exercise of 
authority, he says, by telling him that he will be 
displaced by a new appointee at the end of two 
years. This is not the method of successful private 
business, and it will not work in public business. 
The professions of the politicians that the need of 
the hour is more democratization he pronounces 
as pure demagogy. If frequency of elections and 
short terms were a safeguard against misgovern- 
ment, the people of New York would be better pro- 
tected than any other people in the world, for they 
have annual legislative sessions, frequent elections, 
and there is probably no other place in the world 
where the people vote for so many candidates in the 
course of a year. But, in fact, the government of the 
state is, says Mr. Sedgwick, parcelled out by a close 
corporation, or rather two close corporations, neither 
of which is, in any real sense, responsible. The true 
theory, according to Mr. Sedgwick, is that real respon- 
sibility, the responsibility that secures efficiency, 
can be obtained only through security of tenure, as is 
the case in private business, where this practice is 



1913.] 



THE DIAL

of universal application. The fact is, short tenures 
and frequent elections have led to a breaking down 
of responsibility, and the way to restore it is through 
their opposites. Fortunately, says Mr. Sedgwick, 
the organization of the Federal government, in 
which the elective principle plays little part, rests 
on the true theory, and much of the success that 
has attended its administration is due to this. 
Unquestionably, the author has pointed out one of 
the most fallacious political ideas that has ever 
gained a foothold in our democracy, and his argu- 
ment in favor of the principle followed in private 
business is logical and convincing. Thinking men 
everywhere will agree that the remedy he proposes 
is sound, and at the same time not necessarily incon- 
sistent with the principles of true democracy. 

More of ^ ^ e already considerable number 

Mrs. Eraser's of volumes of reminiscences written 
reminiscences. ^ diplomats' wives there is now 
added the third work of the kind from the fertile 
pen of Mrs. Hugh Fraser. " Reminiscences of a 
Diplomatist's Wife " (Dodd) fills in some of the gaps 
left open in " A Diplomatist's Wife in Japan " and 
" A Diplomatist's Wife in Many Lands." The late 
Hugh Eraser's duties to his government called him, 
first and last, to many parts of the world to China 
and South America and Japan, as well as to various 
courts of Europe and Mrs. Fraser enjoyed with 
him the advantages of this method of introduction 
to many social circles in many capitals. Personages 
of note in public life pass across her pages, and now 
and then a man or woman of lesser note with whom 
one likes to come into familiar contact gives interest 
to the narrative. In her latest volume Mrs. Fraser 
lays her scene chiefly in Italy, with the figure of her 
brother, Marion Crawford, much in the foreground, 
at his spacious seaside villa at Sorrento. England, 
Polish Prussia, Austria, and Chile serve also as the 
setting of sundry interesting pictures of the past. A 
sketch of Crawford's study, " that great upper room, 
with its many windows and its wide door leading 
to the terrace, which was in reality the roof of the 
house," is drawn in a few lines ; and repeatedly the 
occupant of that study is exhibited in some character- 
istic act or utterance by the admiring sister. Por- 
traits of Mrs. Fraser, of her husband, and of her 
brother are to be found in the book. The favor with 
which its predecessors in the series were received, 
and the demand for another volume, led the writer, 
as she tells us in her preface, to give forth this agree- 
able continuation of her random retrospections. 

In a new book of essays, entitled 

Some towering ,, . ,, . .- . y-, ,, ,-f,. i \ 

personalities. AU Manner of Folk (Kennerley) , 
Mr. Holbrook Jackson interprets 
the messages of a dozen or more modern artists and 
thinkers, prefacing these studies with a few essays 
more general in theme : " Concerning Personalities," 
"Lords of Whim," "Masters of Nonsense," "Of the 
Self-Sufficient," and "Vagabonds." These opening 
essays, and particularly the first two of them, serve 



to suggest the dominating note of the whole book. 
It is personality that interests Mr. Jackson; though 
his subjects range from the airily brilliant Max 
Beerbohm and the self-sufficient Whistler, to the 
"suggestive heterodoxy" of Edward Carpenter, the 
"Americanism" of Whitman, and the Social Democ- 
racy of Henry M. Hyndman, all are united by their 
possession of dominating, towering personalities, and 
by their belief (sometimes, perhaps, unconscious) in 
the modern gospel of individualism. Of the "in- 
comparable" Max Beerbohm Mr. Jackson writes: 
" Cleverness and brilliance are the tricks of the lit- 
erary huckster, and to see only these characteristics 
in Max is not to see him at all. Max Beerbohm is 
first and foremost a personality; a point of view." 
Again, he says of Walt Whitman: "Whitman is 
more than a mere literary phenomenon: he is a 
symbol and a prophecy. His personality combines 
all that is momentous and enduring in a complex 
and cosmopolitan community. By his life no less 
than by his work, he is the interpreter and expositor 
of his land and race." And the essay on William 
Morris opens with this spirited challenge: "There 
are those who would separate the ideas of William 
Morris from his art. . . . They are not entitled to 
do so on the authority of William Morris. No artist 
appreciated better than he the interdependence of 
art, ideas, and affairs." It is this virile note, this 
insistence upon the ideas back of the art, the man 
behind the poems or pictures or social philosophy, 
that gives Mr. Jackson's criticism something of the 
personality and power that he looks for in the life 
and art he interprets, and that is winning for him 
friends and admirers with each new volume that he 
gives us. Drawings by Messrs. Joseph Simpson, 
Gordon Craig, Jo Davidson, J. B. Yeats, and Lovat 
Fraser furnish illustrations of unique interest. 

The name of Stonewall Jackson in 
the title of a book on the Civil War 
is sure to awaken interest and breed 
a desire to make the book's nearer acquaintance. 
"One of Jackson's Foot Cavalry" (Neale), by Mr. 
John H. Worsham, makes a double claim on the 
reader's curiosity. Why "foot" cavalry, and what 
new stories of the redoubtable Confederate general 
may the book contain? It was the twenty-first 
regiment, Virginia infantry, that by its steady, com- 
pact, and rapid marching won the name of Jackson's 
Foot Cavalry. It formed a part of the famous 
Second Brigade, which saw some of the hardest 
service of the entire war, in the brilliant Valley 
Campaign, the memorable and sanguinary Seven 
Days' Campaign, and the Maryland Campaign. 
Mr. Worsham enlisted in Company F of this gallant 
regiment at the beginning of the war, rose by suc- 
cessive promotions to the adjutancy of the regiment 
in 1864, but was wounded and permanently dis- 
abled a week later at Winchester. His narrative 
is that of one viewing no extended field of military 
operations, but unassumingly doing the nearest duty 
and acquitting himself well in his allotted place. 



Campaigning 
with Jackson, 



148 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16 r 



Here is his picture of Jackson at Fredericksburg : 
"Gen. Jackson soon made his appearance along the 
line with a cavalcade of officers following him. He 
was dressed in a brand-new uniform, with the usual 
gold lace trimmings for a lieutenant general. He 
even had exchanged the old gray cap for a new 
bespangled one, and looked so unlike our ' Old Jack ' 
that very few noticed him, and none recognized him 
until he had passed. Then the old accustomed cheer 
to him went up with unusual vigor!" The whole 
story of this campaigning with Jackson is well told. 
One would have liked to find a portrait of the author 
among those given, but his modesty has deprived the 
reader of that satisfaction. 



Songs with music Delicious nonsense verses, set to 
for children charmingly original melodies, both 

and others. text an ^ mus i c the work of Mrs. 

Louise Ayres Garnett, are given us in a volume of 
"Creature Songs," published by the Oliver Ditson 
Co. As if this were not enough, we are given for 
good measure a series of illustrative drawings, sym- 
pathetic in their humorous interpretation, by Mr. 
Peter Newell. One of the three aspects of this de- 
lightful book may be exhibited here : 

" The Quadruped is just a beast, 
With legs at north, west, south, and east. 
Perhaps he longs to have some more, 
And yet he seems content with four. 

" The Biped has a sorry lot, 
For only two legs has he got. 
He feels ashamed and hangs his head 
Whene'er he meets the Quadruped." 

Here is another merry little quip : 

" To wear a pair of Garter Snakes 

Would make me ill at ease; 
Perhaps they were created for 
The Aborigiknees." 

A nicer book for children is not often to be found. 
The same publishers send us, in their "Musicians' 
Library," a collection of "Forty Songs by Peter 
Ilyitch Tschaikowsky," for high voice, edited by 
Mr. James Huneker, who prefaces them by a bio- 
graphical and critical introduction, done in a some- 
what less staccato style than is usual with this writer. 
" Reticent in life, in his art he overflows. No com- 
poser except Schumann tells us so much of himself. 
Every piece of his work is signed, and he does not 
hesitate to make the most astounding confessions." 
Of the songs, Mr. Huneker says : " He has left over 
a hundred lyrics, a dozen of which place him in the 
angelic choir led by Franz Schubert, and composed 
of Schumann, Robert Franz, Brahms, and Richard 
Strauss," which is probably not an over-statement. 

The memoirs The once popular French actress 
of a famous familiar to her host of admirers as 
French actress. Ma( j ame Judith, but known to her 
smaller circle of friends as Julie Bernat and, after 
her marriage, as Madame Bernard-Derosne, leaves us 
her anecdotal and at times amusingly frank reminis- 
cences in an entertaining volume entitled "My Auto- 



biography" (Putnam). Contemporary with Rachel, 
with whom she was intimate from childhood, Julie 
Bernat took to the stage as a duck to water, and in 
1833, at the age of six, she performed a juvenile 
part at the Panthe'on, to the vociferous delight of 
the students in attendance. Her formal debut as an 
actress took place at Les Folies nine years later, and 
in 1846 she joined the Theatre francais. Some still 
living will recall her effective rendering of the parts 
of P^ne'lope, Alcmene, Rosine, Charlotte Corday, 
and Mile. Aiss^. She mastered the English language 
sufficiently to appear on the Manchester stage with 
credit to herself and acceptably to her audience. 
The little vanities and jealousies of her profession 
are not unapparent in her narrative, which for that 
reason is probably all the more entertaining. Inci- 
dentally she makes it very plain that the great Rachel r 
the tragedienne whose word and gesture could thrill 
a houseful of entranced play-goers, was a very human 
and sufficiently spiteful and vindictive woman ; and 
it is not unlikely that Rachel would have felt herself 
equal to the task of returning the compliment. Many 
famous characters of an eventful period in French 
history appear in Madame Judith's pages. The book 
is well translated by Mrs. Arthur Bell, edited by Mr. 
Paul G'Sell, and adorned with a frontispiece portrait 
of its captivating heroine. 

Memories The Scottish novelist, Mrs. L. B. 

of Victorian Walford, whose " Recollections " ap- 
ceiebrities. peared some years ago, has now 

published a by-product of that book, " Memories of 
Victorian London" (Longmans). In an excessively 
loose and gossipy manner, she relates the social life 
in which, as a guest of her friend "Mary," she took 
part in the London that is no more; emphasizing, 
with good judgment, her acquaintance with men 
and women who are, in another way, acquaintances 
of the reader. Carlyle, Mrs. Carlyle, Tennyson, 
Ruskin, George Eliot, Millais, Darwin, Tyndall, 
Stanley, Oscar Wilde, and a dozen other celebrities 
talk, and tell stories, and look what they are, or do 
not look what they are, till we are so much at home 
that we do not wince when an "as we all know" 
discloses our ignorance of that day of pink gloves 
and balloon skirts and perfect propriety. Of course 
we attend one of the inevitable Rogers breakfast- 
parties, this time the host is glum. We also meet 
" George Eliot, with her large head, and rather horse- 
like face." Mrs. Darwin hears, from her cook, that 
her worthy husband is an idle man, " I see him in 
the garden yesterday sitting staring at a leaf over 
two hours ! " Carlyle lifts his shaggy head from the 
pillow and thunders "Doctor? I'm for none of your 
doctors. Of all the sons of Adam, men of medicine 
are the most unprofitable"; and the terrified phy- 
sician retreats, and Carlyle is so roused by the visit 
that "it put fresh spirit into him, and he began at 
once to get better." Ah, those were days ! Small 
wonder that the novel, for instance, is not what 
it was: "when great, strong notes were struck, 
though it might be harshly and crudely, they vibrated

through the inmost fibres of our being, and we 
kissed the hand that smote us. They do not smite, 
and we do not kiss, now." 

That well-known bird-lover and writer 
about birds, Bradford Torrey, who 
died rather suddenly and at much 
too early an age, last October, at Santa Barbara, had 
sent the material for his last book to the publishers 
a few weeks before his death. " Field- Days in Cali- 
fornia" (Houghton) collects in attractive and well- 
illustrated book form a number of sketches already 
published in periodicals, with some new ones. They 
tell us about the author's first condor and first water- 
ouzels, his " exciting forenoon " with a yellow-legged 
plover, the happy issue of an unsuccessful hunt, a 
walking tour in the Yosemite, the attractions of a 
California beach, a visit to the redwood grove near 
Santa Cruz, and other things well worth reading 
about in Mr. Torrey's genial, fresh-air-and-sunshine 
style. One of his chapters, of a bookish sort, for a 
change, enlarges on the pleasures of reading a check- 
list, and will appeal to the man of books. The au- 
thor was not quite sixty-nine when his field-days were 
cut short an age that now represents the prime of 
a man's life. To give his final volume something of 
a memorial character, the publishers have provided 
it with a good portrait of the author and illustrations 
of some of his California haunts that are treated in 
the book, and that, in two instances, show an open-air 
view of Mr. Torrey. His friends and admirers will 
prize the little volume. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" China's Revolution " (McBride), by Mr. Edwin J. 
Dingle, can scarcely be said to fulfill the expectations 
aroused by its subtitle, " a historical and political rec- 
ord of the civil war." The best chapters in the book are 
those narrating events and describing scenes of the war 
at Hankow, from which city Mr. Dingle was reporting. 
These chapters are interesting and valuable. The rest 
of the book indicates insufficient breadth of knowledge 
and only moderate grasp of the problems of the present 
in China. The style is decidedly journalistic. 

" Fundamentals of French Grammar " (Holt), by Mr. 
William B. Snow, is a practical text-book b'ased upon 
the inductive method, which has many points of excel- 
lence, and which does not overburden the student with 
grammatical material. " What might reasonably be 
omitted " has been the author's chief concern. " Essen- 
tials of French " by Dr. Victor E. Francois is a " slowly 
progressive grammar " published by the American Book 
Co. " Moliere en Re'cits " (Heath), is a title that ex- 
plains itself. It is the joint work of Messrs. M. L. 
Chapuzet and W. M. Daniels, two English teachers. A 
few " scenes for acting " are appended. Moliere's " Les 
Prdcieuses Ridicules" and "Les Femmes Savantes" 
(Holt) are edited for school use by Mrs. John R. Effinger. 

A welcome addition to the series of " Little Books on 
Art " (McClurg) is Miss Muriel Ciolkowska's volume 
on Rodin. It gives one an interesting glimpse of the life 
and work of the greatest of living sculptors. Rodin's 
relations to his predecessors, his obscure and difficult 



beginnings, his long struggle for recognition, his chief 
works and their occasions, his drawings and etchings and 
ceramic designs, are some of the topics taken up in this 
convenient little volume. The author gives a selection 
of the master's opinions on art, and supports her esti- 
mate of his place among artists by abundant and inter- 
esting quotations from contemporary criticism. A list 
of Rodin's exhibited works, a bibliography, and twenty- 
five illustrations complete a book which seems to be 
fairly accurate, despite the persistent neglect of Villon 
as the creator of that tragic figure of poesy embodied 
in " La Vieille Hdaulmiere." 

For more than a decade the " Oxford Book of En- 
glish Verse " has held its own as the most widely 
popular of all anthologies with the possible exception 
of Palgrave's " Golden Treasury." The compiler, Sir 
Arthur Quiller-Couch, now offers a companion volume, 
the " Oxford Book of Victorian Verse," which covers 
the field from Landor to Mr. Lascelles Abercrombie 
certainly an elastic interpretation of the Victorian 
boundaries. But elasticity of plan is a good principle 
for any anthologist, and probably most readers of this 
collection will be chiefly grateful for the generous 
space given to writers who have come to the front 
during the past quarter-century. Eighteen American 
poets are represented, usually with a poem or two apiece. 
This does not seem to us well-advised; our writers should 
have been dealt with more adequately or else omitted 
altogether. However, after the shabby treatment ac- 
corded Whitman in Professor Lounsbury's " Yale Book 
of American Verse " a great deal can be forgiven an 
English editor who devotes eleven pages to " the good 
gray poet." As must be inevitable with any anthology, 
the individual poetry-lover will grumble a little over what 
will seem to him errors of 'proportion or omission; but 
his abiding feeling will be one of gratitude for such a 
wealth of treasure in so compact and beautiful a form. 
The volume is gracefully dedicated "To my future friends 
and pupils at Cambridge, this propitiatory wreath." 

The delightful Oxford reprints continue to multiply. 
Chief among the newest batch of volumes is a collected 
edition of Robert Bridges's poetical works (exclusive of 
the dramas). It is something of an honor to be the 
only living poet thus far included in the Oxford series; 
but Mr. Bridges is deserving of such distinction, and we 
hope this volume may widely extend his reputation. 
Next in interest is " The Pageant of English Prose," 
made up of seven hundred pages of choice passages 
selected with rare good judgment by Mr. R. M. 
Leonard. A third volume gives us the entire contents 
of the recent two- volume definitive edition of Coleridge's 
complete poems, edited by Mr. Ernest Hartley Coleridge ; 
a fourth contains Browning's " The Ring and the Book," 
with an introduction by Professor Dowden; while the 
poems of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the Australian writer, 
make up a fifth. The ordinary editions of these books 
are models of inexpensive bookmaking; but those who 
care for luxurious perfection may obtain, for a little 
more than the price of the average novel, the same 
books printed on India paper, with limp covers and 
photogravure portraits. By means of these Oxford 
India paper editions, authoritative texts of all that is 
of first importance in English literature may now be 
brought together almost on a single shelf of an ordinary 
bookcase, in a form that could not be excelled for beauty 
and dignity of workmanship, and at a price well within 
the means of any but the most impecunious of book- 
lovers.

Publication of Air. Jeffery Farnol's new novel, " The 
Amateur Gentleman," has now been definitely settled

Admiral Mahan's forthcoming work on the naval 
tactics of the Revolutionary War, of which we spoke in 
a recent issue, has been postponed until autumn. 

Sir Gilbert Parker's latest novel, " The Judgment 
House," which has been appearing serially in " Harper's 
Magazine," will be published in book form on March 19. 

Collected editions, in a single volume each, of the 
plays of Mr. Galsworthy and August Strindberg are 
promised for immediate publication by Messrs. Scribner. 

Mr. Woodrow Wilson's forceful address entitled 
" The Free Life " will soon be issued in a new and 
specially attractive form by its publishers, the Thomas 
Y. Crowell Co. 

Mr. Thomas Robinson Dawley, Jr., author of " The 
Child That Toileth Not," has in preparation a volume 
of personal reminiscences entitled " Fragments from a 
Venturesome Career." 

The volume of " New Comedies " by Lady Gregory, 
which Messrs. Putnam have in preparation, will contain 
five plays, at least two of which are being given by the 
Abbey Company in their present American visit. 

Two new books by Mr. Maurice Hewlett are a feature 
of Messrs. Scribner's spring list. One, " The Lore of 
Proserpine," is a volume of allegorical studies ; the other 
is a book of poems entitled " Helen Redeemed." 

The Doves Press edition of Goethe's " Torquato 
Tasso " is promised for March publication by Mr. 
Cobden-Sanderson; and in June next the Press will add 
" Julius Caesar " to its edition of Shakespeare reprinted 
from the early folios. 

Mr. Gordon Craig's latest volume, " Towards a New

of Mr. Craig's unique scenic settings, with introduction 
and descriptive notes. 

Two books of travel covering widely different scenes 
will be issued this month by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & 
Co. in Miss Betham-Edwards's " In French Africa: 
Scenes and Memories," and Mr. E. A. Bostwick's " The 
Different West: As Seen by a Transplanted Easterner." 

A useful series of small volumes dealing with the 
great writers is announced by Messrs. F. G. Browne & 
Co. in " The Regent Library." Fourteen volumes, 
headed by one on Johnson by Mrs. Alice Meynell, will 
appear in March, and numerous others are in prepara- 
tion. 



Professor A. F. Pollard has been chosen to inaugurate 
the Goldwin Smith lectures at Cornell University. His 
subject is " The Place of Parliamentary Institutions in 
the Development of Civilisation." The lectures are to 
be delivered early this year, and they will be subse- 
quently published in book form. 

" The Russian Empire of To-day and Yesterday," by 
Mr. Nevin O. Winter, is announced for early issue in 
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.'s well-known travel series. 
This firm has also in press " The Art of the Wallace 
Collection," by Mr. Henry C. Shelley, to appear in the 
" Art Galleries of Europe " series. 

It is not often that the first three books issued by a 
new publishing house reach second or third editions 
within a few weeks after publication. This is the rec- 
ord achieved by Messrs. F. G. Browne & Co. with their 
three novels, " The Lapse of Enoch Wentworth," " Pil- 
grims of the Plains," and " The Stain." 

The first issue of an important new religious journal, 
to be called " The Constructive Quarterly," will appear 
in March. Its comprehensive purpose and scope may 
perhaps best be indicated by its sub-title " A Journal 
of the Faith and Work and Thought of Christendom." 
Mr. Silas McBee, for many years editor of " The 
Churchman," will edit the new journal, and George H. 
Doran Co. will be its American publishers. 

A collection of essays by Professor George Santayana 
is announced under the title of " Winds of Doctrine : 
Studies in Contemporary Opinion." It deals with " The 
Intellectual Temper of the Age," " Modernism," " M. 
Bergson's Philosophy," " Pragmatism " (on which Pro- 
fessor Santayana agrees with the criticisms of Mr. Ber- 
trand Russell), "Shelley, or The Poetic Value of 
Revolutionary Principles," and " The Genteel Traditions 
in American Philosophy." 

Among the more noteworthy of Messrs. Scribner's 
spring announcements are Mr. Henry James's autobio- 
graphical account of "A Small Boy and Others"; a 
volume of studies by Mr. James Huneker entitled " The 
Pathos of Distance"; Mr. Price Collier's "Germany 
and the Germans "; a two- volume " Life of John Paul 
Jones" by Mrs. Reginald De Koven; "The Letters of 
General George G. Meade," in two volumes; "European 
Cities at Work," by Mr. Frederic C. Howe; and "Mon- 
archial Socialism in Germany," by Mr. Elmer Roberts. 

Dr. Samuel Willard, educator and author, and for 
many years a contributor to THE DIAL, died at his home 
in Chicago, on February 9. He was born in Vermont 
in 1821, and came to Illinois at the age of ten, graduat- 
ing from the state college in 1843. Previous to the Civil 
War, Dr. Willard came into prominence in connection 
with the " underground railroad," establishing with his 
father a station for fugitive slaves. During the war he 
served in one of the Illinois regiments. For many years 
past he had been a teacher of history in the Chicago 
high schools. 

Among other important works of serious interest an- 
nounced by the Macmillan Co. are " A History of the 
American Negro" by Dr. Benjamin Griffith Brawley, 
" The Soul of America " by Dr. Stanton Coit, " Amer- 
ican Syndicalism: The I. W. W." by Mr. John Graham 
Brooks, "Ancient Ideals" by Mr. Henry Osborn Taylor,

A LITERARY SENSATION! 

The Uncollected Writings of 

EMERSON 

(Essays, Reviews, Poems and Letters which 
have lain concealed for fifty years) 

"It seems almost beyond belief for 
hitherto unpublished matter escaping the 
notice of editors and publishers to make 
its appearance at this day. The Lamb 
Company is to be congratulated on its 
literary find." Richmond Times-Dispatch. 

" To students of Emerson this volume 
will be of abiding interest." 

Toronto Globe. 

" The reprints in this book are lustrous 
with the Emerson intellectuality and 
with this great man's beauty of expressing 
his thoughts. They are very precious to 
the readers of classic literature."

Remain Holland's JEAN CHRISTOPHE: JOURNEY'S END (Love and Friendhip-The Burning Buh-The Nw Dawn) $1.50 net. 
This concludes M. Holland's notable trilogy of novels about a great German composer, who has suggestions of Wagner. 
The first eighty of these five hundred and odd pages are concerned chiefly with the marriage of Christophe's best friend 
Olivier and to Christophe's rise as a composer till he is hailed by some critics as the greatest one living, while he is ridiculed 
by others. Then follow episodes, beginning with Christophe's love for a Parisian actress that makes this volume the most 
dramatic of the three. The London Times says it shows " Holland in the full force o_f his personality . . . that unexampled 
force and tenderness in the delineation of passion or sentiment ..." and the notice continues: "Its vivid pictures of a 
Socialist First of May. . . . Jean Christophe, singing on a barricade, twists the sabre of a French policeman . . . and kills 
him . . . and he is obliged to fly for his life into Switzerland. The second half is almost from the start to finish a master- 
piece. . . . The story of Jean-Christophe between Dr. Braun and his wife is pretty much the story of Tristan and Isolde." 

Laurence Housman's KING JOHN OF JINGALO 

Combines the romance of a lovable king with a biting satire on the English government, which the New York Sun says if

[March 1, 



By ARTHUR E. BOSTWICK 

The Different West 

The West of the book is the belt of great states 
fringing the Mississippi, usually termed the Middle 
West; and "different" means difference from the 
East. The author, formerly connected with the 
New York Public Library, and one time President 
of the American Library Association, is a trans- 
planted easterner who has taken root and become an 
appreciative westerner now Librarian of the St. 
Louis Public Library. 

The strong impressions made upon him, and the 
lack of literature on the subject, led to the recording 
of his conclusions and generalizations which cover 
the land features, vegetation, weather conditions, 
transportation, education, politics, art, science, lit- 
erature, speech and other conditions of difference 
between East and West. 

Fundamental misconceptions of attitude and tem- 
perament and mutual misunderstandings are pointed 
out, so that the work will do good service in helping 
bring the sections closer together. The views are 
bright, taking and optimistic. Many bits of humor, 
illustrative stories, and facts of value fill the pages. 
The book is eminently adapted for popular reading.

FOR MARCH 

Will contain an article on The 
High Cost of Living (familiar 
topic) and Shakespeare 

The problem of the cost of living is not a matter of 
to-day or yesterday. Just about the time Shake- 
speare was born all England was in a turmoil over 
the same problem, for the prices of the necessities 
of life had been doubled, probably on account of 
the flooding of the country with gold brought back 
from Mexico. This condition was naturally serious 
to the poor scribe of Elizabethan London, who, 
receiving from four to six pounds for a play, was 
confronted by the exactions of the landlord of his 
humble lodging, and the keeper of the tavern at 
which he dined when he did dine. 

And many other articles.

JO A Q UIN MILLER. 

A year ago, the National Institute of Arts 
and Letters bestowed its gold medal for poetry 
upon Mr. James Whitcomb Riley, thereby ex- 
pressing the opinion that he was the most dis- 
tinguished of American poets then living. We 
might comment upon this grotesque award in 
considerable detail, instituting " odorous " com- 
parisons with quite a number of men who have 
better realized the high seriousness of the poet's 
calling, and have avowed themselves servants of 
the muse to such effect that they have made no 
bid for vulgar applause, and have been content 
with the small but fit audience of " them that 
know." But at present we will do no more 
than call attention to the fact that the award in 
question overlooked the fairly obvious title of 
another son of Indiana, whose place in the poeti- 
cal firmament was fixed long before Hoosier 
dialect " had the cry " in our literature, and 
whose light reached to the far places of the earth 
at a time when the number of American poets 
whose names had ever been heard of abroad 
might be counted on the fingers of one hand. 

The famous American poet who died on the 
seventeenth of this month was born in Wabash 
District, Indiana, on the tenth of November, 
1841. It is with something of a surprise that 
we realize that his years were no more than 
seventy-one, so long has he figured in our imag- 
ination as a venerable and almost legendary 
figure, and so far back seems the time when his 
"Songs of the Sierras" took the English- 
speaking world by storm. We have somehow 
acquired the habit of associating him with the 
other " good gray poet " whom he resembled in 
his amazing intellectual energy and his defiance 
of conventionality, and who was really more than 
a score of years his senior. He lived a hermit 
for so many years of his later life that his figure 
gradually assumed heroic proportions, and men- 
tion of his name recalled the distant past rather 
than the pulsating present of the world of men. 
Cincinnatus Hiner (sometimes spelled Heine) 
Miller was the name with which his misguided 
parents did their best to handicap his career, 
and for which he substituted the more melodi- 
ous and fitting " Joaquin" when he commenced 
poet in the sense of publication. When a boy 
of tender years, he was taken by his family to

THE DIAL, 



[March 3, 



Oregon, which was his home until 1870, except 
for the periods during which he became a wan- 
derer and an adventurer. The settled years of 
his Oregon sojourn found him a student of 
Columbia College, Portland, from which he was 
graduated in 1858 as valedictorian, then a stu- 
dent and practitioner of law, then the editor of- 
a Democratic paper suppressed for sedition dur- 
ing the Civil War, then a county judge for four 
years. His vagrant years found him playing 
many parts California gold-miner, Indian 
sachem, and Spanish vaquero. It is reported, 
although we believe upon uncertain authority, 
that he was with Walker on his filibustering 
expedition into Nicaragua. At all events, he 
made Walker the subject of one of his most 
striking poems. 

It was in 1870-71 that "Joaquin Miller" 
became a name to conjure with wherever the 
English tongue was spoken. That was the year 
of his apotheosis, when he visited England, was 
welcomed by Tennyson, Browning, Swinburne, 
and Rossetti as one of their company, and pub- 
lished in London his "Songs of the Sierras." 
No American poet (except possibly Longfellow) 
had ever enjoyed such a vogue in England, or 
received such tributes of admiration from those 
most competent to appraise a poet. The day of 
Whitman was to come later, and Poe had long 
been in his grave before his extraordinary Eu- 
ropean fame had come to fruition. But the 
recognition accorded Miller was immediate and 
unstinted, and no American has better savoured 
the sweets of appreciation in a foreign land, or 
been made more fully conscious of the verdict of 
his " contemporaneous posterity . ' ' When his vol - 
ume was soon thereafter republished in America, 
his name was on every lip from Cape Cod to the 
Golden Gate, and his country rejoiced in the 
possession of a new and what seemed to be an 
authentic poet. 

Miller was thus fairly plunged into the liter- 
ary career and, making his home in Washington 
after his return to the United States, became a 
prolific writer. Some of the works of the fol- 
lowing years were "Songs of the Sunlands" 
(1873), " Songs of the Desert" (1875), "Songs 
of Italy" (1878), and "Songs of the Mexican 
Seas " ( 1887 ) . Besides these poems, there were 
two novels, "The Baroness of New York " (1 87 7), 
and "The Danites in the Sierras "(1881). In 
its dramatized form, this novel became " The 
Danites," a very successful stage play. Thus 
for nearly a score of years, Miller was constantly 
before the public, was widely read, and known 
to all his countrymen. His translation to Cali- 



fornia in 1887 marked the decline of his vogue, 
a decline that left him in the closing years of his 
life little more than a legendary figure belonging 
to the tradition of the past. For this there are 
two chief reasons. The first is that his work 
deteriorated in quality, owing to the journalistic 
facility with which most of it was produced. 
The proportion of dross to pure metal grew 
steadily larger, and his verse tended to become 
more and more diffuse and unrestrained. The 
other reason is that his burst into fame resulted 
largely from the English recognition accorded 
him in 1870-71. This was in part fictitious, 
resulting not so much from the feeling that he 
was a great poet on the absolute terms of poetry 
as from the fact that he lived up to the precon- 
ceived idea of what an American poet ought to 
be. As " The Nation " says : " It is the volcanic 
or eccentric elements in our literature that Eu- 
rope prefers to accept as typically American 
Poe and Whitman in the spirit of their works, 
Bret Harte in his picturesque material, and 
Joaquin Miller in his own picturesque person- 
ality of flowing mane, flannel shirt, and boots." 
In this country, we know enough to take such 
things at their worth, and to understand that 
they are anything but essential to the embodi- 
ment of the American spirit in literature. Raci- 
ness is a literary quality not to be undervalued, 
but it is not enough alone to save a man's work 
from oblivion. 

When Miller went to California in 1887 to 
establish his permanent home, he built a sort of 
communal dwelling on the heights above Oak- 
land, near San Francisco. There were several 
small houses erected on the hillside for himself, 
the members of his family, and the guests who 
sought out his retreat for his hospitality was 
as generous and inclusive as that of Bjornson at 
Aulestad. Here he made a garden spot on the 
ungrateful soil, and lived out his last years in 
patriarchal retirement. Such a home had been 
the dream of his earlier years, and he had fore- 
shadowed it in these verses: 

" I know a grassy slope above the sea, 
The utmost limit of the Western land. 

Here I shall sit in sunlit life's decline 
Beneath my vine and sombre verdant tree. 
Some tawny maids in other tongues than mine 
Shall minister. Some memories shall be 
Before me. I shall sit and I shall see 
That last, vast day that dawn shall re-inspire, 
The sun fall down upon the farther sea, 
Fall wearied down to rest, and so retire, 
A splendid sinking isle of far-off fading fire." 

Mr. F. W. Halsey, who visited him shortly 
after the poet had retreated from his visit to 



1913] 



THE DIAL

the Klondike in the year of the great stampede, 
thus describes the poet as he then appeared: 

"Imagine a man of tall, athletic build, with fine, 
dome-shaped brow; long, tawny hair streaked with 
gray; a tangle of yellow moustache and beard; a 
strong, large, nose, sunburned like his cheeks, and clear, 
flashing gray-blue eyes that look out from under heavy, 
bushy eyebrows with the quickness and the eagerness of 
a boy's. He looked as one fancies Kit Carson looked 
when he guided Fre"mont the Pathfinder through the 
hostile Indian country out to the Western sea. Miller 
was dressed in a corduroy coat, trousers in boots, 
pongee shirt, with loose Japanese neck-scarf, and broad 
sombrero. The whole appearance of the man suggested 
his revolt against any restraint of costume, just as his 
talk suggests his warfare on conventionality and his 
delight in what is free and spontaneous in nature and 
life." 

Miller was by no means idle during the 
quarter-century of his hermit life in California, 
and, although the poetic fire was somewhat 
slackened, the output of verse did not cease. 
Some of his noblest poems, such as the Tenny- 
son tribute and the Columbus song, date from 
this period of his life. Several years ago, he 
built for himself a funeral cairn of black flint, 
with hollowed top filled with logs, to serve as 
his funeral pyre, and there it was that the other 
day his ashes were returned to the elements. 
His third wife and their daughter Juanita were 
with him to the end. Nothing in his life became 
him better than the leaving of it thus. Of his 
poetical gospel, the following quotations may 
give illustrative evidence : " Exalt your theme 
rather than ask your theme to exalt you. Braver 
and better to celebrate the lowly and forgiving 
grasses under foot than the stately cedars and 
sequoias overhead. They can speak for them- 
selves. Be loyal to your craft, to your fellow 
scribes. I plead for something more than the 
individual hero. I plead for the entire republic. 
Not to have a glorious literature of our own 
is to be another Nineveh, Babylon, Turkey. 
Nothing ever has paid, nothing ever will pay a 
nation like poetry." Of Miller's outlook upon 
life, and his appraisal of its values, the following 
exquisite poem gives an idea : 

" Ah, there be souls none understand, 
Like clouds, they cannot touch the land, 
Drive as they may by field or town, 
Then we look wise at this, and frown, 
And we cry < Fool! ' and cry < Take hold 
Of earth, and fashion gods of gold ! ' 

" Unanchored ships, that blow and blow, 
Sail to and fro, and then go down 
In unknown seas that none shall know, 
Without one ripple of renown; 
Poor drifting dreamers, sailing by, 
That seem to only live to die. 



" Call these not fools, the test of worth 
Is not the hold you have of earth; 
Lo, there be gentlest souls, sea blown, 
That know not any harbor known; 
And it may be the reason is 
They touch on fairer shores than this." 



A GREAT LADY AND A GREAT 
TRADITION. 

Alice Spencer was the sixth daughter of Sir John 
Spencer, of Althorp Manor, Northamptonshire. 
In 1579 she married Ferdinando Stanley (1559 [?]- 
1594), Baron Strange and fifth Earl of Derby. 
From 1589 to 1594 Baron Strange was patron of a 
company of actors known as "Lord Strange 's com- 
pany," and directed for a time by Edward Alleyn, 
son-in-law of Philip Henslowe, business manager. 
Shakespeare was probably a member of this com- 
pany for some years before 1592. In 1589 Robert 
Greene dedicated his "Ciceronis Amor" to Baron 
Strange. Thomas Nash has a panegyric on him in 
"Piers Pennilesse," 1592. George Chapman, in 
the dedication ,of his "Shadow of the Night," 1594, 
speaks of Stanley as "that most ingenious Darbie." 
In 1595 the Earl of Derby is the Shepherd Amyntas 
in Spenser's "Colin Clouts Come Home Againe," 
who, Spenser writes, could "pipe with passing skill." 
The only known poem by Ferdinando Stanley is a 
pastoral of no great merit contributed by Sir John 
Hawkins to Grose's " Antiquarian Repertory " and 
reprinted in Horace Walpole's "Royal and Noble 
Authors." 

Six years after the death of the Earl of Derby, 
in 1600, his widow became the third wife of Sir 
Thomas Egerton (1540[?]-1617), Baron Ellesmere 
and Viscount Brackley, Lord Keeper of the Great 
Seal. But Lady Egerton retained her title, and 
was known as the Countess of Derby, until her 
death at Harefield Manor, January 26, 1636. 

Sir Thomas Egerton was Bacon's immediate pre- 
decessor as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. Ben 
Jonson wrote three epigrams in his honor ; and 
"the silver-tongued" Joshua Sylvester, a sonnet. 
In 1603, Samuel Daniel, then tutor to Lady Anne 
Clifford, wrote a poetical epistle to the Lord Chan- 
cellor, bewailing his "misery, that whilst I should 
have written the actions of men, I have been con- 
strained to live with children." Beside Daniel's com- 
plaint should stand Lady Anne's appreciation of her 
tutor. A large family picture of the Cliffords pre- 
serves Daniel's portrait beside Lady Anne Clifford's, 
while a detail of the painting shows a shelf on which 
Daniel's poetical works stand next to Spenser's. 

In 1596 Sir John Davies (1569-1626) dedicated 
to Sir Thomas Egerton his " Orchestra, or a 
Poeme of Dancing." A copy of the first edition of 
" Orchestra," with Davies's dedicatory sonnet to 
Lord Ellesmere, in manuscript, beautifully written, 
is preserved at Bridgewater House. 

The foundations of the great library at Bridge-

water House were laid by Lord Chancellor Elles- 
mere. Some of the books belonged to his third wife, 
the Countess of Derby, who as Alice Spencer and 
Lady Strange was a popular patron of literature. 

John Egerton (1579-1649), son of Baron Elles- 
mere, became the first Earl of Bridgewater. Before 
him, as President of Wales, was presented Mil- 
ton's " Comus," at Ludlow Castle, Shropshire, on 
Michaelmas-Night, 1634. Bridgewater improved 
the great library left him by his father. His son, 
John Egerton (1622-1683), second Earl of Bridge- 
water, is described by Sir Henry Chauncy, historian 
of Hertfordshire, as " a learned man " who " de- 
lighted much in his library." 

By her first husband, the Countess of Derby had 
three daughters. Lady Elizabeth Stanley married, 
in June, 1603, Henry Lord Hastings, who succeeded 
his grandfather as Earl of Huntingdon, in 1605. 
Lady Frances Stanley, about the time her mother 
married Sir Thomas Egerton, married his son, John 
Egerton, created Earl of Bridgewater, 27 May, 
1617. Lady Anne Stanley married Grey Brydges, 
fifth Lord Chandos (1579JTJ-1621). 

It is Alice Spencer, Countess of Derby, of whom 
Thomas Warton wrote, "The peerage-book of this 
countess is the poetry of her time." Warton was 
thinking of the unique distinction of a lady to whom 
Spenser dedicated in her youth his "Teares of the 
Muses," before whom and her guest, the Queen of 
England, Shakespeare's "Othello" was first pre- 
sented, and who lived to have Milton write "Ar- 
cades" for an Entertainment to her at her house 
at Harefield. Warton might well have written, 
"The peerage-book of this countess is the literature 
of her time," for Elizabethan literature is studded 
all over with dedications, epistles, and poetical 
laudations, which the Countess of Derby shared 
with her two husbands, with her three daughters, 
and with her grandchildren. 

A series of most interesting dedications and lit- 
erary memorabilia attest the interest in literature 
of the Countess of Derby and her daughters and 
grandchildren. 

In 1591 Spenser dedicated to the Countess of 
Derby, then Lady Strange, the poem of his " Com- 
plaints," entitled "The Teares of the Muses." As 
is known, Spenser claimed kinship with the noble 
house of Spencer of Althorp. Whatever the relation- 
ship was, the dedication of this poem shows that 
it was acknowledged by the Althorp Spencers. 
Spenser writes to Lady Strange: "The causes for 
which ye have thus deserved of me to be honoured 
(if honour it be at all) are, both your particular 
bounties, and also some private bands of affinitie, 
which it hath pleased your Ladiship to acknowl- 
edge." 

In 1595 the Countess of Derby, newly widowed, 
is Amaryllis mourning for her mate, the shepherd 
Amyntas, in Spenser's "Colin Clouts Come Home 
Againe." Spenser's tribute to the Countess of 
Derby, as Amaryllis, is: 



" Shepheard, what ever them hast heard to be 
In this or that praysd diversly apart, 
In her thou maist them all assembled see, 
And seald up in the threasure of her hart." 

(lines 56S-571.) 

Amyntas, the Earl of Derby, is finely lamented : 
" He, whilest he lived, was the noblest swaine, 
That ever piped in an oaten quill : 
Both did he other which could pipe maintaine, 
And eke could pipe himselfe with passing skill." 

(lines 440-443.) 

In 1602 Queen Elizabeth paid a visit of four 
days, July 31 -August 3, to the Lord Keeper, Sir 
Thomas Egerton, and the Countess of Derby, at 
their house, Harefield, in Middlesex, about four miles 
north of Uxbridge, on the border of Bucks. The 
cost of the visit was not far short of 2000 i.e., 
about 16,000, present value. Part of this money 
was paid to "Burbidges players for Othello," the 
first recorded performance of the tragedy. Whether 
Shakespeare accompanied "Burbidges players" to 
Harefield, or was one of them, is unknown ; but it is 
certainly likely that he was present at the first pre- 
sentation of his great play before the Queen. The 
Entertainment at Harefield on this occasion was 
written by John Lyly. A contemporary manuscript 
of this Entertainment was owned, by Sir Roger 
Newdigate, in 1803, and was printed in Nichols's 
"Progresses of Queen Elizabeth" from a copy made 
by the Rev. Ralph Churton. 

In 1603 a set of verses on the death of Queen 
Elizabeth, entitled " The Death of Delia, with Teares 
of her Funeral," was inscribed to the Countess of 
Derby. In 1605 a "Countess of Derby" was one 
of the noble ladies who assisted Queen Anne in Ben 
Jonson's masque of " Blackness," "personated at the 
Court of Whitehall on Twelfth Night." It is not 
certain whether this was the Countess Dowager of 
Derby, or the wife of her late husband's brother and 
successor, William Stanley, sixth Earl of Derby. 
In 1607 John Marston wrote " The Lord and Lady 
Huntingdon's Entertainment of their Noble Mother, 
Alice Countess Dowager of Darby, the night of her 
honor's arrival at the House of Ashby." This 
masque was prepared by Marston in honor of a visit 
which the Dowager Countess of Derby paid to her 
son-in-law and daughter Elizabeth, the Earl and 
Countess of Huntingdon, at their seat at Ashby-de- 
la-Zouch, in August, 1607. 

In 1608 a Countess of Derby, the Countess Dow- 
ager, or her sister-in-law, assisted in Ben Jonson's 
masque of "Beauty," performed by Queen Anne 
and her ladies on the Sunday after Twelfth Night, 
January 10. 

On February 2, 1609, Queen Anne presented her 
third masque at Whitehall, Ben Jonson's "Queens 
celebrated from the House of Fame." Among the 
noble ladies who assisted the Queen on this occasion 
were the Countess Dowager of Derby, and her 
daughter Elizabeth, Countess of Huntingdon. 

In 1609, John Davies, of Hereford (1565 [?]- 
1618), dedicated his "Holy Roode, or Christ's 



1913]

Crosse," to the Countess of Derby and her three 
daughters, in this strain: 

" To the Right Honorable well-accomplished Lady Alice, 
Countess of Derby, my good lady and mistress, and to her 
three right noble daughters by birth, nature, and education, 
the Lady Elizabeth Countess of Huntingdon, the Lady 
Frances Egerton, and the Lady Ann, wife to the truly noble 
Lord Gray Chandois that now is, be all comfort whensoever 
crost." 

Davies's "The Scourge of Folly," about 1610 or 
1611, also celebrates the Countess of Derby as his 
"good lady and mistress" in a series of verses in 
her honor. In 1616 Thomas Gainsford published 
a work called "The Historic of Trebizond." It is 
a collection of romantic stories divided into four 
books, which are separately dedicated to the Countess 
Dowager of Derby, the Countess of Huntingdon, 
Lady Frances Egerton, and Lady Anne Chandos. 

One of the most famous portraits of Shakespeare* 
is the Chandos portrait, now in the National Por- 
trait Gallery of London. The artist is unknown ; 
but the portrait has been attributed to Cornelius 
Janssen and to Paul Van Somer. The history of 
this celebrated portrait shows that it was preserved 
for posterity, partly at least, by the descendants of 
the Countess of Derby. The " Dictionary of National 
Biography" says of this portrait: "At length it 
reached the hands of James Brydges, third Duke of 
Chandos, through his father-in-law, John Nichols, 
and it subsequently passed through Chandos's 
daughter, to her husband, the Duke of Buckingham, 
at the sale of whose effects at Stowe, in 1848, it was 
purchased by the Earl of Ellesmere. The latter 
presented it to the nation." 

On Shrove-Tuesday night, February 18, 1634, 
Thomas Carew, Henry Lawes, and Inigo Jones 
presented their masque, " Ccelum Britannicum," in 
the Banqueting House at Whitehall, and King 
Charles I. was one of the actors. Among the 
" Young Lords and Noblemen's Sons " who took 
part were John Egerton, Viscount Brackley, his 
brother Mr. Thomas Egerton, and his cousin Lord 
Chandos. 

The Earl of Bridgewater went into residence as 
President of Wales in 1633. The social functions 
attendant upon his inauguration extended to Sep- 
tember, 1634, when on Michaelmas night Milton's 
masque of "Comus," which was written for this occa- 
sion, was presented before him. The masque was 
given in the great justice-chamber of Ludlow Castle, 
Shropshire, whose ruins still bear the name of Comus 
Hall. In the presentation, the part of the Lady was 
played by Lady Alice Egerton ; the First Brother 
was John Egerton, Viscount Brackley ; and the 
Second Brother, Mr. Thomas Egerton. " Comus " 
was written while Milton was living with his parents 
at Horton, Bucks, and Viscount Brackley was his 
father's landlord. 

In the dedication of " Comus " to Viscount 
Brackley, Henry Lawes says that it is " not openly 
acknowledged by the Author, yet it is a legitimate 
offspring, so lovely and so much desired, that the 
often copying of it hath tired my pen to give my 



several friends satisfaction." Milton's short masque, 
" Arcades," is described by him as " Part of an 
Entertainment presented to the Countess Dowager 
of Derby at Harefield, by some noble persons of her 
family, who appear on the scene in pastoral habit, 
moving toward the seat of state, with this Song," 
(the opening song). Fleay, in his "Chronicle of the 
English Drama," says that " Arcades " was acted 
not long after "Comus." The "noble persons of her 
family " were probably young Lord Chandos and 
his brother, then living with their grandmother 
at Harefield, and some of the Egertons, Viscount 
Brackley, Mr. Thomas Egerton, and the Ladies 
Alice and Mary Egerton. 

In passing, it is interesting to note that Viscount 
Brackley, the " learned " Earl of Bridgewater, who 
" delighted much in his library," was so scandalized 
by Milton's " Defensio Pro Populo " that he wrote 
in his copy, "Liber igne, auctorfurcd, dignissimi" 

Of the two young Egerton ladies who probably 
sang the songs of "Arcades," Lady Alice Egerton 
became the second wife of Richard Vaughan, Earl 
of Carberry. To her Jeremy Taylor dedicated part 
of his " Life of Christ." Her husband, the Earl of 
Carberry, appointed Samuel Butler, author of 
"Hudibras," to the stewardship of Ludlow Castle. 

Richard Baxter, author of "The Saints' Ever- 
lasting Rest," was a native of Shropshire. In 
1631, when Baxter was a lad of sixteen, he became 
attendant to Mr. Thomas Wickstead, Chaplain to the 
Council of Wales, and lived for a year and a half 
in Ludlow Castle. Lady Mary Egerton married 
Richard Herbert, second Lord Herbert of Cherbury 
(1600[?]-1655), who was the son of Edward Her- 
bert, first Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1583-1648), 
poet and philosopher. 

In 1653 Henry Lawes dedicated to these two 
granddaughters of the Countess of Derby his " Ayres 
and Dialogues for One, Two, or Three Voyces," 
saying they "excelled most ladies, especially in 
vocal music." 

Curiously enough, the Countess of Derby's estate 
of Harefield Manor is indissolubly connected with 
English literature through the Newdigate Prize for 
poetry at Oxford University. Harefield had been 
in possession of the Newdigate family or their 
forebears from time immemorial, when, in 1585, 
John Newdigate exchanged the manor for that of 
Arbury, Warwick, with Sir Edmund Anderson, 
Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. In 1 601 
Sir Edmund Anderson conveyed Harefield Manor 
to Sir Thomas Egerton, to his wife Alice, Countess 
of Derby, and to her daughters after her. On the 
death of Lord Keeper Egerton's widow, the Countess 
of Derby, in 1636, the manor was inherited by Lady 
Anne Chandos, then her only surviving daughter ; 
after her death, in 1647, it descended to her son, 
Lord Chandos. At his death, in 1655, he left it 
to his wife, Jane, Lady Chandos, who married as 
her second husband Sir William Sedley, Bart. ; and 
again, after his death, George Pitt, Esq., of Strath- 
fieldsaye, in Hampshire. About 1660 the mansion

was burned down, by the carelessness, it is said, of 
Sir Charles Sedley, wit and dramatist, who was on 
a visit to Harefield at the time, and who was indulg- 
ing in the dangerous pastime of reading in bed. 

By a deed dated 1673, Lady Jane Chandos 
vested all her estates in Mr. Pitt and his heirs ; 
and in 1675, she being still alive, Mr. Pitt sold 
Harefield Manor to Sir Richard Newdigate, Baronet, 
of Arbury, Warwick. This sale conveyed the manor 
back to its original owners. The Newdigates still 
own both Harefield and Arbury. 

Sir Roger Newdigate (1719-1806), was fifth 
Baronet of Harefield, Middlesex, and Arbury, War- 
wick. He was a member of University College, and 
M.P. for Oxford from 1750 to 1780, when he re- 
tired from public life. He never lost his interest 
in classical art, and in the last year of his life he 
gave Oxford two thousand pounds to remove the 
Arundel Collection into the Radcliffe Library, a plan 
which was carried out by Flaxman. Archdeacon 
Churton described Sir Roger Newdigate as " an intel- 
ligent and polished gentleman of the old school." 
He married twice : first, Sophia Conyers, and second, 
Hester Mundy ; but had no children. A housekeeper 
in his family at Arbury Manor was related to Mary 
Ann Evans, who, as George Eliot, located "Mr. 
Gilfil's Love Story" at Arbury Manor and made 
Sir Roger and Lady Newdigate the originals of Sir 
Christopher and Lady Cheverel. 

In 1805 Sir Roger Newdigate left a thousand 
pounds by will to Oxford University to establish an 
annual prize for poetry, the poem to be "of fifty 
lines and no more, in recommendation of the study 
of the ancient Greek and Roman remains of archi- 
tecture, sculpture, and painting." The restriction 
of the subject to classical art, and of the length to 
fifty lines, did not last many years. The prize 
poems are now about three hundred lines long, and 
the subjects show a wide range of interest. 

The Newdigate Prize has been awarded more 
than a hundred times, and many of the prizemen 
have achieved distinction in English letters. The 
first prize, in 1806, was won by John Wilson, 
"Christopher North," for a poem on "The Study 
of Greek and Roman Architecture." Another early 
Newdigate was Henry Hart Milman, Dean of St. 
Paul's, the historian of Latin Christianity, whose 
subject, in 1812, was the " Apollo Belvidere." 
Thomas Legh Cloughton, long Bishop of St. Albans, 
read his poem, " Voyages of Discovery to the Polar 
Regions," before Sir John Franklin, when the nav- 
igator received the degree of D.C.L. from Oxford, 
in 1829. 

In 1834 the prizeman was Joseph Arnould, later 
Judge of Bombay, who recited " The Hospice of St. 
Bernard " in the presence of the Duke of Wellington, 
then being installed as Chancellor of the University. 
Four lines of this poem are: 

'' When on that field where last the eagle soar'd, 
War's mightier master wielded Britain's sword, 
And the dark soul, a world could scarce subdue, 
Bent to thy genius Chief of Waterloo." 



John Richard Croker says these verses alluding to 
the Chief of Waterloo "made the whole assembly 
start up," "and some people appeared to me to go 
out of their senses literally to go mad." 

Dean Stanley was the Newdigate in 1837, and 
offered a poem entitled "The Gypsies." In 1839 
John Ruskin, prizeman, read "Salsette and Ele- 
phanta" before William Wordsworth, who was made 
an Oxford D.C.L. at that time. The prizeman of 
1842, with a poem on "Charles XII.," was John 
Campbell Shairp, whose haunting lyric "The Bush 
aboon Traquair" carries on the great tradition of 
Scottish ballad and song. Principal Shairp was 
born to poetry, poeta nascitur ; for, with Walter 
Scott, he was a lineal descendant of Mary Scott, 
"the Flower of Yarrow," whose romantic wooing he 
mentions in the poem "Three Friends in Yarrow." 
Matthew Arnold took the Newdigate in 1843, for 
his "Cromwell," and just ten years later (1853) 
Sir Edwin Arnold's "Feasc of Belshazzar" won the 
prize. John Addington Symonds's "Escorial" was 
the Newdigate of 1860. Nor have all the Newdigates 
been men. Rev. W. Tuckwell, in his " Reminiscences 
of Oxford," relates how the Newdigate was once car- 
ried off by a woman. She was Miss Rachel Burton, 
nicknamed "Jack," daughter of a Canon of Christ- 
church. Although she lived long before the foundation 
of women's colleges at Oxford, "Jack's" poem, sent in 
just for fun, to see what would happen, was awarded 
the prize, until the judges discovered her sex! 

Two of the Newdigates have filled the chair of 
poetry at Oxford Matthew Arnold and John 
Campbell Shairp. 

What Sir Roger Newdigate's prize for poetry has 
accomplished was summed up several years ago by 
Ogier Rysden in " A Century of Newdigates." Of 
ninety-nine prizemen, twenty-seven had won a place 
in the " Dictionary of National Biography "; among 
them there had been one ambassador, one Lord 
Chancellor (Roundell Palmer, Earl of Selborne), 
three bishops, three deans, one judge, one physician 
( Francis Hawkins, who wrote a poem on the " Pan- 
theon " and a well-known treatise on rheumatism), 
one artist, and one editor of " The Times." The 
Newdigates have naturally made their best success 
in literature, and have produced no less than 918 
volumes : 163 volumes of poetry, excluding the prize 
poems ; 158 collections of sermons ; 98 volumes of 
essays ; 74 works on divinity ; 48 volumes of lec- 
tures ; 28 biographies ; 55 editions of standard 
authors ; 28 works on political economy, 33 on law, 
21 novels, and 12 plays. This is a large and notable 
output, and makes it of peculiar interest to educa- 
tion in the United States that through the Rhodes 
Foundation the Newdigate Prize last year crossed 
the Atlantic Ocean. The prize of 1912 was won by 
William Chase Greene, of Balliol College, Rhodes 
scholar from Massachusetts, for a poem on " King 
Richard the First before Jerusalem." Mr. Greene 
was salutatorian and class odist at Harvard in 1911. 
He is a son of Professor Herbert E. Greene, of Johns 
Hopkins University. MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE PRESENT POPULARITY OF THE CLASSICS has 

lately been made the subject of some careful investi- 
gation. Certain public libraries have placed the 
great works of ancient and modern literature in a 
particularly exposed situation and watched the result. 
At Springfield, Mass., this plan produced a marked 
increase in an already considerable circulation of the 
classic authors. The monthly " Bulletin " of the 
library records in its February issue that " from the 
first the collection was a pronounced success. It 
seemed to attract all classes of readers. Young and 
old, rich and poor, men and women, could be seen 
standing in front of the case and examining the vol- 
umes. In a month so many of the books were in 
circulation that it was found necessary to replenish 
the supply." This experiment was made in the 
summer, the library's dull season, but when autumn 
came and the books were returned to their places, 
only two, Trevelyan's " Macaulay " and Leigh 
Hunt's " Essays " had found no readers. Of those 
drawn, the " Odyssey " went out eight times, the 
" Divine Comedy " seven, Epictetus six, Rousseau's 
" Emile " six, the " Rubaiyat " six, Moliere's plays 
six, Plato's "Republic " four, Goethe's " Faust " four, 
Malory's "Morte d'Arthur" four, More's "Utopia" 
six, Pliny's letters three, "Sartor Resartus " eight, 
Amiel's " Journal " six, and the leading English 
essayists, excepting Leigh Hunt, were in frequent 
demand. Moreover, it was found by a study of 
charging slips that a very creditable all-the-year- 
round circulation was enjoyed by the principal 
classics, " Faust " being drawn twenty-six times in 
the twelve months from May, 1911, to May, 1912, 
the " Odyssey " twenty-two times, Plutarch's " Lives " 
twenty-one, the " Divine Comedy " twenty, and other 
works in a diminishing scale, down to Aristotle's 
" Ethics," which went out twice. Furthermore, it 
should be remembered that many well-regulated 
families have their own sets of the great authors 
and resort to the library only for current fiction or 
other books of the day ; so that probably not even 
the foregoing very encouraging record is at all ade- 
quate as an indication of the extent to which the 
Springfield people read the classics. In general, it 
seems to be found that wherever the public is given 
a fair chance to choose its reading, the best books 
of all time are the ones to be most constantly drawn, 
year in and year out. It is safe to say that even in 
Newark, N. J., this will be found to be the case, in 
spite of the Newark librarian's recent intimation of 
a doubt in the matter. 

A QUESTION OF USAGE, long open to debate, and 
destined no doubt long to continue so, is again in- 
viting discussion. In a recent newspaper commu- 
nication Mr. John D. Long ventured to say a good 
word for the split infinitive as an old and legitimate 
locution, thereby showing an attitude toward it quite 
different from that of the woman who, on being 



asked whether her husband ever did any work about 
the house, replied with a significant shrug of the 
shoulders : " Oh, yes, he splits a few infinitives every 
day." In that entertaining manual entitled "The 
King's English " occurs the following : " The ' split ' 
infinitive has taken such hold upon the consciences 
of journalists that, instead of warning the novice 
against splitting his infinitives, we must warn him 
against the curious superstition that the splitting or 
not splitting makes the difference between a good 
and a bad writer. . . . Even that mysterious quality, 
'distinction' of style, may in modest measure be 
attained by a splitter of infinitives." The same au- 
thority calls the split infinitive " one among several 
hundred ugly things," and cautions the novice 
against allowing it to occupy his mind exclusively. 
In our language, which is in the main an uninflected 
language, the sign of the infinitive is a separate 
word, just as the sign of the future indicative is a 
separate word ; but why it should be necessary to 
keep the two parts in close contact in one case, and 
permissible to sunder them in the other, has never 
been satisfactorily explained. Ordinarily the modi- 
fying adverb seems to fall naturally and gracefully 
into place either before or after the full infinitive 
form; but occasionally, especially in poetry, good 
reasons for splitting present themselves. A sup- 
posed instance of a permissible split is sometimes 
cited in such sentences as, " He wished to more than 
square the account," which, however, contains an 
ellipsis rather than a split infinitive. In full the 
sentence would be, "He wished to do more than 
square the account," the second, infinitive having its 
"to" understood. To split or not to split, that is 
the question frequently confronting a writer, and 
ordinarily to be answered in the negative if only 
to avoid needless offense to a critical reader's taste. 
It would be interesting to know how the Bible and 
Shakespeare stand in this matter. Have they any 
split infinitives? If the research necessary for an 
authoritative answer has never been made, here is 
a tidy bit of work cut out for someone in quest of 
a subject for a Ph.D. thesis. 



THE SANITY OF GENIUS is vigorously asserted by 
Dr. Arthur C. Jacobson in " The Medical Record." 
He admits the liability to disorder which goes with 
the delicate organization and high-strung nervous 
system of the man of genius. In his own words, 
" genius makes for insanity, but neither insanity nor 
the insane temperament makes for genius. The 
genius is usually, if not always, of insane tempera- 
ment, but his best creative work reflects the man at 
his best, that is to say, sanest. To the degree that 
clinical insanity enters in, to that degree is his work 
vitiated. Insanity is the Nemesis of the delicately 
balanced genius, never his good angel. He does his 
work not because of, but in spite of, the Damoclean 
sword." Dr. Jacobson asks why " a great literature 
is not emanating from the asylums of the land if it 
be true that the relation of genius and insanity is so 



THE DIAL 



close "; and the question is pertinent, despite the 
logical fallacy it implies. Not " all insane men are 
men of genius," but "all men of genius are insane" 
is the assertion he is refuting. However, let us hear 
his answer to his own question. " The answer is 
that the great genius must be eminently sane. He 
must possess in the highest possible degree the crit- 
ical faculty directed toward his own literary pro- 
ductions. No great literary work can possibly be 
produced if this endowment be lacking." But it is 
exactly this perfect marriage of the creative and the 
critical faculties that is seldom found in literature ; 
the one tends to stifle the other, though, as the single 
instance of Goethe would sufficiently prove, it does 
not always succeed. Dr. Jacobson scores a point 
when he declares that "the mind that produced 
Hamlet was super-sane." Great poets and painters 
and musicians, and other men of genius, are such, 
according to this student of the problem, not because 
of but in spite of their liability to psychopathological 
states unknown to common mortals. 

... \ 

OUK DAILY DEBT TO SHAKESPEAKE, as shown by 

the large number of colloquial phrases with which 
he has supplied us, is one that we bear lightly 
enough because we seldom pause to consider its 
magnitude. Mr. Frank J. Wilstach, in the interest 
of Mr. Sothern and Miss Marlowe in their Shake- 
speare repertory, calls attention to a considerable 
number of these everyday Shakespearean words and 
phrases which are commonly used without a thought 
of their origin. His list, which we have not veri- 
fied, includes the following : Bag and baggage, dead 
as a door nail, proud of one's humility, hit or miss, 
love is blind, selling for a song, wide world, cut 
capers, fast and loose, unconsidered trifles, westward 
ho, familiarity breeds contempt, patching up excuses, 
misery makes strange bedfellows, to boot, short and 
long of it, dancing attendance, getting even (in re- 
venge), birds of a feather, that's flat, rag- tag, Greek 
to me, send one packing, as the day is long, packing 
a jury, mother wit, kill with kindness, rnum, ill wind 
that blows no good, wild-goose chase, scarecrow, 
luggage, row of pins, give and take, sold, your cake 
is dough. To almost any reader of this list there 
will at once occur numerous expressions that claim 
a place beside those enumerated, as, for instance, 
" to the manner born," " more honored in the breach 
than the observance," "a sea of troubles," "that 
way madness lies," " the hazard of the die," and so 
on without end. Perhaps it would be shorter to tell 
what our daily speech does not owe to Shakespeare 
than what it does. 



A LITERARY DUMPING-GROUND is made of many 
a long-suffering library by some of its would-be 
benefactors who use it as a convenient depository 
for such printed rubbish as they know not how 
otherwise to dispose of. A well-intentioned lady of 
our acquaintance long had the habit of visiting the 
local library about once a month with a bulky parcel 
of odds and ends in pamphlet or leaflet form, rarely 



or never in book form, which she deposited on the 
delivery desk with the air of a munificent benefac- 
tor, and then departed. Luckily she never made 
inquiry as to the ultimate destination of her gifts, 
never ransacked the card-catalogue to make sure that 
every item had been properly entered and classified, 
and never seemed to expect a formal expression of 
thanks for her heterogeneous contributions. Un- 
doubtedly she assumed that in an institution dedi- 
cated to the preservation and circulation of literature 
her offerings had been welcomed with joy by the 
head librarian, the cataloguer, the classifier, the ref- 
erence librarian, the children's librarian, the direc- 
tor of the circulating department, and all others whose 
chief delight it must be to watch the growth of the 
collection in their joint charge. At any rate it costs 
nothing, she may have thought, for a library to ex- 
tend its hospitality, and its shelf-room, to any waifs 
and strays of print that chance to knock at its doors. 
But it does cost something, as Miss Corinne Bacon 
took occasion to point out last summer at Asbury 
Park, in an address now printed in "Public Libra- 
ries." Cataloguing costs, she continued, and dusting 
costs, and shelf-room costs. In a word, as she aptly 
expressed it, a live library is not a storage reservoir. 
Beware, then, of indiscriminate gifts ! Be on guard 
against the person who seems disposed to make of 
your public library a public dumping-ground.

A LACK IN ENGLISH LITERARY CRITICISM is de- 
tected by Mr. J. E. C. Bodley, a well-known writer 
on France and things French, in its reticence con- 
cerning the identity of the critic. They order this 
matter better in France, he thinks, where the signed 
review is the rule, as contrasted with the unsigned 
review common in England and America. Feeling 
no personal responsibility and pride, the English 
and the American reviewer, if Mr. Bodley is in the 
right, do not put forth their best efforts, and we have 
not, as they have in France, a " school of criticism " 
or any literary critic comparable with the famous 
author of those " Causeries " which once made the 
second day of the week eventful to the reading world 
across the Channel. To himself, then, according to 
Mr. Bodley, the critic owes it to let his light shine 
undimmed by any modest anonymity. Still more, 
however, does he owe it to the author whom he criti- 
cizes, and to the interests of careful scholarship, to 
come out from behind the shelter of anonymity. In 
creations of the imagination and in the play of fancy 
let the writer keep his authorship as secret as he 
chooses ; but not to put one's name to a " hurticle," 
as Thackeray called it, may often savor of unfair- 
ness or cowardly spite or other unlovely quality. 



LITERATURE AS A LIVING ART formed a part of 
the subject chosen by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch for 
his opening lecture as King Edward VII. Professor 
of English Literature at Cambridge. He uttered a 
caution " against despising any form of art which is 
alive and pliant in the hands of man. As for my 
part," he continued, "I believe, bearing in mind Mr.

Barrie's ' Peter Pan ' and the old bottles he renovated 
to hold that joyous wine, that even musical comedy, 
in the hands of a master, might become a thing of 
beauty. Of the novel, at any rate, whether we like 
it or not, we have to admit that it does hold a com- 
manding position in the literature of our times, and 
to consider how far Mr. Lascelles Abercrombie was 
right the other day when he claimed on the first 
page of his brilliant study of Thomas Hardy that 
the right to such a position is not to be disputed; 
for here, as elsewhere, the right to such a position 
is no more than the power to maintain it. You may 
agree with this or you may not, you may or may not 
deplore the forms that literature is choosing; but 
there is no gainsaying that it is still very much alive. 
And I would say to you, ' Believe and be glad that 
literature is an art, and English a living tongue.' " 

LIBERAL LIBRARY RULES are better than harshly 
restrictive ones, and once in a while no rules at all 
seem better than even the most liberal ones. The 
Trinity Parish Library in Boston is an instance of 
a library that does good work with an irreducible 
minimum of red tape. It is in the parish house in 
Clarendon Street, and numbers about five thousand 
volumes, the nucleus of the collection being the 
generous gift of books bestowed by Phillips Brooks 
from his own fine library when he was rector of 
Trinity thirty years ago. These well-selected vol- 
umes and others added later comprise one of the 
best collections of books in the departments of relig- 
ion, biography, travel, essays, and social problems. 
Any person of respectable appearance may enter the 
library and borrow for home use any book desired, 
with no questions asked as to the borrower's ante- 
cedents, with no requirement of references or of 
guaranty for the return of the book. Last year the 
circulation numbered about three thousand volumes, 
and the borrowers included the policeman of the 
neighborhood and learned doctors of divinity from 
far and near. Miss Snelling, the librarian, says that 
she has never known the privileges of the library to 
be abused, though hundreds of those who enjoy those 
privileges are utter strangers to her. 

LINCOLN'S LIKING FOR APT QUOTATIONS, especially 
from the poets, was such as might have been ex- 
pected in one who displayed no mean ability in the 
framing of phrases and sentences so aptly expressive 
as to become themselves household words after his 
death. Mr. John Langdon Kaine's Lincoln reminis- 
cences in the February "Century" contain mention 
of Lincoln's appreciation of that true wit which, 
according to Pope, " is Nature to advantage dressed, 
what oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed." 
"He insisted," writes Mr. Kaine in recalling a boy- 
hood interview with the President when the latter 
chanced to be in an especially talkative mood, "on 
the importance of learning, in early life, sentiments 
expressed in verse. In effect he said that as a man 
grows older, lines which he learned because of their 



pleasant sound come to have a meaning; just as old 
saws show their truth in later life. ' It is a pleasure/ 
he said, ' to be able to quote lines to fit any occasion/ 
and he noted that the Bible is the richest source of 
pertinent quotations." This recalls the remark made 
by George Eliot in one of her published letters and 
quoted the other day by Sir Arthur Quiller- Couch in 
his inaugural lecture as King Edward VII. Professor 
of English Literature at Cambridge. Speaking of 
Wordsworth's poetry the author of " Theophrastu* 
Such" said: "I never before met with so many of 
my own feelings expressed just as I should like 
them." . . . 

THE GROWTH OF THE PERIODICAL PRESS seems ta 
keep pace with the growth of the world's population. 
In the United States and Canada, for example, there 
was in 1912 a birth-rate of newspapers and periodi- 
cals amounting to more than five each week day; 
that is, 1686 new publications started into being. 
But the death-rate was so nearly equal to the birth- 
rate that the net increase for the year was only 
thirty-six, about equally divided between this coun- 
try and our northern neighbor, and chiefly confined 
to the field of daily journalism. So largely are we 
Americans a nation of readers that the printing 
and publishing industry is exceeded, in number of 
employees and value of product, by only four other 
industries or so the statisticians assure us. In the 
last ten years the value of the annual output of printed 
matter in America has increased by more than eighty- 
six per cent. Nearly every trade and industry has 
its one or more periodicals, and the whole mass of 
periodical publications is divided into 208 classes, 
with the weekly issues of all sorts in a large majority* 
A study of the "American Newspaper Annual and 
Directory" impresses one with the magnitude of 
the industry that supplies to thousands of energetie 
Americans practically all the reading matter they 
ever avail themselves of. 



THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW LIBRARY BUILDING 

AT HARVARD was made February 12, when a spade- 
ful of earth was turned up by each member of a 
selected company assembled within the enclosure 
now erected around the site of the prospective struct- 
ure. In the absence of Mrs. George D. Widener r 
giver of the two million dollars that the Widener 
Memorial Library is expected to cost, her son, Mr. 
George D. Widener, Jr., was the first to handle the 
spade, which then passed successively to President 
Lowell, Dean Briggs, Professor Kittredge, Librarian- 
Lane, Assistant Librarian Potter, Mr. Horace Trum- 
bauer, architect. Professor Haskins, of the library 
committee, and the Hon. Robert Bacon, of the Har- 
vard corporation. And now that this spectacular 
spade-play is over, the real digging of the building's- 
foundations is in active progress, with hope on the 
part of the university authorities that the dedication 
of the long-desired library building may form a 
conspicuous part of next year's commencement 
exercises.

WISDOM AND UNWISDOM ABOUT WOMAN.* 

The world we live in is made up of men, 
women, and children. This fact, which works 
out for most of us into an infinite enrichment 
of actual life in interests, duties, and emotions, 
seems a source of wrath and stumbling to many 
of those who sit in their studies writing about 
the past and future of the race with especial 
reference to the part woman plays in the evolu- 
tionary process. It is curious to note how often 
the very writers who protest against sex-bias in 
the one direction will, themselves, display it 
conspicuously in the other. Obviously, if we 
are to treat at all of the sex-interest in the plot 
of the race drama, it should be done with all 
the temperance, detachment, dignity, and ability 
at our command ; obviously, also, few of these 
books will be epoch-making, since the influence 
of such intellectual performances upon evolution 
is slight. At their best these will interpret to 
some struggling human beings the tangles in 
which they find themselves, and furnish a clue 
by which they may follow to the real freedom 
found only in self-mastery; at their worst they 
will increase sex-antagonism and concentrate 
the attention of the individual upon personal 
grievances an attitude which promptly par- 
alyzes will and achievement and dries up the 
springs of character. 

The season's books on the woman-question 
offer very perfect examples of wise and foolish 
literature in their field. " The Advance of 
Woman " by Mrs. Jane Johnston Christie is 
almost a museum-specimen of partisanship. The 
author seems to believe with an absolute fury of 
conviction that Woman is innately, divinely, 
and unalterably a superior being who has been 
maliciously clubbed into silence, if not insensi- 
bility, by Man. Man is accordingly belabored 
with sweeping ferocity. The author argues from 
such facts of animal life as the female crusta- 
cean who " carries a little husband in each 
pocket," and such pre-historic and chiefly infer- 
ential conditions as the matriarchate, that the 
female is biologically the superior of the male ;

that she was originally endowed with the right 
of selection, indefatigable industry, and a paci- 
fic temperament ; that these endowments were 
enough to lead the race to its highest possible 
evolution, had the female continuously domi- 
nated it ; that, as domination was forcibly taken 
from her when, by the result of her own choice 
in selection, the male became the more power- 
ful physically, so the race has been evolving in 
the wrong direction ever since a mistake only 
to be rectified when Man gives over " the futile 
efforts he has made for thousands of years to 
fill a place he was not equipped for," and 
Nature's Elect, the Woman, is absolute ruler 
of the earth. It must be very comforting to 
hold with such fervor these gratifying convic- 
tions about one's sex, but surely the human 
predicament is not so simple as this. Man may 
not have done his utmost in climbing up the 
ages, but a programme which involves his prac- 
tical enslavement at the moment when woman 
is rejoicing in great new freedoms seems subtly 
lacking in logic as well as in humanity, and 
hardly commends itself to sane judgment. 

On the other side, " Woman Adrift : A State- 
ment of the Case against Suffragism," by Mr. 
Harold Owen, is admirably adapted to promote 
the movement it is designed to discourage. The 
present reviewer confesses to grave doubts about 
the immediate expediency of votes for women, 
at least in this country, where, though cer- 
tain industrial injustices remain, nevertheless 
women's grievances as a sex have been replaced 
by privileges which leave the American woman 
the freest creature on the earth to-day. If it 
takes three generations to make a gentleman, 
that complicated product a conscientious voter 
can hardly be created in less ; and while un- 
limited woman-suffrage is almost certainly at 
hand in the United States, it is almost equally 
certain that only a hundred years hence shall we 
know if it is for our real betterment. But Mr. 
Owen's arguments against an extension of the 
suffrage are so minute, masculine, uninspired, 
and British, that they are calculated to create a 
violent reaction in any mind, even that of a con- 
vinced, anti-suffragist! Excellent as are many 
of his beliefs, it must be said that Mr. Owen 
nags. He is also entirely incapable of refrain- 
ing from small flings and cheap gibes at feminine 
foibles which have nothing to do with the issue. 
He weakens his argument, where candor would 
have strengthened it, by refusing to admit 
frankly that women in Great Britain still have 
actual wrongs and disabilities which make their 
case quite different from that of women in 



1913] 



THE DIAJL

America. The book attempts to settle by the 
logic of the debating society a question which 
ought to be discussed in a more generous spirit. 
Mr. Owen does not ignore the fact that duality 
of function and race-betterment are the grounds 
upon which the matter should be decided, but 
he is too much preoccupied with more trivial 
arguments to give these their appropriate posi- 
tion. Now and again he has a flicker of insight, 
as where he intimates that if the female sex is to 
be born again, it must, nevertheless, " be re-born 
in its own image," or where he points out that 
political freedom is likely to be purchased by 
industrial servitude. But as a whole the book 
is too self-satisfied, not to say beefy, and its 
logic too mechanical, to produce an effect. The 
final argument in matters political, as in matters 
religious, is emotion, but this fundamental truth 
of human nature is seldom recognized by those 
who debate according to the rules. 

Whether you always agree with Ellen Key 
or not, her books are examples of close thinking 
and clear expression. As intellectual perform- 
ances, they have dignity and texture. "The 
Woman Movement," her latest work, is an acute 
study of the effect of the general emancipation 
of woman, so far as it has now progressed, upon 
the outer world; upon feminine psychology; 
upon the status of daughters, spinsters, and men 
and women at large; and, finally, upon mar- 
riage and motherhood. Ardent believer in the 
woman-movement as she is, she realizes that it 
has reached the stage where intelligent criticism 
should replace blind enthusiasm. She sees how 
many women have lost their heads and misplaced 
their hearts ; and, without abating a jot of her 
faith in the virtue and necessity of freedom, she 
points out, with a penetration never equalled by 
any opponent of feminine emancipation, the 
hundred pitfalls lying in wait for the modern 
woman. Perhaps the most startling of her ad- 
missions is that regarding the effect -of public 
life on the woman. The woman-movement of 
fifty years ago was based upon belief in the 
eternal stability of womanliness. It was pre- 
cisely that quality which was to benefit the world 
when it was given freedom of operation outside 
the home. Already it has been demonstrated, 
Ellen Key admits, that womanliness is subject to 
change by changed vocations and surroundings. 
She goes so far as to state explicitly that if 
women are to improve political conditions at all, 
it would be well to give them full civic rights 
quickly, before they have lost their intuitive 
and instinctive power through " masculiniza- 
tion." This is an admission that almost goes 



beyond the obstreperous Mr. Harold Owen, yet 
it comes from the lips of a friend. Equally 
acute is her analysis and denunciation of what 
she terms " the amaternal idea," as it is advanced 
by Mrs. Gilman and Rosa Mayreder. Regard- 
ing motherliness as the distinguishing character- 
istic of womanliness, and recognizing that from 
the point of view of the race the division of labor 
between the sexes must on the whole remain the 
same as that which has hitherto existed "if the 
higher development of mankind is to continue 
in uninterrupted advance to more perfect forms,'' 
she gives short shrift to those who maintain 
that equal rights for the sexes mean equal func- 
tions or who insist that woman can do her own 
work in the world and man's as well. Granting 
to these theorists all freedom to live their own 
lives according to their bent, she denounces the 
attempt "so to falsify life- values in their own 
favor" as to set the cerebral type above the 
maternal, or the office above the home, as offer- 
ing a more "human" variety of work. It is 
greatly to be desired that all ultra-feminist 
thinkers and speakers (the terms are not syn- 
onymous) should spend a few quiet hours over 
these significant pages. Carefully digested, they 
offer an antidote to the "unleavened bread" 
of much of the crude and superficial thought so 
undeservedly popular to-day. 

Most young women depend upon instinct for 
the solution of their problems, and in the main 
find it a safer guide than any printed word. 
But those who really desire, first, to think their 
way through the abstract problem of feminine 
destiny, and, second, to supplement that think- 
ing with the best practical advice about what to 
do under the circumstances, should read " The 
Woman Movement," and follow it up with 
" The Business of Being a Woman." Miss 
Tarbefl's little volume contains more available 
wisdom to the page than anything yet written 
on the subject in this country. Few latter-day 
authors recognize that, within the limits of 
decent existence, the breadth or narrowness of 
a life depend far more on the personal outlook 
than upon the external circumstances. Miss 
Tarbell recalls this forgotten truth, and lays 
needed emphasis upon the fact that " the highest 
civilization is that in which the largest number 
sense and are so placed as to realize the dignity 
and beauty of the common experiences and 
obligations." Her book is rational, broad- 
minded, and helpful ; it diffuses common-sense, 
but common- sense irradiated with the ideal. 
What happier combination can there be ?

GREEK LITERATURE AND THE DOOR 
OF TO-MORROW.* 



To-day there is a constant cry for the man, 
the thought, the word, that shall help us open 
the door of to-morrow. A few happy spirits, it 
is true, are content to feast their visions on the 
occasional glorious halting places in man's march 
across the plains and up the slopes of the ages, 
and, in their love for what has been, to be care- 
less of what is to be. For them, Greek litera- 
ture and sculpture and architecture will always 
offer deep joys complete within themselves, even 
as the canvases of Andrea del Sarto or the cathe- 
drals of nameless Gothic builders will abide as 
pleasures that scorn the test of practical service. 
But, on the whole, the literature and art of the 
past, not less than the science of the present, will 
survive and flourish only as they have a meaning 
before the problems of the future. Moreover, I 
believe that the deeper one has delved into the 
past, and particularly the past as represented by 
Greece and Rome, the keener will be his interest 
in the coming lot of his fellow-men: 
" Guests of the ages, at To-morrow's door 
Why shrink we ? The long track behind us lies, 
The lamps gleam and the music throbs before, 
Bidding us enter: and I count him wise, 
Who loves so well Man's noble memories 
He needs must love Man's nobler hopes yet more." 

In any event, the ultimate unescapable trial 
must come before this tribunal, and to its bar 
Mr. Livingstone is willing to bring the Greek 
genius. 

" There are few more important problems than this 
is humanism right ? Is it right to take a purely human 
attitude towards life, to assume that man is the measure 
of all things, and to believe that, even though the unseen 
may be there, still we can know our duty and live our 
life without reference to it ? That is perhaps the biggest 
question of the present day, the one most worth settling, 
the one which every one has to settle for himself. 

" If our minds are made up and we are humanists, 
then we are not likely to find better models than the 
Greeks. Of unaided human nature it is not too much 
to say that they made the best that can be made ; in 
regard to the chief things of life, modern humanists are 
not likely to come to conclusions different from or better 
than those of a people whose acuteness of insight amounts 
almost to inspiration ; and they can hardly find better or 
wiser teachers than its great men. 

" But if we approach the subjects as inquirers, anxious 
to learn to what humanism leads and whether it will 
work, still we must turn to Athens. There alone the 
experiment of humanism has been tried ; the only evi- 
dence about it we can get is the evidence from Greek 
society. There we can see how it succeeds; whether it 
tends to strength, to racial survival; whether it leads to 
justice, righteousness, mercy, true happiness; or whether 
the sins, whose long catalogue closes the first chapter of 

*THE GREEK GENIUS AND ITS MEANING TO Us. By 
R. W. Livingstone. Oxford : The Clarendon Press. 



St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, are the logical and 
finally inevitable issue of life for those peoples who wor- 
ship and serve the creature more than the Creator." 

This is the central and significant feature of 
our Oxford Hellenist's contribution ; and he 
discusses only the essential elements of the 
Greek genius that he believes to have a mean- 
ing for us to-day. There are scores of able books 
and suggestive papers on the value of things 
Greek in the world of thought : the general 
theme, like some great jewel, has so many angles 
that it is impossible for any one worker to gather 
up all the various rays that emanate therefrom. 
The late Professor Adam, for instance, wrote 
enthusiastically and convincingly on " The Vi- 
tality of Platonism"; Mr. Livingstone practi- 
cally sweeps Plato aside, on the ground that he 
is exceptional rather than characteristic. Pro- 
fessor Mahaffy in his felicitous Lowell lectures,, 
published under the title, "What Have the 
Greeks Done for Modern Civilization?" devotes 
several chapters to science, mathematics, poli- 
tics, medicine, and so forth ; Mr. Livingstone 
deliberately discards them all. There are hun- 
dreds of laudatory volumes on Greek sculpture 
and architecture ; Mr. Livingstone treats only 
of literature. A few years ago Professor Kelsey 
of Michigan collected a rather remarkable series 
of papers on the value of Latin and Greek in 
formal education, including Professor Shorey's 
comprehensive brief, " The Case for the Clas- 
sics"; Mr. Livingstone avoids even touching 
upon the question of Greek in the schools. 
These few examples, chosen from so many that 
present themselves, may emphasize not only our 
author's particular service, but also the diver- 
sity and inexhaustibility of this Grecian treas- 
ure. Naturally, Mr. Livingstone cannot exclude 
the rays from other angles ; but he does adhere 
admirably to his plan of presenting what he 
considers the fundamental contributions of 
Hellenism : the Greeks' sense of beauty, their 
Freedom, their Directness, their Humanism^ 
their Manysidedness, and their Sanity. 

But even after the angles are chosen, there 
is need for much defining and limiting, both 
geographical and chronological. What about 
Sparta, with its extreme example of rugged and 
ascetic militarism ? What about Lucian, who 
reads like a nineteenth century essayist ? Or 
Theocritus, the fountain head of idyllic poetry ? 
However, these difficulties do not escape Mr. 
Livingstone, and he comes out with a trenchant 
decision : 

" Firstly: by the Greek genius we shall mean a spirit 
which manifested itself in certain peoples inhabiting 
lands washed by the .Egean sea: it appears to have 



1913] 



THE DIAL, 



177 



been only partly determined by race: Athens was its 
heart, and little or nothing of it is to be seen at Sparta : 
but Pindar possessed it though he was a Theban, Aris- 
totle though he came from Stagira, Thales though he 
was born and lived in Asia, and Homer though his birth- 
place is not known. Perhaps this definition evades the 
difficulty: but it seems to suit the facts. 

" Secondly : in defining this spirit we shall keep our 
eyes fixed on what is admitted to have been its most 
brilliant season of flower, the years between 600 and 
400 B. c. ; without forgetting that a hundred years 
passed before the most influential philosophies of 
Greece came to birth and its far-reaching permeation 
of the world began." 

Keeping our author's plan in mind, we may 
turn to the interesting chapter on " The Note 
of Directness." After recalling Ruskin's in- 
cisive treatment of " The Pathetic Fallacy " 
and " Classical Landscape," Mr. Livingstone 
compares Mrs. Browning's sentimental and 
moving lines on the fate of a sea-gull carried 
into inland captivity with Alcman's brief lim- 
ning of the bird " that flies over the blossom of 
the swell with the halcyons, careless of heart, 
the sea-purple bird of spring." He concedes 
the grace and daintiness of his countrywoman's 
poem, but declares that Alcman gives the more 
accurate picture, as well as a more sympathetic 
rendering of the bird's charm. Passing from 
this directness in the Greek's view of nature, he 
voices his conviction that it was simply one 
aspect of a general trend of thought and man- 
ner of looking at life. " It guided the eyes of 
the Greeks and drew their attention to certain 
aspects of things. It afforded a focus, within 
which they saw everything in strong relief, out- 
side which they saw only darkness and confu- 
sion. It determined their whole idea of the 
world. For everywhere they took things at 
their obvious value, and saw them, so to speak, 
naked." Then he turns to their attitude toward 
such fundamental questions as love, friendship, 
and death. Proceeding always by illustration 
and comparison, he emphasizes his point, find- 
ing throughout his search a simplicity and a 
directness that are at times almost naive, but 
are none the less unflinching and heart-searching 
in their straightforwardness. The Greeks never 
substituted color for light. " They were content, 
in the presence of life, if they could use and 
enjoy it rightly, and in the presence of death, 
if they could know it for what it was." 

The foregoing must serve as an example of 
our author's treatment of his "Notes of Hellen- 
ism''; but one chapter on exceptions is quite as 
interesting as those that represent the rule. 
Believing with Rohde that Platonic thought 
and philosophy were an alien phenomenon in 



Greece, he treats the gfeat master as an example 
of the unhellehic spirit. To be sure, he admits 
that in a thousand ways Plato was a Greek of 
the Greeks, nor has he missed the charm and 
tremendous importance of the master; but he 
feels that the great idealist belongs essentially to 
those who "taught us to look past the 'unim- 
aginary and actual' qualities of things to sec- 
ondary meanings and an inner symbolism. In 
opposition to liberty and humanism they taught 
us to mistrust our nature, to see in it weakness, 
helplessness, an incurable taint, to pass beyond 
humanity to communion with God, to live less 
for this world than for one to come." In this 
connection he deals very briefly with Orphism 
and "similar gospels of other worldliness " in 
Greece, and iterates his conclusion that the ex- 
ceptions to rationalistic humanism are but few. 
Now from Mr. Livingstone's deliberately limited 
point of view, I think he is right ; but we must 
emphasize two points. Firstly : Orphism had an 
influence on Christianity that even yet is very 
hard to estimate. In the paintings of the Cata- 
combs, for instance, it is clear that the Thracian 
singer, whether he ever existed or not, was re- 
garded as prefiguring the Christ, while the echoes 
from Orphism in the New Testament are fre- 
quent and important. Secondly: many great 
thinkers in every century since the birth of 
Christianity, and in every occidental country, 
have seen in Plato an undying light upon the 
eternal hills ; and tributes to his abiding great- 
ness have been poured forth in abundance by 
the apologists of Christianity from Clement, who 
declared that Plato wrote by the inspiration of 
God, to Bishop Westcott, who states admiringly 
that he points to St. John. Greek philosophy 
and Greek religion between them managed to 
influence the thought and morals of the Roman 
Empire and of all succeeding generations. In 
fact, many scholars are declaring to-day that 
Greek teaching about immortality and ethics 
and kindred themes will constitute their most 
valuable and abiding contribution to civilization. 
At any rate, Mr. Livingtone's attitude and his 
confidence in the inherent strength of his case 
are indicated by his willingness to throw away 
the powerful arguments for a knowledge of 
Greek life and literature that can be based on 
the greatness of Plato and the significance of the 
Grecian religions of mysticism. 

But then our author is not trying to convert 
anybody. And here lies much of his charm. 
He admits frankly that he is interested in Greek 
strength and beauty, not in Greek ugliness and 
weakness ; yet he does not deny that the ugliness 



178

and weakness were real and ominous. He is 
always willing to concede everything to the other 
side, sometimes more than is necessary. Such 
a spirit is not less confidence-inspiring than de- 
lightful ; and to the profane who are not of the 
grosser sort the volume will offer a much more 
winning argument for Greek studies than would 
a more definitely propagandist effort. To stu- 
dents and teachers of the Classics, as also "to 
the considerable public who take a humane in- 
terest in what Greece has done for the world," 
it will be a source of genuine pleasure. The 
present reviewer read it the first time with enjoy- 
ment, a second time with unfeigned delight. 

The book has its defects. It skips from 
" Shelley's passionate idealism" to Bruneti&re's 
Sur les Chemins de la Croyance with a glad- 
some agility that recalls the famous measurings 
in the " Thinkshop " of " The Clouds." It writes 
about Winckelmann in words that will not be 
clear to readers unfamiliar with his life, and may 
be misleading. It picks examples that are open 
to controversy. To me, at least, Pindar seems 
a most unfortunate choice as a type of Greek 
humanism. It is extravagantly severe on poor 
Helen. It is unnecessarily uppish about such 
amiable souls as Theocritus and Stevenson and 
Lamb. It jars with a phrase like this: "A 
world where the state was first and the individ- 
ual nowhere," which is an obvious adaptation 
of the famous words of Captain O'Kelley about 
the performance of "Eclipse" at Epsom. It 
even includes the following beautiful sentence 
in a chapter that is lauding Greek truthfulness 
and freedom from artificiality : " We seem in 
their literature to watch the immediate image 
of life, unrefracted by any disturbing medium, 
just as to-day, off their coasts, the traveller some- 
times sails over a sunken sarcophagus, and far 
below him can see the carven figures on it, clear 
and undistorted through the pellucid waters." 
It does a hundred things, and remains intel- 
lectually profitable and stimulating, delightfully 
written, and generously rich throughout. 

Furthermore, I think, it does render fine and 
genuine service in the connection I have tried 
to suggest by the title and the opening para- 
graph of this review. The day of supernatural- 
ism may never pass for all mankind ; but the 
number of men and women who can no longer 
see by its light and live by its breath is increas- 
ing with startling rapidity. They seek their 
revelation in human nature, their guidance in 
reason and the experience of the race. And 
Mr. Livingstone points out that the Greeks are 
the only people who have conceived the problem 



similarly, that their answer is the only one which 
has yet been made. So we are turning back to 
Greece, and beginning to understand what the 
Greeks said and meant. We are ascertaining 
their views, and in some cases accepting them. 
Our author does not explicitly advocate any 
form of what writers have been calling neo- 
paganism ; yet his work may easily incur such 
a charge. Now, on the general question many 
readers will agree with Mr. Chesterton's pithy 
conclusion : " But if we do revive and pursue 
the pagan ideal of a simple and rational self- 
completion we shall end where Paganism 
ended. I do not mean that we shall end in de- 
struction. I mean that we shall end in Christian- 
ity." But writers like Mr. Livingstone and Mr. 
G. Lowes Dickinson (in "The Greek View of 
Life ") are not attempting to revive Paganism, 
or Hellenism, or anything else. They are only 
insisting, and insisting rightly, that the Greeks 
faced many of our problems and have much to 
tell our own generation as it stands before the 
door of to-morrow. FRED B. R. HELLEMS. 



THE COMEDY AND TRAGEDY OF AN 
ACTOR'S LIFE.* 

The intimate and sometimes amusingly frank 
self-revelations of Macready's private diaries, 
now for the first time publicly printed with 
scarcely any reservations or omissions, give them 
that character of warm human interest and un- 
mistakable naturalness that cannot but go far 
toward reconciling the reader to the somewhat 
formidable size of the two volumes in which these 
diaries, between the years 1833 and 1851, are 
presented by their editor, Mr. William Toynbee. 
It is thirty-eight years since Sir Frederick 
Pollock, one of Macready's executors, gave to 
the world the actor's "Reminiscences and Se- 
lections from his Diaries and Letters," and the 
reasons that then made advisable a careful cen- 
sorship of the wealth of material at the editor's 
disposal have now lost their force. The eighteen 
years covered by the present work are the most 
interesting and eventful of Macready's life, the 
period of his highest success in his calling ; 
and they are also interesting and eventful years 
in the political, social, and literary history of 
England. Earlier and later passages from the 
actor's diaries are found in Pollock's book ; but 
before 1833 the entries are brief and compara- 
tively unimportant, and after 1851 they exhibit

Macready in his retirement and busied chiefly 
with family affairs. The "Reminiscences," 
covering the period from infancy to the age of 
thirty-three, and the later letters that are pub- 
lished with them, will serve as supplement to 
Mr. Toynbee's work, and the two books together 
present in sufficient completeness the famous 
actor's four-score years (1793-1873). With 
the addition of Mr. William Archer's succinct 
and scholarly account of the man and his work, 
in the " Eminent Actors " series, the whole story 
of William Charles Macready's public and pri- 
vate life would seem to have been told for all 
time. 

A few passages from his full and intimate 
daily notes will depict the Irish actor's char- 
acter better than any description from another 
person. Piety and passion, outbursts of anger 
and seasons of repentance, pride and humility, 
the fine enthusiasm of one devoted wholly to 
his art, and presently the dull prosiness of the 
introspective moralist these and other contra- 
dictory qualities are to be found in the gifted 
actor's portrait of himself. Though his grand- 
father was a Dublin upholsterer and his father 
an actor and afterward an unsuccessful theatre- 
manager, young Macready was sent to Rugby 
and was expecting to study for the bar when 
his father's misfortunes compelled him to take 
the shortest road to the succor of the distressed 
family. Thus it came about that, as Mr. 
Toynbee tells us, 

" With the University and a learned profession in pros- 
pect, he was suddenly transported into the squalid 
atmosphere of a bankrupt provincial theatre which his 
father, hitherto prosperous, was precariously directing, 
shadowed by the sheriff's officer. To an aspiring and 
highly sensitive public-school boy such a transition must 
have been little less than torture. Worse, however, was 
to follow, for after a few months' hopeless struggle, the 
unfortunate manager disappeared behind the walls of 
Lancaster gaol, leaving his son to face the situation 
alone, a truly appalling plight for a lad of sixteen, with 
practically no experience and not a shilling in the 
treasury." 

But he grappled with the difficulty in manly 
fashion, took command of the stranded com- 
pany, and contrived to hold it together until his 
father regained his freedom and was able to re- 
sume control. On the seventh of June, 1810, 
the son made his first appearance on the stage, 
in the part of Romeo, in which he " cut a gal- 
lant and picturesque figure," and found himself 
fairly launched on his course of forty years' 
uninterrupted success as a favorite entertainer 
of the theatre-going public. But it was a well- 
earned success. On the very first page of the 
present edition of the diaries we find an indica- 



tion of the unremitting care he bestowed on the 
study of his parts. Under date of January 2, 
1833, he writes: 

" My performance this evening of Macbeth afforded 
me a striking evidence of the necessity there is for 
thinking over my characters previous to playing, and 
establishing, by practice if necessary, the particular 
modes of each scene and important passage. 1 acted 
with much energy, but could not (as I sometimes can, 
when holding the audience in wrapt attention) listen 
to my own voice, and feel the truth of its tones. It was 
crude, and uncertain, though spirited and earnest; but 
much thought is yet required to give an even energy 
and finished style to all the great scenes of the play, 
except perhaps the last, which is among the best things 
I am capable of. Knowles is ravished with his own 
acting, and the support it has met with. I wish I was 
with mine." 

A little later occurs one of the diarist's not 
infrequent outbursts of disgust with his calling, 
together with a scathing invective against critics 
in general and the " Quarterly Review" editor in 
particular. In his closing sentence Harriet 
Martineau would have found joy, as would also 
many others whom the mordant pen of Walter 
Scott's son-in-law had stung to madness. 

"I wish I were anything rather than an actor except 
a critic ; let me be unhappy rather than vile ! If I 
meant by this that men who usually criticize are vile I 
should convict myself of equal folly and injustice. It 
is the assumption of the high duties of criticism (de- 
manding genius and enthusiasm tempered by the most 
exact judgment and refined taste) by mere dealers in 
words, with no pretentions to integrity of purpose or the 
advancement of literature, that disgusts and depresses 
me. The sight of the Quarterly Review the arena of 
Croker, Lockhart, Harness, Hall, etc. which H. Smith 
has sent me, induced a train of thought upon the (so- 
called) criticism of the country. Generally speaking it 
takes its tone from faction. The most profound ignor- 
ance is no obstruction to the most dogmatic assertions 
these are made, of course, on points that few persons 
are interested in contradicting, or in seeing contradicted, 
therefore they remain as texts for the declaimers from 
the particular Review to preach from. It is really my 
opinion that in the classification of minds such a one as 
Lockhart's hireling, defamer, corrupt (not by direct 
means of pecuniary bribe, but by party and power), 
malignant trader in sentences pointed to stab, and draw 
by slow droppings the life-blood of a man's heart is 
of the base the basest." 

Macready lived to see the mercilessly slash- 
ing style of criticism go out of fashion, but it is 
probable that he retained to the last a tongue 
that could, on occasion, slash with the best of 
the reviewers and critics. Again and again he 
upbraids himself for giving vent to his anger. 
"Oh passion! passion!" he exclaims, "what a 
wretched, senseless, ruinous guide thou art!" 
And in the same vein he descants more at length: 

" How strange it is that our experience of the pain as 
well as unprofitableness of passion should not teach us 
the lesson of subduing it ! How many times this morn- 



180 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



ing had I to accuse myself and reason myself out of 
my wrath and impatience, as I drove along, because 
Healey had brought me a slow coach instead of a fast 
cab ! If there be one folly more injurious to man than 
another it is the senseless fury of anger." 

This same senseless fury was responsible for 
the hostile relations that grew up, or sprang up, 
between Macready and so many of his friends 
and associates, as Kean and Forrest, Charles 
Kemble and Alfred Bunn, and numerous others. 
Among the amiable diarist's minor foibles we 
find that of late rising repeatedly censured by 
him, though an actor might surely be pardoned 
for hugging his pillow a little longer in the morn- 
ing than other people. Rather amusing are such 
entries as the following: 

" Compunction is injurious if unproductive of improve- 
ment; let my revision of this day enable me to be more 
resolute in my resistance of future temptations, and teach 
me for my own and my children's good the necessity of 
blending activity with enjoyment. .- . . 

" I am again called upon to note down an instance of 
my indolence and weakness ; the reflections of yesterday 
only expose me to further self-reproach to-day. I lay 
in bed until a very late hour. As some atonement I 
walked to town, redeeming part of the day from general 
censure by using it in the wholesome exercise of the 
body, which is the best use of time after employing it 
in strengthening and invigorating our minds. . . . 

" Could not get up when called this morning, so over- 
come did I feel from want of sleep ; all the coaches had 
passed, and left me to make a virtue of necessity, which I 
did by sending my cloak, etc.,to town,and setting off in the 
sharp air of the morning upon a most delightful walk." 

He continues, in quite Pepysian vein, to describe 
the exhilarating effects of his walk, his gratifica- 
tion at being invited to take a seat in a very 
neat gig by a gentleman who was driving to 
town an invitation that he thankfully declined, 
as he was walking for exercise and his pleas- 
ure at the sight of several villagers wheeling 
home the coal he had given them. 

From that part of the record which describes 
his American tour in 1843-4, a few passages 
must be quoted. In New York, soon after 
landing, he writes : 

" Forrest called and took me out to see the reservoir 
of the aqueduct; afterwards to see Mrs. Forrest. Dined 
with Pierce Butler, Bryant, Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow. 
Mrs. Butler's [Fanny Kemble's] conversation was such 

that, had I been her husband I should observe 

that Mrs. Butler spoke admirably well, but quite like 
a man. She is a woman of a most extraordinary mind; 
what she said on most subjects was true the stern 
truth, but what in the true spirit of charity should not 
have been said in the presence of one who was obliged 
to listen to it. Alas! " 

At New Orleans five months later he writes: 
"Last day of my engagement here! The thought 
brings new animation to my spirits and comparative 
quiet to my nerves. My labour is incessant, monoton- 
ous, and with nothing in the character of my criticism 



to stimulate me; the money and the thought of home 
are the comforting reflections." 

Again, in New York, on the eve of leaving our 
shores, he writes, with a mingling of piety and 
thrift : 

"The anniversary of my opening the Park theatre, New 
York, since when I find myself, with all expenses paid, 
about 2,500 bettered in pecuniary circumstances, for 
which I gratefully, devoutly and earnestly thank God." 

Ten portraits of Macready, including six in 
stage costume, and thirty-nine portraits of 
friends and fellow-actors contribute the pic- 
torial element of the volumes, and their thou- 
sand or more pages of excellent reading matter 
are fully indexed as well as sufficiently provided 
with footnotes. PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



MR. ZANGWILI/S NEW PLAY.* 



The appearance of "The Next Religion " has 
been eagerly awaited by the devoted company of 
those who hold that no writer since Browning 
has taken unto himself the entire wealth of 
human culture with finer sensitiveness of re- 
sponse than Israel Zangwill. His work is not 
always of even texture ; when the Almighty 
planned Zangwill, He wrote upon the prescrip- 
tion, '''-Fiat mixtura" yet there be those 
who believe that in " The Mantle of Elijah " 
the author has given to the world the most 
elevated novel of a generation ; in " The Melt- 
ing Pot" he has handled a world-problem with 
masterful security ; his brilliant modern play 
" The War-God " sounds the clearest note of 

. . . "duty 
God's trumpet-answer to life's dreary riddle." 

His internationalism qualifies him for his mis- 
sion as a cosmopolitan mediator (it is perhaps not 
generally known that the composer of the unusu- 
ally successful American song, " I 'm Awfully 
Glad I'm Irish" bears the name of Piantadosi). 
Open to every stimulus throughout the whole 
range of elaborated values, Mr. Zangwill has 
sensed most delicately the richest dignities and 
beauties of human life. He knows his classics 
and his Church Fathers, he has compassed music, 
history, painting, and the infinite messages of 
nature : " the universe has passed through that 
brain," even as in the case of his own Raphael 
Dominick. In the midst of an appalling super- 
ficiality among writers, he feels the life-and- 
death earnestness of the struggle for spiritual 
existence ; his severe puritanism means more 
because it is a part of the web of the most

sumptuous civilization; he has given body to 
the visions of those who yearn for a kingdom of 
God on earth ; he is a true poet and seer of the 
twentieth century. 

Each of the three acts of " The Next Re- 
ligion " is played against a most effective back- 
ground : in the first, the scene is laid in a cosy 
English country parsonage, in which the crisis 
of the insurgent clergyman is developed with 
telling strokes ; in the second act we look into 
the shabby quarters in the Whitechapel Road 
where Stephen and his family are tasting all the 
bitterness of poverty and failure ; the last scene 
shows the splendors of St. Thomas's Temple, 
the cathedral of Stephen's "new religion," of 
which he is the high-priest and prophet. 

But all these scenic and dramatic features are 
but merest incidents when it comes to confront- 
ing the critical problem of our earth, 

" This labouring, vast, Tellurian galleon," 
floundering in the welter of Islam, and Judaism, 
and Christianity, the insistent question as to 
whether Christianity is still able to meet its 
obligations : whether it should be wound up, or 
should continue to do business in the hands of 
receivers ; it is to this ominous taking account 
of the world's stock that Mr. Zangwill summons 
us, and his " New Religion " comes as an answer 
to a waiting which has not been short of pain- 
ful : we trusted that it had been he which should 
have redeemed Israel; if he were not to prove 
the Moses to lead into a larger land, we had, at 
least, every right to expect an open-eyed facing 
of the whole matter. 

Alas and alack! this cosmic drama must be 
added to the large list of Jungle-Books which 
lead nowhere. We had awaited a convincing, 
universal synthesis, and at the beginning such 
hopes are encouraged : " Yes, but the devil's 
truth comes by denying God's truth by affirm- 
ing. From more faith, not from less ! The next 
religion will be larger than Christianity, not 
smaller; harder, not easier." We have intima- 
tions of deep spirituality, of triumphant faith : 
" No lip-religion this, but life's central reality, 
as clear as the sky, as real as the earth." It 
promises to attack the "world's dirty work," 
but fails altogether to connect with the fierce dis- 
persive ethics of to-day's labor-philosophy. It 
certainly fails to show a religion which attests 
or even hints at a significant, harmonized uni- 
verse. Through twelve years the action con- 
tinues, until Stephen, thanks to the money of a 
clumsy British Philistine, is "Master," and "the 
world at his feet" one wonders why. As to 
motives and action, we have an almost sardonic 



blend of light and shade, of hope and despair. 

The real "push" to the New Religion comes 
from Mary, a pure-minded Christian reaction- 
ary, a heroine who hangs like a millstone about 
her husband's neck, and who by an opportune 
miraculous prayer becomes a startling dea ex 
machina at the moment of supreme tragic diffi- 
culty, the whole situation seeming about as 
incongruous here as the big engraving of a side- 
wheeled ocean steamship which marks the close 
of the third volume of St. Ambrose's writings 
in the " Patrologia Latina." The representa- 
tives of the protest against the Christian Church 
and its teaching are sorry figures (even the good 
Stephen) when not vulgar, selfish, or dissipated. 
As to the fire-new Temple-cult, with Swinburne 
as a stained-glass Saint (ein wunderlicher 
Heiliger!), its wax candles and golden candle- 
sticks, its ever-burning taper before the portrait 
of Sir Thomas McFadden, inventor of guns, to 
say nothing of the sacristan in his "blue gown 
with silver spots," these things may be con- 
vincing and heartening to some souls "credat 
ludaeus Apella ; nonego" 

Even the incidental cleverness is annoying in 
its futility, and the dramatic tensity at the close 
is painfully cheap. The play sedulously extrudes 
all undigested objections to superseding Chris- 
tianity, and from a sunny outlook leads to the 
gloomiest fog. Mary's last outcry is against 
Stephen's " miserable religion," and the oracular 
Hal McFadden, M.D., M.R.C.S., etc., trans- 
formed from a chaser of housemaids into a rep- 
resentative of England's mature wisdom, delivers 
the final counsel of despair : " Christianity can't 
be improved on the lesson was cheap at the 
price. Good-bye." We fail to see that twelve 
years of dramatic business have advanced the 
matter one inch. 

Possibly our American perspective is at fault, 
and it may be impossible to overcome the diffi- 
culties in estimating the relative values of these 
things on British soil. It is sufficiently axio- 
matic that a mortal insult in Illinois may be a 
flattering compliment in Michigan, or the reverse. 
But however baffled we may be in getting light 
from Mr. Zangwill's message, our chief marvel 
lies in the easy gullibility of England's Lord 
Chamberlain: the Free Thinkers of our allied 
Empire must surely have bribed him to forbid 
the performance of "The Next Religion" in 
Great Britain, for no conceivable document 
could be better contrived for driving a whole 
people, like a flock, into the untroubled fold of 
the Holy Apostolic Christian Church.

A CONCORDANCE TO DANTE'S 
LATIN WORKS.* 



Concordances are growing in number and 
favor. There is now a flourishing Concordance 
Society. Everybody is familiar with one or 
more biblical concordances. The earliest of 
these were made to show that there is no incon- 
sistency between one part of the Bible and 
another. St. Anthony of Padua should be 
regarded as the patron saint of concordance 
makers, as tradition says that he made the first 
biblical concordance. When Dr. E. A. Fay 
published his Concordance of the Divina Corn- 
media, twenty-five years ago, the hope was 
expressed that the venture might prove suffi- 
ciently successful to encourage further efforts 
in the same direction. Mr. Paget Toynbee gave 
it as his opinion that a concordance to Dante's 
minor works, Latin as well as Italian, would 
undoubtedly do more for the elucidation of 
Dante than half a dozen isolated commentaries, 
there being no method more profitable than 
making Dante his own interpreter. A concor- 
dance of the minor Italian works, compiled by 
Messrs. E. S. Sheldon and A. C. White, was 
published in 1905. To complete the series, 
Messrs. E. K. Rand and E. H. Wilkins, assisted 
by Mr. A. C. White, have recently published a 
concordance of Dante's Latin works. In this 
are included all the Latin works found in the 
third edition of the Oxford text, 1904, namely, 
the "Eclogae," "De monarchia," " De vulgari 
eloquentia," "Epistolae," and "Quaestio de 
aqua et terra." 

A concordance is strictly a ready reference 
book. The aim is always a practical one. It 
has no interest for the mere amateur. It is to 
aid the serious student in word study, the loca- 
tion of a particular passage, or the comparison 
of the different uses to which an author puts a 
particular word. Its value is chiefly as a help 
in the critical study of a text or an author. 
Only the authors of highest rank can expect to 
have the honor of a concordance awarded them. 
Among English authors so honored are Burns, 
Gray, Milton, Pope, Shakespeare, Shelley, 
Tennyson, and Wordsworth. Comprehensive 
indexes and dictionaries of various writers are 
appearing from year to year, like the recent 
Dickens, Kipling, Thackeray, and Zola diction- 
aries ; but these are mostly concerned with the 
proper names occurring in the works of the 

* DANTIS ALAGHERII OPBRUM LATINORUM CONCORDAN- 
TIAE. Ediderunt E. K. Rand et E. H. Wilkins. New York: 
Oxford University Press. 



authors mentioned. One could not get much 
assistance if he went to these guides for help on 
the use of a special word, nor could he determine 
the frequency of use of a particular expression 
by consulting their pages. Thanks to the work 
of Messrs. Fay, Sheldon and White, Rand and 
Wilkins, we now have three valuable aids to 
the study of Dante's vocabulary, helps to the 
study of mediaeval Latin and early Italian as 
used by the same master hand. 

The maker of a concordance must have pa- 
tience, industry, accuracy, leisure, and a sense 
of orderly arrangement. Care is more essential 
than originality, and there is a constant call for 
the play of judgment in deciding what common- 
place words not to index, or what to omit when 
making a concordance to prose works, so that a 
one-line extract can give a sense of the context 
and usage of a particular word. A higher grade 
of judgment is required to plan the arrangement 
of all the material when collected. On the part 
of the compiler, the work must be one of love 
for the author, lest it turn to drudgery of the 
most oppressive sort. All these qualifications 
are amply possessed by the compilers of the new 
Dante concordance. To them, as well as to the 
Dante Society of Cambridge, to which is due 
the first impulse, we extend congratulations on 
the completion of a useful and laborious task 
exceedingly well done.

PERSONALITY IN CRITICISM.* 



The four volumes here grouped for review are 
confessedly miscellanies, and it would be idle to 
profess to find unity in any one of them, much less 
in the group, unless it be in the circumstance that 
they exemplify the power of personality in criticism. 
None of them, that is to say, would have been 
published without the author's name ; each of them 
finds its right to exist in the fact that a considerable 
number of persons will care to know what its writer 
has had to say about books. Two are posthumous ; 
and a third, that of Mr. Frederic Harrison, has also 
a suggestion of posthumous quality, being primarily 
made up of the reminiscences of an old though, 
happily, still thoroughly live man.

tion of the volume called "Books and Bookmen." 
The essay which supplies the title is indeed well 
worth preserving, with its witty and undoubtedly 
personal account of the temptations and falls of the 
bibliolater. The other three were written as popular 
lectures, and show something of the thinness, the want 
of stuff, which is to be expected of such performances 
if they appear unchanged in print, an impression 
strengthened by the fact that the whole book is an 
example of the all too common contemporary prac- 
tice of making, by judicious choice of type and paper, 
a volume which should normally consist of a hun- 
dred pages look like one of three hundred, and sell 
for a corresponding price. The real worth of the 
book, as has already appeared, is in its appeal to 
those who have known the genial Ian Maclaren or 
heard him, and who will be glad of any memorial 
of his personality. Such persons will perhaps turn 
first to the lecture on Humour, which was repeatedly 
delivered in this country. To the reader of this it 
is even plainer than it must have been to the hearer 
that Dr. Watson had nothing of independent value 
to say about humour except where it touched his 
own country and countrymen; but his account of 
Scottish humour remains delightful, and furnishes a 
valuable commentary on many of the " Brier Bush" 
tales. It is characterized, we are told, by " a sense 
of the underlying tragedy of things, of the contra- 
dictions and mysteries of life, which have in them 
a sad absurdity." And the admirable corollary is 
this : " No man comes off so well at a wedding as an 
Englishman, but none is so ill at ease at a funeral; 
while a Scotsman has no freedom at a marriage, since 
he does not know how the matter may end, but he 
carries himself as to the manner born at a funeral." 

Friends of the late Mr. Churton Collins, whose 
criticism was not always distinguished for its gen- 
iality, may also think it a doubtful tribute to collect 
the manuscripts which make up the volume of his 
" Posthumous Essays." These essays exhibit, to be 
sure, the breadth of his interests and the fine back- 
ground of literary experience which he justly com- 
plained was so generally wanting in contemporary 
criticism ; but they show little of the trenchant vigor 
of the " Ephemera Critica," and on the other hand 
preserve many imperfections of form which their 
author would never have permitted to find way into 
print. The greater number were written for delivery 
as popular lectures, and must be judged from the 
standpoint of this purpose. Of this sort perhaps the 
most satisfactory is the account of Emerson, whose 
character is portrayed with finely discriminating 
appreciation. The keynote of the interpretation 
might be found in Mr. Collins's interesting state- 
ment that Emerson combined some of the striking 
qualities of Berkeley, Wordsworth, and Benjamin 
Franklin. 

It was always Mr. Collins's distinction to stress 
more firmly the actual content of literature than is 
the habit of those who have devoted themselves to 
literature as a profession. Of this practice signifi- 
cant examples are found in the essays on Words- 

A / 



worth and Browning. Mr. Collins reacts strongly 
against Matthew Arnold's contempt for the Words- 
worthian philosophy, and holds that, the better we 
know Wordsworth's poetry, the more shall we value 
its actual contribution to the thought of the age. 
Of Browning's religious philosophy his account is 
the most substantial portion of the volume, being 
presented in three essays with the alluringly myste- 
rious titles, " Browning and Butler," " Browning 
and Montaigne," and " Browning and Lessing." To 
have found close kinship between the theological 
speculations of the authors of the "Analogy," the 
" Essays," and the " LaocoOn," Anglican divine, 
Renaissance Catholic-skeptic, and eighteenth-century 
German theorist, must have been a rewarding in- 
tellectual experience. Mr. Collins's further discern- 
ing of parallels between all these and the vaguely 
Christian idealism of Browning's poetry has already 
been ridiculed as an example of his well-known taste 
for literary resemblances, viewed, as others have 
believed, under a very strong microscope. In the 
present instance, however, he was not so much con- 
cerned with source-hunting or questions of influence 
as with the kinship between superficially different 
processes of justifying religious faith ; and the paral- 
lels he draws must be interesting to every student of 
Browning. Whether Mr. Collins implicitly exagger- 
ates the value of the several processes is a question 
for theologian or philosopher. 

Mr. Frederic Harrison's volume is even more a 
miscellany than these others, containing, for example, 
two exceedingly learned essays on Byzantine history 
(one of them the Rede Lecture at Cambridge Uni- 
versity, 1900), fortified with many footnotes, side 
by side with comments of the most chatty character 
on "Poets that I Love" and editions which are 
pleasant to put in one's bag for a journey. It might 
appear that Mr. Harrison, having undergone some 
severe discipline in the field of history, values 
scholarly method in connection with that subject; 
whereas in the field of literature, having been always 
an amateur, he is disposed to scorn other methods 
than those of the amateur. At any rate he holds 
that the " word of ill-omen known as Research hangs 
upon literature like the microbe of Sleeping Sick- 
ness," leading men to make books "by laborious 
poking into charnel houses and dustbins of the past, 
instead of by intelligent understanding of men and 
things." Again, in matters of literary judgment he 
warns us not to trust to experts, since a specialist 
is necessarily limited in his outlook. Wherever art 
is concerned, Mr. Harrison aspires to the same 
catholicity which his Positivism has taught him in 
matters of religion, such an unprejudiced temper 
as won for him the approval of Cardinal Newman, 
he tells with gusto, as translator of the " Imitation 
of Christ." " What I contend for," he says in the 
essay on tragedy, " is respect for all great types of 
art, and freedom from national, personal, or sectional 
bias. ' Art is long,' but inexhaustible." In one 
direction, however, he refuses to extend the scope 
of his appreciation. In a brief essay on Rodin he 



184 



[March 1, 



takes the great sculptor as typical of indefensible 
tendencies in contemporary art, whose single aim, 
apparently, "is to shock one's grandmother." After 
the Victorian period, when " things were decorous, 
refined, and conventional, because it was an age of 
serious, decent, unimaginative men and women with 
a turn for science, social reform, and making things 
comfortable," came an incursion of morbid degen- 
eracy characteristic of " the Scandinavian and Mon- 
gol imagination," with a new cult, which might be 
dubbed" A ischrolatreia worship of the Ugly, the 
Nasty, the Brutal." After indulging himself in this 
healthy outburst, Mr. Harrison proceeds to discuss 
more philosophically why sculpture is of all arts the 
least fitted to the peculiar mannerisms of the age of 
Rodin. 

The real . worth of these essays (barring those 
based on historical learning) is again in the essay- 
ist's personality: in the personality of that type of 
amateur of literature which it is the special glory of 
the English universities to produce. The six essays 
which give the volume its title are frankly confined 
to the rehearsal of the personal tastes of the writer, 
as he goes about his library in old age and takes 
account of what it contains that is still vital, still 
beloved, after all the years. And is this, indeed, 
not as valid a laboratory test as one is likely often 
to have the chance of observing ? On occasion we 
may feel certain that some error of the personal 
equation is implied, as when Mr. Harrison exclaims 
of Byron's Letters, "This is the finest prose in our 
language"; or when he observes, "I care for Plato's 
metaphysics as little as for the rhapsodical gammon 
of Professor Bergson or Miss Marie Corelli" (which 
does not keep him from reading his Plato "with 
ever new delight"). But in general he is close enough 
in touch with the judgment of the ages, of the orbis 
terrarum, to make one certain that his guidance 
among his books will be not only agreeable but 
sound. 

In turning to Professor Brand er Matthews's essays 
we leave reminiscence and retrospection for alert 
contemporary criticism, more worldly than acad- 
emic, even if it be from the professorial chair. Two 
matters of external detail will attract the attention 
of one who picks up this volume. On the title-page 
is a continental sort of appendage to the author's 
name, " Member of the American Academy of Arts 
and Letters," reminding us of that to which we 
have at length attained in the way of an hierarchy 
of which earlier generations of Anglo-Saxon men of 
letters idly dreamed. The other matter is reformed 
spelling in the text, calling to mind Professor Mat- 
thews's eloquent service on behalf of the Spelling 
Board, at whose pertinacity many of his friends 
have scoft in vain. Letting pass these frivolities, one 
finds a dozen essays on literature as various as the 
works of Fenimore Cooper and of Anatole France, 
all in the urbane and liberal tone which the accus- 
tomed reader knows so well. To anyone interested 
in the art of the essayist perhaps the outstanding 
element in this collection is the theory and the prac- 



tice of the French idea of critical style. In more 
than one passage Professor Matthews refers to the 
"Parisian tradition" of writing always for the gen- 
eral reader, of renouncing "overt individuality," 
and eschewing self-expression of a kind likely to 
shock any person addressed; and nothing could be 
plainer than that this is always the goal which he 
sets before himself. The virtues of the method are 
doubtless suitable for imitation on the part of any 
young critic, but it has "the defects of its qualities." 
When one has been led easily and gracefully through 
fifty pages of the essayist's urbanities, he finds him- 
self beginning to wish to be shocked in some fashion, 
either by a really salient idea or a mannerism of 
expression, even if it be some extraordinary thrust 
of personality in the manner of a Saintsbury. He 
begins to weary, too, of the elegantly amateurish way 
in which the abundant quotations from other critics 
are introduced, "It was a Frenchman who de- 
clared"; "As Whitney once phrased it"; "It was 
the wise Mommsen who called" etc.; "It was the 
shrewd Bagehot who asserted"; "As Sidney Lanier 
declared poetically." These instances are from a 
half dozen pages, pages guiltless, incidentally, of 
any too scholastic footnote which might aid a thor- 
ough reader to seek out a citation in its context. It 
must have required much self-restraint on the part 
of a scholar to so purge his method and style of the 
dreadful German habit called griindlichkeit. But 
while we may be genuinely grateful to him for doing 
so, we must regretfully admit that some of the merits 
of griindlichkeit such as the sense that we have 
really come to grips with the heart of the subject, 
as distinguished from circumnavigating it appreci- 
atively have been lost at the same time with the 
clumsiness of the German style. 

Of the subjects discussed in this volume, perhaps 
those to which the author makes the happiest con- 
tributions are Familiar Verse, the Duty of Imitation 
'on the part of young writers, and Anatole France. 
Another topic from which one hopes not a little is the 
elusive question as to the indifference of English 
readers to French poetry; but it is disappointing to 
learn nothing of this beyond the familiar facts that 
the French language lacks accent, lacks semi-tones, 
and lacks Germanic root-words, though these are 
restated with persuasiveness and charm. (On this 
subject there is now available the recent and valuable 
discussion of M. Legouis.) Perhaps least appealing, 
to many readers, is a curious little essay called " The 
Devil's Advocate," in which are brought together 
" historic doubts " concerning the right of Johnson, 
Ruskin, and Carlyle to a lasting place among great 
writers. It will be seen that the real source of 
unity in this grouping is in the common element of 
alleged bad manners, together with the element of 
exaggerated personality in style. But the devil's 
advocate (quite properly, of course) is allowed to 
forget such facts as that, while Dr. Johnson wrote a 
very bad style, he also wrote a very fine one. Who 
can read the closing words of the Preface to the 
Dictionary, or many a passage in the Preface to

Shakespeare, and believe that his influence as a 
stylist was altogether "artificial and demoralizing"? 
And as to lacking readers, there are signs of a new 
growth in this direction, of a new appreciation of 
Johnson's sturdy sagacity and truthfulness, witness 
the recent lectures of Professor Walter Raleigh. 
Here Mr. Churton Collins, in some pages that 
exhibit sound appreciation not only of Johnson's 
personality but of the substantial value of what he 
wrote, probably comes much nearer than the devil's 
advocate to representing the final judgment of the 
court. RAYMOND MACDONALD ALDEN. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



A French 
study of 
Chaucer. 



Students of Chaucer will rejoice in 
the appearance in an English dress 
(Button) of M. Legouis's valuable 
biography of Chaucer, which appeared in Les grands 
ecrivains Strangers (Paris: Bloud et Cie., 1910). 
We do not hesitate to pronounce it the most stimu- 
lating and suggestive book on Chaucer, of its kind, 
that has appeared in many years. M. Legouis brings 
to his task exceptional qualifications : wide familiar- 
ity with the literatures of both France and England ; 
a keen delight, we may believe, in the special type 
of literature narrative poetry represented by 
Chaucer; sympathy with the point of view of the 
poet; and a distinctive and trenchant style. As a 
Frenchman, too, he naturally pays much attention 
to the style of the poet. He emphasizes the value of 
the training Chaucer received from his close imita- 
tion of the intricate verse forms of Machaut and his 
contemporaries. The Roman de la Rose, "the great 
poetical well" of the fourteenth century, was to 
Chaucer even more than a school for style; it sup- 
plied him with many thoughts, images, turns of ex- 
pression. Indeed, recording as M. Legouis's book 
does the results of the latest scholarship, it differs 
from earlier works in representing Chaucer as far 
more of a borrower than was formerly supposed to 
be the case. It is not merely that he borrows plots 
and motifs, as did everybody in those days and for 
a long time afterward ; it is not that he echoes many 
a line, and phrase, and bon mot, stored up by a re- 
tentive memory through years of absorbed reading ; 
it is indeed the very essence of French poetry that 
he reproduces the pure, even tone of the trouveres, 
the simplicity, the restraint, the sober sense, betoken- 
ing the firm control of mind over feeling, which 
were distinguishing traits of the old French poets 
and which, in M. Legouis's opinion, serve to set off 
Chaucer's poetry in such sharp contrast with that 
of his English predecessors that to pass from one to 
the other seems like going into a different world. 
It is natural that a Frenchman should be the first 
to appreciate this fully and set it forth in telling 
fashion. Yet the author by no means belittles the 
genius of the English poet; nor is there any undue 
display of patriotism in his description of Chaucer's 



French debt. He represents Chaucer indeed as a 
very human poet, who never poses as a mentor, but 
would always be looked upon as "a good-natured 
companion always ready to make place for some- 
body else," and who very quickly makes himself our 
friend. Yet he contends that Chaucer marks a dis- 
tinct advance, which may be characterized as a 
progress of the intelligence : a weakening of passion 
based on self-confidence, a keen pleasure in observ- 
ing men as they are, a willingness to portray average 
humanity. "He leads the group of amused and 
good-natured observers who will accept as a fact the 
motley fabric of society, without wishing to dye to 
a uniform colour the many strands that compose it." 
Thus he becomes the first, as he is not the least, of 
the realists. M. Lailavoix as a translator has ac- 
quitted himself well. Occasionally he has made a 
foreigner's slip in idiom, as e.g., when he says that 
the Wife of Bath "must be put on the same rank 
with Panurge and Falstaff " (p. 175) ; but such in- 
stances are rare. Some will regret that he has not 
thought it necessary to translate M. Legouis's care- 
ful analysis (sixty-four pages) of "The Canterbury 
Tales"; but as partial compensation for this omis- 
sion we have a well-written preface of thirty pages 
in which the translator himself sums up French 
knowledge and opinions of Chaucer, deriving his 
facts chiefly from Miss Spurgeon's work. We have 
noted one or two misprints: p. 5, in the quotation 
read floytinge; p. 118, 1. 6 f.b., read Robert K. 
Root; p. 119, read De Casibus Virorum, etc. The 
frontispiece portrait of Chaucer, reproduced from 
the Occleve MS. now owned by Mr. Munro, comes 
out much better than it does in the French edition. 

Bergson's own Two translations of Henri Bergson's 
*oM?n n "Introduction a la M&aphysique " 
philosophy. are published almost simultaneously 
under the respective titles of "An Introduction to 
Metaphysics" (Putnam) in a rendering made by 
Mr. T. E. Hulme, and "The Introduction to a New 
Philosophy" (Luce) translated by Mr. Sidney Litt- 
man. Mr. Hulme's translation has the very decisive 
advantage of having been revised in proof by M. 
Bergson, and further advantage was taken of that 
fact to make several changes in the presentation of 
the subject. And apart from this, Mr. Hulme's trans- 
lation is the more exact of the two. On the other 
hand Mr. Littman's volume includes a portrait of 
Bergson, which may be a consideration with some 
admirers of the French philosopher. The reader 
should not surmise from the original title that the 
author has written a general textbook. He simply 
gives us in these pages the basis upon which his own 
philosophy is built. Briefly, his argument is that 
the intellect, working as it does for practical ends, 
in the interests of the control of matter, tends to dia- 
gram everything, to specialize on the fixed and the 
expected features of reality; and then, when it be- 
gins to speculate, it takes the diagrams of reality for 
reality itself. From this tendency come the errors 
of the conflicting schools of philosophy, which have 



186 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



all failed to see that the reality of life is a continual 
becoming, a flow which will not stop and mould itself 
on the categories of the understanding. This flow, 
says Bergson, cannot be described in the static terms 
of the intellect any more than grey can be described 
to a man who has never seen it in terms of black 
and white, although after it is once seen it can be 
analyzed into those terms. To comprehend reality 
then, we must use a faculty of direct perception, 
an intuition which is behind, and more fundamental 
than, intellectual understanding. There is nothing 
mysterious about that faculty, says Bergson. "Every 
one of us has had occasion to exercise it to a cer- 
tain extent. Any one of us, for instance, who has 
attempted literary composition, knows that when 
the subject has been studied at length, the materials 
all collected, and the notes all made, something more 
is needed in order to set about the work of composi- 
tion itself, and that is an often very painful effort to 
place ourselves directly at the heart of the subject, 
and to seek as deeply as possible an impulse, after 
which we need only let ourselves go. . . . Meta- 
physical intuition seems to be something of the same 
kind. What corresponds here to the documents 
and notes of literary composition is the sum of the 
observations and experiences gathered together by 
positive science. For we do not obtain an intuition 
from reality that is, an intellectual sympathy with 
the most intimate part of it unless we have won its 
confidence by a long fellowship with its superficial 
manifestations." This last sentence should be an 
answer to those who have ridiculed the Bergsonian 
method on the ground that it exalted an alleged 
mystical faculty above positive science. 

The crowded life The record . of J hn Wesley's strenu- 
of a great ous life, with its thousands of miles 

religious leader. of yearly travel and its incessant 
preaching to audiences of humble hearers, is fairly 
equalled by the crowded chronicle of General Will- 
iam Booth's gospel labors from the sixteenth year of 
a life that exceeded the Psalmist's limit by thirteen 
years. "The Authoritative Life of General William 
Booth, Founder of the Salvation Army," by Mr. G. S. 
Railton, the General's First Commissioner, comes 
seasonably from the press within six months of the 
famous religious leader's death. Like Wesley and 
like Fox, William Booth had to maintain his cause 
against great public opposition, and like them he 
knew no such word as defeat. The fruit of his cour- 
age and enthusiasm was a religious organization ex- 
tending to every part of Great Britain and to half 
a hundred other countries as well. That so frail a 
form, sustained by a diet incredibly meagre in its 
proportions, could have borne the burden of work 
and travel put upon it, especially in later years, ex- 
cites wonder and admiration. It was the sustaining 
power of a high and unselfish purpose that carried him 
through. In his biographer he is fortunate to have 
a man more intimately familiar with the details of 
his life and work than anyone outside his immediate 
family. Mr. Railton freely supplements his narra- 



tive with extracts from Booth's journals and letters 
and published writings. Characteristic of Mr. Booth 
and in harmony with the plan of the biography is 
the omission of those details which, while of less 
moment than the successive steps in the evangelist's 
rise to world-wide recognition and in the recruiting 
of his great army of religious workers, would have 
pictured the man to us more vividly as a human 
being and would have imparted variety to the narra- 
tive. For instance, while the General tells us much 
about his six weary years of apprenticeship at Not- 
tingham and his subsequent period of irksome toil 
in London, he seems not to think it worth while, or 
of any interest to the reader, to explain in what his 
labors consisted. We fail to find any mention of 
the trade to which he was apprenticed, the fact of 
his conversion in the course of that apprenticeship 
overshadowing in its importance all less spiritual 
concerns. As a record of evangelistic toil and 
achievement, and as a history of the Salvation 
Army, the book is all that could be desired. It is 
well illustrated, and a useful chronological table is 
added. (George H. Doran Co.) 

Essavsbvthe "Anecdotes and entertainment, 
wife of a rather than severe speculations, his- 

famous essayist, torical and social, are the farrago 
libelli the burden of the book," writes Andrew 
Lang in a prefatory note to his wife's volume of 
collected papers, "Men, Women, and Minxes" 
(Longmans). Eighteen diverting studies in biog- 
raphy and literature and the philosophy of life, some 
of them dating back a quarter of a century, were 
chosen in Mr. Lang's lifetime by himself and Mrs. 
Lang from her contributions to various periodicals, 
and were in press for book publication at the time 
of his death. It is a severe test for a woman writer 
to be compared with so brilliant a literary crafts- 
man as was Andrew Lang ; but the comparison 
is inevitable, and in truth implies a compliment, 
for dissimilars are never compared, but rather con- 
trasted. Something of her husband's lightness of 
touch, something of his command of a wide range 
of curious reading, and something of his fondness 
for the frequent unexpected or humorous turn of 
thought, are perceptible in Mrs. Lang's pages. She 
treats, with equal facility, " A Poseuse of the 
Eighteenth Century " namely, Madame de Genlis, 
"The Social Records of a Scotch Family," "Pit- 
falls for Collectors," "Rousseau's Ideal Household," 
"Morals and Manners in Richardson," "Two Cen- 
turies of American Women," " Other People's 
Friends," and various other topics. But in her 
" Trials of the Wife of a Literary Man," in which 
she ought to speak with authority, she pictures that 
woman's lot as too unendurable to be true ; she makes 
the literary husband talk " shop " and ride his hobby 
to the point of utter weariness, whereas the surpris- 
ing and refreshing thing about the best of literary 
men about Browning and Thackeray and Scott and 
William Black, and dozens more is their unaffected 
delight in escaping from the subjects associated with

studies in ma * n authorities depended 

primitive upon by the German critic, Arthur 

Christianity. Drews, in his attack upon the doctrine 
of an historical Jesus, was Dr. William Benjamin 
Smith of Tulane University, a mathematician by 
vocation but a theologian by avocation, who had 
independently reached the same conclusion as the 
German scholar, that Jesus was not an historical 
personage. The book in which Professor Smith's 
conclusions were set forth in detail, " Ecce Deus : 
Studies in Primitive Christianity " (Open Court Co.), 
was originally written in German and published in 
Germany probably owing to the fact that a work 
of such character is not only more sure of general 
welcome there, but because the judgment of the 
author's peers on his work must be a German judg- 
ment. Now the book comes, in enlarged form, to 
the English reader, after its ground has been pre- 
pared by the wide discussion of the recent English 
translation of Drews's book. While the general 
consensus of opinion is against both scholars in 
their contention, the fact must be apparent even to 
their opponents that they have done good service in 
clearing away from the figure of Christ much that 
is undoubtedly unhistorical and misleading. Pro- 
fessor Smith's discussion of such points as the in- 
terpolated references to Jesus in the writings of 
Josephus, for instance, is a matter of general interest 
to believers and non-believers alike. Stated posi- 
tively, Professor Smith's thesis is that primitive 
Christianity was the evangel of a Saviour-God, con- 
ceived monotheistically, and described in symbolic 
terms which afterward came to be interpreted as 
referring to the man Jesus. His work, therefore, 
is not to be regarded as an attack on Christianity, 
but simply as an alternative explanation of its origin 
and growth. _ 

Later memories Mr Henl 7 Ma y ers Hyndman's 

of an Enaiish " Further Reminiscences " (Macmil- 
pubhcist. j an ^ f orms a sequel to his "Record 

of an Adventurous Life," which came out two years 
ago and attracted attention by its variety of interest 
and liveliness of style. That book brought the 
writer's life down to 1889; the present volume con- 
tinues the discursive narrative to the year just ended. 
Social and economic questions naturally claim the 
lion's share of space in the pages of this energetic 
social-democrat, but literary topics also find a place, 
and among literary celebrities Mr. Bernard Shaw, 
with whom Mr. Hyndman is evidently on intimate 
terms, receives most frequent mention. As a sample 
of the book's engaging manner, and in illustration 
of its author's out-spoken partisanship on any ques- 
tion, small or great, that presents itself for discus- 
sion, the following passage is worth quoting. "But 
h propos of that albuminous repast of his, what a 
pity it is that Shaw should have stunted the natural 



growth of his mind and racked his intellect to fiddle- 
strings by his confoundedly inappropriate diet. Why 
has Shaw no pathos? How is it he is destitute of 
poesy? What makes his humour comparatively 
thin ? Why do his dramas tend to peter out at their 
latter end? I say it with all confidence and certi- 
tude : because his food is not suited to our damnable 
climate, and his drink does him no good. In Sicily, 
or Tasmania, at Santa Barbara, Cape Town or 
Copiapd these vegetarian vagaries may be pardon- 
able, though I should be sorry to try them on myself 
even there. But in England and in London, to say 
nothing of Ireland and Dublin, they are a sheer 
tempting of Providence to reduce a man to his lowest 
possible common denominator." Here, then, at last 
we have pathos and poesy traced to their source in 
beef and ale. The book is full of good things, almost 
as good as beef and ale, but it does not abound in 
pathos and poesy which, however, the reader will 
not look for. 

Mr. Hugh Child ers, who died last 
summer > completed shortly before his 
death the manuscript of a collection 
of historical studies entitled '' Romantic Trials of 
Three Centuries," now published by John Lane Co. 
The twelve cases selected for discussion were tried 
between the years 1650 and 1850. They are very 
unequal in interest and importance. Disraeli's early 
libel suit has relatively no significance, except such 
as attaches to the smallest of a great man's doings 
and sufferings ; and the Lyons Mail mystery, 
although the case is worked out by the author with 
enthusiastic thoroughness, falls somewhat out of the 
cadre, being as it is the only matter treated which 
has nothing to do with England or English proced- 
ure. Each one of the others touches on some inter- 
esting phase in the development of English criminal 
law. The trial of Elizabeth Canning for perjury, 
to instance one of them, was the first "of those 
elaborately conducted criminal trials in which no 
time or expense is spared on either side, and in which 
all the characteristics of English criminal law are 
seen at their best." That of William Penn for street 
preaching, to name another, first established defini- 
tively the right of juries to acquit, without reference 
to the attitude of the judge. Mr. Childers was so 
thoroughly interested in his cases that the reader's 
interest is not likely to flag, even when, as in the 
matter of the Lyons Mail, he presents the slightly 
varying evidence of witness after witness with a per- 
sistency that grows fatiguing and confusing. In such 
easily followed and thrillingly interesting trials as 
that of the unfortunate " macaroni parson " Dodd, 
his narrative makes a powerful appeal even to the 
reader who has little interest in legal minutiae. 

That Mr. Kendall Banning is a ver- 
a. satile young writer is evidenced by 

the simultaneous publication, under 
the auspices of the Brothers of the Book, Chicago, 
of two booklets as widely different in contents as 
" The Squire's Recipes " and " The Love Unend- 



188 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



ing." The former, irreverently known as " the booze 
book," pretends to be a collection of recipes for the 
concoction of a dozen alluring and insidious drinks, 
as originated by one Calvin Banning, the author's 
putative ancestor. It masquerades as a reprint of a 
pamphlet dated Sudbury, 1784, and the mystification 
is effectively carried out by the employment of old- 
fashioned typographical devices. As for the recipes, 
they sound good, and will probably be found good 
by those who venture to follow them. Mr. Banning's 
other booklet is a collection of four sonnets, dedi- 
cated to the memory of " the wife of my youth." We 
quote the one called " Communion." 

" No circumstance of death shall part us twain : 
My love for thee is not but for a day ; 
But sometime, somehow, ever and for aye, 
Mine arms shall hold thee to mine own again. 
Time shall not enter unto love's domain ; 
Men, creeds and worlds and gods, in grim array, 
Like chaff before the storm, shall sweep away, 
And death shall die. But love, our king, shall reign. 

Somewhere, between the black, abysmal night 
That broods in silence, endless and profound 
Below the thunders of the seventh hell, 
And heaven's utmost high celestial height, 
Where perfect love by perfect peace is crowned 
My soul shall find thee. And the rest is well." 

The undeniable beauty of this sonnet is matched in 
the other three. And a photogravure of Watts's 
" Love and Death " provides a frontispiece in exqui- 
site keeping with the emotion of the poems. 

New light on the In rescuing from oblivion the names 
exploration of of four Virginian explorers (Wood, 
the Ohio Valley. Batt8> Fallam, and Needham), and 
establishing by their narratives the fact that the 
actual discovery of the Trans- Allegheny region was 
made by the English and not by the French, a 
notable addition to the history of North American 
exploration has been made by Messrs. Clarence 
Wadsworth Alvord and Lee Widgood, whose vol- 
ume embodying this result is published by the 
Arthur H. Clark Co. under the title, "The First 
Explorations of the Trans- Allegheny Region by the 
Virginians, 1650-1674." It is singular enough 
that two such painstaking historians as Francis 
Parkman and Justin Winsor should have denied 
the authenticity of these discoveries ; but as the most 
essential link in the chain of evidence Abraham 
Wood's letter describing the journeys of Needham 
and Arthur was buried in the Public Record 
Office in London, there is perhaps some excuse for 
their mistake. To complete the story, the editors 
have brought together in this volume not only several 
documents that had never before seen the light, but 
also some that had already been published. None 
of these latter, however, were readily accessible. Not 
the least valuable part of the work is the full and 
scholarly introduction, in which the editors succeed 
in throwing a very clear light not only upon the lives 
and achievements of the discoverers, but also upon 
the circumstances and conditions that impelled them 
to cross the mountains the first pathfinders in the 



restless and resistless movement toward the west. A 
bibliography and an analytical index, two features 
often enough missing in works of this character, 
add materially to the value of the book from the 
student's point of view. 

Anew volume " This and That and *he Other" 

of Mr. Seiioc't (Dodd) is a new volume of essays by 
diversions. an English author who needs no 

introduction. Mr. Hilaire Belloc the versatile, irre- 
sponsible, prolific, altogether likable Mr. Belloc 
is particularly beloved by those who are not attracted 
by the essayists of paradox and the essayists of 
aesthetic culture. In his latest book, which differs 
from its predecessors mainly in the title (and not 
conspicuously even in that respect), we have a new 
fund of mirth, sobriety, and sentiment, a thisness 
and thatness and otherness as diversified and in- 
structive as those of the world itself; pedants, 
atheism, inns, crooked streets, the love of England, 
the obituary notice, are some of the forty subjects 
dealt with. " On Knowing the Past " is a title that 
symbolizes Mr. Belloc's habit, which distinguishes 
him from most American essayists, of looking to 
former ages for inspiration and guidance. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Poems and Stories by Bret Harte " (Houghton), 
edited by Mr. Charles Swain Thomas, is a welcome 
addition to " The Riverside Literature Series." Seven- 
teen poems and five stories are included, while the 
editor has supplied notes, questions, and an introduction. 

Professor Albert H. Tolman's " Questions on Shake- 
speare," published at the University of Chicago Press, 
is a series of pamphlets, each devoted to a single play, 
which provides the teacher with a wealth of material in 
the shape of information, suggestion, and questions for 
discussion in class. It is a very helpful publication. 

Mr. Henry Frowde publishes, in two volumes, a 
translation, made by Mr. Edward Kershaw Francis, of 
the Latin lectures on poetry, delivered in 1832-41 by 
John Keble, when he held the professorship of poetry 
at Oxford. They are a welcome and highly important 
addition to the literature of literary criticism in English. 

Adam Lindsay Gordon is probably the best known of 
Australian poets, and it is no slight tribute to his fame 
that an American publisher should have thought it safe 
to venture an edition of his complete poems. This is 
what the Messrs. Putnam have done, and the volume, a 
very attractive one, is edited by Mr. Douglas Sladen. 
It includes several pieces never before printed. 

The second publication of The Happy Publishing 
Company (London) is a little brochure entitled "Religion 
and Fairyland," whose thesis aims to show that the funda- 
mental human need for a fairy land, a " beyond," 
is " the raw material of all religion, and perhaps of all 
philosophy and art as well." The binding of the little 
book is dainty and unusual. Miss Edith M. Jewson is 
its author. 

Lamb's essay on " Old China," dear to every votary 
of Elia, has been reprinted in an exquisite little River- 
side Press Edition by the Houghton Mifflin Co. Several 
quaint decorations in blue from Japanese ceramic designs 



1913.] 



THE DIAL 



189 



embellish the twenty-odd pages ; and the old-fashioned 
paper boards, in blue and white, which enclose the book- 
let strike a pleasant and appropriate note. It is indeed 
what Lamb himself would have called a "delicate 
edition." 

The " Guide to the Study and Reading of American 
History " (Ginn), prepared by Professors Edward Chan- 
ning, A. B. Hart, and F. J. Turner, is a revised and 
greatly augmented form of a work published in 1896 by 
the first two of the editors named. It now constitutes 
a working bibliography which places every student of 
the subject under a deep debt of gratitude. 

Mr. Robert H. Bradbury has prepared " An Inductive 
Chemistry " (Appleton) which lives up to its name in its 
order of topics and method of their treatment. It be- 
gins with sulphur and the sulphides, an opening which 
has manifest advantages. The subjects of the kinetic 
theory of matter, the atomic theory, valence, and the 
periodic law, are introduced when the time comes to 
take them up, instead of being forced upon the unpre- 
pared mind as an introduction to the subject. A series 
of eight portrait illustrations, from Scheele to Fischer, 
adds materially to the interest of the book. 

So nearly ideal in form and make-up is the " Golden 
Treasury Series " (Macmillan) that we have long thought 
a poet could ask no better favor of the future than that 
his work should be enshrined in one of these little blue 
and gold volumes. William Allingham is the latest 
poet to gain admittance to the series. Although known 
chiefly by his two children's songs, " Up the airy moun- 
tain " and " Good-bye, good-bye to Summer," which 
appear in every anthology, Allingham wrote much that 
will always find favor among serious poetry-lovers. 
The present selection from his work has been made by 
Miss May Allingham. A photogravure portrait of the 
poet is included by way of frontispiece. 

A uniform library edition of the works of Sir Gilbert 
Parker, to be completed in eighteen volumes, has been 
planned by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The edi- 
tion is known as the " Imperial," and is similar in form 
to the other subscription sets of modern authors issued 
by this house. The first volume of the set, " Pierre 
and His People," contains a general introduction by 
the author, and each volume has a special introductory 
article concerning the book that follows. The other 
volumes now at hand are " A Romany of the Snows," 
" Northern Lights," and " Mrs. Falchion." These 
books of Sir Gilbert's earlier years will prove a pleas- 
ant revelation to the host of those who know him only 
by the recent novels that have made him .so widely 
popular a writer. 

Public libraries in Australia have not yet caught up 
with the needs of the Australians, but it is a new coun- 
try and the library idea must be allowed time to grow. 
Among those who are doing good work in fostering its 
growth is Mr. E. Morris Miller, librarian of the Mel- 
bourne Public Library and chairman of the Provisional 
Committee of the recently formed Library Association 
of Victoria. A well-considered treatise on " Libraries 
and Education " comes from his hand, being the out- 
growth of a series of lectures lately delivered by him. 
The pamphlet treats of the relations of libraries to edu- 
cation, in six sub-sections; of school libraries and read- 
ing, in the same number of subordinate chapters ; of the 
university library; and of schools and libraries. The 
references show the author to be a careful reader of 
English and American library literature, and no stranger 
to German and French. 



NOTES. 



A book on " Enjoyment of Poetry," by Mr. Max 
Eastman, is announced by Messrs. Scribner. 

An account of " The Life and Times of Calvin " by 
L. Penning, a Dutch writer, will be published immedi- 
ately by Messrs. E. P. Dtton & Co. 

Mr. Bliss Carman is engaged in the preparation of an 
" Oxford Book of American Verse," planned as a com- 
panion volume to Mr. Quiller-Couch's well-known 
anthology of English poetry. 

Mark Twain's life in Bermuda has been made the 
subject of a volume by Miss Elizabeth Wallace, which 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. announce under the title, 
" Mark Twain and the Happy Island." 

" English Criticism " by Professor J. W. H. Atkins, 
and " English Dramatic Poetry " by Professor Felix 
Schelling, are two important volumes soon to appear in 
Messrs. Button's "Channels of English Literature" series. 

Mr. Humfrey Jordan, who will be remembered as 
author of "The Joyous Wayfarer," one of the most 
distinctive of last year's novels, has completed a new 
story entitled "Patchwork Comedy," which Messrs. 
Putnam will publish late this month. 

Another of Mr. John Masefield's long narrative poems 
is the principal feature of " The English Review " for 
February. "The Daffodil Fields" is its title. An 
interesting discussion of " Phonetics and Poetry," by 
Mr. Lascelles Abercrombie, also appears in this issue. 

" The Price of Inefficiency," by Mr. Frank Koester, 
is an analysis and criticism of our national conditions, 
to be published this spring by the Sturgis & Walton Co. 
This firm has also in press a new novel by Mr. John 
Fleming Wilson, entitled "The Princess of Sorry 
Valley." 

Charles Major, a novelist of wide popular repute, died 
at his home in Shelbyville, Ind., on February 13. His 
first book, " When Knighthood Was in Flower," had an 
enormous sale at the time of its publication, fifteen years 
ago. Eight novels have appeared from his pen since 
that time. 

Mr. John Muir's " Story of My Boyhood and Youth," 
which has been the most interesting of recent "Atlantic " 
features, will be published in book form this month by 
Houghton Miffiin Co. This house has also in press a 
new volume by Mr. Enos A. Mills, to be entitled " In 
Beaver World." 

Three books of serious interest soon to be published 
by Mr. B. W. Huebsch are the following: " The Dis- 
covery of the Future," by Mr. H. G. Wells; " Syndi- 
calism, Industrial Unionism, and Socialism," by Mr. 
John Spargo; and "The Truth about Socialism," by 
Mr. Allan L. Benson. 

In Mr. James Huneker's forthcoming volume, " The 
Pathos of Distance: A Book of a Thousand and One 
Moments," will be discussed such subjects as "The Later 
George Moore," " The Celtic Awakening," " In Praise 
of Fireworks," " The Artist and His Wife," and "Brown- 
ing among his Books." 

"The Drift of Romanticism," a new series (the 
eighth) of Mr. Paul Elmer More's " Shelburne Essays," 
is announced for early issue by Houghton Mifflin Co. 
Other books of literary interest to be published this 
spring by the same house are the following : " The En- 
glish Lyric," by Professor Felix A. Schelling; "Youth 
and Life," a collection of " Atlantic " essays by Mr. 
Randolph S. Bourne; "Goethe's Key to Faust," by Mr.

William Page Andrews; and " Strange Stories from the 
Lodge of Leisures," translated from the Chinese by 
Mr. George Soulid. 

The Committee on Research Institute is collecting in- 
formation about bibliographical material and indexes kept 
in manuscript by libraries and individuals. Those who 
have in their possession or know of the whereabouts of any 
such material, are asked to communicate with Mr. Aksel 
G. S. Josephson, care the John Crerar Library, Chicago. 

Two volumes by the late John Bascom, for many 
years a frequent contributor to THE DIAL, are an- 
nounced for spring publication by Messrs. Putnam. 
One of these, entitled " Things Learned by Living," 
is a sort of spiritual biography of a life lived on the 
highest intellectual and ethical levels; the other book 
is a collection of " Sermons and Addresses." 

The April number of the "American Historical 
Review " (Macmillan) will contain the full text of the 
address on " History as Literature " which Colonel 
Roosevelt delivered on December 27 before the Ameri- 
can Historical Association as president of that body; as 
well as the papers read before the same association by 
Mr. Charles Francis Adams, Professor J. W. Thomp- 
son, and Professor W. E. Dodd. 

Among the more important books on the Spring list 
of Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. are the following: "All

A Small Boy and Others B y Henry James 

PFitk photogravure frontispiece. 8vo. $2.50 net; postage extra. 

"A Small Boy" is one of the most charming pieces of autobiography imaginable, as 
might be expected from a master of expression and character turning back to describe that 
part of life which furnishes the most permanent of all impressions. It is the story of Henry 
James's own boyhood, and the little figure of himself, which he sees with characteristic 
detachment, yet with a distinctly affectionate interest, is as happily depicted and realized as 
any he has ever drawn. 

If Mr. James has ever written any little masterpiece better than this, which is doubtful, 
he has certainly never written any more sympathetic, more attractive, and, finally, more 
entertaining. 

The PathoS Of Distance By James Huneker 

A BOOK OF A THOUSAND AND ONE MOMENTS 

$2.OO net; postage extra. 

This volume is a veritable kaleidoscope of literary color and form. Nietzsche's phrase, 
which the author takes for a title, suggests poetically its material: papers written at various 
periods of a brilliant career and having the mellow tone of time. Like the author's 
"Promenades of an Impressionist," "The Pathos of Distance" is largely concerned with 
art. But there is much more. Some of the titles are '-'The Later George Moore," "The 
Celtic Awakening," "In Praise of Fireworks," "The Artist and His Wife," "Browning 
Among his Books." 

Plays by Bjornstjerne Bjornson 

'The New System," ''The Gauntlet," "Beyond Human Power." Translated, with 

an Introduction, by EDWIN BlORKMAN. 

Portrait. $1.50 net; postage extra. 

These plays have never before been published in English, and are the most important of 
Bjornson's dramatic writings. Intensely modern in their spirit, and treating of the social and 
even commercial problems of to-day in their ethical aspects, they are restrained and almost 
classical in form. 

"The Gauntlet" deals with the question of a similar moral standard for both sexes, " The 
New System" with the distinction _ between personal and business morals, 

"Beyond Human Power" with the ^T-V-T^ power of one man's will over another.

Enjoyment of Poetry By Max Eastman 

Formerly lecturer on " The Psychology of Beauty" at Columbia University 
I2mo. $1.25 net; postage extra. 

The poetic impulse in perception, in conversation, and in literature is one and the same. 
It is the impulse to realize. The author distinguishes this from the practical impulse, which 
is to achieve, or adapt oneself to an environment. He traces these two impulses and illustrates 
them in the very beginnings of experience, in the play of children, in the origin and growth of 
language, in slang and profanity, in everyday conversation, and finally in books of poetry and 
science.

IMPORTANT NEW SPRING BOOKS 



The New Book by the Author of ONE WAY OUT (now in its Seventh Edition) 



f nr Olrl By WILLIAM CARLETON 

lOl V/IU Author of "One Way Out" 



William Carleton, in "One Way Out," told only half his story. As his business pros- 
pered, he bought a farm, and in the country village ran up against another set of conditions 
which surprised him, but which he proceeded to tackle in the same spirit which won success 
for him as an emigrant to the slums. He found the town asleep and began, as he expressed 
it, "to blow the resurrection trumpet." He made a live town of it and incidentally made it 
a big paying proposition. 

Perhaps few books have appeared at what is so clearly the opportune time. Community 
cooperation, rural and urban, is the method by which the movement for efficiency in country 
life is expected to realize itself. "New Lives for Old" is the expression of the spirit and the 
practice of co-operation. 

The director of the school of agriculture in an important American university calls the book 
"the most helpful contribution yet made to the revival of agricultural interest." 

A man about to take up a homestead in the Northwest writes: "It is impossible for me 
to tell you of the great inspiration and good I have gained from reading ' New Lives for Old.' 
When up in that new country I know it will help me make the success that I'm going to make." 

"Mr. Carleton bought a tumbled-down old house with fifty acres of land attached and 
undertook its regeneration. He did more than this he got at the root of the reason why 
'farming doesn't pay' and he isn't afraid to say why. Read and you will get a new view of 
farm conditions." Detroit Free Press. $1.20 net; by mail, $1.35.

nis' is fresh and fragrant as a cottage-garden, smelling of honesty and heartsease and

THE general reader and the busy man who- can spare but little time to devote to 
books will find in these carefully chosen volumes of extracts useful Introductions to 
Authors of perennial interest. Though the number of reprints of standard authors is 
large, it is only in the REGENT LIBRARY that what may be -called the continuity of 
Authorship is preserved by the system of "links" which indicate the nature and the 
bulk of the work from which the selections are made. The volumes form veritable 
introductions to the authors treated, and are indispensable companion volumes to the 
ENGLISH MEN OF LETTERS and the GREAT WRITERS series. Every fact of importance 
in their lives and works will be found referred to. Outside complete editions of any 
author, no other volumes of selections will be found to give so much material and 
information. Biographical details, a handy Biography and Iconography, together with 
expert criticisms of famous literary men, make each volume a complete presentation of 
the author covered.

IMPORTANT BOOKS 



Francesco Petrarca and the Revolution of Cola di Rienzo 

A STUDY IN THE HISTORY OF ROME DURING THE MIDDLE AGES 

By MARIO EMILIO COSENZA 
Instructor in Latin in the College of the City of New York. 

In these pages the author draws a picture of Petrarch as a statesman. He has chosen for special treatment Petrarch's relations 
with Cola di Rienzo, because they constitute a story that is virtually a chapter in the history of Rome during the Middle Ages. 
The material of the present volume is drawn chiefly from Petrarch's letters, from the extremely important correspondence of 
Cola di Rienzo, and from the equally important archives of the Roman church. Nearly all of this material is new to the English 
language. The notes have been made detailed enough to make clear Petrarch's allusions. 

355 pages, 12mo, cloth. $1. 50. Postpaid $1. 60. 



American Poems 



Selected and edited, with illustrative and explanatory notes and bibliographies, by 
WALTER C. BRONSON, Professor of English Literature, Brown University. 

The book offers a most carefully chosen and well-balanced presentation of the poetic works of Americans, covering the entire period 
of our history. For the teacher as well as the student the value of the work is greatly enhanced by the comprehensive Notes, 
Bibliography, Glossary, and Index. It is believed that the book will have the wide popularity of Mr. Bronson's earlier collection, 
ENGLISH POEMS, which has been adopted by all leading American colleges.

1913] THE DIAL, 221 

THE TRUE THOUGHT OF MARRIAGE 

By JOHN MILTON SCOTT 

Author of "Kindly Light in Prayer and Praise," of which Rev. Heber Newton, D.D., writes: 

" The poems illustrate the right oi the author to bear the noble name of John 
Milton. One cannot criticise these poems. They are beyond criticism." 

In this day and age, in which there is so much discussion, dissension and shadow thrown upon so important a subject as 
that of Marriage and the home, this is a timely and worthy word in its defense. 

In this booklet the author beautifully portrays the purpose, the truth and the sanctity of the true marriage. 

It is brimming over with words of truth for the thirsty and of guidance for those astray ; a helping hand to the weak and 
weary is extended therein ; and wise counsel is given to the misinformed. It is practical as well as idealistic. 

The final word is a beautiful poem entitled, " Elizabeth," written in the author's best vein, which alone is-worth more than 
the price of the booklet. 

The price is 15 cents per copy, or two for 25 cents.

AN EXECUTIVE OF LETTERS. 

Commenting upon the election of M. Poincare 
to the Presidency of the French Republic, the 
London "Nation" wrote the other day as fol- 
lows: "Thus the Republic makes choice of a 
citizen eminently in accord with its ideals, and 
singularly fitted to represent and adorn its 
standard of manners. It will now be the legi- 
timate boast of the intellectual Frenchman that 
the titular head of his State is also a member 
of the Academy." How many Americans, we 
wonder, are acquainted with the fact that these 
words are literally applicable to the man who for 
some ten days past has filled the exalted office 
of President of the United States? And of 
those who are somehow dimly aware that there 
is such a body as the American Academy of 
Arts and Letters, and that Mr. Wilson is a 
member thereof by virtue of his distinction in 
letters, how many realize the significance of the 
latter fact for our culture as a nation, and for 
our standing in the eyes of that section of man- 
kind which appreciates intellectual distinction 
and has a just sense of human values? It is 
now the legitimate boast of the intellectual 
American, as of the Frenchman, " that the 
titular head of his State is also a member of the 
Academy." We have long been assured by 
pessimists that there was no use in hoping for 
certain desirable things under our system of 
government that the Constitution, for example, 
was practically unamendable, that the machinery 
for removing from the bench a corrupt judge 
was practically unworkable, and that the highest 
office in our gift could not possibly be bestowed 
upon the sort of American who stood in the 
opinion of the elect as the finest embodiment 
of our national idealism. Thirty years ago, it 
was frequently remarked by those who believed 
James Russell Lowell to be the first of Amer- 
icans then living that under no conceivable cir- 
cumstances could he, or any man of his type, 
become the chief magistrate of the nation. Well, 
the kaleidoscope of politics has made realities of 
all three of those impossibilities during the space 
of a year, and in the choice of a President the 
most seemingly impossible of them all. Let it 
not be said lightly after this that the American 
people is so hampered by the machinery of its 
own creating as to be unable to put into effect 
its own deeper purposes. 



224 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



The writings of the Presidents of the United 
States have been collected by the industry of 
historians into imposing sets of volumes that 
fill many feet of shelving in all our large libra- 
ries. No "five-foot shelf" of culture could ac- 
commodate more than a small fraction of these 
books. Most of their contents, to be sure, are 
innocent of the tincture of letters, and we know 
how Charles Lamb would have classified them. 
The "works" of Madison and of Polk and of 
Buchanan and of McKinley may not even re- 
motely be associated with literature, and are 
valuable only for their biographers and the his- 
torians of their periods. But in the Sahara of 
the mass of Presidential writings there are scat- 
tered oases for the reader's refreshment. In the 
recorded words of Washington and Jefferson 
there is something more than material for 
history. There are passages which strike the 
hu man note, and have the validity of literature 
because they transcend the conditions under 
which they were produced. The writings of 
Lincoln contain purple patches of wisdom 
adorned with style for which nothing less than 
the inspiration of genius can account. The 
epic of the Civil War, as unfolded in Grant's 
memoirs, was awarded very high praise for its 
purely literary value by no less a critic than 
Matthew Arnold. The volume of Mr. Roose- 
velt's writings is so great, and so respectable, 
if not distinguished, in quality, as to give their 
author a recognized place in American litera- 
ture, and win for him an election to the 
Academy, thus making him a sharer in the 
distinction of our present Executive. Never- 
theless, Mr. Wilson is a man of letters in a 
more absolute sense than any of his predeces- 
sors. He won his spurs as a modest scholar and 
teacher, before political preferment appeared 
on his horizon, and no accident of adventitious 
rank, but his own intrinsic abilities, made pub- 
lishers and editors seek out and solicit his work. 

President Wilson once wrote an essay on 
Bagehot, whom he called "A Literary Politi- 
cian," defining the term as "the man who has 
the genius to see deep into affairs, and the dis- 
cretion to keep out of them." He has not been 
discreet enough to live up to this definition, but 
the indiscretion may be imputed to him for right- 
eousness, and the hobgoblin of inconsistency in 
this matter is not likely to cause him sleepless 
nights. Elsewhere in the same context, he 
enlarges upon his definition. "The literary 
politician, let it be distinctly said, is a very fine, 
a very superior species of the man thoughtful. 
He reads books as he would listen to men talk. 



He stands apart, and looks on, with humorous, 
sympathetic smile, at the play of policies. He 
will tell you for the asking what the players 
are thinking about. He divines at once how the 
parts are cast. He knows beforehand what 
each act is to discover. He might readily guess 
what the dialogue is to contain. Were you short 
of scene-shifters, he could serve you admirably 
in an emergency. And he is a better critic of 
the play than the players." In this genial 
description, Mr. Wilson has given us his own 
characterization, although he would be the last 
person in the world to style himself "a very 
superior species of the man thoughtful." But 
his friends will insist that this is no less true of 
him than all the rest. And he can do nothing 
else that will so dignify and exalt his office as 
the bringing into the discharge of its duties the 
objectivity and the fine detachment that are the 
attributes of his ideal literary politician. An 
emergency has pressed him into the service of 
scene-shifting, and we expect him to prove equal 
to the occasion. "New occasions bring new 
duties," says the poet, but we cannot conceive 
that in the present instance the duties will be 
really new. Rather will they be the practical 
expression of old duties long held theoretically 
sacred, and now to be performed for the service 
of his fellow-countrymen in the spirit in which 
he has been urging them all his life. 

In the man of letters as executive we have 
the fullest confidence. Examples may be mul- 
tiplied, all the way back to Tyrtaeus. Fire- 
stricken San Francisco and the new-born 
Portuguese republic have alike, in our own 
time, entrusted the chief executive function to 
a poet, and had no occasion to regret their action. 
Lord Morley and Lord Haldane are shining 
present-day examples of the man of letters in 
high executive office. And not the least of the 
satisfactions with which we acclaim a member 
of the American Academy as President is that 
of feeling assured that he will be able to give 
impressive literary expression to his purposes 
and policies, that we may expect from him for 
the next four years a series of state papers of 
whose felicitous quality the Inaugural of last 
week gives us a pleasant foretaste. That first 
address of the new President to the American 
people offers indeed a striking illustration of 
the sort of distinction that we have a right to 
expect from an executive of literary instincts 
and training. For the simple sincerity and 
the restrained passion with which it pleads for 
social justice it will be remembered and cher- 
ished long after its author has passed away.

THE DIAL

ALL-AMERICA VS. ALL-ENGLAND IN 
MODERN LITERATURE. 

Literature, in many respects, is a game of skill; 
and all games have to be decided by the prowess of 
opposed champions. The rivals must be brought 
together ; the runners must stretch away to the goal, 
the cricketers play their match, the chess players 
bend over the board. It is of course difficult to 
make such individual or concerted tests among the 
champions of literature; but a system of parallels 
may do something to enable us to award the wreath. 
Such parallels, in the briefest form, between the 
contending powers of English and American litera- 
ture during the middle half of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, is what I venture to propose. 

Precedence for the prophets! Due libation and 
invocation to Carlyle and Emerson! I suppose the 
final estimate of the value of these two writers 
must be subjective. It must depend on whether 
the reader is attuned to pessimism or optimism, 
whether he prefers humanity bodied forth in the 
awful struggle of life, or the dim-haunting presences 
and thin oracular voices of the gods. Carlyle always 
knew what he meant and wanted. His energy con- 
centrated in the intense, jagged lightning flash, 
which eats up the impurities of the air, but perhaps 
prostrates some giant tree or kills some master of 
the herd. Emerson is so eclectic in his likings that 
when you balance all his contradictions there is left 
a tabula rasa. He is like the summer lightning, 
which flares and fades and does no harm. Em- 
erson, however, has that perfection of phrase which 
carries so far. If his philosophy is uncertain, his 
expression is clear. Nietzsche, for example, may 
possibly have taken his idea of the Superman from 
Carlyle's hero worship and adoration of brute force, 
but he gives no sign of the indebtedness ; whereas it 
is recorded that he usually had a volume of Emerson 
at hand. On the whole, I think that this first con- 
test for place between England and America must 
be accounted a draw. 

Not so the struggle between the two foremost dis- 
ciples of these men between Ruskin and Thoreau. 
Both of these last were apostles of nature rather than 
of humanity. They perhaps knew nature equally 
well. But Thoreau knew her as an Indian does, inti- 
mately and of necessity ; Ruskin like a college pro- 
fessor with encyclopdias and sciences and arts at 
the back of his head. Both were ascetics, men of 
the hermit type ; but Thoreau yielded to the cenobitic 
discipline, while Ruskin fought against it and tried 
to make himself useful to his fellows. Their basic 
philosophy, contempt for the things of this world, 
was the same. But the wild tang and original flavor 
of Thoreau is nothing compared with the richness, 
the variety, the ever changing wealth of earthly wine 
and viands and heavenly nectar which is in Ruskin. 
England scores heavily in this comparison. 

Turn now to the two poetic puzzles of the last 
century Browning and Whitman. Of Browning's 



intellectual force there can be no question. He had 
enough wit, wisdom, subtlety, resources of knowledge, 
to have made him a leader in almost any field of 
active life. And Whitman's emotional gift, his 
oratorical exuberance, above all his profound belief 
in himself, might have made him a great religious 
power, the founder of a faith. But both elected to 
write poetry, and tried by the canons of that art it 
seems to me that they only slenderly succeeded. 
However, they have the right of sanctuary in the 
hearts of their admirers, who account them the 
greatest poets of their age, and I leave to such admir- 
ers the decision as to which is the best. 

From that Perkin Warbeck and this Jack Cade 
of literature I turn to the true Princes of the Purple 
Line. First on the roll come Tennyson and Poe. 
They rose together, in poetry at least they wrought 
on similar lines, they admired each other's art. Poe 
said that Tennyson was the most perfect poet who 
had ever lived ; and Tennyson called Poe the prince 
of American poets. In mere verse, indeed, Poe would 
be overwhelmed by the immense mass of his rival's 
work, even though his own slender product may have 
a more rare and original strain. But Poe's prose is 
equivalent to poetry, and it is by his prose that he 
has conquered the world ; whereas Tennyson's verse 
seems to be utterly ineffective outside the limits of 
the English-speaking race. He has had no apparent 
influence on the Continent, has bred no imitators 
there. He is so entirely English, so peculiarly the 
product of his Victorian environment, that he carries 
no appeal to the revolutionary-minded European. 
Perhaps he may have his revenge some day when 
his sweetness and charm, his ideals of decency and 
law, his Virgilian reverence for the deities of the 
hearth and field, may again attract the world. At 
present, however, Poe seems the greater man. 

Arnold and Lowell are like the greater and the 
lesser Ajax fighting behind one shield. Which is 
which, however, it would be pretty hard to say. 
Lowell is the richer and more radiant, Arnold the 
deeper and more poignant. In criticism Arnold is 
the law-giver and Lowell the appreciator. Coleridge 
and Hazlitt are their analogues. In poetry the sing- 
ing god only entered into Lowell occasionally. This 
god was always with Arnold; but was so checked, 
driven, beaten back by Arnold's circumstances and 
character of mind that he had scant chance to do 
himself justice. I think, on the whole, that the 
balance of greatness inclines towards Arnold's side. 

Mrs. Browning and Longfellow were popular 
poets, but they lifted popular poetry to a level of 
distinction if not of supremacy. I should, I think, 
cast my vote for the lady ; but in popular poetry 
the opinion of the people counts, and the author of 
" Voices of the Night " and " Evangeline " must be 
at the head of the poll. 

It is difficult to find a parallel for Rossetti in our 
literature. Perhaps we must hark back to Bryant 
to find a writer with an equal conciseness of phrase 
and stateliness of air ; though Bryant's austerity set 



226 



THE DIAL, 



[March 16, 



against Rossetti's luxuriance makes the comparison 
a little ridiculous. The American poet seems to me 
the more permanent power of the two. 

Christina Rossetti and Aldrich are rivals and fair 
equals in the short lyric. Aldrich has more of airy 
grace ; Miss Rossetti more of profound emotion. 

Swinburne must range unchecked across the 
field. Our technicians, Bayard Taylor and Stedman 
and Lanier, would be no match for him were they 
multiplied a dozen-fold. 

Turning now to the novel, Dickens lifts himself 
so above the age in mass and power that it is im- 
possible to find any American to oppose him. Per- 
haps with Irving and Bret Harte together an attempt 
might be made to do so. Irving is anterior, and 
Bret Harte is in some respects a pupil of Dickens. 
The former cannot compete in variety or creative 
force, but a few of his masterpieces have a classic per- 
fection which Dickens hardly reached. And Dickens 
learned a great many of his secrets from the older 
man. Irving revealed England to Dickens before 
the latter revealed it to us. As for Bret Harte, 
Carlyle thought him superior to Dickens in their 
kind of work. This is hardly so ; but if the Amer- 
ican gained much from his master, he repaid the 
debt by creating a school to which a good many of 
the best recent English writers of fiction belong. 

If we assort Hawthorne with Thackeray we shall 
have a pair of opposites. On one side there is the 
tragedian, Puritan, man of solitude ; on the other, 
the comedian, churchman, and man of the clubs. 
The only thing in which they are alike is a pure and 
easy style, in each case impregnated with person- 
ality. To say which is the greater might be vain, 
but few will dispute that they are equal. 

The Bronte sisters rule a realm apart in romance. 
The light in their books seems to come up from the 
ground, as though the hills of the fairies had opened 
and those uncanny creatures had come forth to make 
their luminous rings on the grass. They have no 
real analogues in America, where passion has been 
so severely let alone. Perhaps the world of Herman 
Melville is as remote and enchanted in its own way. 
His credit is but slight compared with their fame, 
but " Typee " and " Moby Dick " will endure. 

Cooper is the largest, the most wide-ranging 
American novelist. I have reserved him to oppose 
to Trollope because of a certain practical and prosaic 
turn of mind in each. They both produce strong 
effects with apparently little artistic instinct or in- 
clination. The American is, however, immeasur- 
ably the greater, both as a creator of character and 
as the painter of scenic wonders. Trollope received 
both his art and his subject matter by inheritance 
from Jane Austen. If he is sturdier than she is, he 
is also less fine. But Cooper only took his methods 
from Scott. His matter is novel ; it is larger 
and intrinsically more fascinating than that of his 
master. 

So much for the imaginative writers. Coming 
to the historians, the balance is against America, 



mainly because of Macaulay's prepotent cleverness 
of phrase. Prescott, Parkman, and Motley could 
outwrite Froude and Freeman, but Macaulay is too 
vivid for them. Here again in subject matter the 
Americans have all the advantage. Macaulay's 
history hardly unfolds one of the great stories of 
the world. It is conceivable that it may cease to 
interest, however illuminated by his festal fireworks. 
But the conquests of Cortez and Pizarro, the deeds 
of the North American explorers and adventurers, 
the struggle of the Netherlands with Spain, have a 
stamp of wonder and splendor on them which must 
always attract, though they are only adequately and 
not brilliantly set forth by our historians. 

There are many other writers who range by the 
side or in the rear of those I have named. But 
these are enough for a comparative judgment. It 
seems to me that the American product about equals 
the English. This is not the general view, even in 
our country. In our clear air the reverberation of 
English fame has been overwhelming. In fact, it 
is a fault with us that we open our ears to foreign 
voices and shut them to domestic accents. The echo 
of American reputations, on the contrary, has always 
had a difficulty in making way against the density 
of English fog and insular self-assertion. The 
power of a literary past is also with the modern 
English writers. Each one of them, as it were, 
has Shakespeare and Milton, Burns and Byron, 
at his back. So it is hard to compete with them on 
their own ground. On the continent, however, at 
least three of our men, Poe, Emerson, and Cooper, 
are more widely read and appreciated than any of 
their English rivals. It is certainly our business 
in America to stand up for our own if we can do 
this without gross folly or favoritism. 

There is one fact that makes American literary 
success stand out fiery bright and that is the scant 
measure of material reward it has achieved. For 
all the higher sort of abilities, whether in war, states- 
manship, or letters, we in America have always been 
bargain-hunters, we have got our great men as 
cheap as possible. The reverse has been the case 
in England. Exact figures are of course lacking, 
but it is probable that Dickens, Bulwer Lytton, 
Macaulay, and Tennyson each received close on to 
a million dollars for his work in life. With the 
single exception of Mark Twain, it is doubtful if 
any American author of high rank ever made a 
tithe of this amonnt. Even the less popular English 
authors have been exceedingly well paid. Thack- 
eray accumulated a comfortable fortune. Ruskin 
could have got and probably did get large sums for 
his writings. Trollope and George Eliot received 
immense material rewards. In this view, and con- 
sidering also the incredible and preposterous rewards 
of business men and inventors flaunted in their faces, 
American writers have done extremely well and 
have exhibited a self-devotion and self-sacrifice 
almost unparalleled in literature.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE EPISTOLARY ART is now not uncommonly 
numbered among the lost arts. The reason of its 
decline, if there has really been such decline, may 
perhaps be partly found in what Mr. Leonard Porter 
Ayres, a statistician of the Russell Sage Foundation, 
has to say concerning the vocabulary of present-day 
letter-writing. It appears that this vocabulary is 
surprisingly meagre. Tabulations covering about 
twenty-four thousand words show an employment of 
only two thousand and one different words, of which 
forty-three are used so often as to constitute a full 
half of all the words tabulated. The pronoun of the 
first person achieves a record of nearly eleven hun- 
dred, and, contrary to all expectations, the word 
" soap " far outstrips the word "love" in frequency. 
Surely we must be a hard and prosaic generation, 
to judge from the statistician's findings. But let us 
console ourselves with the belief that the batch of 
letters examined by him was not up to our average 
in richness of thought and felicity of expression. 
There is no good reason why we should not write 
as delightful letters as were ever penned ; in fact, it 
would not be difficult to find reasons why our letter- 
writing ought to excel that of former generations. 
Just wherein we fail has been pointed out, or the 
attempt has been made to point it out, often enough; 
but after all is said and done, the letter-writer, like 
the poet, is born, not made ; and his letters can flout 
all the rules laid down for epistolary composition, 
and yet be works of art. Is it alleged that our pres- 
ent style lacks dignity, shows too much indulgence 
in trivialities? Turn, then, to Sydney Smith and 
see how amusingly he can handle trivialities. In a 
letter to Lady Holland he begins thus : " I am sorry 
to hear Allen is not well; but the reduction of his 
legs is a pure and unmixed good; they are enormous, 
they are clerical! He has the creed of a philoso- 
pher and the legs of a clergyman ; I never saw such 
legs, at least, belonging to a layman." Or is the 
objection raised that our epistolary style tends to 
formality and stiffness ? Consider for a moment the 
style of Anna Seward, the "Swan of Lichfield" 
her correspondence in six volumes is easily accessible. 
Here are two sentences from a letter of hers to Dr. 
Parr: "Disease gloomed, and made long my wintry 
and vernal hours, since I had the honour and delight 
of conversing with you in Warwickshire. . . . Often 
in the absence from our little city, do I look back with 
home-sickness to my umbrageous retreat beneath its 
spires, especially when the swart star glares." Dr. 
Johnson's high opinion of this gifted lady is well 
known. If, again, it be urged that letters now are 
too curt and businesslike and matter-of-fact, what, 
we ask, could be more curt and businesslike than 
David's letter to Joab concerning Uriah the Hittite, 
sent by the hand of Uriah himself ? This early and 
famous example of the epistolary art runs as follows: 
"Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, 
and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and 



die." The fault of the feeble or futile or otherwise 
wretched specimen of letter-writing lies in the letter- 
writer himself ; but plenty of good, incisive, humor- 
ous, fanciful letters are written in these days, only 
they very seldom get into print. The more pointed 
and personal and therefore spicy and enjoyable they 
are, the less adapted are they to publication. 


FREAKS OF LANGUAGE furnish matter for endless 
debate and comment of a more or less learned philo- 
logical sort, and as all are users of language the dis- 
cussion of these linguistic vagaries is of universal 
interest. Professor Lounsbury's remarks on Ameri- 
canisms ("What Americanisms Are Not") in the 
current "Harper's Magazine" will please all good 
Americans who like to believe that they speak En- 
glish, and very good English, whatever our cousins 
across the water may say to the contrary. In the 
English mind there seems to be a tendency to brand 
contemptuously as an Americanism any term or 
phrase that for the moment strikes the ear with an 
unwelcome unfamiliarity, or appears otherwise 
objectionable; and the makers of dictionaries of 
so-called Americanisms too often encourage this 
tendency. The Yale professor gives some glaring 
instances of the way these innocent offenders "have 
been shoveled into vocabularies of terms assumed to 
be peculiar to this country." His first example is 
"female," which as a matter of fact many American 
readers must have noted as occurring with rather 
tiresome frequency in Victorian fiction of even the 
most distinguished English authorship. Professor 
Lounsbury might have included in his list the word 
"commence," which Americans have been accused 
of using in foolish preference to "begin." If we 
sin in this, we sin in good English company. There 
are other somewhat objectionable usages now pre- 
valent with certain English authors, which perhaps 
a little later, as soon as their irregularity is discov- 
ered, will be fathered upon us. For instance, in 
that excellent novel, " Marriage " (not Miss Ferrier's 
romance), the phrase "aren't I?" is put into the 
mouth of the hero, a man of education and the holder 
of a professorship; and it is to be found in other 
English authors of the present time. In the books 
of the popular writer who has immortalized the 
Five Towns in fiction, the preposition "off" for the 
more usual "of" or "from" is to be found more 
than once, as in the expression, to buy something 
"off" a person. Some morning we shall wake up to 
find ourselves accused of distorting "am not" into 
"aren't" and of invariably substituting "off" for 
"of." 



WHAT THEY READ IN OREGON ought not to be 
very different from what they read in Maine. The 
two Portlands are good representative American 
cities, and the three thousand miles separating them 
do not mean a like sundering of interests. Never- 
theless, eastern readers and others may like to hear 
from the officials of the Library Association of Port- 
land, Oregon, something about the reading habits 



228 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



of the people of Multnomah County, over which that 
growing institution now extends its activities. In 
light reading, the most popular author appears to be 
Dickens, with Victor Hugo, Dumas, Mark Twain, 
and Bulwer Lytton following on his heels. Of 
almost equal popularity, reports the librarian, are 
Jane Austen (who would have thought it ?), Mr. 
Kipling, Mr. Owen Wister, Dr. Weir Mitchell, and 
Charles Reade. Also it is to be noted that the vaca- 
tion privilege of drawing an extra number of books 
for a prolonged period is extended to travelling men 
throughout the year, but " no fiction is included, as 
trains and hotels supply novels generously " which 
cannot be said of eastern trains and hotels, as a rule. 
In selecting books for purchase, the library pursues 
no narrow policy. " Nothing human is foreign to 
us," declares the president of its board of directors ; 
and " whatever has taken literary form, with sin- 
cerity of purpose, may be needed on the shelves of 
a public library. ... A great deal of criticism arises, 
however, when purchases are made of books of fact 
and fiction which can be described as containing 
insurgent thought or audacious inquiry and criticism 
of things as they are. It should be needless to say 
that the library staff has instructions as to the class 
of readers from whose hands certain books should 
be withheld, especially in the case of young or im- 
mature minds, and a careful supervision is kept at 
all times in order to minimize possible harmful 
results." The practical difficulties and inevitable 
embarrassments of such a supervision in a public 
library are at once apparent. The Portland library 
attendants must have unusual tact and wisdom to 
meet these perplexities with credit to themselves 
and to the satisfaction of all concerned. 


THE UNTRANSLATABILITY OF THE BEST LITER- 
ATURE has long been admitted; but the fact that 
much of the study of foreign masterpieces, with 
dictionary and grammar and commentary in hand, 
results in little more real appreciation of their 
peculiar excellences than could be got from transla- 
tions, is less often recognized. While such study is 
necessary and helpful in acquiring full mastery of 
an alien tongue, the learner at first does little more 
than painfully and imperfectly translate the strange 
words into terms, sometimes far from synonymous, 
that he can understand. Of course the real under- 
standing of the text comes only when one is so far 
advanced as unconsciously to think, and perhaps 
even to dream, in the foreign language. Mr. Price 
Collier, in his work on " Germany and the Germans " 
now appearing in " Scribner's," well says of the dif- 
ferent nations of the earth : " Each builds its life in 
words, and the words are as little alike as in the 
days of Babel ; and thus it comes about that we 
misunderstand one another. We translate one 
another only into our own language and understand 
one another as little as before, because we only know 
one another in translations, and the best of the life 
of each nation remains and always will remain un- 



translatable. No one has ever really translated the 
Greek lyrics of the choruses of JEschylus, or the 
incomparable songs of Heine. Who could dream of 
putting the best of Robert Louis Stevenson into Ger- 
man, or Kipling's rollicking ballads of soldier life 
into Spanish, or Walter Pater into Dutch, or Edgar 
Allan Poe into Russian ! " Pater, by the way, came 
of Dutch stock on his father's side, and his books 
would more easily admit of translation into the lan- 
guage of Holland than into some other tongues that 
might be named ; but that does not invalidate the 
argument, which might have been turned to account 
in explaining why -so many of the masterpieces of 
so-called translation such as FitzGerald's " Ru- 
bdiy^t " and Pope's Homer are far from being 
translations at all. . . . 

A LIBRARY "WAITING LIST" may not have one 
established meaning throughout the library world, 
but its meaning at the Grand Rapids Public Library 
is interestingly explained by Mr. Ranck, the libra- 
rian, in his current Report. When requests for 
books not in the library are received, he tells us, 
the books are first of all looked up in the "waiting 
list," which is a card-catalogue of works desirable, 
but not immediately purchasable for lack of funds. 
"There are now," we read, "more than 10,000 
volumes on this 'waiting list,' nearly all of them 
desirable for our shelves according to our best infor- 
mation, provided we had the money to pay for them. 
This list is referred to and used constantly in order- 
ing books from publishers' remainder catalogues, 
books for which there is a sudden special demand, 
etc. Those purchased in this way from remainder 
catalogues we usually get at half or less than half 
the original price. The money thus saved more 
than pays for the work of maintaining this list, 
which at the same time is used in so many other 
ways. For many of the requests, no information 
regarding the publisher or price can be found, and 
on calling up the requester it is frequently learned 
that there is no certainty as to the author and title, 
and therefore the Department is wholly in the 
dark. For all books requested, the Library endeav- 
ors to find reviews in standard periodicals or get 
information from other reliable sources, where it is 
learned that many of these books are trivial, inac- 
curate as to facts, or vicious. Cards noting these 
facts are held at the library for our information 
and the information of those making the inquiry." 
This waiting-list system of book-purchase might be 
commended not only to all libraries, but also to all 
individual buyers ; for book-buying, like marriage, 
is often effected in haste, to be repented at leisure. 

PRESIDENT WILSON'S LITERARY STYLE is made 
the subject of interesting comment from the pen of 
Professor Bliss Perry in the March "Century." 
That one who expresses himself in language abound- 
ing in delicate bookish overtones should be quick to 
detect the same subtle harmonies in another, is not 
at all surprising ; and Mr. Wilson, as a man of 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



229 



letters, could hardly have found a more sympathetic 
and appreciative critic than in the present instance. 
Mr. Perry recognizes the coarsening influences to 
which a public man is subjected, and the effect they 
may have even on our new President's graceful and 
felicitous and refined manner of spoken and written 
utterance. Nevertheless he believes that Mr. 
Wilson's best writing is yet to come, while as ad- 
mirable examples of his next best he points to such 
earlier and later essays as " The Truth of the 
Matter," "On Being Human," "Mere Literature," 
" The Author Himself," the papers on Burke, 
Bagehot,and Cleveland, and other scholarly articles. 
As a marked example of one whom the wear and 
tear of high public office refined rather than coars- 
ened, Lincoln is instanced, and the writer continues : 
"Woodrow Wilson is the first professional man of 
letters to become President of the United States. 
No man who has entered the White House since 
Lincoln has been better equipped by character and 
training to ennoble and refine the tone of public 
utterance" which without a doubt now stands in 
crying need of being refined and ennobled. Signi- 
ficant at this time become the words long ago writ- 
ten by Mr. Wilson and now recalled by Mr. Perry : 
" It behooves all minor authors to realize the possi- 
bility of their being discovered some day and exposed 
to the general scrutiny." 



A BUREAU OF GENERAL INFORMATION is what 

the modern public library strives to be, as well as a 
storehouse and distributer of good literature. In 
this attempt the library at Newark, N. J., appears to 
have succeeded more than passably well. Its busi- 
ness branch, already noticed in these columns, has 
within the few years of its existence achieved a fame 
that has gone abroad in the land. After hearing of 
the many and varied demands to which it promptly 
responds in the ordinary course of its day's work, 
one is almost ready to believe that here at last can 
be found, in the person of the alert and resourceful 
attendant in charge, somebody who really knows 
your own business better than you do yourself. 
Stories are told of the most curious and perplexing 
questions asked and answered at this dispensary of 
general and particular information. For example, a 
street in Ohio, city or village unknown, was inquired 
about ; a man in Pennsylvania, residence and occu- 
pation lost in nebulosity, so far as the inquirer was 
concerned, was earnestly sought ; particulars con- 
cerning trolley routes to Boston were desired ; and 
all these, with nobody knows how many other conun- 
drums, were answered with accuracy and despatch. 
Necessarily the store of reference material maps, 
directories, railway time-tables, hotel guides, and so 
on maintained at a library business branch like 
that at Newark is rather different from that to be 
found in the ordinary reference room, and it is per- 
haps a debatable question whether the services ren- 
dered are such as properly may be expected of a 
public library. At all events, the business branch, 
as conducted at Newark, is an extremely useful 



public institution; and until some other provision is 
made for its maintenance, those who resort to it will 
doubtless be glad to have it continued as an offshoot 
of " the people's university." 

REMEMBERING WHAT ONE READS is rapidly be- 
coming an obsolete accomplishment, so multitudinous 
and heterogeneous are the books that we rush through 
in these latter days. Not to remember the matter 
itself, but to remember where it may be found in 
case of need, is getting to be the limit of the burden 
imposed on the memory; and it is this ability to 
direct others to the desired source of information 
that the librarian and the reference-room attendant 
more and more diligently cultivate. The schoolboy 
who, on being asked how many ribs there are in the 
human skeleton, stumbled at the exact number, but 
referred his teacher to the second page in the third 
chapter of the textbook, had already begun to develop 
this useful but not altogether most desirable form of 
memory. At Harvard it has recently been urged 
that the English system of examination at the hands 
of a board of examiners ought to be adopted. At 
Oxford and Cambridge the professor giving the 
course neither sets the examination questions nor 
corrects the papers, so that a larger and more inde- 
pendent command of the subject is encouraged in 
the student than in our own colleges, where not the 
subject itself so much as the instructor's presentation 
of it is regarded as the all-important thing by the 
crammer for examination. But, after all, the slight- 
ness of the connection between mere memory of 
facts, of whatever sort, and real culture, becomes 
apparent to anyone in reviewing his own educational 
experience. . . . 

SERIOUS STUDENTS AND THEIR "SOURCES," that is, 

the printed and manuscript material needed by them 
in their researches, are in this country of magnificent 
distances often widely sundered ; and any system 
of inter-library loans that shall practically diminish 
these distances is to be welcomed. The Librarian of 
Congress contributes some words of weight on the 
subject of "Libraries and the Investigator" to the 
March "North American Review," calling attention 
to the comparative fewness of valuable special col- 
lections accessible to the public in the United States, 
their unsystematic development, and their very irreg- 
ular geographic distribution. While more than two- 
thirds of the population lie west of the Alleghenies, 
only about one-eighth of the important working libra- 
ries are situated within this vast region. There is, 
naturally enough, a huddling of these institutions on 
the Atlantic seaboard. But a perfect inter-library 
loan system would do much to equalize disparities; 
and the Library of Congress, since its removal into 
its present quarters, and especially since its present 
librarian's assumption of its superintendence, has 
led the way in the practice of a liberal and widely 
beneficent policy in this respect. It now hopefully 
awaits a more general following of its example, and 
the inauguration of a more thorough-going parcel- 
post system to diminish the expense of a nation-wide 



230

exchange of library books in the interest of serious 
students and specialists. Significant and reassuring 
is the fact, noted by Mr. Putnam, that not one book 
has been lost of the many that have been sent out 
from the library under his charge to distant appli- 
cants. The risk, then, and even the present expense 
involved in the inter-library loan system are negli- 
gible as compared with the accruing benefits. 



A GIGANTIC LEXICOGRAPHICAL UNDERTAKING 1*8 

proposed by a number of English scholars of emi- 
nence. At the great congress of historians to be 
held next month in London, it is expected that co- 
operation will be solicited for the preparation of a 
dictionary of mediaeval Latin. Dr. Murray, of the 
great Oxford Dictionary, and his colleagues and 
others are bestirring themselves in the matter, and 
an invitation will probably be extended to history 
workers in all countries to lend their aid in the 
great enterprise, whose magnitude becomes apparent 
when one considers the mass of mediaeval literature 
written in a decidedly corrupt Latin between the 
fall of Rome and the Renaissance. A lifetime 
devoted to the reading of this mountain of books on 
theology, law, medicine, philosophy, science, history, 
and other subjects, would make but slight impression 
on it. Hence the need of extensive collaboration 
and of rather minute subdivision of the labor. 
The standard work in this field of lexicography has 
hitherto been that of DuCange (1678), of which the 
latest edition appeared in 1883-7, a monumental 
work and a credit to its compiler's industry and 
scholarship. But modern standards call for a more 
rigorous and thorough treatment of the whole sub- 
ject. If the project is carried through, there will 
be added one more to the already considerable list 
of scholarly and useful reference works undertaken 
from the pure love of the task itself and in the 
sustaining hope of producing something that shall 
be of benefit to others, in soscula sceculorum. 

THE INDISPENSABILITY OF THE PRINTED WORD, 

and of that store-house and disseminator of the 
printed word, the public library, is emphasized by 
Mr. John Cotton Dana in his ever fresh and stim- 
ulating monthly publication, "The Newarker." 
Forecasting the "Educational System of Newark in 
1924," he predicts for the library "a very large 
influence as a universal, ever-present educational in- 
centive and aid," and continues: "Teaching always 
falls back at last upon the page of print. Most 
people to-day say they care little for books and ask 
to be shown, and at the same time to be told. So 
soldiers are taught; so were taught the slaves who 
toiled by thousands at the building of the pyramids. 
So to-day are taught the men with the shovel and 
the hoe. The green hand in the factory must see 
and touch his lathe and chuck and pulley, and be 
told by spoken words their uses before he can be 
trusted to mind the machine before him. But this 
is a busy world; most men must be always doing, 
and few can be spared in office or store or shop or 



factory to point out the obvious and to repeat the 
ancient rules in the ears of listening dullards. And 
so he who in the pernicious pride of his own dullness 
is waiting to be shown, is outstripped by him who 
not only looks and listens, but also reads." Ampli- 
fying the familiar railway-crossing inscription, the 
above writer's wholesome advice to the present gen- 
eration might be thus worded: Stop, Look, Listen, 
but, above all else, Read! 



THE REFERENCE LIBRARY'S DEBT TO BENJAMIN 

ELI SMITH, who died on the 24th of February after 
a long illness, is so great as almost to eclipse the other 
services he rendered to literature. As a young man 
of twenty-six he undertook the managing editorship 
of "The Century Dictionary," and was afterward 
editor-in-chief of "The Century Atlas," "The Cen- 
tury Cyclopedia of Names," and the revision of the 
"Dictionary." In other fields of literary activity, 
he translated, with the encouragement and aid of 
the late President Seelye of Amherst College, 
Schwegler's "History of Philosophy," and later pro- 
duced English versions of Cicero's "De Amicitia," 
and edited selections from Marcus Aurelius, Epic- 
tetus, and Pascal. In poetry also he early displayed 
talent, and he painted with skill, besides being some- 
thing of an athlete, as his college mates can testify. 
Born in 1857, of New England parentage, at Beirut 
his father was for twenty-five years connected 
with the American mission in Syria, Benjamin 
was sent to this country to be educated, and was 
graduated from Amherst in 1877. Further study in 
Germany followed, after which he taught philosophy 
at Johns Hopkins; but what was to be his chief 
work began in 1883 with his connection with The 
Century Co. He died at his home at Rochelle Park, 
N.Y. . . . 

THE STEALING OF LITERARY THUNDER without 

due, acknowledgment of the source of the theft is 
not exactly a praiseworthy practice. That sprightly 
and oft-quoted writer on the less serious aspects of 
library life, Mr. Edmund Lester Pearson, in his 
department known as "The Librarian" of the 
Boston "Transcript," relates amusingly his not 
altogether amusing experiences in encountering the 
frisky offspring of his own fecund fancy in publica- 
tions to which they have strayed by a more or less 
roundabout route, losing in their wanderings the tag 
designating the place of their nativity. Incidentally 
he pays graceful acknowledgment to THE DIAL 
for "occasional inspiration" in his own writing, and 
adds, truly enough, that he believes the benefit has 
not been wholly one-sided. To "The Librarian" 
these columns are in truth rather deeply indebted ; 
and it is an indebtedness shared, as we have recently 
noted, by our antipodes. The "Library Miscellany," 
published at Baroda in three languages, reprints in 
a late number Mr. Pearson's clever bit of verse 
entitled "The Reference Librarian" which, how- 
ever, the editor has not attempted to translate for 
the Gujarati and Marathi sections of his journal, 
much as one would have liked to see him try it.

THE FIRST ILLUSTRATED ENGLISH BOOK Came 

under the auctioneer's hammer the other day, when 
" The Mirrour of the World," printed by Caxton in 
1490, with the crudest of woodcuts, copied from 
those in the manuscript of Vincent of Beauvais, was 
sold at Sotheby's. The first and unillustrated edition 
of this work made its appearance from Caxton's press 
in 1481 ; the illustrated issue is a greater curiosity 
in the book world, and the present copy has added 
value from having belonged successively to two cele- 
brated English artists, Millais and Birket Foster, 
themselves illustrators as well as painters. From 
the rude designs in this Caxton production, designs 
chiefly representing teachers instructing their pupils, 
and betraying an almost incredible clumsiness in 
the draughtsman, to the modern photogravure and 
other mechanical or semi-mechanical processes of 
book-illustration, both in black-and-white and in 
colors, it is a long leap, though it was far from 
being a leap in the actual evolution of the illus- 
trator's art. Not per saltum, but per gradus, was 
the long distance covered. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



RADIOGRAPH OR SKIAGRAM? 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Exactness in the choice and use of words is an indi- 
cation of culture and of refinement in ideas. The 
uncultivated person may describe the color of each of 
several objects as " red," while one with a clearer 
perception easily recognizes that there are many hues 
represented, such as vermilion, scarlet, crimson, pink, 
rose, damask, ruby, and even maroon. We frequently 
find " infer " used in the place of " imply," and vice versa. 

Exactness demands that so far as possible each word 
should have one definite meaning, and no other. Un- 
fortunately full compliance with this proposition would 
increase our vocabulary to a cumbersome extent. When, 
however, we have two words and two significations they 
should not be used indiscriminatingly, and the unneces- 
sary forms should be dropped. 

Dictionaries, are governed chiefly by usage, rather 
than by inherent right. Not seldom words receive 
their initial impulse from those who may be better 
versed in some other branch of science than they are 
in orthography, and the carelessness of others per- 
mits an error to be perpetuated. Thus we find a strong 
tendency among prominent surgeons to use the word 
" radiograph " to designate the shadow picture taken 
by means of the X-ray. Exactness is favored by reserv- 
ing certain forms for given ideas, and in our choice of 
words and forms we must be largely guided by their 
derivation. 

We have many words in the English language ending 
in "-graph," " -gram," and "-graphy"; and approved 
usage, perhaps only through carelessness, has permitted 
some confusion as to the definite signification of these 
suffixes. The Greek word "grapheiu," from which we 
derive the suffix "-graph," is a verb, and designates 
the action of writing or making a picture. The result 
of the completed action was designated by the Greek 
" gramma," and from the stem of this noun we have 
the suffix " -gram." If, however, those ancients desired 



to indicate the result of continued or repeated action 
they used the noun " graphia," from which we have the 
suffix "-graphy." The ending " -graphy " therefore 
indicates an art, descriptive science, or treatise, as in 
" telegraphy," " geography," or " archseography," and 
" biography." We very properly use the suffix "-graph " 
in verbal forms, such as " telegraph," and " photo- 
graph." We also use this form to describe instruments 
by means of which the action may occur, such as 
" phonograph," " cardiograph," and " actinograph." 
Etymologically considered, the result of the action 
should be described by the suffix " -gram," as in " tele- 
gram " and "skiagram." The uses of the ending 
" -graph " to denote the result of the finished action is 
secondary and unnecessary, and is therefore confusing. 
It is unnecessary because we already have the form 
" -gram " with that individual signification. Why then 
should the form " photogram " have been permitted to 
drop into oblivion? Why not say " phonogram " and 
" dictogram," rather than the more cumbersome expres- 
sions " phonographic record " and " dictographic re- 
cord "? In spite of the authority of many dictionaries, 
therefore, it seems that the form " skiagram " is pre- 
ferable to " skiagraph " to indicate the picture taken 
by the Rontgen ray; and " radiogram " is better than 
" radiograph." 

There are three objections to the use of " radio- 
graph," " radiogram," and " radiography " with refer- 
ence to the taking of shadow-pictures by the aid of the 
X-ray. In the first place they represent a compound 
of Latin and Greek stems. This is an etymological 
offense which, because it is without any excuse, betrays 
ignorance on the part of the user. It is without excuse 
because we already have the purely Greek compounds 
" skiagraph," etc., with the same applied reference, and 
at present without any further signification. Secondly, 
it is objectionable because it causes the use of two sets of 
words without change of meaning. Thirdly, it has been 
found that a chemical (radium) has a similar power of 
making shadow-pictures upon the photographic plate 
through ordinarily opaque objects. The use of the word 
"radiograph" and its companion forms should therefore 
be strictly limited to such photography by means of 
emanations from the chemical radium. It must be 
remembered that " skiagraph " is not a new word, as it 
was used long before we knew anything of the peculiar 
properties of the Rontgen ray. Though old methods 
have now fallen into disuse, and though strictly the 
term might cover all shadow pictures, practically it 
would be well to limit the use of the term "skiagram" 
to the photograph taken by the electric ray, and leave 
the form " radiogram " to describe such a product of 
emanations from radium. 

There is another use of the verbal suffix "-graph," as 
found in a noun, which both usage and reason seem to 
approve. We have said that the suffix " -graphy " 
indicates the result of repeated, or continued, action, as 
found in an art or descriptive science; and thus is dis- 
tinguished from a " -gram," which is the result of one 
action. There is an intermediate form which is some- 
times needed, a sort of diminutive " -graphy." Several 
characters are combined into one " monogram." A 
" monograph " is more extended in signification, and the 
term is used to designate a short treatise upon a single 
topic or portion of a topic, generally in some science or

WAGNER 



BAYREUTH.* 



The story of Richard Wagner's achieve- 
ment at Bayreuth is of absorbing interest. A 
genuine reformer in his art, he had all the 
reformer's troubles and discouragements to 
meet; but he had also the indomitable faith 
and determination which lead to success. The 
thought of a National Play House, where the 
new operas which he had in contemplation 
might come to adequate representation, had 
risen upon his consciousness, and he never 
abandoned the prosecution of his plan for its 
realization. Time and time again affairs were 
so critical that everyone connected with the 
enterprise was ready to give it up. The Master 
himself once or twice appeared to have lost 
heart ; but he made a rapid recovery, was ready 
for additional sacrifices, devised fresh expedi- 
ents, and went to his task once more. 

Miss Caroline V. Kerr has done an excellent 
work in translating and editing the letters of 
Wagner which have to do with the inception 
and completion of the Bayreuth Theatre. Her 
introductory account is admirably adapted to 
give the needed unity to the collection. As 
early as 1848 Wagner published a paper on 
" A Project for the Organization of a National 
Theatre." In 1863, Miss Kerr tells us, he 
produced an essay on "A German National 
School of Music"; this he hoped to establish 
in Munich. He had not reached his thirty-fifth 
year before his mind was filled with the master- 
pieces to which he subsequently gave form. He 
had conceived the large tetralogy ; and a sacred 
opera was hovering before him which finally 
assumed the form of "Parsifal." He recog- 
nized that as a dramatic poet he was to make use 
of the material furnished by German mythology, 
filling it, however, with a significance that was 
human and universal. His study of Schopen- 
hauer and of Oriental literature gave him the 
idea of a religious experience which lay at the 
foundation of all religions, and out of this came 
"Parsifal," and another opera of which we hear 
under the title of " The Penitents," and of which 
a fragment was left at his death. 

In 1850 he tells his friend, Friedrich Heine: 
"I am now thinking of writing the music to 
Siegfried. In order to be able to produce it 
properly some day, I am cherishing all sorts of

bold and unusual plans, for the realization of 
which nothing further is necessary than that 
some rich old uncle or other should take it into 
his head to die." In the preface to the first edi- 
tion of the drama of " The Ring of theNibelung," 
which appeared in 1862, he distinctly announces 
his plans. He prefers a small town free from 
the influences surrounding the metropolitan 
opera houses. He proposes a theatre designed 
strictly for artistic purposes, as he understood 
them ; the coming together of singers imbued 
with the seriousness and nobility of their calling; 
the cooperation of instrumentalists who under- 
stood what the intentions of the Master really 
were; and the presence of an audience of music- 
lovers from far and near, who would make of 
the occasion a new festival of the combined arts 
in their highest estate. No doubt in all this he 
had in mind the great festivals of ancient times. 
As Miss Kerr very well remarks: 

" Wagner projected these ideas with that fine free 
breadth which characterizes the mind of genius, but the 
' three full years ' which he allowed himself for the 
completion of his heroic musical task ' Ring of the 
Nibelung ' became, in reality, a quarter of a century 
filled with struggles and disappointments, baffling to 
anyone but a reformer fighting for an idea which em- 
bodied his ' conscious mission in life.' " 

The work thus remained a matter of earnest 
endeavor, persistent propaganda, and anxious 
anticipation until 1871, when it assumed the 
proportions of a great effort on the eve of 
realization. 

Miss Kerr, following Glasenapp, gives a fine 
characterization of the men on whom Wagner 
chiefly relied for practical assistance. There were 
four Friedrich Feustel, Theodor Muncker, 
Emil Heckel, and Carl Brandt. It would be 
difficult to find anywhere exemplars of greater 
devotion, clearer understanding, or*higher secu- 
lar wisdom. The man with whom they had to 
deal was not one to engage readily in com- 
promises; he had an unalterable conception of 
the dignity and significance of his labors had 
anyone ever more right to such self-confidence ? 
and the diplomacies of the manipulator of 
inevitable expedients met with characteristic 
treatment at his hands. The demands made 
upon him were excessive, but he met them at 
whatever cost or sacrifice. 

Of the four advisers, Feustel was engaged in 
political matters relating both to the German 
Empire and to his residence city, Bayreuth. 
He was a man of affairs, an excellent manager 
of practical business, a competent financier, and 
so indefatigable a laborer in the cause that he 
received the appellation of " the Flying Dutch- 



1913]

man of Bayreuth." Muncker was the Burgo- 
master of Beyreuth, and he gave the new 
musical evangel his unfaltering attachment ; 
he took a personal share in the task of the 
Master, and was a bulwark of defense in time of 
trouble. Heckel of Mannheim was an organizer 
of exterior enterprises everywhere ; he dissem- 
inated intelligence widely, and served the pur- 
poses of obtaining the necessary financial help 
and propagating the crusade in divers places. 
Last but not least we have Brandt, the famous 
stage machinist of Darmstadt, for whom Wag- 
ner had the deepest regard, and whose advice 
and suggestion were invaluable. He was far 
more than a maker of stage machinery, he had 
to do largely and fully with the positive crea- 
tion of a suitable home for a new synthetic art 
that was far more than a mere extension of the 
limits within which music, operatic and other, 
had prospered up to the date of that art's appear- 
ance. Music was to undergo a transfiguration 
of all its material, was to rise to a wholly new 
and higher plane. 

Why Bayreuth was chosen for the Music- 
Drama Festival finds explanation in this extract 
from a letter to Feustel : 

" The place must not be a large city with a permanent 
theatre, nor one of the large summer resorts where 
during the season an absolutely undesirable public 
would offer itself; it must be centrally located in Ger- 
many, and moreover be a Bavarian city, as I also intend 
to take up my permanent residence in the place, and 
consider that I could only do this in Bavaria if I hope to 
enjoy the continued patronage of the King of Bavaria. 
Apart from these considerations, this pleasant old city, 
with its surroundings, made an indelible impression on 
me years ago, and the fact that I am an utter stranger to 
the citizens of Bayreuth gives me no cause for alarm." 

Miss Kerr tells us that in the spring of 1871 
Wagner went again to the old hill town, and 
the " indelible impression " was deepened and 
the final decision made. It was during this visit 
that Wagner, who was travelling incognito, fell 
ill, and Dr. Carl Landgraf was called in to see 
him. The doctor became the uncompensated 
physician to the artist assemblage at Bayreuth, 
and he is assuredly to be named in any account 
of the enterprise. In April of 1871, Wagner 
issued a communication to the public, now well 
disposed to his efforts, " About the Perform- 
ances of a Stage Festival Play, ' Ring of the 
Nibelung.' "' In this he reiterated the explana- 
tions of his project formerly made. The esti- 
mated cost of the Festival was over two hundred 
thousand dollars, and the means for raising this 
sum were to be found through the Wagner So- 
cieties. The Societies were to issue membership 
certificates ; the holder of the certificate was to 



have a place at all of the performances, and three 
persons might share in one certificate. By the 
early death of Karl Tausig his knowledge and 
enthusiasm were lost to Wagner, and the main 
labor of establishing the Societies fell upon the 
broad and willing shoulders of Heckel, whose 
wisdom and devotion had no superiors. He 
organized the first Wagner Society in Mann- 
heim in 1871, and the ball was set in motion. 

The rest of the story, with its ups and downs, 
its manifold fluctuations, its hopes and tem- 
porary despairs, may be read in these letters. 
Here are the origirial sources, and they are per- 
vaded by the fervor of emotion which belongs 
to the success of enterprises of great pith and 
moment. At times it seemed as though im- 
passable barriers obstructed further progress. 
The Emperor of Germany was appealed to 
without result, and more than once Louis of 
Bavaria was obliged to come to the rescue. At 
last the Festival came into being, one of the 
capital achievements of mankind, only to sink 
into a subsequent silence of five years. Then, 
in 1876, "Parsifal" resounded in the ears of 
men, and the Bayreuth Theatre was established. 

Miss Kerr's translation is a good one; 
although there seems an occasional misunder- 
standing of a German idiom. The connecting 
passages are excellent, and the series of letters 
becomes a consistent history. It is here that 
Miss Kerr has done some of her best work, and 
she converts epistles written to various persons 
into a genuine chapter of autobiography. It 
was a fine thing to bring together these intimate 
communications relating to an important episode 
in Wagner's life ; it was a still finer thing so to 
arrange and relate them as to give continuity of 
interest and narrative. The letters are charac- 
teristic of the author, who was always a won- 
derful letter-writer. Louis JAMES BLOCK. 



J. M. SYNGE AND His WORK.* 

The amount of biographic fact so far made 
known about J. M. Synge is surprisingly small, 
and though a book "is shortly to make its ap- 
pearance that will tell from direct reminiscence 
all that the world is entitled to hear, written by 
those who knew Synge well," the promise does 
not seem to carry a hope of much more exten-

sive information than we now possess. The 
biography in Mr. Francis Bickley's little vol- 
ume consists of one chapter of nine pages ; and 
that, as far as actual biography is concerned, is 
mostly padding. Synge was born in Dublin, 
spent his wander-years 011 the continent as 
obscurely as Goldsmith did, was discovered by 
Mr. W. B. Yeats in a Paris garret in 1897, and 
on the latter's advice devoted himself to creative 
work in Ireland until his death in 1909. Such 
are the outstanding facts of his life. 

What effect the years of study in French and 
German had upon Synge's literary work has not 
as yet been fully developed, nor is it even satis- 
factorily indicated by Mr. Howe in his " critical 
study." It would form a very pretty subject 
for research, not even unworthy of a doctor's 
dissertation, though, of course, repulsively mod- 
ern. It stands to reason that the formative 
years up to 1897 were probably formative in 
the real sense of the word. Mr. Yeats's very 
words that Synge had "nothing to show but one 
or two poems and impressionistic essays, full of 
that kind of morbidity that has its root in too 
much brooding over methods of expression, and 
ways of looking upon life, which come, not out 
of life, but out of literature, images reflected 
from mirror to mirror," these words explain, 
to some extent at least, the wonderful diction of 
the plays, and enable one to comprehend how 
this genius when brought into the open air of 
the Aran Islands could turn to healthy use this 
morbid care for the word and phrase. Still 
more might one expect to find far-reaching 
influences in form and thought, as indeed has 
been pointed out by Professor Sherman in the 
matter of Synge's relation to Anatole France 
and others. 

Whatever results might be obtained from such 
a study of foreign influence, they would not lessen 
our appreciation of Synge's genius any more than 
our knowledge of the pre-Shakespearean influ- 
ence decreases our admiration for the "Comedy 
of Errors" or "Hamlet." The voice is a new 
one, as distinctively national as individual. 
"The Well of the Saints," the chief of Synge's 
plays, according to Mr. Howe, has elements in 
common with Maeterlinck's "Les Aveugles" 
and Clemenceau's " Voile du Bonheur," but it is 
as wholly characteristic of the Irish national 
genius as it is expressive of Synge's sense of 
the greyness of life untouched by the poetic 
imagination. The play is no less a product of 
Ireland than the "Playboy," which is based on 
a story told Synge by " the oldest man on Inis- 
maan." Its local color is perfect in detail ; the 



characters have the complete flavor of the soil, 
so much so that the bit of supernaturalism 
upon which the action hinges is accepted by the 
audience as readily as are the superstitions of 
the locality by the inhabitants. The very con- 
trast, too, between the world of reality and that 
of imagination is characteristic both of the Celt 
and of Synge. Thus in this play of "The Well 
of the Saints," two blind beggars, man and wife, 
weather-beaten and old, recover their sight by 
the miracle of an itinerant saint and discover 
that their beauty, which the villagers had made 
them believe as actual, was the grossest delusion. 
With their sight they get only misery, and not 
until their eyes become dimmed again and grad- 
ually become sightless, do they return to their 
former joy in the natural world about them. 
When the holy man returns and is about to 
repeat the cure by means of the sacred water, 
the man strikes the can containing it out of the 
saint's hand and thus spares himself and his wife 
the misfortune of another miracle. Their world 
of imagination is better than that of things as 
they saw them with their eyes. The same note 
is struck in other plays. The Playboy discovers 
himself, by breaking away first from the dull 
tyranny of a brutal father and later from the 
fleeting joys of a false state of worship as a hero 
into the realization of his own spirit, till he be- 
comes "a likely gaffer in the end of all," a poet 
ranging through the Western World of his 
vaunting imagination. So the Tramp in " The 
Shadow of the Glen" holds out to Nora, who 
somewhat doubtfully accepts the prophecy ac- 
cording to which "you'll be hearing the herons 
crying out over the black lakes, and you '11 be 
hearing the grouse and the owls with them, and 
the larks and the big thrushes when the days 
are warm ; and it 's not from the like of them 
you '11 be hearing a tale of getting old like Peggy 
Cavanagh, and losing the hair off you, and the 
light of your eyes, but it 's fine songs you '11 be 
hearing when the sun goes up, and there'll be 
no old fellow wheezing, the like of a sick sheep, 
close to your ear." All this the Tramp holds 
out to her imaginative spirit, so that she goes 
out with him to face "the cold, and the frost, 
and the great rain, rather than live with her 
husband in a lonesome place the like of this 
place." And in "Deirdre of the Sorrows" the 
contrast is carried to the extreme, so that when 
the world of facts becomes overpowering, the 
only refuge is death, but death lighted up by 
faith and love. Just before Deirdre presses the 
knife into her heart and sinks into the grav^e, 
she thus addresses Conchubor, who has killed 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



235 



her lover and husband, Naisi : "I have a little 
key to unlock the prison of Naisi you'd shut 
upon his youth forever. Keep back, Conchubor; 
for the High King who is your master has put 
his hands between us. It was sorrows was fore- 
told, but great joys were my share always ; yet 
it is a cold place I must go to be with you, 
Naisi ; and it 's cold your arms will be this night 
that were warm about my neck so often. . . . 
It 's a pitiful thing to be talking out when your 
ears are shut to me. It's a pitiful thing, 
Conchubor, you have done this night in Emain ; 
yet a thing will be a joy and triumph to the ends 
of life and time." Love is as great a transformer 
of the actual as is the imagination, and in Deirdre's 
case it has made the world so beautiful that death 
with her lover is better than life without him. 

Synge's genius was much more tragic than 
comic . His comedy, "The Tinker's Wedding, ' ' is 
probably the least effective of his works. In- 
teresting types of character the tinkers and the 
priest are, but the dialogue is not particularly 
amusing nor is the plot very interesting. His 
comedy is at its best when it serves to heighten 
by contrast the grim or the pathetic. Thus how 
admirably in "The Playboy" is the character 
of Shawn revealed when he disconsolately 
remarks to the Widow Quin a propos of his 
rival's success: "Oh, Widow Quin, what '11 I 
be doing now? I'd inform agen him, but he'd 
be sure and certain to destroy me. If I wasn't 
so God-fearing, I 'd near have courage to come 
behind him and run a pike into his side. Oh, 
it 's a hard case to be an orphan and not to have 
your father that you're used to, and you'd 
easy kill and make yourself a hero in the sight 
of all." The comic spirit in this play which 
is more marked than in any other, brings out 
more completely the tragic fate of Pegeen, who 
sees all her happiness suddenly vanish in her 
disillusionment. She has lost her playboy of 
the western world and nothing will 'fill the 
blank. "Eiders to the Sea" is a tragedy of a 
whole people who earn their bread on the waters, 
and it is filled with the brooding and fatalistic 
melancholy of the Celt. Maurya speaks with 
the solemn intensity of her kind. It is not the 
" excitement of the will in the presence of at- 
tainable advantages" we have in this tragedy; 
it is rather the submission of the will crushed by 
the inexorable power of the sea. When her last 
son is brought in drowned, she cries : "They 're 
all gone now, and there isn't anything more the 
sea can do to me. ... I '11 have no call now to 
be up crying and praying when the wind breaks 
from the south, and you can hear the surf is, in 



the east, and the surf is in the west, making a 
great stir with the two noises, and they hitting 
one on the other. I '11 have no call now to be 
going down and getting Holy Water in the dark 
nights after Samhain, and I won't care what 
way the sea is when the other women will be 
keening." And how poignantly passion is 
expressed in the greatest tragedy of them all, 
when Deirdre bids farewell to the home of her 
seven happy years as she leaves it for the un- 
known : " Woods of Cuan, woods of Cuan ; dear 
country of the east ! It 's seven years we 've had 
a life was joy only, and this day we're going 
west, this day we 're facing death, maybe, and 
death should be a poor, untidy thing, though 
it's a queen that dies." And again just before 
she presses the knife to her heart she says: 
"Little moon, little moon of Alban, it's lone- 
some you '11 be this night, and to-morrow night, 
and long nights after, and you pacing the 
woods beyond Glen Laoi, looking every place 
for Deirdre and Naisi, the two lovers who slept 
so sweetly with each other." 

And the voice of this genius is new because 
his people are so wonderfully fresh and clear. 
What a great language they speak ! How lucid 
and simple and poetic it is! Thus in "The 
Well of the Saints" Martin tells of the sights 
the two blind beggars, he and his wife, have: 
"Ah, it's ourselves had finer sights than the 
like of them, I'm telling you, when we were 
sitting a while back hearing the birds and bees 
humming in every weed of the ditch ; or when 
we'd be smelling the sweet, beautiful smell 
does be rising in the warm nights, when you do 
hear the swift flying things racing in the air, 
till we'd be looking up in our own minds into 
a grand sky ; and seeing lakes, and big rivers, 
and fine hills for taking the plough." Above 
all, the voice is new because the author is not 
concerned in solving a problem or exploiting a 
theory ; it is like the voice of the Elizabethans, 
which proclaims truth and beauty through the 
medium of pure art. JAMES W. TUPPER. 



DISRAELI AS POLITICIAN AND AUTHOR.* 



In the preface to the second volume of Mr. 
William Flavelle Mony penny's Life of Disraeli, 
it is explained that the delay in publication was 
due to reasons of health. The preface is dated 
October, 1912 ; a little later news went abroad 
of the author's death. The passing of a brilliant

writer is always keenly felt ; in this case there 
is the added regret that death came while the 
author was in the midst of the greatest task of 
his career. Of his biography of Disraeli only 
two of the four volumes that he had planned 
have been published. We are assured, however, 
that he had the remaining volumes well under 
way, and that they will appear in due time. 

In the present volume the author has em- 
ployed the same literary method as in the earlier 
one. It is to a large extent made up of extracts 
from Disraeli's letters and novels, which the 
author has strung together on a thin thread of 
original narrative. This method has decided 
advantages : it gives the reader an insight into 
Disraeli's mental character that no discussion 
on the author's part could give us. The great 
politician is made to reveal all the many traits 
of his extraordinary mind, his love for the fan- 
tastic, his ambition, his shrewdness, his faith in 
himself, his vanity, and the rest : the author 
makes no attempt at concealment. At the same 
time, there arises a doubt as to whether the 
method has not been overworked. It is import- 
ant to know what Disraeli thought of himself ; 
but we need also to be told what his contem- 
poraries thought of him. To some extent Mr. 
Monypenny supplies this information, but too 
often it is given on the authority of Disraeli 
himself. It may be true that " I spoke with 
great effect last night in the House, the best 
speech on our side," and that " my great speech 
in 1846 . . . was followed by the loudest and 
longest cheer that ever was heard in the House 
of Commons," but we ought to have more 
evidence. 

The volume covers a period of nine years, 
beginning with Disraeli's first appearance in 
parliament in 1837 and closing with his suc- 
cessful overthrow of Sir Robert Peel in 1846. 
A chapter is given to his marriage, and another 
to his stay in Paris during the winter of 1842-3 ; 
but the bulk of the narrative is devoted to liter- 
ature and politics, two subjects that were closely 
related in Disraeli's mind. Mr. Monypenny has 
studied his subject from three sides : he sees 
him as a parliamentary orator, as a novelist, 
and as a political theorist. Disraeli the states- 
man will be the subject of future volumes ; for 
in his career previous to 1846 there were no 
clear indications that he would ever develop con- 
structive statesmanship ; nor would anyone have 
guessed in the days when he had to remain in- 
doors for fear of his creditors that he would 
some day prove a fairly successful chancellor 
of the exchequer. 



Considerable attention is given to Disraeli's 
career as a parliamentary orator. The story of 
his maiden speech, when the radicals and the 
Irishmen howled him down, is told in detail, 
and the author shows that it was Disraeli's own 
fault that he received such rough treatment : 
he went "out of his way to provoke the hostility 
of the Irish, on whom the traditions of the House 
were least likely to impose restraint." Ten days 
later he was again on the floor, and was satisfied 
with the impression that he made : "I spoke 
again last night and with complete success." 
Three months later he made an unusually effec- 
tive speech, and " sat down amid loud cheers "; 
but he adds : " No one cheered me more vehe- 
mently than Hobhouse, who was a little drunk." 
Before he had been six months in the House, 
it seems that the press as well as parliament 
had begun to take him seriously. At least such 
is his own belief. 

" I made a most brilliant and triumphant speech last 
night unquestionably and agreed upon by all hands the 
crack speech of the night. . . . Every paper in London, 
Radical, Whig, or Tory, has spoken of my speech in 
the highest terms of panegyric, except the wretched 
Standard, which, under the influence of that scoundrel 
Maginn, always attacked me before I was in parliament, 
and now always passes over my name in silence." 

The author also discusses Disraeli's oratorical 
mannerisms, his monotonous drawl, his careless 
gestures, and the indifferent manner that he 
employed until he reached the really important 
parts of his speech, when he would suddenly 
rise to the occasion and give the enemy thrust 
after thrust. 

Two chapters are devoted to Disraeli's novels 
of this period, " Coningsby " and " Sibyl." Mr. 
Monypenny rates these very high, whether re- 
garded as works of art or as political treatises. 
But he is not oblivious to the defects in Disraeli's 
literary art, chiefly his inability to keep his 
purpose from dominating the story. The au- 
thor's discussion of these novels is most illumi- 
nating. "'Coningsby' can be regarded either 
as a work of art, or as the manifesto of Young 
England." The chapter on Young England, a 
group of dreamers who looked to Disraeli as a 
leader, serves as an excellent introduction to 
the discussion of the novel itself, for some of the 
members of Young England appear as characters 
in the story. In "Sibyl" Disraeli gives us a 
study of conditions among the impoverished 
industrial classes. It is Mr. Monypenny's opin- 
ion that although "Sibyl" has been a favorite 
"with the critics and with the elect," it is really 
inferior to " Coningsby." 

"Coningsby" is important for the study of

Disraeli as a political theorist, because in this 
book he develops his ideas of historical Toryism ; 
" Sibyl," because in this he shows the necessity 
of combining the older Tory idea with that of 
social reform. In tracing the growth of the new 
Toryism, Mr. Monypenny finds that Disraeli 
was not disloyal to his early radical convictions 
when he became a member of the conservative 
party. With his conservative friends he em- 
phasized the historic elements of the English 
constitution, the land, the church, and above 
all the monarchy. But he did not stop there: 
he realized that the industrial revolution had 
produced a new set of social conditions, and 
that the call for social reform should be heeded. 
Monarchy, as he viewed it, did not exist merely 
to conserve the existing institutions; it was to 
serve as the agent of the nation in effecting 
social reform. 

" For him in the political cosmos there are two great 
realities the throne at the centre, and the People at 
the circumference; and on the maintenance of their nor- 
mal and unimpeded interaction the health and balance 
of all depends. 'The privileges of the multitude and 
the prerogatives of the Sovereign had grown up together, 
and together they had waned '; together also they were 
to be redeemed from the selfish oligarchy which had 
usurped them, and the not less selfish and only less nar- 
row middle class which had now taken the place of the 
oligarchy. That, briefly stated, is the Disraelian posi- 
tion. There is no shrinking, as we can see, from democ- 
racy as such, though there is a shrinking from a sudden 
transference of power to a neglected and entirely unedu- 
cated democracy." 

It was, however, not as the exponent of a 
political theory, but as the supporter of a ques- 
tionable economic expedient, the corn laws, that 
Disraeli mounted to leadership. The fight over 
the corn laws is told in considerable detail. An 
effort is made to show that Disraeli was abso- 
lutely honest in his opposition, and that he had 
given Peel warning in several notable speeches 
that an attempt to abandon protection might 
bring them to the parting of the ways.- It is 
in his discussion of this conflict that Mr. 
Monypenny shows most clearly his own political 
bias; this part of the narrative is therefore 
likely to meet with some criticism. For the 
author holds that the abolition of the corn laws 
ruined English agriculture, while it brought no 
help to Ireland ; that the apparent prosperity of 
England in the following years was not due to 
the repeal, but to other causes: "the great 
development of steam and railways that was 
proceeding when it was adopted, and the gold 
discoveries in California and Australia that soon 
followed"; and, finally, 

" The repeal of the Corn Laws was the first decisive 
step in that policy of sacrificing the rural life of England 



to a one-sided and exaggerated industrial development 
which has done so much to change the English character 
aud the English outlook, and which it may not impossi- 
bly be the business of subsequent generations to endeavor 
to retrace." 

It is also a question whether the author is 
just in his treatment of Sir Robert Peel. He 
admits that morally Peel was superior to 
Disraeli ; Disraeli's flat denial in the House of 
Commons that he had ever asked Peel for an 
office would make another conclusion impossible. 
Mr. Monypenny makes no attempt to excuse the 
falsehood ; he adds, however, " Let the politi- 
cian who is without sin in the matter of veracity 
cast the first stone." But, he argues, "there is 
not only a moral but an intellectual integrity, 
and in intellectual virtue Peel was as much the 
inferior of Disraeli as in the moral he was his 
superior." 

It is likely that too much is made of Disraeli's 
devotion to principle ; for it seems impossible 
to disguise the fact that he was, after all, a 
political adventurer, who would leap at an op- 
portunity like that afforded by the plight of 
the squires who were threatened by Peel's pro- 
posed legislation. But except in matters related 
to the great battle in 1846, the author shows 
rare judgment and writes in a spirit of evident 
fairness. It must be remembered, however, 
that Mr. Monypenny wrote in the year 1912, 
in an atmosphere full of schemes for future corn 
laws and other forms of protection ; in such an 
atmosphere it would be difficult for the judgment 
of a Tory to maintain an even balance.

THE WOMEN OF SHAKESPEARE.* 

Several years ago Mr. Frank Harris, the 
London editor and dramatic critic, published a 
work on " The Man Shakespeare," in which he 
professed to read the inner history of Shake- 
speare from youth to decline by finding him 
thinly disguised in his dramas under a recurrent 
type-character, now, for example, as Orsino, now 
as Hamlet, and now as Antony. Mr. Harris's 
new volume of studies, reprinted from "The 
English Review," are in effect a continuation 
of the same theme. By "The Women of 
Shakespeare" are meant primarily the four 
actual women who had most to do with the 
shaping of Shakespeare's life and sentiments 
his mother, wife, mistress, and daughter. These 
women, like Shakespeare himself, Mr. Harris

finds portrayed more or less faithfully in suc- 
cessive characters in the dramas, and he freely 
employs such phrases as Cleopatra-Fitton and 
Judith-Marina to convey his meaning. Natur- 
ally, the chief emphasis is upon the mistress, 
Mary Fitton, Queen Elizabeth's maid-of -honor. 
It was she, Mr. Harris believes, who is to be 
credited with the development of Shakespeare's 
tragic power, working in his soul and art a trans- 
formation paralleled (shall we say ?) only in such 
histories as those of Dante and Petrarch. 

The matter of the volume is not entirely new. 
We have long been familiar, for instance, with 
the attempt to identify " the whitely wanton 
with a velvet brow" of " Love's Labor's Lost" 
with the dark lady of the sonnets, and this lat- 
ter with Mary Fitton. But Mr. Harris goes far 
beyond these slight conjectures, and attempts 
to extract from the plays not only, as already 
stated, a spiritual history, but even definite 
biographical details. For example, a scene in 
"Coriolanus" makes him "feel that Shake- 
speare's mother on her death-bed had probably 
begged something of Shakespeare which he had 
granted very reluctantly," that she had, in fact, 
" made him promise to be reconciled to his wife." 
A declaration so bold as this excites one's curi- 
osity to know by what process of deduction the 
author arrives at his conclusions. Example 
will be more satisfactory than description. 
Speaking of " Coriolanus," he says : 

" The wife plays hardly any part in the drama; the 
whole interest is concentrated on the mother and son. 
. . . The speech of Coriolanus when he is on the point 
of yielding to his mother's pleading is impossible in the 
mouth of a Roman general, but is all the more character- 
istic of Shakespeare at this time: 

Like a dull actor now 
I have forgot my part, and I am out, 
Even to a full disgrace. . . . 

. . . You gods ! I prate, 
And the most noble mother of the world 
Leave unsaluted : sink my knee, i' the earth 
Of thy deep duty more impression show 
Than that of common sons. . . . 

Surely in the last lines of this self-revealing speech we 
catch an echo of Shakespeare's pride in himself and his 
intense admiration of his mother. Why should Corio- 
laniis praise his mother to us ? " 

It seems to us rather more pertinent to ask, 
Why should Shakespeare praise his mother to 
a London audience ? But if that is not convinc- 
ing, perhaps the following may be this time 
with reference to "Antony and Cleopatra": 

" Shakespeare had been in love with Mary Fitton for 
years. She had got into his blood, and he could not 
but paint her for us in act after act, in a dozen differing 
moods. Even Shakespeare's intellectual conscience 
Enobarbus cannot control himself when he speaks of 
her: 



I saw her once 

Hop forty paces through the public street ; 
And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted 
That she did make defect perfection 
And, breathless, power breathe forth. 

This incident seems to me a veritable performance of 
Mary Fitton reported by Shakespeare. It must have 
made a deathless impression on him. Not only does it 
throw Enobarbus off his perfect balance: but it is in 
itself too peculiar to be imagined and is besides not at 
all in keeping with the character of the sensual queen. 
It reminds us too directly of the bold sonnet-heroine. 
That insistence upon ' power ' strikes the same note as 
in Sonnet 150: 

from what power hast thou this powerful might ? ' ' 

In the chapter on "All's Well that Ends 
Well" Mr. Harris makes out a strong case for 
the identification of Bertram's character with 
that of Lord Herbert, and the plausibility of 
this portion bespeaks serious consideration for 
his entire argument. But, unfortunately, no- 
where else does assent follow so readily, and very 
often one feels compelled to enter an emphatic 
denial. That Hamlet upbraiding his mother 
and beseeching her to abandon the King should 
be really Shakespeare reproaching Mary Fitton 
and begging her to cast off Lord Herbert, ap- 
pears little short of ridiculous. And when, a 
little later, we are told that the unnatural cruelty 
of Hamlet in speaking with such contempt of 
the slain Polonius 

" I '11 lug the guts into the neighbor room " 

is only to be explained by the fact that " Shake- 
speare is here again thinking of Herbert, the 
real object of his hate, whom often in imagina- 
tion he had killed with one quick thrust," one 
feels bound to protest that if this indeed be so, 
the creator of Hamlet was insane. If Mr. Harris 
were not so serious and so evidently convinced 
by his own reasoning, we should be disposed to 
think it all a deliberate hoax, perpetrated pos- 
sibly with the object of showing the Baconians 
how, with persistence enough, one can read any- 
thing he pleases into the text of Shakespeare. 

Not the least strange part of it all is the au- 
thor's fancy that his discovery somehow glorifies 
Shakespeare, even while he calls him a snob and 
a sensualist. He appears to think that now, for 
the first time, in the light of this new truth, is 
Shakespeare revealed in all his essential human- 
ity, and his character clothed with flesh and blood. 
But surely this is just what all men have always 
seen in Shakespeare. Life, we grant, indeed, 
we insist, he must have known to the core. 
What we refuse to believe, even granting the 
Herbert-Fitton episode, which is by no means 
established, is that he should have kept so nar- 
rowly within the pale of his personal experience 



1913] 



THE DIAL

and hugged so closely his private wrongs that 
he merely transcribed them, schoolboy-like, into 
his plays, instead of transmuting them into that 
wonderful pageant of universal human passions 
that spectators and readers alike have taken 
them to be. Mr. Harris exclaims, in a moment 
which to a mere "mandarin-professor" looks 
like the very ebullition of hysteria, "What a 
pity it is that Shakespeare and Mary Fitton do 
not sleep together in the great Abbey!" But 
if we were once convinced of what he asserts so 
exultantly, that many of the plays, including 
all the greatest ones, actually "reek of" Mary 
Fitton, we should feel with an immeasurable 
sadness that our idol was dethroned and should 
<;lose our Shakespeares forever. Happily, not 
many of us are likely to be convinced.

MYSTICISM: WHITHER BOUND?* 

The world will not cease to demand from 
mysticism some firm human significance. Lack- 
ing this, a new mystic vision may indeed carry 
us off our feet for a time, but we will not fly 
far with it. Possessing this, it may transport 
us to very strange shores : we will " adventure 
for such merchandise." History is instinct 
with this demand, and general thought will 
make it continually more pressing. Surely it 
is destined, working its way to the very roots 
of mysticism, to cultivate in time a hardier 
plant and lovelier flowers than have been. 

But just at present the process is acute 
and debilitating. The blossoms are not only 
strange but inherently fragile, for instance, 
those that blow in M. Maeterlinck's garden. 
Graceful and assiduously tended as these are, 
they can scarce draw one's approbation unmixed 
with the regret "that it should come to this"! 
Especially calculated to stir the Hamlet 'in one, 
are the essays on Emerson, Novalis, and Ruys- 
broeck in their English dress. The translation, 
though on the whole adequate, is frequently the 
reverse of subtle, and in any case much of the 
original color and perfume was bound to flee 
the language of shop-keepers; moreover, the 
studies in the volume represent, as the translator 
remarks, the sources of Maeterlinck's "philo- 
sophic inspiration." As a result, his views 
confront the Anglo-Saxon reader in barer out- 
line than ever before, and readers are likely 

*ON EMERSON, and Other Essays. By Maurice Maeter- 
linck. Translated by MontroseJ. Moses. New York : Dodd, 
Mead & Co. 



to be numerous on account of the author's 
popularity. Many who have seen Maeterlinck 
through the general haze which hangs about 
him may be induced now to ponder somewhat 
thoughtfully the bare essentials of his mysticism. 
Indeed, although the essays are not new, they 
have now a fresh importance. They provide, 
unintentionally, a timely " Past and Present.'' 
Joining with certain other influences which are 
working in the same direction, they will help 
compel our attention for the present state of 
mysticism. And more general meditation upon 
this subject should react to the good of mysti- 
cism itself, should indirectly hasten its period 
of firmer growth. Whither is it bound? 

Mysticism comprises two main spiritual 
states, fundamentally inseparable and comple- 
mentary but nevertheless distinct: an apo- 
calyptic, in which truth seems merely to be 
revealed ; and a humanly creative, so to speak, 
in which new truth seems brought into exist- 
ence. At times, the dreamer is contemplating 
a transcendent picture from which a veil has 
dropped ; again, he is himself the artist, paint- 
ing with divine colors a scene not yet known to 
heaven or earth. For him, the joy of strangely 
mingled self-forgetfulness and creative exulta- 
tion is for the moment all-sufficient. He rele- 
gates to colder hours, or to other persons, the 
pursuit of a rational harmony. This pursuit 
reduces the two mystic states to aspects of what 
has so far appeared, in the world's net verdict, 
a persistent dualism presenting such further 
discords as "the one and the many," good and 
evil, eternity and time. Yet all considerable 
attempts at harmonizing these discords have soon 
reacted upon the nature of mysticism itself 
have been the true parents, indeed, of all mys- 
tic visions which have attained lasting human 
significance. 

Where, then, will the pursuit of harmony 
next lead us? The effect of modern thought, 
certainly, has been to deepen the human terms 
of the old paradox. The tap-root of them all, 
plainly, is "time" roughly represented in 
ordinary speech by such expressions as flux, 
evolution, human progress, and the like: time 
in the largest sense of the word. This fact has 
been more and more firmly established among 
us, on the one hand by those who look askance 
on everything from Rousseau to Bergson, and 
on the other by those optimists spiritual chil- 
dren of Comte who find the direct line of 
progress passing through the middle of our 
epoch. So that the central stream of human 
thought, if it follows its old commonplace pro- 



240 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



cedure of issuing about midway between the 
conservative and radical channels, can scarcely 
do so without being colored, more deeply than 
before, with the current of time. That color- 
will slowly work its way in just what degree 
it is impossible to foretell, although certainly 
not in the Bergsonian degree through the 
general conception of ultimate reality. To this 
result the majority of nineteenth century writ- 
ers, most often unwittingly, have made sig- 
nificant contributions. Even those have done 
so who, like Carlyle and Browning, affected 
independence of the age's trend and rendered 
inborn homage to " the Quiet " overhead. For 
by uniquely emphasizing, in effect, the lasting 
significance of human labor, "the many," even 
evil, and various other constituents of the 
human drama, they edified the very plot and 
frame of that drama time itself. They all 
abetted time's invasion of the Quiet's realm. 
It seems that the central push of history was 
behind them. 

The eventual result for mysticism will be to 
intensify what was termed above its humanly 
creative mood. Implicit in this mood is the 
recognition that time possesses at bottom some 
ultimate reality. Nor will the intensification of 
that mood make it dissonant with the apocalyp- 
tic state in which time's shackles seem to be 
loosed. For it is surely the function and value 
of mysticism to solve, as the world grows older, 
deeper discords than of yore. And the mystic 
himself may experience increasingly rich returns. 
The truth which he discovers will never again, 
indeed, have the pure simplicity and the static 
completeness of the Platonic vision. But if the 
divine excellence shall show some inherent need 
of development, it will evince also a transcend- 
ent capability for such unfolding. And the 
rapture of perceiving this excellence will be 
mingled more than ever with the deep joy 
of creatively aiding in that development. A 
prevision of this joy appears in Emerson : the 
"Oversoul" is overlaid with a peculiarly crea- 
tive " Self -Reliance " fruit of a long growth 
of human thought which in him attained a pro- 
phetic, if premature, harmoniousness. 

In Maeterlinck's essay on Emerson, however, 
the thought-foundation has faded from view, 
and the self-reliance been reduced to a succes- 
sion of receptive moods. How strangely thin, 
then, here as in the writings of Emerson's 
less noted present-day disciples, does the Over- 
soul appear! And it is this sort of soul "a 
capricious and hidden thing '' he once well terms 
it which the author pursues through the re- 



maining two essays, and distills into a haze of 
imagery. Mystic imagery, rather than mystic 
vision with its large background of thought, is 
what attracts him, notably in Ruysbroeck. 
The book is therefore thoroughly characteristic 
of contemporary mysticism. For this has fallen 
into the twofold estate produced always by peri- 
ods of transition: its apocalypse is weak, and 
its humanly creative vision is merged largely in 
a predilection for symbolism. Fleeting impres- 
sions of vague greatnesses often light shadows 
of past gods are elaborated through a finely 
graduated scale of symbolic images. Pick up 
almost any present literary production tinged 
with mysticism be it American lyric, German 
reverie, or Russian novel and you are told the 
same story. It throws one's thoughts, distress- 
ingly, upon the merely latent, inert aspect of 
reality. The oversoul, without firm human 
foundation, easily sinks to an undersoul. Those- 
highest " peaks " of our being, for instance, that 
Maeterlinck talks so much about, do they not 
quickly turn, if one rubs one's eyes, into mere 
inverted images of valleys? 

To be sure, it is well to be made conscious of 
our needs; such a condition is pre-essential to 
reconstruction. And if the pursuit of symbol- 
ism cannot fulfil those needs, nevertheless it has 
a certain secondary value. At its best, present- 
day literary mysticism is cultivating the high 
meaning of the small familiar things of life; it 
is thus contributing in a minor fashion to that 
humanizing of mysticism which is bound in the 
future to run its course. And, indeed, flashes of 
truly constructive insight, indicating a develop- 
ment of fresh vitality in the general direction 
outlined above, are not wanting: witness the first 
part of Maeterlinck's essay on Novalis. But 
naturally the new harmony, in which time, with 
its increased reality, shall be reconciled again 
with eternity, must be built up not in the proper 
sphere of mysticism but in that of religious 
thought. Browning's optimistic attempt at over- 
coming this discord was not merely Victorian, 
but also prophetic; though smiled at nowadays, 
to be sure, by many of the critical, it has obvi- 
ously met a real need vaguely apprehended by the 
public mind. Other religious or semi- religious- 
thinkers, among them Professor Eucken, have- 
been more or less consciously contributing to the 
coming result. In the meantime, mysticism is-

PROBLEMS OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY.* 



An eminent economic authority of a past genera- 
tion once said that, while production to a large extent 
is governed by fixed and immutable laws, the distri- 
bution of wealth varies according to the laws and 
customs of a country, one being fixed by nature, 
the other by society. If this is true (and there seems 
to be a consensus of opinion in that direction) the 
present industrial unrest is caused by the desire for 
a more equitable distribution of the fruits of human 
toil among the several producers. The capitalist has 
always been able to take care of himself, but now 
the laborer is coming into his own more than ever 
before in industrial history. Both capital and labor 
are indispensable factors in production, and through 
peaceful adjustments of difficulties right understand- 
ing and mutual well-being must be brought about. 
Discontent, to be effective, must express itself ; and 
even if the proposed remedies vary, as they do in 
the four books here considered, the inevitable out- 
come must be social progress. 

Sir Arthur Clay discusses in "Syndicalism and 
Labor" the rise of militant methods in labor circles, 
and adds some notes upon various aspects of social 
and industrial questions of the day. The origin of 
Syndicalism is briefly described, and concerning its 
meaning we read : 

" It may be correctly used to designate the system adopted 
by any association of persons formed to further common 
interests; but in France of late years it has acquired a special 
meaning', and is now generally understood to denote the 
policy of the ' Confederation Gen^rale du Travail,' the object 
of which is the destruction by force of the existing organi- 
sation, and the transfer of industrial capital from its present 
possessors to Syndicalists, or in other words to the revolution- 
ary Trade Unions. The means by which this object is to be 
secured is the General Strike." 

One faction looks to revolutionary methods, while 
the other to constitutional means, to accomplish their 
ends. The intellectual justification of Syndicalism 
in the writings of Sorel is thus stated: 

" In the absence of a virile and energetic middle class, 
human progress is impossible. In these latter days this class 
has become degenerate and cowardly. The only chance for 
its regeneration is that it should, be compelled to fight for 
its existence. The war of classes taught by the doctrine of 
Syndicalism can alone supply this necessary stimulant ; there- 
fore to teach this doctrine is to serve the true interest of 
humanity." 

In other words, Syndicalism is advocated as a relig- 
ion. The larger part of Sir Arthur Clay's book is 
devoted to an historical resumti of the development 
of Syndicalism in France, Sweden, Italy, Spain, and 
the United Kingdom. Then follow chapters on 
trade unionism in England, and the influence upon 
it of growing socialistic sentiment. The position

of the author is that of an extreme Tory, and the 
" sacred rights of property " are emphasized to the 
neglect of even the most conservative and humane 
considerations. All trades unions are regarded as 
necessarily anti-social bodies, and their present tend- 
encies are viewed with alarm. Although written 
almost entirely from secondary sources, and despite 
its reactionary tone, the book contains an interesting 
account of the ideas and growth of Syndicalism. 

Unlike the previous volume, Mr. Portenar's book 
on "Organized Labor" is a discussion of labor prob- 
lems and how to meet them written from a trade- 
union point of view. The author is a member of 
the Typographical Union, and his views are there- 
fore not theoretical but the result of actual experi- 
ence. The lesson to him of the McNamara affair, 
with all its attendant results, is not the necessity for 
a breaking up of trade unionism but for its more 
thorough organization. The way out is by peaceful 
means. Then, after a consideration of some of the 
existing grievances, the author says: 

" Hence the first answer to the question, What shall we 
do ? is a negative. We shall not resort to open or furtive 
violence. Those to whom an ethical reason is sufficient need 
not be urged to refrain from it. Those who see in it a means 
of advancement should be satisfied that the best to be hoped 
from it is temporary gain, certain to be followed by punish- 
ment for the guilty and disaster for the movement. The 
two reasons together should control us all." 

A chapter is then devoted to Syndicalism, and its 
exposition in this country by the Industrial Workers 
of the World. Here also the writer takes the 
evolutionary and not the revolutionary view, and 
condemns the idea of the "irritation" strike as a 
common feature of industrial life. The way out is 
rather by cooperation for mutual benefit and pro- 
tection. Organization by industry as allied trades, 
with arrangements for the arbitration of grievances 
with employers, is strongly urged. But even with 
this ideal realized more or less fully, the strike is 
not to be discarded, because, as in war between 
nations, the strike is a last resource for the work- 
man, when all other efforts for justice have failed. 
Succeeding chapters are devoted to "Insurance 
Benefits," "Co-operative Trading," and related 
topics. The proposal is made that a great co- 
operative society should be formed, to be controlled 
and directed by the international unions, for the sale 
of union-made goods, thus doing away with the 
profits of the middleman and the expensive methods 
of the boycott and the union label. The dominant 
note of the book is one of practical common-sense 
combined with a belief that no problem is settled 
until it is settled right. 

"The New Industrial Day" is described as "a 
book for men who employ men "; and its author, Mr. 
William C. Redfield, a former member of Congress, 
presents in its pages the results of his own experience 
as a manufacturer and as an observer of industrial 
conditions. The thesis of the book is that the work- 
man should be so treated that he may do his best, 
and this involves a wage which has some relation to 
the profit realized from his work. The plea is for

an intelligent development of the workman, and the 
application of brains to business methods. The line 
of least resistance in reducing expenses seems to be 
the reduction of wages, and this is taken by many 
employers ; but the real need is for better methods 
of production and of business management. Says 
Mr. Redfield : 

" Given the scientific spirit in management, constant and 
careful study of operations and details of cost and this is 
the crux of the whole question given the scientific spirit 
in management, constant and careful study of operations 
and details of cost, modern buildings and equipment, proper 
arrangement of plant and proper material, ample power, 
space, and light, a high wage rate means inevitably a low 
labor cost per unit of product and the minimum of labor cost" 

The reality of this statement is brought out in some 
nine chapters by a great wealth of illustration from 
practical experience. The days of the rule of thumb 
are gone, and to keep afloat to-day the manufac- 
turer must cease to be a Bourbon and must really 
understand his business. Particularly pungent and 
refreshing is the chapter entitled " What Have We 
Got to Do with Abroad?" where our failures in 
foreign trade are traced to our neglect to comply 
with the demands of foreign buyers rather than to 
our high wage rate, which is in reality a low product 
rate. Costs and their causes are then dealt with in 
a spirit of inexorable logic, while the influence in 
their reduction of a well-paid and efficient working 
force is clearly brought out. The fact is insisted 
upon and reiterated that we have only gone half- 
way on the industrial road, and that in the light of 
the rise of human values account must be taken of 
the human factor in production as well as of ma- 
chinery and selling. The results coming from a 
scientific spirit in management are shown, and at 
the same time fair dealing with the worker is in- 
sisted upon as a requisite for success. The book is 
based not only upon sound sense but upon sound 
economics; for, as the writer so clearly points out, 
high-priced labor leads to progress, efficiency, and 
improved methods, and these lead in turn to an 
increased output and to greater cheapness of the 
product. 

Fourteen papers, written from many points of 
view, are brought together in "The Outlook for 
Industrial Peace." While lacking to a considerable 
extent any degree of unity, the result is a compre- 
hensive presentation of conditions and tendencies in 
the industrial world. The need of settling disputes 
between employers and employees without resort to 
strikes, and a method of accomplishing such a result, 
is brought out by Mr. Marcus M. Marks in an exposi- 
tion of "The Canadian Industrial Disputes Act." 
The initiative under this act for conciliation comes 
not from the government but from one or the other 
interested party, and results in the appointment of 
a Board of Conciliation and Investigation. Pending 
the investigation of this Board, the service must be 
uninterrupted, under penalty of heavy fines. After 
investigation, a published report is made, but there 
is no compulsion as to acceptance of this report or 
for arbitration. 



" If both parties voluntarily agree to arbitration, well and 
good ; but the act contemplates only investigation and pub- 
licity. After the report of the Board has been published, 
either party is entirely free to strike or lock-out ; the law 
has been complied with when employer and employed per- 
mit the situation to remain unchanged until the end of the 
period of investigation. However, workingmen are quite 
unlikely to risk the dangers of a strike in the face of an 
adverse opinion of such a Board. Similarly, the employer 
will in almost every instance accede to the requests made by 
a fair tribunal." 

The effectiveness of this act is shown by the 
fact that during the past five years only fourteen 
instances out of one hundred and ten disputes so 
referred have resulted in strikes. In the light of 
such a result, it would seem well for our several 
states to adopt such a method. The aims and 
methods of various industrial organizations are 
discussed in the papers on " The National Civic 
Federation and Industrial Peace," by Dr. Seth 
Low ; " The Joint Board of Sanitary Control in the 
Cloak, Suit and Skirt Industry in New York City," 
by Mr. Henry Moskowitz ; " Industrial Betterment 
Activities of the National Metal Trades Association," 
by Mr. Robert Wuest ; and " Industrial Peace Ac- 
tivities of the National Electric Light Association," 
by Mr. Arthur Williams. Then the related topics 
of scientific management and industrial education 
are emphasized in " The Attitude of Labor towards 
Scientific Management," by Mr. Hollis Godfrey; 
" Education and Industrial Peace," by Mr. Herman 
Schneider ; and " Factory Organization in Relation 
to Industrial Education," by Mr. Hugo Diemer. 
The most thoroughgoing paper of all is the one on 
" Conditions Fundamental to Industrial Peace," by 
Mr. George B. Hugo. After a scathing indictment 
of the surrender of the Boston Elevated Railway 
Company to organized labor in the recent strike, 
the assertion is made that there is no choice for 
the individual between the two evils of corporate 
capital and organized labor. Each is as bad as the 
other. Over against these is placed the ideal of 
individual economic freedom. How this is to be 
brought about is not indicated, except in the state- 
ment that " government will again assume its abdi- 
cated function of protecting the individual." But 
large-scale production and big business units are 
already here ; and it is entirely unlikely that in- 
dustry can be forced back into past conditions. In 
conclusion it may be said that industrial peace 
means industrial democracy, and the consequent 
passing of absolute monarchy (not to say despot- 
ism) in industrial relations. The contrast between 
democracy in government and absolute monarchy 
in industry, as now existing, is too glaring an 
anomaly to last. GEORGE MILTON JANES.

RECENT AMERICAN POETRY.* 

In "A Day at Castrogiovanni," Mr. George 
Edward Woodberry has crystallized in noble verse 
the impressions of a happy Sicilian day. It was a 
day five years ago, spent on the site of Demeter's 
temple and in view of Etna. There are three poems : 
a sonnet called "Etna," an ode to "Proserpine," 
and a didactic poem in stanzas upon " Demeter. " 
The sonnet may be given complete: 

" Bird-wakened out of sleep, my darkling eyes 
Saw Etna bloom and whiten in the dawn, 
While over hollow leagues of crag and lawn 

Brightened earth's edge upon the far-set skies ; 

Now, volleying light, the lucid mountain lies 
Transfigured, in the breath of gold updrawn, 
Dim base to rosy plume, and high the wan 

Worn moon turns snow, and worships as it dies. 

" Then o'er the shoulder of that mount in heaven 
Rose like a moon divine, celestial sun, 

The Star to which all glory hath been given, 

The orb of life whence all things here have been. 

The nightingales sang on, and I shall see 
No sight so mighty in tranquillity." 

Of the " Prosperpine " we will quote the closing 
section : 

" O Prosperpine, dream not that thou art gone 

Far from our lives, half -human, half-divine ; 
Thou hast a holier adoration won 

In many a heart that worships at no shrine. 
Where light and warmth behold me, 
And flower and wheat enfold me, 
I lift a dearer prayer than all prayers past ; 
He who so loved thee that the live earth clove 
Before his pathway unto light and love, 
And took thy flower-full blossom, who at last 

Shall every blossom cull, 
Lover the most of what is most our own, 
The mightiest lover that the world has known, 
Dark lover, Death, was he not beautiful." 

The burden of the " Demeter " is that worship is 
one, however diverse the names of its gods and the 
systems to which they belong.

" Lo, I have believed in all the gods in turn, 
And know they have no being but in me ; 
All is the form of what doth inly burn, 

Up from the fetich to eternity ; 
Wherever man doth pray, and finds faith there, 
I kneel beside him and repeat his prayer. 

" Man doth prevail, who masters, age by age, 
The secret forces that through nature ply, 

And with the changes of the mind grows sage, 
Whose faith burns brighter as the old truths die ; 

Truth is the cloud, molded by every storm ; 

Faith, like the rainbow, changes not its form." 

This reminds us of Swinburne's " Hymn of Man," 
without its fierce invective, or of the prelude to the 
" Songs before Sunrise." It expresses the essence 
of the religious belief of the emancipated mind 
which sees life steadily and sees it whole, and echoes 
also the wistful sympathy of such a poem as " Die 
Gotter Griechenlands." Mr. Woodberry's position 
as the first of living American poets would be secure 
without the credit of this new volume ; of its con- 
tents we may simply say that they are entirely 
worthy of the genius that gave us " Wild Eden " 
and The North Shore Watch." 

The contents of Mr. Percy MacKaye's "Uriel and 
Other Poems " are chiefly personal and commemor- 
ative. The pieces have been written for occasions, 
and offer tributes to Moody, Gordon Craig, Peary, 
Browning, Thackeray, and others. The " Uriel " 
of the collection is William Vaughn Moody, who 
is also the subject of another poem, " To the Fire- 
Bringer." We quote some scattered stanzas from 
the titular poem : 

" Because he never wore his sentient heart 
For crows and jays to peck, of ttimes to such 
He seemed a silent fellow, who o'ermuch 
Held from the general gossip-ground apart, 
Or tersely spoke, and tart : 

How should they guess what eagle tore, within, 
His quick of sympathy for humblest smart 
Of human wretchedness, or probed his spleen 
Of scorn against the hypocritic mart ! 

" But special-privileged investitures 
Of beauty liked him not. To him the fact 
Was by its passion only made compact 
Of beauty ; as, amid the Gloucester moors, 
The loveliness, which lures 
The artist's eye, for him was nature's prism 
To illume his love of country : art which endures 
At once is poetry and patriotism, 
In spite of jingoists and epicures." 

Mr. MacKaye's thought is fine and true, but he has 
many forced and infelicitous phrases, and his diction, 
as the close of the above stanza shows, is sometimes 
anything but poetic. The following stanza is ex- 
plained by this note: "Shortly before his death, he 
told a friend about a new drama, on the theme of 
Saint Paul, the outlines of which had come to him 
splendidly as a vision": 

" Darkling those constellations of his soul 
Glimmered, while racks of stellar lightning shot 
The white, creative meteors of thought 
Through that last night, where clad in cloudy stole 
Beside his ebbing shoal 



244 



[March 16, 



Of life-blood stood Saint Paul, blazing a theme 

Of living drama from a fiery scroll 

Across his stretched vision as in dream 

When Death, with blind dark, blotted out the whole." 

In "The Vaunt of Man, and Other Poems," Mr. 
William Ellery Leonard has given us a detailed and 
intimate relation of the adventures of his soul in 
far-off lands and the realms of gold which literature 
discloses to the seeker, adventures with faiths and 
ideals, with " men of high report," with love and life. 
His poems are intensely intellectualized, and shaped 
in the mould which results from a wide acquaint- 
ance with literature and with the currents of 
thought that have flowed down through the ages. 
Mr. Leonard is no experimenter, and has no con- 
cern with the freakishness in which the feeble find 
their last resort. His temper may fairly be called 
academic, which is not to our mind a term of dis- 
praise, albeit his outlook and his moods are distinctly 
modern. The sonnet is his favorite form, and he 
thus uses it to state his poetical programme or con- 
fession of faith: 

" I would make mention of primeval things, 
Oceans, horizons, rains, and winds that bear 
Moist seeds from isle to isle, caves, mountain air 
And echoes, clouds and shadows of their wings 
On lakes or hillsides, autumns after springs 
In starlight, sleep and breathing and the blare 
Of life's reveille, love, birth, death, and care 
Of sunken graves of peasants as of kings. 

The wide world over, 

O be bold, be free ! 

Strip off this perfumed fabric from your verse, 
Tear from your windows all the silk and lace ! 
And stand, man, woman, on the slope by me, 
O once again before the universe, 
O once again with Nature face to face ! " 

It may be said that the writer keeps fairly true to 
the line thus marked out for himself. In the follow- 
ing piece he strikes a note that was sounded for 
us by Arnold and Sill : 

" Our life is threefold ; toil for daily bread, 
A little vintage and a little oil, 
Consumes the middle day ; and after toil, 
When golden sunlight (else for joyance shed) 
Once more behind the hill or holt is sped, 
Then sleep must take us from the stars and foil 
The joyance of the splendor-night and coil 
Around us dreary shades or dreams of dread ; 

" But in the space between our toil and sleep, 
An hour at level dawn, at eve an hour, 
A sacred watch we keep, or ought to keep : 
Then stands the soul at peace, as in a tower, 
And hears the world's eternal music sweep, 
And knows its heritage of light and power." 

Mr. Leonard's poems are good to read and to pon- 
der over. They get at the realities of life, and 
have something worth while to say about them ; and 
always in a grave, measured, and exalted expression. 

Happy the poet who can sing from his heart : 

" Yes, I have been in Avalon, 
The faery Isle in faery seas ; 
Therefore it is my face is wan, 
My heart at peace remembering these. 
It may not be, and yet I seem 
Forever waking from a dream.'' 



If he can say this, he will walk among men apart, 
taking fortune's buffets and rewards with equal 
thanks, with only pity in his heart for those who 
look at him askance and call him visionary or ideal- 
ist. The great army of philistines, their thought 
fixed upon mean ideals, will bestow upon him neither 
their understanding nor their applause, but he will 
be sure of his reward despite their purblind disre- 
gard. Mr. Madison Cawein, whose song we have 
just echoed, is one of those whose consecration to the 
poetic calling has long been attested, and his new 
volume, " The Poet, the Fool, and the Faeries," was 
not needed to make sure his election to the company 
of our approved singers. We must find space for 
one of these new lyrics, and our choice shall be " In 
the Deep Forest." 

" In the deep forest when the lightning played, 
Pallid and frail a wilding flower swayed, 
Lifting its blossom from the streaming sod, 
Trembling and fearful, like a child dismayed, 
Who in the darkness has forgotten God. 

" In the deep forest, in the thunder's roll, 
Face to pale face I met with my own soul ; 
And in its eyes were trouble and alarm, 
Like that which held the heaven from pole to pole, 
And doubt of God above the night and storm. 

" In the deep forest, when the tempest passed, 
The flower smiled unbroken of the blast ; 
And in the forest, as the day dre-w on, 
Hand in pale hand, with sure eyes upward cast, 
My soul and I stood confident of dawn." 

One little chink may be found for this exquisite bit 
of imagery : 

" Godiva-like, the moon rode into sight, 
Cautious, yet confident that no one sees ; 
The naked moon, astonishing the night, 
Brightening the thoroughfares of all the trees : 
Holding her course unfaltering and sure, 
Knowing herself as beautiful as pure." 

Mr. Cawein is not, as far as we know, a popular 
poet ; his verses are not sought after by the news- 
papers, nor do they offer the combination of slangi- 
ness and sentiment which appeals to the host of 
readers who think they like poetry without having 
the remotest notion of what it really is. But he has 
long been sure of his following among those whose 
judgment really counts, and for whom poetry to 
be poetry must be a deep interpretation of nature 
and the soul of man. 

In a new "Vagabondia" volume this time 
without the collaboration of Richard Hovey Mr. 
Bliss Carman once more rings the changes upon the 
old themes of nature's pageant, the legendary lore 
of the past, and the joys of the care-free life under 
the sun on the open road. The following is typical : 

" We travelled empty-handed 
With hearts all fear above, 
For we ate the bread of friendship, 
We drank the wine of love. 

" Through many a wondrous autumn, 
Through many a magic spring, 
We hailed the scarlet banners, 
We heard the blue-bird sing.

THE DIAL

" We looked on life and nature 
With the eager eyes of youth, 
And all we asked or cared for 
Was beauty, joy, and truth. 

" We found no other -wisdom, 
We learned no other way, 
Than the gladness of the morning, 
The glory of the day. 

''So all our earthly treasure 
Shall go with us, my dears, 
Aboard the Shadow Liner, 
Across the sea of years." 

This pretty, facile stuff is anything but difficult to 
write, and it goes out of one ear as quickly as it goes 
into the other. Mr. Carman properly calls these 
pieces "Echoes," we might have read them all 
before without now being conscious of the fact. And 
we must considerably qualify the praise bestowed 
on a poet who is capable of writing "Me for there ! " 
as the ending of a lyric of yearning for the beauty 
of a scene known in the past. 

Of Mr. Hermann Hagedorn's "Poems and Bal- 
lads," the ballads are better than the poems, but 
they are too long to reproduce. If we were to choose 
one for that purpose, it would be "The Devil and 
St. Donat," which opens thus: 

" The Devil hath made him a ship 

To bear the sinful souls ; 
He hath made it well of roots from Hell, 
And sulphur and brimstone and coals." 

To say "sulphur and brimstone" is like saying 
" poems and ballads." Of the pieces which the au- 
thor is content to describe as poems, the sonnet on 
our national infamy of repudiating the Panama treaty 
with England shows us that the poets are ever watch- 
ful of our country's honor. It is addressed to the 
Senate. 

" Blind guardians of the glory of our land, 

Defenders of our fame, what have you done ? 
Crying! Our holiest pledges every one 

Are idle words writ on the windy sand ! 

How shameless at the judgment do we stand ! 
Through cynic Europe hear the laughter run ; 
Shrewd Machiavellis mocking as they shun 

The great republic of the faithless hand ! 

" Yea, we are great, but not by juggled phrases ! 
Yea, we are strong, but not by troth denied ! 

The age is full of change and insecure ; 
Hot in the fevered blood of nations blazes 
The strife of souls. Only by clear-descried 
Intrepid equity can we endure." 

Mr. John Hall Wheelock discourses thus of " The 
New Love ": 

" Before the morning I arose and went 

Over the snowy meadows clear and cold, 
And with the dawn a deep and new content 
Awoke in me. Farewell, dear love of old. 

" Now that I love you, what is there to say ! 

Who would have harmed you, what shall now be said ! 
The morning wind has purged it all away. 
Before this love all the old lusts lie dead. 



" The holier love more deep than all desire 
Into my spirit from the morning came, 
Out of the sacred and the whitening Fire 
It rose within me like a silent flame ; 

" And the winds blew it to me from the west, 

Over the sad fields of unbroken snow, 

Patient and pure as your own naked breast 

And hopeless as our love of long ago. 1 ' 

The verses sound as if they meant something, but 
close scrutiny discloses little more than inarticulate 
emotion tricked out with imagery. We quote this 
poem, and make this comment upon it, because 
most of the contents of Mr. Wheelock's volume, 
"The Beloved Adventure," invite similar observa- 
tions. Gauzy fancies and nebulous ideas abound in 
his collection, but we rarely find in it either clear-cut 
thought or lyric rapture. Moreover, Mr. Wheelock's 
verses are somewhat freer in form than is permis- 
sible to anyone not an approved master. It is only 
at great risk that a minor poet may attempt what 
a Verlaine or a Whitman is free to do without 
censure. 

" The Call " of the poet is thus apprehended by- 
Mr. Selden L. Whitcomb : 

" Sing no more of the meadow brook 
That wanders amid the grasses ; 
Sing no more of the lover's look 
When the careless maiden passes ; 

But sing of passion that endureth, large, 
Sweeping the soul to life's untrodden marge. 

" Sing of Peruvian peaks that rise 

In silence, barren, regal; 
Unseen, unsought of human eyes, 
Too lonely for the eagle ; 

Where only the winds of God are unafraid 
To search the eternal terrors He has made." 

It is a tonic prescription, but Mr. Whitcomb does, 
not seem to apply it very resolutely to his own case,, 
for he has much to say of birds and flowers and 
lovers. Nevertheless, he has force here and there,, 
and sometimes sounds a resonant note, as in " My 
Own." 

" I would suck the bitter, perilous fruits, 
I would chew the bark of nauseous roots, 
I would gnaw the wolf's abandoned bone, 
If I might find my own. 

" Lash me atop the swaying mast 
Amid the sleet and the midnight blast 
That bends with the breaking vessel's groan,. 
If I may find my own. 

" Shackle my feet and bind my hands, 
Bear me a slave to deadly lands 
To strike all day on the stubborn stone, 
If I may find my own. 

" I would woo the fever's wasting heat 
With the taunting demons at my feet, 
The sunken eyes whence reason has flown, 
If I might find my own. 

'' Tear off the wreath the master gave, 
And break the marble over my grave 
To be by brambles overgrown 
If I may find my own."

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



For a collection of first poems, the " Interpreta- 
tions " of Miss Zoe' Akins are distinctly promising. 
She has grace, passion, and sensuous charm, and 
her ear for music is keen and sure. This little 
lyric is a singularly haunting thing : 

" I am the wind that wavers, 
You are the certain land ; 
I am the shadow that passes 
Over the sand. 

" I am the leaf that quivers, 

You the unshaken tree ; 
You are the stars that are steadfast, 
I am the sea. 

" You are the light eternal, 

Like a torch I shall die, . . . 
You are the surge of deep music, 
I but a cry! " 

These lines from the long poem " Mary Magdalen," 
reflecting the courtesan's thoughts after the vision 
has come to her, show how well the writer has 
mastered the subtleties of blank verse : 

" What if my hands be white mine eyes like pools 
Made deeper by the shade of standing reeds ? 
What if my house be still and beautiful ? 
My slaves as fair and fleet and soft of foot 
As Aphrodite's doves? What if I live 
As long in legend as that Spartan queen 
For whom a war was made in perished Troy, 
And whose gold hair shall flame when stars are dark ? 
I care no more to watch the wandering moon 
Launched like a burning galley in the sky, 
Or swinging like a lantern through the clouds, 
And from the even-hour I hide my head." 

From the tender and heart-felt tribute " In Memory 
of Swinburne," we take these two stanzas : 

" Not all of England's armies, nor her ships, 
Could leave, as thou, 
Her language on a million singing lips, 
Alien till now ; 

" And that the land that bore thee leaves unsaid 
Praise for thy name, 

And does not lay the laurel o'er thee, dead, 
Is thy land's shame." 

Mrs. Alice Corbin Henderson's little book of 
verse invites such epithets as iridescent, fantastic, 
and ethereal. Her lyrics are not easily reducible 
to any form of intellectual statement, and their 
appeal is through music and delicate imagery, sug- 
gesting not a little the measures of the Celts who 
have been troubling the poetic waters of late years. 
One of them is frankly styled a "Reve Celtique," a 
title which these stanzas justify: 

' For Danu, Lir, and Cleena with light feet, 
Who tossed the bubble of the world away. 
And with light laughter, music low and sweet, 
Covered it over and left it till a day, 

" Have vanished with their softly waving spells, 
Their flame-white dances and bright hair wind-tossed 
Sadder than deaths the wars of worlds have cost, 
The keening of the winds in these low dells : 



"While we have turned from beauty and have lost 
Our sense of aneient kinship with the earth, 
Under the running wave the flaming host 
Dance in the heart of time and knew no birth." 

Sometimes the verses are conceits, as in Pygmalion's 
description of his beloved statue: 

" Her waist is the faint horizon 

Where night and day are drawn, 
Her low left hip is the twilight, 

And her right hip is the dawn. 
Her breasts are hills of widsom, 

And the pale pink rose 
Of the summit is veiled with marble, 

Where the color comes and goes," 

or, as in " Moon of Peace ": 

" Lap me in scented waters, moon of peace, 
In silver waters flowing under the moon, 
For now the water-bearer's pouring flood 
Pours rivers of silver peace under the moon, 
The dragon is killed, the archer's arrow sped, 
The bearded goat has trampled out the wine, 
And now the water-bearer's pouring flood 
Pours rivers of silver peace and silver wine." 

They are very pretty conceits, and their astronomy 
is not ar fault. But we must represent this volume 
by at least one complete poem, and " Nodes " is the 
one that seems to us the best single example of 
Mrs. Henderson's work : 

" The endless, foolish merriment of stars 
Beside the pale cold sorrow of the moon, 
Is like the wayward noises of the world 
Beside my heart's uplifted silent tune. 

" The little broken glitter of the waves 
Beside the golden sun s intent white blaze, 
Is like the idle chatter of the crowd 
Beside my heart's unwearied song of praise. 

" The sun and all the planets in the sky 
Beside the sacred wonder of dim space, 
Are notes upon a broken, tarnished lute 
That God will some day mend and put in place. 

" And space, beside the little secret joy 
Of God that sings forever in the clay, 
Is smaller than the dust we cannot see 
That yet dies not, till time and space decay. 

" And as the foolish merriment of stars 
Beside the cold pale sorrow of the moon, 
My little song, my little joy, my praise, 
Beside God's ancient, everlasting rune." 

Mrs. Florence Earle Coates is a poet who is con- 
tent with the old forms of expression, and who holds 
fast to the old sanities of thought. This alone is much 
in an age when so many of the followers of the muse 
are given over to f reakishness, and when originality 
at any cost is held to be necessary to arrest the atten- 
tion. Mrs. Coates keeps to the tried and safe ways, 
and makes her appeal neither by stridency nor 
eccentricity. Sometimes she gives beautiful voice 
to an abstract idealism, as in the closing page of her 
new volume, where we find an injunction to " Dream 
the Great Dream ": 



1913] 



THE DIAI, 



247 



"Dream the Great Dream, though you should dream 

you, only, 

And friendless follow in the lofty quest, 
Though the dream lead you to a desert lonely, 
Or drive you, like the tempest, without rest, 
Yet, toiling upward to the highest altar, 

There lay before the gods your gift supreme 
A human heart whose courage did not falter 
Though distant as Arcturus shone the Gleam. 

"The Gleam ? Ah, question not if others see it, 

Who nor the yearning nor the passion share ; 
Grieve not if children of the earth decree it 

The earth, itself their goddess, only fair ! 
The soul has need of prophet and redeemer : 

Her outstretched wings against her prisoning bars, 
She waits for truth ; and truth is with the dreamer, 

Persistent as the myriad light of stars." 

It is love in the high spiritual sense of the mystics 
and the saints, rather than in the grosser vision of 
the sensualists, that is enshrined in these verses on 
"Eros": 

" I, who am love, come clothed in mystery, 
As rose my beauteous mother from the sea, 

Veiling my luminous wings from mortal sight 
Whether at noon or in the star-strewn night 
That I may pass unrecognized and free. 

" Ignoring them that idly seek for me 
Unto mine own, from all eternity 

I come with heart aflame and torch alight 
I who am Love ! 

" What bring I them ? Ah, draughts that sweeter be 
Than willing waters of Callirhoe ! 

What give I them ? Life ! even in Death's despite ; 
And upward still I lead them to the height 
Of an immortal passion's purity ! 
I who am Love." 

Most of the poems in this collection are of the occa- 
sional class, suggested now by the death of a great 
man, now by a news-item, now by an intimate 
personal experience. The tendency to moralize is 
perhaps a little too pronounced, but the idealism is 
always fine, and the emotional note rich and com- 
pelling. 

As the title indicates, Miss Robinson's "The Call 
of Brotherhood and Other Poems " voices the newly- 
awakened social conscience of our time, the humani- 
tarian feeling that is so intense as to be somewhat 
reckless in the choice of instruments for the attain- 
ment of its goal. "The Great Question " Voices the 
perplexed state of mind of many a worker for the 
cause of humankind : 

" My heart is weary with the world's distress, 
The cry of those who struggle in the night. 
Oh ! Lord, who sent thy Son for our redress, 
We pray thee as of old ' Let there be light ! ' 
I would not ask the ' Why ' nor pierce the veil ; 
All that I long for is to know, behind 
The torture, and the terror, and the wail 
Of human woe, there is no cruel, blind, 
Unreasoning Chance, that hurls us here and there, 
Victims of an insensate Tyranny ; 
I would not ask the Cause, but this my prayer 
To know there is a Cause for Misery ; 
Could I but see the working of Thy Hand 
I should be willing not to understand." 

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

Ripe reflections Contributed originally to a religious 
on life's weekly journal, the little essays in 

minor problems. "Along the Road (p utna m), by 
Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson, are not unnaturally 
devoted largely to questions of conduct, to specula- 
tions on the great mysteries by which our every-day 
life is surrounded, and to such personal reminiscences 
as have a bearing on the spiritual problems that con- 
front all thoughtful persons throughout life. Treat- 
ing the commonest of daily experiences with the 
geniality and the insight that lend charm to his dis- 
cussion of whatever topic, Mr. Benson here gives 
his readers a new sense of the height and depth and 
illimitable richness of existence. Ethical questions 
alternate with glimpses of great men and bits of 
nature-study and description. Such subjects of uni- 
versal interest as conversation, tactfulness, pride, 
reading, absent-mindedness, gossip, letter-writing, 
jealousy, sympathy, and sincerity, form the staple of 
his well-considered and often suggestive and stimu- 
lating talk in most of these brief chapters. Concern- 
ing interruptions, for example, he well says that 
"there is no form of self-discipline to be compared 
to that which can be practised by dealing with little 
tiresome engagements and interviews and interrup- 
tions in a perfectly tranquil and good-humoured way, 
giving the whole of one's attention to the matter in 
hand, and not allowing the visitor to feel that he is 
being hurried or that he has intruded." The fol- 
lowing is pertinent to the season: "I do not at all 
like the languor, about three degrees this side of 
faintness, which Keats said was one of the luxuries 
of spring; I like to be judiciously and temperately 
frozen, when all that one does is sharp-set and has 
a keen edge on it." A story of Alpine experience, 
which he entitles " The Face of Death," and which 
describes his narrow escape from falling into a cre- 
vasse, reminds one of Leslie Stephen's harrowing 
narrative of "A Bad Five Minutes in the Alps," 
except that Stephen's tale is fictitious and covers 
forty-eight pages, while the other is undoubtedly 
true, and (chiefly for that reason) takes only seven 
pages in the telling. Mr. Benson is thoroughly 
enjoyable in these latest essays of his, even though 
they are sometimes in the nature of miniature 

sermons. 

One of the most voluminous of re- 

Cent W0rks deali "S with the ent 

is Mr. Lancelot Lawton's "Empires 
of the Far East " (Small, Maynard & Co.). During 
the period of preparation, two of the three empires 
dealt with Korea and China changed their 
status; but the original title was retained and the 
narrative brought down to March, 1912, while the 
splendid map shows the Republic of China. It is 
difficult to summarize the contents of these bulky 
volumes. The 1571 pages of text are divided into 
eighty-four chapters of varying length. At least 
a thousand pages, comprising forty-three chapters,

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



are devoted to Japan, "for the reason that she is 
the first Oriental country within modern history 
to be accorded a place of front rank among the 
Powers of the world." These chapters deal with the 
geography and history, the administrative, social, 
economic, financial, and industrial conditions of that 
empire, the war of 1904-5, and the problems of the 
Pacific. Seven chapters, comprising seventy pages, 
describe conditions in Korea since the Japanese 
occupation, while an eighth treats of the other colo- 
nial possessions of Japan. Manchuria is considered 
in eighteen chapters of 250 pages, receiving some- 
what more attention than China, which is dealt with 
in fourteen chapters of 214 pages. In the case of 
China the narrative is concerned solely with the 
reform movement, the recent revolution, and the 
establishment of the Republic. It is difficult also 
to estimate the value of this elaborate piece of work. 
Mr. Lawton tells us that "Hitherto the critics of 
our allies have been met with the charge of failure 
to substantiate their statements. Consequently I 
have taken special pains to produce chapter and 
verse for all that is written." If this were the case 
the work might be almost invaluable, but as a matter 
of fact exact citations are rarely given. Such state- 
ments as " I have it on the authority of an American 
Consul" and "the notable speech delivered some 
years ago by Sir Thomas Sutherland " hardly consti- 
tute a citation of "chapter and verse." Throughout, 
Mr. Lawton is a vigorous critic of the Japanese 
We learn that "to America, Japan has become 
what in Europe Germany has so long been to Great 
Britain "; that in Manchuria "the policy persistently 
pursued by the Japanese since the war has been 
. . . one of deception and despoliation "; and it is 
certainly a new interpretation of history to assert 
that the exclusion policy of the Tokugawas " was the 
outcome of a petty and primal arrogance which 
dictated a savage hatred of other peoples and an 
ignorant contempt for their ways." The volumes 
do contain, however, a great mass of valuable inform- 
ation concerning the most recent happenings in the 
Far East. 



Folk-tales Ten ^ a ^ es from an old woman, who 

from the in turn had heard them from her 

fforff eous East. gran dmother, two from an old 
Brahman, three from an old barber, and from 
another old Brahman enough more to make twenty- 
two, such was the farrago offered by the Rev. 
Lai Behari Day in his "Folk-tales of Bengal," 
published originally thirty years ago, and now re- 
issued by the Macmillan Co. in a "colour-book" 
edition, printed on heavy paper in large type and 
illustrated with no less than thirty-two full-page 
pictures by Mr. Warwick Goble. Now, the present 
reviewer admits frankly that he is a lover both of 
folk-tales and of almost anything Indian, so his 
judgment may not be quite as trustworthy as he 
tries to believe ; but to him the book was very wel- 
come, and its merits seemed to justify fully its 
reappearance in such a new and elaborate dress. 



Brahmans, and rakshasas, and gold-mohurs; mar- 
vellous horses called pakshirajes or kings of birds ; 
elephants that are king-makers; the kapila cow that 
gave milk whenever it was needed; the hiraman, or 
green-gem parrot, that " not only replied intelligently 
to every question the king put, but recited to him 
the names of the three hundred and thirty millions 
of the gods of the hindu pantheon"; toontooni eggs 
that hatch into beautiful maidens ; the boy with the 
moon on his forehead; the child suckled by seven 
mothers ; gardens of heavenly scented flowers ; 
wonder-working jewels guarded by serpent kings, 
who would not hear about them all? Then there 
is the popular life and popular wisdom that always 
appear in the folk-tale, whether it is told beneath 
the Bear of the North or the Cross of the South. 
And through every page breathes that haunting 
spirit of the Orient which attracts an occidental so 
irresistibly, if it attracts him at all. The author 
vouches for his material in these words: "I have 
reason to believe that the stories are a genuine 
sample of the old, old stories told by Bengali women 
from age to age through a hundred generations"; 
but a punctilious critic might question whether two 
or three of the narratives are folk-tales in the strict 
sense of the word. However, neither this point nor 
a few minor defects need interfere with the pleasure 
of any reader who has a taste for popular tales and 
the gorgeous East. 

Character ^ considerable amount of interest 

building is being manifested throughout the 

in school. educational world to-day in the prob- 

lem of moral training in the schools. Most people 
seem to think that school children should receive 
ethical instruction, but there is little agreement 
respecting the way in which this should be accom- 
plished. The French people have elaborated a 
course of moral instruction, beginning with the 
earliest school year and continuing on through the 
Iyc6e; but American teachers have not had much 
confidence in this system, because it has seemed too 
formal. Miss Jane Brownlee, in her volume en- 
titled " Character Building in School " (Houghton 
Mifflin Co.), presents a method of moral instruc- 
tion for young children which does not seem as rigid 
and mechanical as the French system. Her methods 
were worked out in the public schools of Toledo, 
Ohio, and they have attracted favorable attention. 
As administered by Miss Brownlee herself, the sys- 
tem accomplished a good deal in making her pupils 
conscious of ethical principles, and observant of these 
in their daily lives. Her plan aims to lead children 
to form clear and accurate notions regarding the 
duties of everyday life. The teacher is simply a 
guide to the children in working out ethical prob- 
lems. Miss Brownlee presents most of the questions 
which she would ask children on any topic, and in- 
dicates just how she would guide her pupils to reach 
sound conclusions in regard to their conduct in daily 
life. This book should be of genuine service to all 
who have to do with the training of young children.

But if a teacher should attempt to use it as a French 
instructor often uses his text-book on ethics, it is 
doubtful if good results would follow. The success 
of a method of this sort depends largely upon the 
personality and attitude of the teacher. The relation 
between teacher and child must be wholly natural, 
unaffected, spontaneous. The questions must seem 
to the pupil to come directly out of his daily experi- 
ence, and not to be thrust upon him from the outside. 
In the hands of a formalist, work of this sort would 
be as likely to do harm as good. It seems to the 
present reviewer that Miss Brownlee has included 
too much in her plan. She has tried to cover all 
the ethical relations of pupils, whereas it would seem 
better to limit the instruction in the youngest years 
to those relations which are most prominent in a 
child's adjustments to those about him. It is prob- 
ably impossible to build up effective ethical notions 
about relations which have not yet been assumed, or 
to think straight about duties beyond the experience 
of the child at the time he is being instructed. 

Ten women Women as champions of worthy 
of light and causes are more and more making 
leading. tne j r i n fl uen ce felt, though not always 

of late in the most womanly manner. Ten who did 
succeed in being reformers without ceasing to be 
women are made the subject of a useful and very 
readable book by Mr. Elmer C. Adams, with the 
collaboration of Professor Warren Dunham Foster. 
" Heroines of Modern Progress " (Sturgis & Walton 
Co.) presents in compact and attractive form the 
chief events in the lives of Elizabeth Fry, Mary 
Lyon, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Harriet Beecher 
Stowe, Florence Nightingale, Clara Barton, Julia 
Ward Howe, Frances E. Willard, J. Ellen Foster, 
and Miss Jane Addams the record being neces- 
sarily, and fortunately, incomplete in the case of the 
last-named. The volume has been prepared to help 
meet a demand for "adequate short biographies of 
those women who have done the most for the world's 
progress during the last century," and is designed 
especially for "young women of from twelve to 
thirty," as the preface explains. A six-page chron- 
ological table at the end shows interestingly the 
overlapping and interlocking of the ten lives related, 
and gives an idea of their connection with some of 
the great reform movements of the last hundred 
years. In the body of the book, facts and dates and 
statistics are wisely made subordinate to more gen- 
eral and more largely significant matters ; but this 
course has not quite succeeded in avoiding all errors 
of statement. One, at least, arrests attention, in the 
account of Mrs. Howe. "In the late sixties," we are 
told, "Mrs. Howe watched with the interest of a 
traveler and a linguist the progress of the Franco- 
Prussian war. Her mature conclusion was that the 
war had been hatched up by politicians for political 
reasons, without any heat whatever on the part of 
the soldiers who fought in it. The war had been 
won and lost, and thousands of lives had been 
snuffed out." But the war did not begin until the 



summer of 1870; its first rumblings go back no 
further than June of that year. Moreover, it may 
be questioned whether Mrs. Howe's interest in the 
war was primarily that of " a traveler and a lin- 
guist." Portraits of the ten heroines of progress 
are appropriately inserted, and a short introduction 
by Mrs. Ellen M. Henrotin opens the volume. 

A summer in In the form of a j^nal extending 
an amateur from March 1 to October 12, of some 
farmer's life. evidently recent year, the story of 
Mrs. Henry Wade Rogers's experience as an amateur 
farmer on a small New Jersey estate inherited or 
otherwise acquired from her maternal grandfather 
is agreeably told. " The Journal of a Country 
Woman " (Eaton & Mains) is the name she gives to 
her book. It is small, well illustrated, well printed, 
and fragrant throughout with odors of the farm and 
the field. The Palisades of the Hudson are near by, 
and the whole environment presents itself as all but 
ideal for the agricultural experiment entered upon 
with zest by the writer all the more so because of 
the manifest sufficiency of material as well as mental 
resources with which she essays her task. Of her 
conception of the dignity and difficulty of the farmer's 
calling, she leaves the reader in no doubt. " In advis- 
ing my young college friends," she says, " to choose 
farming as a lifework the God-ordained work for 
mankind I discriminate, and advise only the 
specially bright and energetic ones to take it up, 
the honor men. A mediocre man may earn a scanty 
living in law, medicine, the ministry, or other lines, 
but he could hardly worry a living out of the soil. 
Brains, energy, and insight must go to make the 
successful modern farmer." She might have added 
capital to the other prerequisites. Quotations from 
Whitman, Gilder, Dr. Van Dyke, and other poets 
and prose-writers appropriately diversify the narra- 
tive. Apparently Mrs. Rogers is planning to con- 
tinue the agricultural enterprise so auspiciously 
begun, even though she is forced to delegate its 
immediate management to someone else for some 
months in the winter. Hers is a book to make one 
long for a grand-paternal farm in the beautiful 
Hudson valley, with a grand-paternal fortune to 
spend in making it rejoice and blossom as the rose* 

A book on evolution which says 
so ethi g really new is by way of 
being an extraordinary phenomenon, 
whether regarded from a literary or a scientific 
standpoint. To be sure, much that is novel in the 
way of fact or principle is being added just now to 
the sum of knowledge about the factors of evolution ; 
but such contributions are, in the first instance, 
almost invariably to be found in some biological 
journal or the proceedings of some learned society. 
So when a book like Professor R. E. Lloyd's " The 
Growth of Groups in the Animal Kingdom " ( Long- 
mans) appears, with a mass of new and pertinent 
facts, analyzed in a critical and unorthodox manner, 
it constitutes an event worthy of special mention.

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



As a consulting zoologist of the Indian Plague Com- 
mission, Dr. Lloyd had the opportunity of examin- 
ing many thousand rats collected in all parts of India 
through the exterminatory activity of that commis- 
sion. In the course of this examination specimens 
were found from time to time which differed from 
all known species of rats in particulars which had 
been and are used by systematic zoologists as the 
basis for distinguishing species. These findings led 
Dr. Lloyd to speculate as to the probable origin of 
these aberrant groups of rats. The present book is 
the outcome of these speculations. It opens with a 
careful critical discussion of the concept of a natural 
species. The treatment of this perplexing subject is 
excellent. It clearly and convincingly sets forth the 
essentially artificial and unnatural way in which the 
problem of species separation and description is 
handled by practical working taxonomists. Having 
cleared the ground in this way, the author proceeds 
to describe in detail his own results in regard to the 
nature, origin, and distribution of new " groups " of 
rats, which one may or may not call "species" as he 
chooses. Cogent evidence is adduced to show that 
these new natural groups arise by mutation, and that 
natural selection has nothing to do with their origin. 
The concluding chapters are devoted to the discus- 
sion of the results of similar purport obtained by 
other workers, and to an exposition of the author's 
general philosophy of evolution. The book is a sub- 
stantial contribution to the literature of evolution. 

The human Under the somewhat arresting title of 
basis of "Human Quintessence," Dr. Sigurd 

our life. Ibsen (once premier of Norway and 

a son of the dramatist) has written a work which 
even the professional philosophers, into whose pre- 
serves the author boldly enters, must acknowledge 
as most suggestive and stimulating, and one which 
the unprejudiced reader is quite likely to hail as a 
true and an emancipating book. Like many other 
thinkers and laymen, Dr. Ibsen has tired of the 
spirit in which, for the last half century, the great 
problems of human life have been approached. Dur- 
ing that time, some such abstraction from natural 
phenomena as the struggle for existence or the 
dogma of utilitarianism, or the dogma that man is 
nothing but the product of heredity and material 
environment, has been taken as a starting point, and 
from it rules of human conduct have been laid down. 
Dr. Ibsen objects to all such criterions of life on the 
ground that they are artificial. We may know, intel- 
lectually, he says, that we are not the central beings 
of the universe. We may be Copernican in creed. 
But such knowledge has never been emotionalized 
and made part of our springs of action. When we 
actively live we must do it on a Ptolemaic basis 
that is to say, we must regard our humanity as the 
centre of things and always act in reference to that 
rather than to any extra-human standpoint. And 
the distinctively human thing about us, he further 
says, is that self-conscious use of reason by which we 
can mould our destinies as we will. Hence he out- 



lines a social policy that will remind the reader of 
the social rationalism of the eighteenth century. In 
fact, he frankly avows belief in the " eighteenth- 
century belief nowadays so despised that social 
systems are capable of being reconstructed from the 
beginning and on a strictly reasonable basis." It is 
easy to scoff at such a view as this, but Dr. Ibsen 
is not alone in trying to resuscitate it, and his book 
may be cordially recommended as an offset to some 
of our more uncritical brands of social psychology.

A gallery of ^ r ' Francis Gribble's busy pen has 
Devonshire been at work noting down the many 
worthies. illustrious names associated more or 

less closely with the county of Devon, and chroni- 
cling some of the things said and done by the bearers 
of those names. "The Romance of the Men of 
Devon" (Little, Brown & Co.) is in plan and scope 
somewhat after the pattern of the same author's 
"Romance of the Oxford Colleges," being a chatty 
and entertaining book abounding in curious informa- 
tion and anecdote not likely to be already familiar 
to the reader. The great names that any mention 
of Devonshire calls up are, of course, those of Walter 
Raleigh, Joshua Reynolds, Coleridge, Humphrey 
Gilbert, Francis Drake, John Davis, Charles Kings- 
ley, James Anthony Froude, and Richard Blackmore; 
but there are also many more Devon men of note, 
such as Thomas Bodley, the judicious Hooker, Miles 
Coverdale, Benjamin Robert Haydon, John Gay, 
Philip Gosse, the naturalist, and his son Edmund. 
Thomas Newcomen receives conspicuous honor at 
Mr. Gribble's hands as a Dartmouth man and the 
real inventor of the steam engine, James Watt and 
his bubbling tea-kettle to the contrary notwithstand- 
ing. At the other end of the scale stands Jack 
Rattenbury, "as hard as nails, and an ingenious 
rascal to boot. He hit upon the subtle device of 
smuggling lace in the interior of disembowelled 
geese," but found in the end that the way of the 
transgressor is hard. Not all the persons so agree- 
ably mentioned in Mr. Gribble's pages have very 
much to do with Devonshire, but they help to fill 
out a readable volume. Good illustrations abound, 
but the index to be expected at the end of such a 
work is lacking.

tion of a rigid adherence to the old natural rights 
philosophy, the advocacy of Jesuit teachings, the 
frequent and unwarranted use of slang, and the 
extended glorification of the Church fathers. In 
no way can the book be looked upon as a contribu- 
tion to the literature of Socialism. The author 
discloses the grossest ignorance concerning not only 
the more fundamental ideas underlying the socialist 
movement, but also the developments which have 
taken place in the fields of philosophy, political 
science, and economics since the opening of the 
nineteenth century. He declares man to be "a

moral being, with inalienable personal rights and 
an eternal destiny"; he maintains that "God made 
the family" and "established civil society"; while 
he looks upon the State, not as "the output of mere 
economic conditions " or as " the dynamic expression 
of material evolution," but on the contrary as "a 
natural institution with well defined rights and 
duties, limited by the prior rights and duties of the 
family and of the individual." Any group of men, 
or any movement, which looks at these matters from 
any other viewpoint, is to be condemned most vigor- 
ously as being detrimental to the welfare of society. 
Destructively, the author attempts to show that So- 
cialism is " non-natural, if not unnatural," and that 
it is opposed to religion, the home, and to personal 
and property rights. Life under Socialism "would 
be as deadly dull as that seen in a boarding house, 
a charity school, or a barrack room." Construc- 
tively, Father Vaughan advances the idea that "if 
the old Catholic laws about pi'operty, and the obliga- 
tions attaching to it, were once more brought into 
general practice, we should find ourselves many mile- 
stones nearer to a solution of our present-day social 
problems." Other than this, he proposes nothing more 
definite as a Catholic solution of the problem than a 
"Triple Alliance" of "the Church, the State, and 
Private Initiative, working in harmonious accord." 

The scenery In " Highways and Byways of Som- 
and records of erset " (Macmillan), Mr. Edward 
Somersetshire. Hutton writes with even more than 
his usual enthusiasm. For in Somerset was the 
home of his childhood, and the glamor of the child's 
vision still rests upon the land. From a neighboring 
hill-top, he believed it was the world that lay spread 
out beneath him. He saw its cities, Bristol, the 
port of the sea ; Bath, upon the hills ; Wells, half- 
hidden in avalley ; Taunton, with shining wind-vaned 
towers. Here, on this very hill-top, had the Legion 
halted ere it went singing on its way to Rome. 
There, mysteriously alone, islanded in the evening 
mist, rose Avalon, where St. Joseph hid the Grail. 
Beyond, loomed Camelot, very dark and strong, that 
was King Arthur's, that saw Guinevere go by, and 
heard the tumult and the shouting. Yonder, in the 
marsh, lay Athelney that hid King Alfred, and Wed- 
more where he curbed the Danes. It is easy to read 
between the lines that the author has found it a 
gracious task to fill in the outlines of his well- 
remembered vision, to describe the noble archi- 
tecture of manor and cottage, of cathedral and village 
church ; to portray the country, often of rare beauty 
and always of great peace; to recount the historic 
associations where the fathers signalled the passing 
of the Legions, the onset of the Saxons, the retreat 
of the Danes, the advance of the Normans, the conn- 
ing of the Armada. Somerset has been one of the 
least-visited parts of Southern England by the 
tourist. But this book will surely tempt many to 
include the county in their next itinerary. One hun- 
dred drawings by Miss Nelly Erichsen add much to 
the charm of the volume. 



The life story The late William Leroy Broun, for 
of a Southern the last twenty years of his life presi- 
educator. <jent o f tne Alabama Polytechnic 

Institute, and before that at various times connected 
with Vanderbilt University and the University of 
Texas, was a man who had worked his way up 
against difficulties that would have discouraged the 
ordinary youth. A brief but impressive account of 
this struggle and its triumphant issue, with illustra- 
tive selections from Dr. Broun's correspondence and 
public addresses, has been prepared by his brother, 
Major Thomas L. Broun, assisted by his daughter, 
Miss Bessie Lee Broun, and his granddaughter, Miss 
Sally F. Ordway. "Dr. William Leroy Broun" 
(Neale), as the book is entitled, is really a compila- 
tion, the compilers holding themselves modestly in 
the background and allowing other more disinterested 
observers to tell the story of Dr. Broun's achieve- 
ments as Confederate army officer, science teacher, 
and college president. A noteworthy chapter de- 
scribes a memorable clash between Alexander H. 
Stephens and the subject of the biography, with 
its momentous consequences. Dr. Broun was con- 
spicuous among the too few well-equipped workers 
for Southern education, and his death in 1902 at 
the age of seventy-five removed one whose character 
and services were held in the highest repute. Por- 
traits of Dr. Broun, his wife and daughter, and some 
of Bis associates, are given in the book. Nine pages 
of autobiographical notes, especially interesting for 
their account of school days and early manhood, are 
inserted near the beginning. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A dignified library edition of " The Political Debates 
between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas " 
has just been published by the Messrs. Putnam. The 
work is edited by Dr. George Haven Putnam, who sup- 
plies it with a historical introduction. 

The Right of the Child to be Well Born," by Dr. 
George E. Dawson of the Hartford School of Religions 
Pedagogy, is a brief but excellently presented statement 
of the purpose and possibilities of the eugenics move- 
ment. The discussion of what should be the mutual 
relations of religion and eugenics is quite the best treat- 
ment of this fundamentally important phase of the 
eugenics progaganda which has come to our attention.

"Literary Influences in Colonial Newspapers, 1704- 
1750," by Miss Elizabeth Christine Cook, is a publica- 
tion of the Columbia University Press. Miss Cook has 
examined the files of the chief colonial newspapers for 
the half-century in question, and has made notes upon 
such portions of their contents as have a literary flavor. 
Nothing of much importance is thus rescued from obliv- 
ion, but a demonstration is afforded that the newspapers 
of that period were not altogether without a tincture of 
letters, and that they were considerably addicted to the 
reprinting of passages from current English literature, 
and of framing imitations upon these models. Miss 
Cook's notes and extracts make very interesting reading.

manuscripts. The award is to be made within sixty 
days from the close of the contest, and the prize-winning 
novel will be published in February of next year. 

William Foster Apthorp, one of the best-known of 
American musical critics, died in Switzerland on Feb-

Herewith we have pleasure in presenting our 
annual classified List of Books Announced for 
Spring and Summer Publication. About twelve 
hundred titles, representing the lists of more than 
fifty American publishers, are entered here. With 
the exception of a few technical and medical publi- 
cations, this list is a fairly complete summary of 
the Spring publishing season although it is quite 
probable that not a few important books will this 
year, as in past seasons, appear without preliminary 
heralding.

TO OUR 
SUBSCRIBERS 



Although THE DIAL is mailed regularly 
before the first and sixteenth of each 
month, as heretofore, many of our sub- 
scribers experience a delay of from one to 
two weeks in receiving the paper. Th'is 
is due to a recent ruling of the postal 
authorities, by which certain periodicals 
entered as entitled to the second class 
privilege are now conveyed in the mails 
by freight, instead of by express as in the 
past. Until this ruling is done away with, 
as it must be within a short time, we can 
only bespeak the patience of our readers.

THE BEAR 'S CLA WS B y GRA CE SARTWELL MASON and JOHN NORTHERN MILLIARD 

From her bronze cage in the rotunda of a New York hotel a tired stenographer, who inherits the wanderlust, and dreams and writes 
stories of romantic adventures in far lands, is swept, at a day's notice, into the very whirlpool of the Oriental life of which she has always 
dreamed. It becomes her lot to help her intrepid, resourceful engineer husband as he plans to build railroads through the Persian desert, 
and to thwart the practiced spies of Russia in their efforts to block his work. The story is a thrilling, gleaming, colorful narrative of life 
and adventure in the Far East, spiced with a flavor of the devious ways of international politics. Illustrated by W. D. Goldbeck. ISmo.

In this unusual story of the Spanish-American war the reader is let behind the scenes to a remarkable extent. Lieutenant Holton is 
detached from his command at the outbreak of hostilities to engage in important secret service work. The machinations of some misled 
Cuban patriots, villianies of Spanish spies, as well as the San Juan assault, the destruction of Cervera's fleet, the saving of Santiago, with 
the winning by Holton of a beautiful and devoted Cuban girl enthusiastically devoted to the cause of liberty, combine to make an unusual 
story, told with a thorough knowledge of the naval and other historical conditions of the war's events. Illustrations by J. Allen St. John.

A well told mystery story is always assured of popularity, and a mystery of a decidedly novel character is unraveled in this tale of 
Chicago's foreign quarter. The possession of the cross means peril and sometimes death. In a strange way it links the destinies of dwellers 
in twentieth century Chicago with an old Italian family, with multiplied sinister activities for its ownership, and the hidden treasure of the 
long dead Borgias. How the lovers of the story discover the secret of the cross and each other forms the climax of the story. Illustrated

By RANDALL PARRISH 

The recent international aviation meet in Chicago is the starting point of Mr. Parrish's latest novel, whose hero, Lieutenant Philip 
Dessaud of the French army, is the inventor of an improved military aeroplane. Why his machine was withdrawn from the contest at the 
last moment and lost to sight, and why its inventor disappeared mysteriously, are the questions answered in a breathlessly moving yarn 
of international intrigue and the loyalty to Dessaud of a young American newspaper-woman, who balks a plot to steal the secret of his 
invention. Mr. Parrish writes of the last flight of this aeroplane with all the vim and accuracy that have distinguished his former tales of 
more familiar adventures. Illustrated by Clarence F '. Underwood. $1.25 net 

By GERALD VILLIERS- STUART 

A brilliant and satirical story of life in English, Bohemian, and artistic circles the circles that affect~to lookdown upon the middle 
classes as being Philistine. The heroine is a young woman whose success as a novelist leads to her being victimized by an unscrupulous 
artist who induces her to write anonymously a book of doubtful character from which he reaps the profits. Only when he has driven her 
to the verge of suicide is her rescue effected by a strong unsophisticated, direct American whose manliness is in vivid contrast to the 
cowardly blackmailer whom he silences and drives into exile. 12mo. $1.25 net

THE GIRL WITH TWO SELVES 



By F. H. COSTELLO 



This most unusual story deals with dual personality. A rich American, travelling in Egypt, meets a young woman who, under the 
influence of a delusion, claims him as her husband. To save her from the possibly fatal effects of her mental trouble, he agrees with her 
father to act the part until she resumes her normal identity. Upon their return to America the girl's true personality asserts itself; but 
meanwhile the man has fallen in love with the personality which he first knew and has nursed. How a rival appears, and how the strange 
complex drama is worked out to a fitting climax, is told in a manner that carries the reader breathlessly along and without a pause. With

A uthor of For the Soul of Rafael, ' ' etc. 

The conflict between the personal destinies of a man and woman united in a pure and deep love, and the conventions of society, 
forms the theme of Mrs. Ryan s new novel. Through her marriage in her girlhood to a man who has since deserted her, the heroine, an 
artist of genius, is debarred from union with the man she comes to love in later life. Those bars she and her lover strive for a time to 
ignore. Unlike so many books on the same theme, the author does justice to the views both of the individual who claims the right of 
personal happiness, and to the conventions which, blind though they necessarily are, yet serve the interests of the civilization which the 
individual seeker after happiness has accepted. The scene of the story is alternately laid in a Mexican settlement in California and in 
fashionable eastern cities. Illustrated by Hanson Booth. Crown 8vo. $1.35 net 



THE WOMAN OF THE TWILIGHT 



By ROBERT AMES BENNET 



OUT OF THE DEPTHS 

Mr. Bennet's latest and strongest novel deals with reclamation not only of the dry lands of the Colorado ranges, but of human 
character. The chief figure in the story is a young engineer who has been ruined in character by the usual upbringing of a rich man's 
son. Having been discovered in the theft of another engineer's plans, he is disowned, and seeks service on a ranch. The influence on his 
character of the ranch owner's daughter, the jealous hatred of a cowboy who is himself in love with this girl, and the part the 
eastern youth plays in enhancing the rancher's fortunes, make a story true to the real life of the Colorado open, and full of the thrilling: 
drama of strong human character, good and bad, in its lust for power and love. Illustrated by George Brehm. Crown Svo. $1.35 net

THE DIFFERENT WEST B y ARTHUR E. BOSTWICK 

The West of the book is the belt of great states fringing the Mississippi, usually termed the Middle West; and the "different "means 
difference from the East. The author, formerly connected with the New York Public Library, and one time President of the American 
Library Association, is a transplanted easterner who has taken root and become an appreciative westerner now Librarian of the St. 
Louis Public Library. The strong impressions made upon him, and the lack of literature on the subject, led to the recording of his con- 
clusions and generalizations which cover the land features, vegetation, weather conditions, transportation, education, politics, art, science, 
literature, speech and other conditions of difference between East and West. Fundamental misconceptions of attitude and temperament 
and mutual misunderstandings are pointed out, so that the work will do good service in helping bring the sections closer together. Many 
bits of humor, illustrative stories, and facts of value fill the pages. ISmo. $1.00 net

Author of "In the Heart of the Votget," "Literary Ramble* in France, " etc. 

For one thousand miles in Northern Africa the tricolor of France waves over burning sands, fertile valleys, magnificent mountains, 
dotted over with Arab cities and hamlets. The talented writer of these chapters has the eye of an artist and the skill of the accomplished 
teller of tales. The reader enjoys with her the hospitality of the rich and poor, fellowships with French soldier and Arab peasant, sees 
how the people live, and looks on the glory of sky, earth, and the works of men's hands with delight. There are anecdotes of famous per- 
sons, and adventures not a few. Miss Edwards knows just what to tell which will most satisfy and please, and does it with unfailing 
vivacity and clearness. Illustrated. Large 8vo. $2.50 net 

BIOGRAPHY 
ROYAL WOMEN: Their History and Romance By MARY RIDPATH- MANN 

The author is a well-known lecturer on historical themes and a daughter of the celebrated historian, John Clark Ridpath. In these 
chapters she describes the characters and careers of four notable women Queen Elizabeth of England, Mary Queen of Scots, Marie 
Antoinette, and the Empress Josephine. Mrs. Mann has not essayed history of the official "dry-as-dust" order, but has described the 
private lives and inner motives which often unrecognized really dominate the lives of nations, with the experience of these famous and 
favorite characters of royalty. The illustrations are a notable feature of the work. Illustrated. ISmo. $1.25 net 

MARK TWAIN AND THE HAPPY ISLAND By ELIZABETH WALLACE 

Mark Twain is one of the perpetually interesting characters about whom his admirers never tire of hearing. This book narrates his 
doings and " table talk" while visiting Bermuda (the "Happy Island"), and also describes the everyday life of Mr. Clemens's home in 
Connecticut. The writer is a friend whose record gives in glowing sentences the human side of the distinguished American, picturing him 
just as he was, attended by the select companions who knew him as "the King," and composed his court on the island. His love for 
children and attentions to them are strikingly told. A number of his letters are reproduced, and there are many illustrations from photo-

modern orators are given, many of them in full, and in some cases accompanied by valuable analyses. The work is not only instructive, 
but emphatically stimulating. Indexed. 12mo. $1.50 net

Important Announcement of a New Book 

By Dr. Alfred Rinsel Wallace 

SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT AND 
MORAL PROGRESS ' 

As what may practically be considered a birthday mes- 
sage, Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace (who has just passed his 
ninetieth birthday anniversary) has written this book on 
"Social Environment and Moral Progress." 

Dr. Wallace, who shares with Darwin the honor of hav- 
ing discovered the great principle of natural selection, pro- 
nounces in his new work a strong indictment of many current 
social conditions, traces out the root cause of what he con- 
eiders our degeneracy, but concludes the volume with a con- 
structive policy based upon the vital facts of psychology and 
morality. 

A vital topic set forth by a world-authority.

On the Foundation and Technic of Arithmetic Prof. George B. Halsted 

" In Professor Halsted 's treatment with the aid of history of the rules and technic of arithmetic and the 
merits of its symbolism and numerical systems he is very stimulating." London Mathematical Gazette. 
" The present volume is a welcome addition to the body of writings having to do with the history 
and methods of teaching arithmetic." School Science and Mathematics. 

Pp. iv + 133. Cloth, $1.00. 

New Logic Dr. Charles Mercier 

Dr. Mercier is physician for mental diseases at Charing Cross Hospital, London ; also examiner of 
mental diseases and psychology in University of London. 

" The aim of this book is to show that the traditional logic of Aristotle occupies much the same 
position today that witchcraft did 250 years ago. It was as an introduction to the study of insanity 
that the author was first moved to examine logic. He holds the doctrine that until we have an 
adequate and correct logic we cannot duly appreciate or approve the erroneous reasoning either of 
the normal or morbid kind." Boston Evening Transcript. 

Pp. xxvii + 422. Price, $3.00. 

Aesop and HySSOp William Ellery Leonard 

Fables adapted and original, in a variety of verse forms, picturesque, lively, and humorous in phrasing, 
with a moral, fresh in wisdom and succinct in expression, pleasingly appended to each. Profitable for 
amusement and doctrine in nursery and in study. 

Pp.xxii+158. Cloth, $1.50. 

Man a Machine Julien Offray La Mettrie 

La Mettrie was the most extreme writer among the earliest French materialists. His theory that the

Syndicalism J. Ramsay MacDonald 

" The chapter on the philosophy of Syndicalism is as good as anything yet published on the subject

England and America, all these things are explained." The Outlook.

A PRACTICAL FIELD 
FOR LIBRARIES 

The general manager of one of the large adding machine 
companies attempted to look up some references on busi- 
ness efficiency and business psychology two weeks ago. 
After a morning's fruitless search in the public library for 
books on these subjects, he appealed to us for suggestions. 
There are thousands of executives and employes who 
read business books, and who would welcome an oppor- 
tunity to consult them in the libraries. Mr. John C. Dana, 
for example, has made the Business Section of the Free 
Public Library in Newark, N. J., a vital force in the build- 
ing of successful business careers. 
In this country, where business plays so important a 
part in the lives of its citizens, libraries can offer no more 
practical service than to provide good business books for 
the use of business executives and their employes. We 
handle business books exclusively, and shall be glad to 
confer with librarians who wish to establish or improve 
business sections in their institutions. 
You will find our 176 page book, 

"What to Read on Business" 

especially valuable in this connection. It contains descrip- 
tions of practically every business book in print. You are 
told whether the book is for a beginner or for an executive ; 
whether the author has accomplished his purpose or not ; 
in fact, all the useful and time-saving information you 
want regarding business is included. 
To librarians we shall be glad to send "What to Read 
on Business" upon receipt of 50 cents in stamps or coin. 
The regular price of the book is $1.00. A letter is not 
necessary. Your name and address on this ad sent to us 
with 50 cents will bring your copy by return mail.

ANDREW LANG AND OTHERS. 

The thin pamphlet which reports the pro- 
ceedings of the Academic Committee of the 
Royal Society of Literature, at a meeting held 
four months ago, offers material of varied inter- 
est. The chief feature of its contents is a com- 
memorative address upon the late Andrew Lang, 
delivered by Professor William Paton Ker, a 
writer of whom it may be said almost in the 
sense in which it may be said of Lang, that 
he touches nothing which he does not adorn. 
"Learning and the pursuits of literature," said 
the speaker, "have had many hard things said 
of them; but they are essentially honorable, 
and few men of letters have done more to 
show this than Andrew Lang, in two ways 
particularly in the help he gave so freely 
to anyone who wanted it, and in his absolutely 
regardless fashion of working on any question 
which he took up." Lang has sometimes been 
dispraised because he scattered his brilliant 
powers, instead of coordinating them and con- 
verging them upon the preparation of a magnum 
opus. But it was of the very essence of his 
genius to work in this way, and he preferred to 
attack a subject by a minute critical examina- 
tion of its separate aspects rather than by a 
deliberate effort to build it from the ground up 
in orderly fashion upon a preconceived archi- 
tectonic plan. Thus many of his books are 
bigger than they seem, simply because they 
are unconventional in their elaboration. His 
"Custom and Myth" is an example. It is a 
collection of popular essays upon a variety of 
subjects, "an advance of skirmishers in front 
of an army" he called it, but the fire of these 
skirmishers had a definitely concerted aim, and 
its effect was to strew the field with slain the- 
ories, thus preparing it for the occupation of 
the constructive engineers that would later take 
possession. 

Speaking of Lang's poetry, Professor Ker 
dwells lovingly upon its lighter or more fanciful 
aspects, quoting the stanza in which he condoles 
with Stevenson on the unenlightened condition 
of the Samoan Islands : 

" There are nae bonny U. P. Kirks, 

An awfu' place; 

Nane kens the Covenant o' Works 
Frae that o' Grace."

THE DIAL 



[April 1 



He also places stress upon Lang's love for places, 
as expressed in these verses on the Tweed: 

" Like a loved ghost, thy fabled flood 

Fleets through the dusky land; 
Where Scott, come home to die, has stood, 
My feet returning stand. 

" A mist of memory broods and floats, 

The Border waters flow, 
The air is full of ballad notes , 
Borne out of long ago." 

'These verses are too simple and obvious to win 
anything but scorn from the young priests and 
vestals of the modern poetic cult, but the speaker 
is surely right when he says that " they have their 
place in the House of Fame as surely as any 
poem by the greater masters." 

This tribute to Lang is followed by a memo- 
rial address on the late A. W. Verrall, spoken 
by Professor John William Mackail. Verrall's 
name is known to every classical scholar, but 
probably means little to those outside the fold. 
Yet few classical scholars of our time have done 
so much as he to make the dry bones of scholar- 
ship live, and that is a service which outweighs 
many times its volume of pedantry and linguistic 
achievement. It is the sort of service for which 
Andrew Lang and Sir Gilbert Murray in En- 
gland, Professor Gildersleeve and Professor 
Shorey in this country, have placed us under a 
debt of deep obligation, because it is the sort of 
service of which the classics stand in most need. 
As the speaker said, Verrall was not one of 
those who " move like laborious ghosts, out of 
the daylight, immersed in a dead world," and in 
praising his memory "we are not following a 
grammarian's funeral." The following passage 
gives us the central theme of the tribute which 
Professor Mackail was so well qualified by his own 
precept and practice to pay the dead classicist : 

" For him letters, both ancient and modern, were a 
world crowdedly and intensely alive. He brought to 
the study of the classics of these masterpieces which 
have been so thumbed and worn by long currency the 
fresh mind at whose contact they sprang into fresh 
vitality. He brought the same fresh interest and enjoy- 
ment to English letters and the literary art of his own 
day. To hear him discourse on modern authors was 
to realise that they were not separated in his mind from 
the ancient authors among whom he worked profession- 
ally. To both alike he applied the same rapid intelligence, 
in both alike he felt the same living interest. And that 
was the interest neither of classicism nor of modernism ; 
it was the interest of literature as a fine art." 

It is well to call attention to the work of any 
man who shows "how the art of letters can sus- 
tain and reinforce the art of living ; how com- 
merce with great writers may and does kindle in 
their students some corresponding greatness of 



soul ; and how literature is not a region abstract 
and apart, but a real thing, the image and in- 
terpretation of human life." With all his 
"humane impishness " and super-subtlety, Ver- 
rall was a scholar who showed us these things ; 
and because this was his mission, we cherish 
his memory. 

The contents of our pamphlet close with the 
remarks made by Mr. Edmund Gosse in award- 
ing, on behalf of the Academic Committee, the 
Polignac prize for the best work of imaginative 
literature produced during the preceding twelve- 
month. The award fell to Mr. John Masefield 
for his poem, " The Everlasting Mercy." We 
are anything but sure that this poem deserved 
the prize, but it is a pleasure to quote the 
eloquent words in which Mr. Gosse stated what 
he believed to be its claims. 

" As we read ' The Everlasting Mercy,' which is a 
narrative of conversion, a story of the light of God 
breaking into a dark soul through the cracks which pain 
and shame have made in it, we feel the mysterious 
pulse of humanity beating, throbbing all around us. Mr. 
Masefield takes us away from Mayfair, and away from 
Fleet Street, too. But not into any remote symbolic 
province or mystically fabulous No-man's land. We 
stand with him among the familiar inland English hills, 
in fields where Piers Plowman might have walked or 
Bunyan prayed, and the robust voice of the new poet, 
like those of all the earlier singers and yet unlike them 
all, chants to us of the meaning of daily life, and of 
God's insistent call to human frailty." 

We have taken this pamphlet as the subject 
of an article because we believe thoroughly in 
the importance of such bodies as the Royal 
Society of Literature, in their implied functions 
of upholding standards, of crowning distin- 
guished work, and of memorializing the great 
who pass away. They may at times be mistaken 
in their judgments, but they stand for the acad- 
emic idea, which never more than at the present 
day needs to be upheld in all the fine arts. The 
flood of the bizarre in poetry, painting, music, 
and the other arts threatens more than ever 
before to tear us from our aesthetic moorings 
and set us adrift upon uncharted seas. And we 
are very sceptical of the notion that those seas 
are lik;ly to disclose strange new worlds to our 
view. Their expanses are more likely to reveal 
impassable ice barriers than visioned mounts of 
purification. And, applying the lesson to our 
own country, we are glad that we have, in the 
National Institute of Arts and Letters, a body 
corresponding to the Royal Society of Litera- 
ture, a body to which the nation may look alike 
for warning and for guidance, in confidence that 
while it will prove all things artistic, it will con- 
tinue to hold fast to that which is good.

THE DIAL 



285 



THE PROBLEM OF BAUDELAIRE. 

i. 

The history of literature is rich in grimly humor- 
ous coincidence. Charles Baudelaire, who translated 
into French the works of Edgar Allan Poe, hated 
America for its failure to appreciate his idol. In 
his judgment America was ''a great gas-lit barbar- 
ism," and it is perhaps a bit of poetic justice that 
to-day, when on the Continent and even in England 
" Les Fleurs du Mai " holds a large place in the his- 
tory of modern poetry, few Americans know the very 
name of Baudelaire. There is, to be sure, a wide 
gulf between his talent and our canon of taste, a 
gulf so wide that this poet cannot be read in the 
schools. And French authors whose works are not 
read in the schools have for us scarcely more than a 
legendary existence, thin and unsubstantial as that 
of ghosts in the Elysian Fields. 

Is this fact due to our literary press? Let us 
consult Poole and the periodical indexes. Between 
1881 and the end of 1912, while scores of studies 
on Baudelaire were being published in Europe, we 
find on this side of the Atlantic only Mr. Huneker's 
essay. I am aware, certainly, of the role of the 
American magazine as mentor of adolescence. But 
the existence of "Les Fleurs du Mai " is now a fact 
of literary history, and on the whole a rather 
important fact. 

A single essay in twenty years ! And even its 
occurrence loses in significance when we add that it 
was written, not by a professional scholar but by a 
musical critic, an American who had learned in Paris 
a larger cosmopolitanism and a tolerance perhaps 
too undiscriminating. With characteristic enthusi- 
asm, Mr. Huneker proposed to demolish the " Legend 
of Baudelaire." But his study,* unfortunately, pre- 
sented only one side of the question, its evidence 
being taken from Baudelaire's friends Crepet and 
Gautier. A dithyramb of praise, it is really an 
attempt to make a saint out of a sinner. And, with 
all due appreciation of the discovery that Baudelaire 
" wrote a Latin hymn to Saint Francis," one finds 
it hard to admit that " at heart he was a believer," 
and it is to be feared that the critic places too much 
emphasis upon the " hymn " in question-! further- 
more, why quote " Pacem summum tenent " ? Is it 
to bring out the singular nature of the subject? 

This unique essay, however, may have had its 
effect. In any case, 1913, already an annus mira- 
bilis, has given us in one short month not only 
Professor Marinoni's admirable article,! but a crit- 
ical study an English production which, by its 
mere bulk and the range of its quotations, indicates 
to even the casual eye the importance which this 
poet must henceforth assume in the history of liter- 
ature. A tall octavo of nearly three hundred pages,

France and England,"* considers, not merely his 
descendants in literature on both sides of the Chan- 
nel, but the poet himself, with his relations to Poe, 
Sainte-Beuve, Gautier, Aloysius Bertrand, and Pt- 
rus Borel. Some of these chapters are extremely in- 
teresting, and the last two names will certainly be 
new to English readers. In France, Baudelaire's 
posterity numbers Villiers de PIsle Adam, Barbey 
d'AureVilly, Verlaine, Huysmans, and Mallarme^ 
together with the less known figures of Corbiere, 
Rollinat, Samain, and Laforgue. In England we 
find, with a few minor poets, Swinburne, O'Shaugh- 
nessy, and Wilde. America, too, by the way, has 
produced at least one volume of Baudelairian verse, 
the "Book of Jade," published anonymously some 
ten years ago. So perhaps it may be interesting to 
revert to this curious poet, who pushes to a singular 
perversity a certain tendency in all Romanticism. 

n. 

Even from its beginning the French Romantic 
school, confident as it was that it had superseded 
Classicism and set up in its stead a living ideal, con- 
tained the germ of the malady which was eventually 
to prove its own destruction. Romanticism revealed 
to the world the secret of a new beauty the Beauty 
of the Personal ; but with that interest was involved, 
implicit and inevitable, the element of curiosity. 
Now curiosity may take a more or less objective 
expression, as in Hugo's use of the grotesque; or 
the mind may turn its scalpel upon itself, as in 
most of Rousseau's descendants from "Rene"" and 
S^nancour to Alfred de Vigny and Sainte-Beuve. 
Theophile Gautier, preoccupied as he was with 
plastic beauty, reveals in a great deal of his early 
verse this morbid curiosity, but it reaches its height, 
set over against the love of Beauty as in Gautier, 
yet fascinated at the same time by the ugly and the 
macabre, in the poetry of Charles Baudelaire. A 
true son of the Romanticists in his exasperated 
sensibility, this poet expiated the excesses of two 
generations of lyrical egoism. 

Temperamentally, Baudelaire is related to three 
French Romanticists, the Vigny of the Mo'ise, the 
Sainte-Beuve of the Poesies and Volupte, and the 
Gautier of the Comedie dela mort and the Albertus.\ 
His first characteristic is a neurasthenic sensibility, 
exasperated by excess and the habit of self-analysis. 
This manifests itself even in his childhood, and his 
memories of daily strolls taken with his father among 
the statues of the Luxembourg Garden are no less 
significant than his boyish suffering at the time of 
his mother's second marriage. So we find him 
moody and misunderstood in his life at school, hat- 
ing its routine as he hated his step-father at home. 

* New York : E. P. Button & Co. 

t A deeper analysis, of course, would trace this whole 
aspect of Romanticism back to Chateaubriand. The morbid 
egoism of Ren6, the Satanic lyricism of Atala's dying speech, 
and the brutality of cruelly realistic detail throughout " Les 
Natchez" (especially in the battle-scenes), all foreshadow 
Baudelaire. This relationship is not noted by Mr. Turquet- 
Milnes. 



286 



THE DIAL 



[April 1 



Sick and overstrung, the revelation of life seems to 
have come to him as a series of shocks, moral 
catastrophes which, in a nature not strong enough 
to react healthily, left a morbid desire to shock the 
world in its turn. Here, too, as has been suggested 
in the case of Prosper Me'rime'e, we may have the 
explanation of Baudelaire's impassibility and his 
dandyism, and perhaps, also, of that very pose of 
Satanic paradox which Me'rime'e himself, at times, 
used as a mask against the Philistine. A neuras- 
thenic type, he felt moreover the fascination of shock- 
ing, and the truculence or brutality which marked 
his conversation and a part of his literary product is, 
properly considered, not merely a paroxysm of revolt 
against convention, but an index of a pathological 
condition. Those who believe that Baudelaire was 
all " pose " should read his letters and his journal. 

Turning now to the dedication of "Les Fleurs 
du Mai," we find a lyrical presentation of his atti- 
tude a poem describing the sufferings of the artist, 
doomed to misunderstanding and contempt, in a 
world of the bourgeois. Yet this conviction does not 
make Baudelaire entirely a stoic or a hermit, except 
in moments of absolute nervous revulsion. Like 
Gautier, he is one for whom the visible world exists ; 
like Vigny, he feels the poet's solitude, so well 
expressed in his predecessor's Mo'ise. More of a 
hedonist than Vigny, he is both charmed and repelled 
by the world without ; and there is something char- 
acteristic in the description, recorded, I believe, by 
Asselineau, of one of Baudelaire's early studios. 
Over the lower half of his window the poet had 
drawn a heavy curtain, but in that window, looking 
out only on the sky and the passing clouds (compare 
the first of the Prose-poems), stood a vivarium filled 
with curious reptiles. The anecdote is certainly 
suggestive. All of Baudelaire is revealed in it; his 
de-humanized idealism and his fascination with the 
grotesque, his love of solitary revery and that morbid 
curiosity which craves its stimulant even in moments 
of seclusion. 

A thorough hedonist, a seeker of impressions for 
their own sake, Baudelaire loved all the arts, more 
especially the plastic arts of form and color. In his 
Salon de 1846, he showed that he was an art-critic 
of no mean order. Like Gautier, he attempted to 
transpose the arts; and some of his poems are 
fashioned like statuettes of metal or stone. His very 
ideal of poetic beauty is the sculptor's, as we may 
see in his sonnet to Beauty: 

" Je suis belle, 6 mortels, comme un re"ve de pierre, 
Et mon sein, oil chacnn s'est meurtri tour k tour, 
Est fait pour inspirer au poete un amour 
Eternel et muet ainsi que la matiere. 

" Je trone dans 1'azur comme un sphinx incompris 
J'unis un coeur de neige k la blancheur des cygnes, 

. Je hais le mouvement qui d^place les lignes 
Et jamais je ne pleure et jamais je ne ris." 

Thus, with Gautier, Baudelaire is the real ancestor 
of the Parnassian poets. Of painting he says 
(notably in the midst of a generation of realists), 
" Pas de grande peinture sans de grandes pense'es "; 



yet he admits also the art that is purely decorative, 
a pendant to his love of the arabesque in ornament 
and the rococo in architecture. In music his cham- 
pionship of Wagner, at that time, at least proves that 
Baudelaire always had the courage of his artistic 
convictions. And when he speaks of the windows 
of a certain cathedral, "coloured with the intense 
colours with which a profound temperament invests 
all the objects of life," he is, in fact, only describing 
his own attitude. A preternatural quickness to 
sensation, an almost clairvoyant keenness of impres- 
sion, responsive to melody, color, and perfume, and 
with this a sense of the mystery of beauty, gave to 
Baudelaire in poetry something of the quality that 
Delacroix and Moreau attained in painting. Some 
of his poems, it is true, have been compared to 
"moonlight shining on a dung-heap," and fully 
deserve the comparison. But, in the main, it is the 
moonlight that prevails. 

Of course the poetic expression of such a talent, 
at once curious and introspective, will often be sensu- 
ous, and even consciously sensuous, as in the hero 
of Sainte-Beuve's novel. The soul bent back upon 
itself, always seeking within that ultimate Beauty 
of which the expression just eludes its grasp, suffers 
an exhaustion of spirit which turns in reaction to 
the pursuit of physical pleasure. Hence the sensu- 
ousness exhibited by many of the Romantic poets, 
often confused with their idealism as in the glare of 
an overwhelming "illumination." So with Baude- 
laire, as with not a few others, life is reduced to the 
double service of Art and Love ("Le Ranon"), and 
woman, in whom his sensual egotism sees nothing 
but a Delilah, becomes in turn his goddess and his 
evil genius, or by a refinement of perversity which 
reveals his neurasthenia, goddess and demon at the 
same time. 

" Je t'adore a l'e"gal de la voute nocturne, 
O vase de tristesse, O grande taciturne, 
Et t'aime d'autant plus, belle, que tu me fuis, 
Et que tu me parais, ornement de mes nuits, 
Plus ironiquement accumuler les lieues 
Qui apparent mes bras des immensite's bleues." 

From Love, as from Art itself, he asks but a 
moment of forgetfulness. "One must ever be 
drunken," he says in one of his prose-poems : 

" One must ever be drunken. Everything is in that ; it is 
the only question. In order not to feel the horrible burden 
of Time that is breaking your shoulders, bending you earth- 
wards, you must be ceaselessly drunken. 

" But with what ? With wine, poetry or virtue, as you 
will only intoxicate yourself; and if sometimes, on the 
steps of a palace, on the green sward of a grave, or in the 
mournful solitude of your room you wake to find the intoxi- 
cation diminished or vanished, ask of the wind, or the wave, 
or the star, or the bird, or the clock . . . ask what time it 
is; and the wind, wave, star, bird, and clock will tell you: 
' It is time to be drunken.' Lest you should be the martyred 
slaves of Time, be ceaselessly drunken ! with wine, poetry, 
or virtue, as you will." 

III. 

The Anglo-Saxon ideal is to measure life by action, 
by accomplishment, by moral or intellectual activity. 
For Baudelaire, life was a matter of artistic emo- 
tions, a service of the senses, a matter of moods. 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



287 



Nowhere else in literature is this attitude exempli- 
fied so completely. For such a nature there is no 
development ; Baudelaire never reached that stage 
in which the life of the intellect detaches itself, rises 
supreme from the early tyranny of sense and feel- 
ing. Indeed his very thoughts take their color from 
his moods, and he is so lacking in convictions that 
he can " conceive how one may desert a cause for 
the sake of testing the joys of fighting on the oppo- 
site side." He is a creature of moods, uncontrolled 
by an intellectual or ethical norm, and being a poet, 
he is necessarily a poet of moods. 

It is this that made him one of the favorite authors 
of "Young France " of a generation since, full of 
contrasted impulse and lacking as it was in religious 
or philosophical bases. For no one has noted so 
surely as Baudelaire, or with so keen and felicitous 
a touch, the curious return upon itself, the mordant 
ennui that sooner or later seizes upon him who lives 
entirely to his moods and impressions. Moods and 
sensations for their own sake is the aim of his art, 
always the attempt to seek out and fix a new impres- 
sion, to define a new substratum of feeling. The 
poet's part in life, as he conceives it, is not merely 
that of an observer but an experimentalist, and his 
ends are always egotistic. But where a Goethe, with 
his objectivity and his power of intellectual detach- 
ment, could realize such a life, Baudelaire, deficient 
in will and character, was forced to pay the price. 
In truth, life seems opposed to the very theory of 
the hedonist ; one can never re-live an impression. 
Only too soon, for Baudelaire, came the time when 
the first fine response to life was lost, when the 
freshness of youth had left him, as the sun sinks 
behind the horizon in " Le Coucher du Soleil 
Romantique." 

" Mais je poursuis en vain le Dieu qui se retire ; 
L'irre'sistible nuit e'tablit son empire, 
Noire, humide, funeste, et pleine de frissons. 
Une odeur de tombeau dans les te'nebres nage, 
Et mon pied peureux froisse, au bord du mare'cage, 
Des crapauds impreVus et de froids limagons." 

This, then, is the result of his artistic impressionism. 
" Le Printemps adorable a perdu son odeur." And 
now, of course, it is too late to escape from self in 
the objective intellectual world, and the poet must 
go on to the end as he has begun, unable to break 
the chains of sensibility or to rise above it. 

So it was that Baudelaire, eager to lose himself 
again in the tense emotions of youth, was drawn 
more and more toward those morbid moods, unnat- 
urally stimulated by wine and opium, that he had 
at first cultivated only through revolt or curiosity. 
4 ' Les charmes de 1'horreur n'enivrent que les forts ! " 
he cries; but we are not deceived by this self- 
glorification; it is evident that his pursuit of the 
brutal, of the perverse, and of the macabre came to 
be his only escape from boredom. The poet is 
caught in a spiritual impasse, and the Furies are 
gaining upon his slackening steps. And here and 
there, in an image that palpitates with an insanity 
of realism, his poems reveal the disease of the nerves 
which foreshadows the end. 



It is a sombre spiritual tragedy that we read 
between the lines of "Les Fleurs du Mai." His 
ennui becomes a chimera: it is the dragon that 
besets his life (Preface). He comes to envy the 
dull stupidity of the brute world (xxxi.) ; he longs 
for death with a depth of feeling that recalls the 
Middle Ages. And after the desperate invocation 
which ends the volume, after the cry which con- 
cludes one of his prose-poems, we feel that, at the 
worst, death could hardly transfer his spirit to a 
darker hell. "N'importe ou," he cries, echoing 
Poe, " n' importe ou, hors du monde ! " 

Anywhere out of the world! Never was moral 
clearer. Each for himself, men forge their dreams 
of life, but no palace of art or pleasure was ever 
reared with walls high enough to keep the spectre 
of ennui outside. His will atrophied by introspec- 
tion and inaction, he found himself a prisoner in a 
self-created dungeon, bestridden by his chimera as 
by the Old Man of the Sea. Again and again he 
tried to break his bonds we catch a glimpse of the 
struggle in his letters and diary, but it was too 
late. The self-reproaches of his sterile genius, 
rendered more powerless by the clutches of his vice, 
the tortures of a vision which he could not realize, 
were added to his punishment. So, when scarcely 
nine years after the publication of his volume of 
poems, he fell, stricken with paralysis and aphasia, 
on the steps of one of those old churches which he 
loved to study, we may be sure that Baudelaire had 
descended to the lowest depths of the spiral reached 
the bottom of the Inferno, which, a new Dante of 
the Perverse, he had discovered in the recesses of 
his own soul. And that curious tomb of his at Paris, 
against the wall in the Cimetiere Montparnasse, that 
tomb where, immortalized in marble, Baudelaire lies 
beneath the brooding eye of a marble Lucifer, recalls 
in horrible symbolism his long death agony, the bed

CAS UAL COMMENT. 

AN INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION OF THE BOOK 

INDUSTRY AND THE GRAPHIC ARTS is planned for 
the summer of 1914 by the Deutscher Buchgewerbe- 
verein, in celebration of the one hundred and 
fiftieth anniversary of the Royal Academy for the 
Graphic Arts and the Book Industry, at Leipzig. 
Under the patronage of the King of Saxony, and 
with an Honorary Committee of one hundred and 
forty men of note, mostly Germans, this interesting 
exposition of the art of book-printing, book-illustrat- 
ing, book-binding, etc., will open its doors, it is 
expected, about the middle of May, and close them 
about the end of October. A spacious plot of ground 
in the suburbs of the book city has been offered by 
the city fathers for the occasion, and city and king- 
dom have appropriated two hundred thousand marks 
each to defray expenses. The exhibits, as now

THE DIAL 



[April 1 



planned, group themselves under sixteen heads, thus 
denominated: Free graphic arts; applied graphic 
arts ; instruction in the industries of the book trade ; 
paper manufacture; the working-up of paper; manu- 
facture of colors; photography; technics of repro- 
duction; letter-cutting, type-founding, and allied 
trades, stereotypy and electrotypy ; printing process; 
bookbinding; publishing, retail and commission 
book-trading ; newspaperdom and intelligence de- 
partment, methods of advertising and canvassing; 
library business, bibliography, bibliophilism, and 
collections; machinery, apparatus, materials and im- 
plements for the entire printing industry ; measures 
for the protection and benefit of the work-people. In 
the library section will be illustrated the fitting-up 
of libraries, with library plans, views, furniture, 
catalogues, etc.; also public libraries and reading- 
rooms will have a special sub-section to themselves, 
as will bibliography and amateur printing and 
poster-collections, ex libris, and stamps all these 
coming under Group 14 in five sub-sections or classes. 
In the words of the prospectus, "Each group is to 
be introduced by a historical and a technical instruc- 
tive department, whereby laymen will be stimulated 
and encouraged. The development and the position 
in the history of civilization of the various branches 
of the book industry will be clearly demonstrated, 
and the technical stages of each process will be shown 
in a way suited to the general intelligibility. An 
ethnographical section will be devoted to the products 
of primitive peoples. Workshops in going order, 
models and apparatus for demonstrating purposes, 
and cinematograph performances are to stimulate 
the interest of experts and general public in equal 
degree." Intending exhibitors and others can obtain 
further information from the Deutscher Buchge- 
werbeverein, Leipzig. 

THE RECENT PERFORMANCES OF BRIEUX'S "IiES 

A VARIES" in New York, under the management 
of Mr. Richard Bennett, backed by the " Medical 
Review of Reviews" Sociological Fund, attracted 
a tremendous and largely legitimate interest. How 
far they advanced the definite aim of those who 
were instrumental in getting the play produced, 
the enactment of a Federal law which shall forbid 
marriage without certificates of good health from 
both parties, only time can tell. Certainly no speech 
received quite so much applause as the doctor's 
arraignment of the old notary for investigating his 
prospective son-in-law's financial and moral standing, 
and asking nothing about his physical health; but 
the applause at this point may prove only that the 
audience knew why it had been asked to hear the 
play. Whatever one may think about the advisa- 
bility of producing "Les Avarie's " the English 
version is entitled " Damaged Goods " it cannot 
be denied that this particular presentation was 
conducted with dignity and seriousness, and was 
admirably acted throughout, so that full justice 
was done to both the dramatic and the sociological 
values of Brieux's play. The special public who 



witnessed the performances by virtue of their con- 
nection with the Sociological Fund found it highly 
engrossing and impressive, and paid the actors gen- 
erous tribute of enthusiastic and grateful applause. 
The text of the play is familiar to readers of 
modern drama in the original or in Mr. Pollock's 
translation. It is, of course, a masterpiece of 
"thesis drama," an argument, dogmatic, insistent, 
inescapable, cumulative, between science and com- 
mon sense, on one side, and love, of various types r 
on the other. It is what Mr. Bernard Shaw has 
called a " drama of discussion "; it has the splendid 
movement of the best Shaw plays, unrelieved 
and undiluted by Shavian paradox, wit, and 
irony. We imagine that many in the audiences 
at the Fulton Theatre were astonished at the 
play's showing of sheer strength as acted drama. 
Possibly it might not interest the general public; 
probably it would be inadvisable to present it to 
them. But no thinking person, with the most 
casual interest in current social evils, could listen 
to the version of Richard Bennett, Wilton Lackaye, 
and their associates, without being gripped by the 
power of Brieux's message. 



THE DEATH OF TWO COEVAL ENGLISH AUTHORS, 

William Hale White ("Mark Rutherford") and 
Thomas Hodgkin, brings regret to all who have 
admired the sterling qualities in each of these 
workers in different but not unrelated branches of 
literature. Dr. Hodgkin's birth-year is given as 
1831, and Mr. White's as "about 1830," which will 
make the foregoing adjective " coeval " sufficiently 
apposite. Few readers of the noteworthy trilogy of 
novels, " The Autobiography of Mark Rutherford," 
" Mark Rutherford's Deliverance," and " The Rev- 
olution in Tanner's Lane," have known the author 
otherwise than by his pseudonym, and as " Mark 
Rutherford " he will still continue to be known. His 
stories were really studies of social, domestic, and 
religious questions, and their appeal was to the 
thoughtful, not to those who read for mere amuse- 
ment. His later works of fiction, " Miriam's 
Schooling," " Catherine Furze," and " Clara Hop- 
good," have won less notice than the first three. 
His biography of Bunyan, in the " Literary Lives " 
series, his " Pages from a Journal " and " More 
Pages from a Journal " are the chief of his later 
productions. It is to be noted that his adoption of 
authorship as a calling came about largely in con- 
sequence of his expulsion from the Congregational 
ministry for his views on inspiration. Dr. Hodgkin, 
like Grote a banker and a historian, attained by his 
" Italy and her Invaders " (eight volumes published 
at the time of his death) considerably less fame than 
did Grote with his twelve volumes of Greek history, 
the popularity of which was such that twelve hun- 
dred copies of the final volume were sold in one 
week ; but the literary art and the large grasp of his 
subject shown by the later historian were of no mean 
order. Dr. Hodgkin was of Quaker antecedents, 
and his own dignified bearing and simple habits 



1913]

were in harmony with the traditions of the Society 
of Friends. The two men here bracketed together 
seem to have had in common a deep religious seri- 
ousness and interest in the ethical aspects of things. 



POETRY AS A VOCATION of a bread-winning, life- 
sustaining character has been followed by compar- 
atively few ; as an agreeable and harmless avocation 
it has been embraced by many. Just now public 
attention is turned toward Mr. Alfred Noyes as an 
example of one who has succeeded in making poetry 
his servant, as a provider of material necessities, as 
well as his mistress. From the day he left Oxford 
to the present time his verses have been commercially 
successful, and also successful in a far higher sense. 
No such experience has he known as that so amus- 
ingly recorded by Mr. Yoshio Markino, who high- 
heartedly bade farewell to Japan and turned his 
face toward the New World " with a hope to become 
a poet or a writer in English," only to meet with 
speedy disappointment. "I had to make livelihood," 
he tells us, " by washing windows and dishes, or a 
little better thing, making sets of false teeth for 
some dentists." Another and a more confident 
aspirant to poetic distinction (and the attendant 
emoluments) was little Mary Antin from Polotsk 
in Russia, who has told us all about her coming to 
Boston at twelve years of age, and the enthusiasm 
with which she adopted America to be henceforth 
her own country. Of her early hopes and plans she 
writes : " As I understood it, my business was to go 
to school, to learn everything there was to know, to 
write poetry, become famous, and make the family 
rich. Surely it was not shirking to lay out such a 
programme as that. I had boundless faith in my 
future. I was certainly going to be a great poet; I 
was certainly going to take care of the family." 
Still another instance, this time a more conspicuous 
one in the world of letters, comes to mind. When 
Thomas Bailey Aldrich entered his uncle's commis- 
sion house in Pearl Street, New York, his real life 
was not passed in the brokerage business, but was 
lived in the little back hall bedroom on the third 
floor of his boarding-house in Clinton Place, where 
he collected Japanese fans, meditated high themes 
in poetry, and, as he says, wrote " a lyric or two " 
every day before going down town. And when, one 
red-letter day, the editor of "Harper's" accepted a 
poem and paid him fifteen dollars for it, he could 
not refrain from publishing the glad tidings in his 

uncle's office. "Why don't you send the d d 

fool one every day?" was that thrifty person's re- 
joinder. But the poet in Aldrich was proof against 
scoffs and jibes, as it ever will be in him whose eyes 
are fixed on Parnassus. 



THE REGENERATION OF LEISURE through the 
establishment of civic theatres, indoor and outdoor, 
was the subject of a recent address by Mr. Percy 
MacKaye at Smith College, in the town distinguished 
by the possession of a highly successful civic theatre 
which his own cordial encouragement helped to 



establish. The refining of popular amusements was 
urged by the speaker as one of the needs of the age. 
The civic theatre would substitute the habit of filling 
time for that of killing time, and under its lead social 
evils might be made to give place to cooperative 
pleasures. "Finally," declared the speaker, "it 
should succeed in making commercial playhouses 
appear tawdry. . . Outdoor theatres deserve atten- 
tion ; most of them are privately owned at present, 
but a recollection of the glory of the Greek outdoor 
theatre shows what they can do. The success of 
the one at Berkeley, Cal., has been notable. The 
public park of every city should have one. The 
workers in the theatre should join with the city to 
form committees to advance the regeneration of 
leisure. In the civic theatre puppet-shows will live 
again, and the pantomime exemplified by ' Sumurun ' 
will have its part. Here the lyric poet will regain 
his lost right of appeal to an audience rather than 
to an individual. There may be a revival of the 
old-time art of masques, so valuable for their influ- 
ence on large numbers at once; these, too, are best 
given outdoors. Redemption of leisure by art 
may take the course of a return to symbolism and 
renewed use of ancient nature symbols." The 
open-air pageant whose revival has of late met with 
encouraging favor is in harmony with this scheme 
of wholesome and refining recreation, and was com- 
mended by Mr. MacKaye. Amusement is, indeed, 
as he expressed it, "one of the mightiest positive 
forces in America. Art is self-government at its 
highest. It has only begun to give articulate ex- 
pression to the vast modern revulsion of ideas now 
in process of growth, and its future rests with the 
people." . . . 

MAKING THE BOOK READY FOR THE READER, 
classifying and cataloguing and labelling it, some- 
times costs more than the price of the book itself, 
as all librarians very well know. It is estimated 
that the public libraries of Massachusetts alone are 
spending half a million dollars yearly in making 
their stores of literature readily available for the 
most advantageous use. The State Library at Bos- 
ton, numbering about three hundred thousand vol- 
umes, is at present undergoing expert treatment at 
the hands of cataloguers, at a cost of five thousand 
dollars a year, the work to continue probably eight 
years or five years if an annual expenditure of 
eight thousand dollars should be authorized. The 
catalogue is, of course, to be of the card form, the 
only convenient shape in which a catalogue can be 
kept up to date. At Harvard the old card catalogue 
is being transformed into a printed card catalogue of 
uniform character throughout, this change meaning 
a cost of forty or forty- five cents per volume cata- 
logued ; and even at that rate the printers are com- 
plaining that there is little or no profit in the job for 
them. Mr. Charles J. Babbitt, the library expert 
now engaged in cataloguing the State Library, is 
quoted as estimating the cost of a type-written cata- 
logue for that library as eleven cents for each book 



290 



THE DIAL 



[April 1 



treated ; but, on the other hand, the librarian of 
Congress is said to question whether so small an 
expenditure will cover the cost of a good card cata- 
logue. At any rate, amid all the agreements and 
disagreements of the learned librarians, it is safe to 
say that the purchase price of a book represents 
much less of its real cost to the public library than 
one person in a thousand ever suspects. 


A HUNDRED YEARS OF GRIMM 's FAIRY TALES 

have not outworn their popularity. On the con- 
trary, their fame has spread amazingly from the day 
of their publication. English was the first foreign 
language into which they were translated, and no 
one knows in how many others they are now current. 
Those of us who were brought up on "Hansel and 
Gretel" and the rest of the fascinating tales will 
never find anything in narrative form to fetter the 
interest as did those nursery stories of long ago. 
Professor Erich Schmidt has been celebrating their 
centennial in the Deutsche Rundschau, reminding 
us again of the varied and often obscure sources 
from which they were drawn, and paying tribute to 
the mastery of simple, idiomatic German displayed 
by the two brothers who so diligently labored in 
collecting and preserving them. From old peasant 
women, especially the "cattlewife of Schwelm," of 
marvellous memory, from Maria the sewing girl, 
and from Dorothea Wild, whom Wilhelm Grimm 
later took to wife, many of these folk tales were 
gathered and put into literary form. The Cobbler 
of Nuremberg, Hans Sachs, is ultimate authority 
for others, and old jest-books and mediaeval Latin 
poems were drawn upon for still other of these 
homely narratives. In fact, the net was spread wide, 
and all sorts of waifs and strays were gathered in, 
to be immortalized with the touch of genius at the 
hands of the brother collectors. In the tales, virtue 
is rewarded, vice is punished, and true lovers made 
happy, in a way never other than satisfying to the 
unspoilt juvenile taste. Now and then a sly stroke 
of humor gives variety, but rather puzzles than 
pleases the literal-minded child reader as at the 
end of one story where it is printed, "Anybody that 
does not believe this tale must pay a dollar," a com- 
mand that is said to have brought one unbelieving 
but strictly honest little maiden to the door of the 
brothers Grimm with a thaler in her small hand. 
She was as upright and downright as is the manner 
of most of these homely but entrancing tales. 

SHORT CUTS TO A LEARNED PROFESSION are 
commonly to be mistrusted, and our State laws are 
more and more making them impossible. Among 
learned professions no librarian would hesitate to 
include his own, to which, with all our library 
schools and their two-year and three-year courses, 
short cuts are not unknown. It is probably well that 
the subordinate positions in library work should be 
open to apprentices of little or no technical training, 
and it may also be well that even the head librarian- 
ship should be not beyond the reach of the born 



librarian unequipped with a library-school diploma. 
Of the many libraries now conducting training 
classes for the filling of vacancies in their own 
service, that at Detroit has recently called our 
attention to its activities in this field. Its apprentice 
class receives ten months' instruction, no fees re- 
quired, and its members become "eligible to serve 
as substitutes at the end of the first month, and in 
this manner have an opportunity to earn some part 
of their support. After the final examination those 
who prove acceptable during the course are eligible 
to appointment to the regular staff." The formal 
instruction is limited to one hour five times a week, 
and does not pretend to take the place of regular 
training-school instruction, though it "covers in a 
general way the curriculum of such a school, with 
a special view of meeting local needs," and the 
subjects to which most careful attention are given 
include "cataloguing, reference work, children's 
work, book selection, book ordering, and trade 
bibliography." In existing conditions the appren- 
tice class has an indisputable place. 

OUR PLETHORA OF WORDS, as evidenced by the 
ponderous tomes of the great Oxford Dictionary, 
now in the letter T and progressing majestically 
toward "zygosis" and "zyxomma," causes dis- 
quietude in some breasts. Are we pruning the 
luxuriant growth of our vocabulary as we ought? 
Should every foreign term that falls lightly from 
the tongue or pen of him who is too indolent to 
search for its native equivalent be naturalized 
before the completion of a long term of residence 
among us? To take a familiar instance, has the 
French word for "ingenuous," which we have never 
been able to decide whether to adopt in its mas- 
culine or its feminine form, any legitimate place in 
our vocabulary? And does it not savor of some- 
thing like pedantry or priggishness, or a desire to 
appear learned and well-read, to sprinkle our dis- 
course with such exotic terms as "provenance," 
" format," " gauche," " gaucherie," " diva," " tenore," 
"concetti," and other like substitutes for adequately- 
expressive English words? Occasionally the foreign 
term seems to be the only one for the exact shade 
of meaning one wishes to convey, and its use as a 
last resort is unobjectionable. Importations from 
the domain of science are further swelling our 
dictionaries, and the slang term obtains rather too 
ready admittance. We rejoice, of course, that ours 
is a living and growing language, but there is such 
a thing as a growth too rapid for either health or 
strength or beauty. 

A GREAT LIBRARY-ORGANIZER'S WORK came too- 
early to its close in the death, March 11, of Dr. 
John Shaw Billings, since 1896 head of the New 
York Public Library, and before that in charge 
of the Library of the Surgeon-General's Office at 
Washington, where his labors in compiling the great 
sixteen-volume catalogue of that collection, and in 
making the collection itself the most valuable med- 



1913] 



THE D1A1, 



291 



ical library in the world, brought him merited dis- 
tinction. He was born April 12, 1839, in Indiana; 
attended Miami University and the Medical College 
of Ohio ; served as surgeon in the Civil War, attaining 
the rank of lieutenant colonel ; has held various posi- 
tions of usefulness and eminence, including the chair- 
manship of the board of trustees of the Carnegie 
Institution at Washington ; and was largely instru- 
mental in securing the Carnegie grants for building 
up the New York public library system. The plan 
and arrangement of the latter's great central library 
building are credited to him, and to his organizing 
genius also the Johns Hopkins Hospital at Baltimore 
is greatly indebted. Honorary degrees and society 
memberships at home and abroad were bestowed 
upon him in profusion. Among his published works 
the "National Medical Dictionary," in two volumes, 
deserves prominent mention. Dr. Billings was a 
man given to large undertakings of public useful- 
ness, and whatever he undertook he seems to have 
carried to success. 

THE PLAY-GOER'S IMAGINATION has far less exer- 
cise now than in the early days of the theatre 
which is rather to be regretted. The staging of a play 
in ancient Greece and Rome was a simple matter 
compared with the elaboration of scenery and cos- 
tume now demanded. And in Elizabethan England 
it was not much more of an undertaking. As Pro- 
fessor Felix Schelling said the other day at Amherst 
in his Clyde Fitch lecture, "our method of present- 
ing a play makes for the reduction of intellectual 
effort ; we are personally conducted throughout, and 
the imagination is rarely taxed." Between Shake- 
speare's Snout playing the part of a wall, with a 
daub of plaster or loam on his person to foster the 
illusion, and Mr. Edison's kinetophone reproducing 
grand opera or scenes from real life, with every 
movement and color and sound, even to the spoken 
word, somewhat accurately rendered, there may 
well stretch three centuries of effort and experiment 
and evolution. Such triumphs of realism drive some 
of us to the quiet of the study and the congenial 
atmosphere of the library, there to take our fill of 
the drama in a manner befitting one whose imagina- 
tion needs not the guidance of leading-strings. 


A CLEARING HOUSE FOR PERIODICALS IS con- 

ducted by the Minnesota Public Library Commission, 
as explained in its " Seventh Biennial Report." By 
means of this clearing house the libraries throughout 
the State are greatly helped in completing their sets 
of magazines and reviews for reference use. A sur- 
plus at one place supplies a deficiency at another, 
through the mediation of the clearing house. "The 
Commission pays the freight on all magazines sent 
in, and the libraries upon those which they receive. 
During the period of nineteen months covered by 
this report, 2171 numbers have been given to 
libraries, a smaller number than in preceding 
years, for the reason that the majority of libraries 
have practically completed their back files and are 



now subscribing for the magazines which are reg- 
ularly bound each year. Of the more popular 
magazines which are not valuable for reference 
material, 1059 numbers have been sent to lumber 
camps, where they are greatly appreciated." The 
thought here suggests itself that if all State library 
commissions were to establish similar clearing houses 
and then unite in the maintenance of a central or 
national clearing house a clearing house of clear- 
ing houses, in short the completion of defective 
sets of periodicals in all the public libraries of the 
United States might be facilitated. But perhaps 
the scheme would be too complicated for practical 



use. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

ART IN THE MAGAZINES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

My letter published in your issue of February 1 
called forth only seven replies, or eight counting the 
one published. One of these is a gentle and courteous 
protest from the Editor of the " Century," who notes 
that the April number of that magazine will contain an 
article criticising new fads in art, with a lot of illustra- 
tions. " When you see these you will not consider Mr. 
Dearth's picture an extreme example of a general type, 
but will think it conservative." Six letters support my 
opinion of the picture criticised, with a variety of vigor- 
ous expressions. No real defense has been attempted, 
if we except that of Mr. R. U. Johnson, who merely 
urges that the work is " conservative " compared with 
other pictures now before the public, which is of course 
a fact. 

On the whole the referendum has not been a conspic- 
uous success, but another time we might do better. Dr. 
E. E. Hale, in a semi-facetious manner, raises the ques- 
tion whether the plan proposed could be expected to 
give results of any value. Judged by their attitude 
toward works of art, people may be divided into three 
groups: (1) those who care especially for the technique; 
(2) those who value the work for its mission to mankind; 
and (3) those who regard it with comparative indiffer- 
ence, and have no strong feelings of any kind regarding 
it. At the present time, it is probably no exaggeration 
to say that at least ninety per cent of our people belong 
to the third class, whose opinions on the subject, so far 
as they have any, are not definite or well considered 
enough to be of much value. Consequently an attempt 
to collect opinions wholesale, without any sort of selec- 
tion, would scarcely repay the trouble. The professional 
group, representing the first class in our classification, is 
organized and articulate, and naturally dominates the 
situation. It is of course true that the best representa- 
tives of art belong equally to the first and second classes, 
so that the second point of view is never lost sight of 
entirely. It is, however, my contention that the present 
state of the fine arts and of art criticism in this country 
is unsatisfactory on account of the insufficient attention 
paid to what I conceive to be the real mission of art, 
and that the remedy lies with that body of educated 
people who value art for its influence on morality, using 
that word in its broadest and original sense. These 
people, owing to the size of our country and the lack of 
any obvious common bond, are too inarticulate, too little 
able to bring to a focus the very considerable body of 



292 



THE DIAL 



[April 1 



opinion they represent. It seemed to me that perhaps 
the readers of THE DIAL were a sufficiently selected 
group to be of value in this connection. Judging by 
those personally known to me, I should say that on the 
whole they must represent the group it is desired to 
reach fairly well. If the referendum became customary 
and received adequate support, I believe the results 
would be of real value. In no instance would all, or 
nearly all, the readers send in opinions, and thus the 
indifferent in relation to the matter under discussion 
would be eliminated. 

Another possible development of the same idea would 
be to ask readers to nominate, say, one hundred persons, 
who would be asked from time to time to briefly express 
their opinions on particular topics, with the understand- 
ing that they would only do so if they felt sufficiently 
competent and interested. Then, as the result of a par- 
ticular referendum, we might have before us a numeri- 
cal summary of the general vote, with a selected series 
of statements giving the opinions of specially competent 
individuals. 

In zoology, at the present time, there is much discus- 
sion of nomenclature, and the methods outlined above 
have been followed by certain journals, I think with 
wholly beneficial results. Whenever such methods are 
employed, they tend to increase interest, and shift the 
power and feeling of responsibility from the few to the 
many. Democracy is not in itself a cure for all our 
ills; how much of it we need in particular cases will 
depend upon circumstances, but unless we have demo- 
cratic ideals, the tendency will be all the other way, 
with eventually disastrous results. 

With regard to the immorality of bad art, I would 
say this: bad drawing is not necessarily immoral, but 
when a work comes to have any importance as art, its 
effect on the public morals cannot be avoided. This is 
too large a subject to discuss here,; but it will, I think, 
be generally admitted that our feeling for harmony or 
beauty is intimately connected with the very fibre of 
our morality. Some of the preposterous things which 
have lately been exhibited as " art " are scarcely im- 
moral, because they have, I suppose, no real grip on the 
imagination. The maximum of injury arises from works 
which are, as Mr. Johnson says, relatively " conserva- 
tive." It is just as it is with people: we are in danger 
of being misled and degraded by those who are moder- 
ately abnormal, but no one fears the influence of a 
lunatic. T. D. A. COCKERELL. 

Boulder, Colo., March 16, 1913. 



"AREN'T I" AND "AN'T I." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The longer the discussion regarding the use of 
" are n't I " goes on, the more I am impressed with the 
fact that consultation of the dictionary, with some recog- 
nition of the attempt to spell according to sound, would 
have quieted apprehension among those who fear for 
the purity of our mother tongue. 

The instances of this usage come from southern En- 
gland and New England. In both, the sound of final 
" r " has practically ceased to exist. Consequently the 
phrase referred to is pronounced to rhyme with "can't," 
as that abbreviation is properly pronounced, with the 
low-back-wide vowel which we term in English, some- 
what inaccurately, " Italian a." Reference to the New 
English Dictionary gives the abbreviation " an't," pro- 
nounced to rhyme with "can't," as in literary use in 



English since 1706, the date of the first example cited; 
and defines it as the " contraction for are n't, are not; 
colloquially for am not; and in illiterate or dialect speech 
for is not, has not (han't). A later and still more illit- 
erate form is AINT." 

Of the six instances of the use of " an't " cited, five 
are of its use in the plural as a contraction for "are n't," 
and only one, from the "Rejected Addresses," of its use 
in the singular, where it is colloquially used for "is not." 
I am impressed with the notion that more profound 
search would have shown its extended use in the first 
person singular. It is formed upon precise analogy with 
" can't " for cannot " and " shan't " for " shall not," 
where the dropping of the closing consonant of the first 
member of the abbreviation is followed by a lengthening 
of the "short English a" to the "Italian a," as if for 
compensation, precisely as in the case of " an't " from 
" am not." Note a similar lengthening of the vowel in 
" don't " and " won't." 

When a Boston father reports his child as saying 
" are u't I," in standard English, which knows not the 
sound of final " r," the child has merely said " an't I " 
quite correctly, and the same is to be said of the citation 
which occasioned this controversy. And as the New 
English Dictionary, by implication, authorizes its use 
as literate, why may we not recognize it as having been 
literate, certainly since 1706, and content ourselves 
therewith, at least as a permissible colloquialism?

ANOTHER DISINHERITED BRITICISM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

An example of questionable British idiom, more ear- 
distressing to me than any of those cited in the inter- 
esting paragraph on " Freaks of Language " in your last 
issue, may be found in the current number of " The 
English Review." In what is otherwise an excellently- 
written short story, the hero addresses this remarkable 
query to the heroine: " I used to be great on material 
forces, use n't 1 ? " Perhaps it is not without significance 
that this linguistic vagary is put in the mouth of an 
American character, thus paving the way for that inevi- 
table day when some Saturday Reviewer will confront us 
with this latest instance of a " barbarous Americanism."

AN OMITTED ACKNOWLEDGMENT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

At the time that my " Journal of an Expedition 
across Venezuela and Colombia " was published I was 
absent from this country on an expedition to South 
America. An appendix on " Temperature and Weather " 
was prepared from my notes by Mr. Burton M. Varney, 
of Harvard University. Owing to a misunderstanding, 
which would not have arisen had I been in this country 
at the time the volume was published or had Mr. Var- 
ney not been so very modest, this acknowledgment was 
not included in the preface. 

An " Additional Note " stating this fact has been 
prepared in such form that it may readily be inserted 
in the volume. If any of your readers who own copies 
of the book will send a line to that effect to the Yale 
University Press or to me, I shall be very glad to fur- 
nish them with the inset. HIRAM BINGHAM.

CHAPTERS FROM A NATURALIST'S 
EARLY LIFE.* 



A more severe or puritanical upbringing than 
that pictured by Mr. John Muir in his " Story 
of my Boyhood and Youth" could hardly be 
imagined. At school in his native town of 
Dun bar, Scotland, the rudiments of book- 
learning were soundly thrashed into the male 
pupils, the boys were flogged again at home for 
delinquencies at school, and they were also well 
birched by the paternal hand for seeking to 
ease the strain of unremittent discipline by 
pommelling one another. Sundays were made 
formidable by the rigors of church-attendance, 
and if a fearful joy was snatched on Saturdays 
from the indulgence of irrepressible youthful 
impulses, the recreation was likely to be paid 
for with additional administrations of chastise- 
ment. A little later in the autobiographer's life, 
in the hard pioneer days of his early Wisconsin 
experience, only two holidays, the fourth of 
July and the first of January, were granted to 
him and his brothers and sisters by the strenu- 
ously industrious parents ; and, by his own con- 
fession, the chronicler of these hardships and 
severities seems to have had assigned to him all 
the most back-breaking and heart-breaking of 
the fearful tasks encountered in subduing the 
wilderness of a frontier homestead of sixty 
years ago. No wonder he was called the " runt " 
of the family. Although he migrated to America 
at eleven years of age, he can scarcely be said 
to have grown up with the country ; hard work 
stunted the growth. 

Under the inflexible rule of a father who held 
the Bible to be the only book profitable for in- 
struction, and to know " Jesus Christ, and him 
crucified," the only knowledge of value, the 
eager intellect of the son must have been in 
some danger of atrophy. It is pathetic to 
imagine the lad snatching surreptitious glimpses 
of the inside of a book on church history 
probably the only reading available except the 
Bible and being sternly ordered to bed by the 
father, to whom such frivolity seemed doubly 
unpardonable when protracted beyond the hour 
of eight o'clock at night, the family bedtime. 
It is almost with incredulity that we read of 
the amount of scripture committed to memory 
by the son at the parental bidding. The better

part of the Old Testament and all the New he 
tells us he was at one time able to repeat per- 
haps he is still able to do so. Dick's " Chris- 
tian Philosopher " he hoped to be allowed to go 
through on the strength of the first word of the 
title. But he says his father " balked at the 
word ' philosopher,' and quoted from the Bible 
a verse which spoke of ' philosophy falsely so- 
called ' " though he must have altered the text 
if he used those exact words. With approach- 
ing manhood, however, the book-hungry lad 
seems to have succeeded in providing himself 
with a few of the English classics ; and this is 
what he says about them : 

" I remember as a great and sudden discovery that 
the poetry of the Bible, Shakespeare, and Milton was 
a source of inspiring, exhilarating, uplifting pleasure; 
and I became anxious to know all the poets, and saved 
up small sums to buy as many of their books as possible. 
Within three or four years I was the proud possessor 
of parts of Shakespeare's, Milton's, Cowper's, Henry 
Kirke White's, Campbell's, and Akenside's works, and 
quite a number of others seldom read nowadays. I 
think it was in my fifteenth year that I began to relish 
good literature with entlmsiasm, and smack my lips 
over favorite lines, but there was desperately little 
time for reading, even in the winter evenings, only a 
few stolen minutes now and then. Father's strict rule 
was, straight to bed immediately after family worship, 
which in winter was usually over by eight o'clock." 

At last paternal permission was obtained to 
use as much of the early morning for reading 
as was desired. Fired with zeal to make the 
most of this opportunity, the son was out of bed 
the next morning long before daylight; and 
when he found by the kitchen clock that it was 
only one o'clock, his exultation at the prospect 
of five free hours knew no bounds. But the 
kitchen fire was out, and he feared to strain his 
father's indulgence too far by re-kindling it at 
so unheard-of an hour. The temperature was 
below freezing, and the only alternative to going 
back to bed was to take refuge in the compara- 
tive warmth of the cellar not to read, how- 
ever, as it was too cold even there for the enjoy- 
ment of poetry, but to give bodily shape to 
some of the many mechanical inventions with 
which the boy's head was teeming. All the 
world knows of Mr. Muir as a naturalist, but 
before he devoted himself to the wonders of 
natural science he had earned a reputation as a 
most ingenious and skilful inventor. Without 
ever having seen the inside of a clock or watch, 
he conceived the idea of a clock that should not 
only tell the time of day, but also the days of 
the month and of the week ; and he whittled out 
the machine in these early morning hours in the 
cellar, following it up with other curious con-

structions, and making them "go," too, when 
they were set up. From an iron rod, three feet 
long and five-eighths of an inch in diameter, 
that had formed part of a wagon box, he made 
a most delicate and accurate thermometer, 
multiplying the expansion and contraction of 
the rod by a series of levers, and making it so 
sensitive to variations of temperature that the 
dial hand would move at the approach of a 
person. Another contrivance would tilt a bed 
on end at any desired hour a most effective 
kind of alarm clock. Sketches of a number of 
these curious products of his inventive genius 
are drawn by the author for the illustration of 
his book. His account of these machines, and 
of the glory they won for him at county fairs 
and at the State University, where his room 
became a museum of wonders not yet forgotten, 
is exceedingly diverting and often amusing. 
Equally engrossing is his description of his 
eagerness for a college education and the way 
in which he contrived to gratify his longing. 
Let a short passage be here inserted: 

" With fear and trembling, overladen with ignorance, 
I called on Professor Stirling, the Dean of the Faculty, 
who was then Acting President, presented my case, and 
told him how far I had got on with my studies at home, 
and that I had n't been to school since leaving Scotland 
at the age of eleven years, excepting one short term of 
a couple of months at a district school, because I could 
not be spared from the farm work. After hearing my 
story, the kind professor welcomed me to the glorious 
University next, it seemed to me, to the Kingdom of 
Heaven. After a few weeks in the preparatory depart- 
ment I entered the Freshman class In Latin I found 
that one of the books in use I had already studied in 
Scotland. So, after an interruption of a dozen years, I 
began my Latin over again where I had left off; and, 
strange to say, most of it came back to me, especially 
the grammar which I had committed to memory at the 
Dunbar Grammar School." 

But to this student, Latin and Greek were 
only the dead sticks of knowledge ; the living 
tree was science, with its manifold wonders. 
Not surprising is it, therefore, that he refused 
to follow the prescribed course leading to a 
diploma, but picked here and there such studies 
as chemistry, geology, and botany, and spent his 
four college years more profitably than if he 
had pursued the usual routine ; for he had a 
maturity of mind and a wealth of hard-won 
experience not found in the average collegian. 
The problem how to support himself during his 
course at Madison was not the easiest one to 
solve, and at times he was reduced to fifty cents 
a week for the supply of his bodily needs. He 
boarded himself, as did many of his comrades, 
and worked at farming in summer and at teach- 
ing in winter to keep the wolf from the door. 



And through it all he turned his inventive fac- 
ulty to good account, constructing a thoroughly 
successful automatic fire-lighter for the country 
school he was teaching, thus saving precious 
time for his studies, and filling his room at the 
university with divers sorts of labor-saving 
devices. Here is his account of one of his 
summers : 

" At the beginning of the long summer vacation I 
returned to the Hickory Hill farm to earn the means 
in the harvest-fields to continue my University course, 
walking all the way to save railroad fares. And 
although I cradled four acres of wheat a day, I made 
the long, hard, sweaty day's work still longer and 
harder by keeping up my study of plants. At the noon 
hour I collected a large handful, put them in water to 
keep them fresh, and after supper got to work on them 
and sat up till after midnight, analyzing and classifying, 
thus leaving only four hours for sleep; and by the end 
of the first year, after taking up botany, I knew the 
principal flowering plants of the region." 

With the completion of the university course 
the narrative comes to an end, much to the 
reader's regret. Let us hope it may be con- 
tinued at an early date. There is a freshness 
and truth and simple sincerity about it that go 
far toward making it one of the great pieces of 
writing of its kind. It clears the brain and 
braces the system to read so genuine, unpre- 
tentious, homely, and convincing a bit of auto- 
biography. Sweet are the uses of adversity 
when it can shape such a life as is so unassum- 
ingly portrayed in Mr. Muir's pages. No one, 
having once opened the book, can lay it down 
unfinished ; and no one, having finished it, can 
fail to feel himself the better for it. 

In form and workmanship the volume is 
worthy of its contents. A fine portrait of the 
author faces the title-page.

BROWNING AS THE POET OF HIS 
CENTURY.* 



Of the large amount of literature put forth 
in connection with the recent Browning centen- 
ary, the most important contribution is Miss 
Helen A. Clarke's " Browning and his Cen- 
tury." It is a book of real distinction, fully 
up to date, and permeated with present-day 
thought. 

The first chapter gives us this thesis: (1) 
That in the history of thought one of the great- 
est contributions ever made was made by the 
nineteenth century, namely this, "Once for 
all, it decided what particular range of human

knowledge lies within the reach of mental per- 
ception and what particular range of human 
knowledge can be grasped only through spirit- 
ual perception"; and (2) that of this thought 
and this century the master poetic mind was 
Robert Browning. 

To trace how Browning entered into the arena 
and ventured to tackle, as early as in his second 
poem, the supreme problem of his age the rela- 
tion of mind and spirit is a purpose never lost 
sight of by the author. For example, in " Saul " 
she sees not only what the average reader sees 
a poem full of humanity, tenderness, and sheer 
poetic beauty, but also an interpretation of 
the origin of prophecy. It places Browning not 
only in the van of the thought of the century 
on questions connected with biblical criticism, 
but in a still more advanced position by virtue 
of the psychological tinge given to David's ex- 
perience. Miss Clarke points out that William 
James himself could not have portrayed better 
a case of religious ecstasy growing out of gen- 
uine exaltation of thought. The special contri- 
butions of Herbert Spencer, David Strauss, 
Cardinal Wiseman, and the group of Oxford men 
in the Tractarian Movement are summarized to 
show that Browning in his mid-century poems 
was abreast and sometimes ahead of even such 
leaders as these, in the battle of mind and spirit. 

Again, when later in the century scientific 
thought brought to the fore the problem of evil 
and its corollary, the conception of the Infinite, 
Browning was also completely abreast of the 
current. This is shown most fully in " Ferish- 
tah's Fancies " and " Parleyings." Miss Clarke 
is quite warranted in calling it a " strange freak 
of criticism " that so many, even of Browning's 
admirers, have failed to note the importance of 
these later works. The great outcry against 
them, of course, has been the old one that 
philosophical and ethical problems are not fit 
subjects for treatment in poetry. But, she 
argues, it is just as prejudiced and unforeseeing 
in these days to limit poetry to this or that kind 
of a subject, or to say that nothing is dramatic 
which does not deal with immediate action, as 
it would have been for Homer to declare that no 
poem would ever be worthy of the name that did 
not contain a catalogue of ships. By using the 
dramatic form, the poet has been able to convey 
a deep sense of the characteristics peculiar to 
the century. The latter half of the Victorian 
period, in its thought phases, lives just as surely 
in these poems as Renaissance Italy in its art 
phases lives in " Fra Lippo Lippi," " Andrea 
del Sarto," and the rest ; and this is true, 



though one group is cast in the form of Persian 
fables, and the second in the form of " Par- 
leyings " with worthies or un worthies of past 
centuries. 

The lyrics in "Ferishtah," albeit not con- 
forming to Elizabethan models, are accounted 
by Miss Clarke as among the finest ever written. 
It was a happy thought to place them as a com- 
panion picture to Mrs. Browning's "Sonnets 
from the Portuguese." The Sonnets portray 
the sunrise of a great love; the "Ferishtah" 
lyrics reflect the subsequent development of 
such a love, through the awakening of whole new 
realms of feeling, love for humanity as a whole, 
all the little trials of life dissolved in the new 
light, and divine love realized with a force never 
before possible. 

The chapters on "Political Tendencies" and 
"Social Ideals" are less convincing, since the 
author is forced to admit that Browning's poetry 
shows little interest in the political ideas of his 
own age and century, and that his social ideals 
have no touch of nineteenth century utilitarian- 
ism. While his work is instinct with sympathy 
for all classes and conditions of men, Browning 
does not feel the ills of life with the intensity 
of a Carlyle, nor its ugliness with the grief of 
a Ruskin, nor yet its lack of culture with the 
concern of an Arnold; nor would he stand in 
open spaces and preach socialism to the masses 
as did Morris. His thought was centred upon 
the worth of every human being to himself and 
for God. Earth is after all only a place to grow 
in, and to prepare one's self for life to come; 
and failure here, so long as the fight has been 
bravely fought, is to be regarded with anything 
but regret, for it is through the failure that the 
vision of the future is made more sure. 

One of the most acceptable features of this 
intensely interesting volume of nearly four hun- 
dred pages is its freedom from padding of any 
kind. Miss Clarke has avoided the custom of 
most of her predecessors, who fill in with long 
citations of the poet's own words. She is so 
thoroughly familiar with the poems that she 
assumes her readers to be, also. She is so thor- 
oughly steeped in their spirit that we are quite 
ready to agree with her, in this passage near 
the close: 

" The century had to grow up to him. It is needless 
to say that it did so. Just as out of the turmoil of 
conflicting scientific and religious thought has emerged 
a serene belief in man's spiritual destiny, so out of the 
turmoil of conflicting schools of criticism has arisen a 
perception of the value of the new, the original, the 
different in art. Critics begin to apply the principles 
of evolution to their criticism as Browning applied it to 



296

his art, . . . not forgetting that the poet or dramatist 
may have a farther vision of what is to come than any 
other man of his time. The people first, for the most 
part, found out that here in Browning's work was a new 
force, and calmly formed themselves into groups to 
study what manner of force it might be, regardless of 
the sneers of newspaperdom and conventional academies. 
And gradually, to the few appreciative critics of the 
early days have been added one authoritative voice after 
another until the chorus of praise has become a large 
one, and Browning, though later than any great poet of 
the century, is coming into his own." 

Through her latest volume, Miss Clarke has 
added one more to our long list of obligations to 
her as the editor and interpreter of Browning. 
It is unfortunate that in this new book so many 
printer's errors have escaped the proof-reader, 
such as "Chancer" for " Chaucer," "Athen's" 
for " Athens," and others equally obvious. The 
illustrations consist chiefly of half-tones from 
photographs of nineteenth century notables ; 
some of these are good, but the one at the close 
of the volume, showing Browning himself, is so 
badly reproduced as to be almost a caricature.

CLIMBING THE ROOF OF THE 



The political customs of Great Britain and 
Russia and the regulations of the native states 
in northern India and Tibet forbid Europeans 
to travel for any purpose in the neighborhood of 
Mt. Everest, the crowning peak of the Hima- 
layas. No exception could be made for the 
Duke of the Abruzzi, brother of the King of 
Italy, renowned as mountaineer and friend of 
science and exploration. Having conquered the 
Ruwenzori in Central Africa, he must turn in 
Asia from the forbidden monarch to the lesser 
but no less formidable peak designated in the 
coldly scientific annals of the Indian Geological 
Survey, and hence upon the maps, as " Mt.K V 

Aside from the challenge of unsealed summit, 
and the incentive to extend the horizon of geo- 
graphical knowledge by explorations and surveys 
into unknown regions, a third motive led to this 
attempt upon the highest peak of Karakoram, 
namely, to put to the test under natural condi-

tained effort under varying phases of climate 
at great elevations, and to determine if possible

the limits thereto which altitude with its reduced 
atmospheric pressure may establish. Laboratory 
experiments, indeed, and balloon ascensions in- 
dicate limits far above those of our greatest 
mountain peaks ; but such tests lack the very 
factors of exertion, endurance, and climate which 
are of essential value to the mountaineer. The 
first ascent of Mont Blanc (15,780 feet above 
sea-level) was made toward the close of the 
eighteenth century. Since that time the goal 
has been steadily pushed higher and higher till 
it now stands at 24,600 feet, achieved by the 
Duke of the Abruzzi on Bride Peak in his latest 
expedition. This exceeds by 700 feet the great- 
est mountain altitude achieved by men up to this 
time. Not only this, but the party lived for 
thirty -seven days at or above 16,000 feet, and 
then for another seventeen days were never 
below 18,000, nine days of this latter period 
being spent at or above 21,000 feet. During 
this time they made two ascents, involving four 
days of fatiguing work, sleeping at 21,673 and 
22,483 feet, and reaching 23,458 and 24,600, 
all of this being accomplished under adverse 
conditions of cramped quarters, constant bad 
weather, and reduced nourishment due to loss 
of appetite. 

Expeditions such as this are possible to but 
few persons. They require profound technical 
experience in geographical exploration, long and 
expensive preparations, complicated and heavy 
equipment to be conveyed by porters (often 
natives unaccustomed to the work and to the 
appurtenances of civilization), and, above all, 
energy, will, decision, and power of organization. 
They require also a genius for leadership which 
will sustain the morale alike of Swiss guides 
and of hired helpers, as well as of companions, 
at times when human effort is taxed to the limit 
of endurance amid dangers seen and unseen, 
when a false move or a mistake in judgment 
means certain disaster. Dr. Filippi's narrative 
is not a fulsome encomium of his leader, but one 
does not need to read far between the lines to 
appreciate the fact that the expedition to the 
Karakoram had the advantage of both studied 
scientific management and of inspiring leader- 
ship commanding the loyalty of all. 

But notwithstanding all that ample provision 
and wide experience could do, the flag of Savoy 
does not float from the summit of U K 2 ." Snow- 
mantled precipices, threatening avalanches, and 
almost continuous storms rendered the ascent 
impossible, though attempted at several angles 
and though the great elevation of 23,458 feet 
was reached. Baffled at this, the objective point

of the expedition, the leader turned to Bride 
Peak, and here, in spite of the cumulative effects 
upon himself and his party of the previous 
strenuous work at high altitudes, the cold of the 
almost continuous blizzard which enveloped them , 
and the malnutrition due to loss of appetite, he 
succeeded in attaining the hitherto unprece- 
dented height of 24,600 feet, but only to find 
himself balked again in reaching the summit 
by impassable precipices. 

The backbone of Asia covers a region five 
hundred miles wide, from Afghanistan to Burma, 
a distance of 1500 miles, far more than all the 
mountains of Europe and the Caucasus piled 
up together. North of the Punjab, and sepa- 
rated from it by the upper course of the Indus, 
stretches a huge system of towering peaks, 
the Karakoram, whose snowy mantle feeds a 
vast system of radiating glaciers. The route of 
the expedition lay through the Vale of Cashmir, 
and thence with a party recruited en route to 
the number of 250 porters and guides, they 
pushed across icy passes and the barren outliers 
of the distant range, over wavering bridges of 
twisted withes, across glacier-fed torrents, a dis- 
tance of 225 miles to the head of the Godwin 
Austen Glacier, whence they had their first 
sight of the object of their quest. 

" Suddenly and without warning, as if a veil had been 
lifted from our eyes, the wide Godwin Austen valley 
lay before us in its whole length. Down at the end, 
alone, detached from all the other mountains, soared up 
K 2 , the indisputable sovereign of the region, gigantic 
and solitary, hidden from human sight by innumerable 
ranges, jealously defended by a vast throng of vassal 
peaks, protected from invasion by miles and miles of 
glaciers. Even to get within sight of it demands so 
much contrivance, so much marching, such a sum of 
labors." 

This mountain, whose estimated altitude is 
28,000 feet, is not alone in its grandeur, but 
lies amid a sea of peaks more numerous even 
than in the Mt. Everest region. In the 450 
miles of the Karakoram chain there are no less 
than thirty-three known peaks of 24,000 feet or 
more. To these the Duke of the Abruzzi's 
explorations added one new peak exceeding 
27,000 feet, and at least fifteen others all over 
23,000, now measured for the first time. 

For many weeks the party marched across 
the great Baltoro Glacier, and from their sev- 
eral base camps essayed the subjugation of the 
towering white-robed pinnacle of "K 2 " at its 
head. While the Duke and his experienced 
Swiss guides were making their hazardous 
attempts to find some passable shoulder or 
chimney, other members of the party were 



actively working upon a very complete photo- 
grammetric survey and exploration of the Bal- 
toro Glacier and its tributaries. Most notable 
of all the records of these explorations are the 
wonderful photographs taken by Cav. Sella, 
and reproduced in the atlas accompanying the 
narrative. These fine panoramas, together with 
the excellent photographs reproduced freely in 
the text of the narrative, constitute a revelation 
of snow-clad peaks and pinnacles, and veritable 
torrents of moraine-covered ice sweeping down 
from every valley and merging in one vast sea of 
seracs, crevasses, and disrupted and dishevelled 
debris of cliff and precipice, a chaos of the 
world in the making. It is no exaggeration to 
state that these photographs of Cav. Bella's are 
unsurpassed in the magnificence and sublimity 
of the scenery they reveal. A distinctly new 
standard has been set, in reference to both sub- 
ject and execution of the plates. They fittingly 
accompany a straightforward and keenly inter- 
esting tale of a good piece of exploration emi- 
nently well done. 

The appendices deal with the scientific results 
of the expedition. The equipment for scientific 
exploration was exceptionally excellent, and the 
results are correspondingly significant. The 
greatest achievement was the accurate mapping 
of the Baltoro, Godwin, Austen, and Savoia 
glaciers, with their surrounding peaks and moun- 
tain chains, by means of the photogrammetric 
apparatus perfected by Comm. Paganini of the 
Military Geographical Institute of Florence. 
The plane table, tape, and theodolite are super- 
seded by a panoramic photographic apparatus 
provided with special measuring devices which 
furnish the photographic perspectives with the 
elements needed for the survey. In the field 
a series of views are taken from the different 
stations, with bearings to surrounding trigono- 
metrical points. These pictures serve later as- 
the basis for all those operations in map-making 
which under any other method must be per- 
formed in the field. The method is especially 
adapted to the survey of steep mountainous 
country, or of places in which for any reason 
the time for field work is limited or the country 
difficult of access. The nature and result of this 
survey are recounted by Lieut. Cambiasco ; and 
Professor Omodei reports upon the extensive 
meteorological and altimetrical observations 
carried on coincidently during the period of the 
exploration at a number of stations of consid- 
erable altitude along the route. These consti- 
tute a valuable addition to the climatology of 
these remote and little-known lauds. 



298 



[April 1 



The geological results are discussed by Ing. 
Novarese, of the Italian Geological Survey, and 
Mr. R. D. Oldham, of the Geological Survey 
of India. Their papers deal mainly with the 
tectonics of these ranges of mountains, and the 
interpretation of the remarkable courses which 
the Indus and its tributaries have cut through 
the mountain ranges ; and with the nature of the 
rock samples, which show that at least parts of 
these massive mountains are of Mesozoic origin. 
Discussion of the glaciers is confined to the nar- 
rative of the expedition. The last appendix, by 
Professor Pirotta and Dr. Cortesi, gives a list 
of the plants collected at these high altitudes. 

To the professional mountaineer the book 
brings a revelation of a well-planned, efficiently 
organized, and admirably executed expedition, 
together with the stimulus of an example of 
untiring effort, and it leaves the poignant chal- 
lenge of the unaccomplished. To the casual 
reader it brings a picture of the top of the world 
so interestingly portrayed that one is loath to 
leave it. To the lover of mountains it opens a 
new vista of glaciers, avalanches, and mountain 
peaks swathed in snow, grim, awful, and uncon- 
querable by the indomitable spirit of man, but 
still surpassingly beautiful and majestic.

"THE SUBJECT OF ALL, VERSE."* 

It would not, of course, be fair to state that 
the fame of Mary Sidney, Countess of Pem- 
broke, has been overshadowed by that of her 
brother Philip, with whom she was so closely 
and happily associated. On the contrary, she 
has gained a measure of immortality through 
this association that she could hardly have 
hoped to win otherwise. Biographers have loved 
to dwell upon the deep and tender tie that bound 
brother and sister whose mutual confidence was 
so perfect, and whose tastes were so kindred. 
They have often painted the charming picture 
of the joint literary labors of these two in the 
great library, or in the lovely park, at Wilton, 
during the period of Philip's exile from Court 
through the Queen's displeasure. A gracious 
legend has even shown them engaged in active 
collaboration upon Sidney's idyllic romance, 
"The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia"; and 
the sister's assumed share in the actual com- 
position of this work has assured her hitherto 
a much higher and more important place in 



* MARY SIDNEY, COUNTESS OF PEMBROKE. By Frances 
Berkeley Young. With portraits. London : David Nutt. 



Elizabethan literature, on the creative side, than 
modern criticism is now disposed to allow her. 
The recent discovery, by Mr. Bertram Dobell, 
of three new manuscripts of the " Arcadia " 
seems to prove conclusively that Lady Pem- 
broke's share, outside of what inspiration she 
may have afforded, was strictly limited to cer- 
bain corrections and changes which she deemed 
necessary when preparing for the press a com- 
plete version of the story out of several incom- 
plete manuscript " states." Her edition, which 
was the second, appeared in 1593, or three 
years after Lord Brooke's partial printing. 

And yet, although Mary Sidney has gained 
so much, she has also lost something, through 
the closeness of this association with her brother. 
Absorbed so completely into his personality, 
certain individual traits of her own have be- 
come more or less obscured, and her peculiar 
position in Elizabethan letters has not always 
been sufficiently emphasized. Lady Pembroke 
was not only her brother's sister although she 
herself accepted this secondary role with a hu- 
mility that would be touching did it not contain 
so much noble pride and herself a writer of 
moderate merit, whose literary undertakings 
were largely identified with his. She was also 
a great lady of the Renaissance, one of the first 
women of high rank in England to adopt that 
liberal attitude towards literature of which so 
many women of France and Italy bad already 
given illustrious examples. Nicholas Breton 
compared her with the Duchess of Urbino, and 
this comparison " is of very great interest," 
writes Miss Young, whose monograph deals 
very thoroughly and suggestively with this 
aspect of her subject, " showing, as it does, that 
the Italian fashion of a cultivated lady of rank 
as the centre of a literary and artistic circle had 
reached England, along with all the other 
Italian ' influences ' of that and earlier periods." 
"It should be remembered," the writer con- 
tinues, "that Lady Pembroke was only one of 
a group of ladies of rank whose tastes were 
literary, and whose purses were more or less 
open. Margaret, Countess of Cumberland 
. . . Lucy, Countess of Bedford . . . Anne 
Clifford . . . Countess of Dorset and Mont- 
gomery, were all women of this type. Lady 
Pembroke, however, easily surpasses them all 
in the solidity of her attainments, and the real 
scope of her contributions to letters and culture." 
The same may be said of her active patronage 
of men of letters. While her husband lived 
and she remained chatelaine of Wilton, that 
house formed a veritable refuge for poets whom 



1913]

she befriended and who repaid her with compli- 
mentary addresses and epistles-dedicatory like 
that with which Thomas Howells prefaced his 
*' Devises." This, dated 1581, when Lady Pem- 
broke was still hardly more than a girl, is the 
earliest which the author has been able to find. 
Among the other poets and men of letters who 
contributed to this galaxy of praise, are men- 
tioned Nicholas Breton, Abraham Fraunce, 
Samuel Daniel, Thomas Nashe (as well as his 
adversary, Gabriel Harvey, so Lady Pembroke 
would seem to have kept fairly clear of current 
literary controversy), Thomas Watson, Barnaby 
Barnes, Thomas Churchyard, Michael Drayton, 
and so on almost without end, while, of course, 
Spenser's tribute to her poetical powers, in 
" Astrophel," is well known. Some of these 
poets she actively influenced, as in the case of 
Daniel, whose tragedy after the Senecan model, 
"Cleopatra, "doubtless owes its direct inspiration 
to her own translation of Garnier's " Antonie." 
Lady Pembroke's dramatic interests and sym- 
pathies were, like her brother's, clearly classical, 
and doubtless her influence was, as far as pos- 
sible, exerted against the rise and spread of the 
romantic school. But whatever hope there may 
have been for a moment that her taste might 
triumph was soon dispelled by the eclipse of 
Kyd another of her proteges who, it has been 
suggested, was her master in the structure of 
English blank verse, and who was still a third 
translator of Gamier. It is to this particular 
development of the contemporary drama, rather 
than, as Miss Young seems inclined to think, 
to any imperfect sympathy with the dramatic 
form as such, that should be attributed the 
slightness of her connection, so far as we know, 
with the dramatic art of her time. There is, 
indeed, a paucity of playwrights among the poets 
*' whom she countenanced and subsidized," and 
many of whom "are, to our modern view, as 
mediocre of their kind as the most mediocre and 
extravagant dramatist of the time." But the 
extravagance and mediocrity of her sonneteers 
were well within the regies of the art they 
practiced, while those of the dramatists were of 
a strange new variety which seemed to have no 
root in the literary culture of the past, and even 
to attack and set this culture at naught. Yet, 
even so, it would seem strange that, as Miss 
Young points out, Lady Pembroke apparently 
never "gave countenance financial or other- 
wise to that gifted but needy and reckless 
youth," Philip Massinger, whose father, Arthur 
Massinger, was for so many years in her hus- 
band's employ as "a kind of secretary and 



trusted agent," and whom, therefore, she must 
have known all about. Perhaps, however, it is 
the records that are at fault; anyway, it is easier 
to believe that this is the case, than that the 
Countess was actually guilty of what might 
well seem gross indifference or even neglect of a 
member of the family of an old and faithful 
retainer especially on any such grounds as 
mere lack of complete literary sympathy. 

For Mary Sidney may have been, as Miss 
Young asserts, an accomplished type of the 
"blue-stocking" though she uses the term 
without prejudice, simply to indicate what seem 
to her temperamental reasons for rejecting any 
intimations of renaissance Platonistic tendencies 
on the part of her heroine. She was this, but 
she was much more besides an exceedingly 
lovable, warmhearted, loyal, and altogether hu- 
man woman. Fragmentary as are her personal 
records, and incomplete as must therefore ne- 
cessarily be our estimate of many sides of her 
character, one intimate trait, at least, stands 
clearly forth, along with her high intellectual 
quality and her well-attested practical capacity 
in the management of her affairs. This is a 
strain of genuine gentleness, that comes out 
again and again in her letters, and that shows 
her to have been ever considerate and thought- 
ful for others, and full of a grave and tender 
concern for their welfare. The letters themselves 
are not numerous, and they often deal mainly 
with matters of indifferent interest. But nearly 
all have certain self -revelatory touches that tend 
to bring the writer more closely to us. We have 
to thank Miss Young for thus collecting them, 
and also for printing, for the first time, Lady 
Pembroke's translation of Petrarch's "Trionfo 
della Morte," which is full of verbal and met- 
rical felicities. The little book, as a whole, con- 
tains as complete and well-rounded a picture as it 
would be possible to make of this literary great 
lady whose character and activities, no less than 
her sentimental associations, entitle her to an 
important place in the history of English society 
and literature. w. A. BRADLEY. 



THE centenary of David Livingstone's birth, which 
occurs this year, is fittingly marked by the republica- 
tion, in popular and fairly inexpensive form, of Henry M. 
Stanley's two famous books, " How I Found Living- 
stone " and "In Darkest Africa" (Scribner). A new 
introduction is contributed to the first-named book by 
Dr. Robert E. Speer, Secretary of the Presbyterian 
Board of Foreign Missions. All the old wood-cuts and 
maps seem to be retained in both volumes. Another 
publication appropriate to the centenary is a reprint, in 
the " Macmillan Standard Library," of Mr. C. Silvester 
Home's brief " Life of David Livingstone."

[April 1 



THE PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN SOCIALISM.* 



In more than one of the important countries 
of continental Europe the socialists hold to-day 
the centre of the political stage. The aspect of 
national and local elections which is scrutinized 
most keenly is the showing of the spcialist party. 
The parliamentary group most watched, and 
most feared, is the socialist. And the measures 
which absorb the most serious efforts of the 
State are not infrequently those of socialistic 
origin and character. For people accustomed to 
the political impotence and the sluggish head- 
way of the socialist movement on this side of 
the Atlantic it is difficult indeed to conceive 
how vast a place socialism fills in the politics 
and everyday thought of France, Germany, 
Austria, Italy, or Belgium. 

The progress of European socialism is to be 
measured only in part by the swelling statistics 
of party membership. The figures are unques- 
tionably impressive, but the developments of 
largest significance are those relating rather to 
the spirit, aim, and trend of the socialist propa- 
ganda. To arrive at an estimate of socialism's 
inward character at the present day, a non- 
socialist American investigator, Dr. Samuel P. 
Orth, has undertaken recently a study of the 
subject on the spot and in consultation with the 
most authoritative exponents of the creed. The 
results, which have been gathered in a somewhat 
sketchy but readable volume, under the title 
" Socialism and Democracy in Europe," are 
well worth the attention of every student of 
contemporary social phenomena. The aspects 
of the socialist movement in the four countries 
covered England, France, Germany, and Bel- 
gium which are adjudged most fundamental 
at the present time are its practical, even oppor- 
portunist, character and the readiness of the 
majority of its partisans to employ ordinary 
political means to attain their ends. The poli- 
tical connections, policies, and triumphs of the 
socialist masses become, indeed, the real theme 
of the book. It is shown that the majority of 
socialists have cast off entirely such earlier ec- 
centricities as the ravings against religion and 
the espousal of free love ; that there has come 
gradually an understanding that institutions are 
the products of ages and " cannot be changed 
at the fancy of every new and disgruntled 
prophet "; that the old cry of class- war has 
been largely discarded, in the reaJization that 
the interests of the worker are not fundament- 



* SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY IN EUROPE. By Samuel 
P. Orth, Ph.D. New York : Henry Holt & Co. 



ally different from those of the rest of the com- 
munity ; that the end to be sought has been 
discovered to be a levelling-up, not a le veiling- 
down of society ; and that the old ideal of 
change by bloody revolution has given place to 
the newer one of reform by methods of peace 
and persuasion. 

Under the influence of these ideas the social- 
ists as a body have turned their attention in all 
countries from overpowering and remotely pos- 
sible achievements to less ambitious but more 
readily realizable ones. Collective ownership of 
the means of production and distribution, the 
destruction of capitalism, the abolition of pov- 
erty these remain ultimate ideals. But the 
objects to which present attention is directed 
are rather such as relate to workingmen's com- 
pensation legislation, old age pensions, sickness 
and accident insurance, regulation of the hours 
of labor, and other phases of social legislation in 
the interest of the laboring masses. The instru- 
ment of achievement is the ballot, and where the 
power of the ballot is inequitably distributed, as 
it is in Germany, electoral reform is likely to 
stand at the forefront of the socialist programme. 
Syndicalism, involving as it does the employ- 
ment of force, represents a reversion to the 
semi-anarchistic spirit of the socialism of sixty 
years ago ; but it seems to be Mr. Orth's opinion 
that syndicalism will not be able to hold its 
own against the more moderate influences of 
the evolutionary socialists. 

The practical achievements of political social- 
ism are shown to have been enormous. Indeed, 
it has been only since the socialists have begun 
to be represented actively in the parliaments 
and sometimes in the ministries as well of 
Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Austria, 
Denmark, and other countries, that positive 
achievements of an important nature can be 
accredited to them. Of these achievements 
three are emphasized by the author as of prin- 
cipal importance. The first is the extension to 
the laboring masses of the democracy established 
for the middle classes by the bourgeois revolu- 
tions of 1848 and after. Always and every- 
where the socialists stand for universal suffrage, 
direct elections, and the secret ballot, and in 
Belgium and other countries their influence has 
been decisive of the policy to be adopted in 
respect to a variety of such matters. Secondly, 
the socialists, becoming themselves lawmakers, 
have been able to force upon the attention of 
lawmaking bodies the question of labor in all 
its aspects and to obtain labor legislation of a 
most beneficent character. And, thirdly, they 



1913]

have prodded the State to the assumption of 
manifold obligations and activities which form- 
erly were regarded as lying quite beyond its 
sphere. The State in these days not only makes 
and enforces laws, levies taxes, conducts foreign 
relations, and makes war ; it inspects mines and 
factories, maintains asylums and hospitals, pro- 
vides schools, pensions aged workmen, insures 
against unemployment, regulates housing, and 
does scores of other things which it rarely or 
never did in times past. These things it now 
does largely as a matter of course, and mainly 
because the power of socialism, whether visible 
or hidden, has accomplished the partial "social- 
ization" of the state, even though contrary to 
the will and intent of the so-called governing 
classes. 

The book is provided with a brief but well- 
selected bibliography, and an extended appendix 
contains useful documentary materials (chiefly 
socialist declarations of principles), synopses of 
electoral laws, and statistical tables. Crammage, 
correctly printed in the bibliography, appears 
on page 53 as Grummage. 

FREDERIC AUSTIN OGG. 



GENERAL, GRANT'S LETTERS.* 



In his introduction to the newly published 
Letters of General Grant, Mr. George Haven 
Putnam remarks that "there is no utterance 
that can give as faithful a picture of a man's 
method of thought and principle of action as 
the personal letters written, with no thought of 
later publication, to those who are near to him." 
Applying this principle to Grant's correspond- 
ence, Mr. Putnam says that "these letters, 
dating back to the time of his youth, give a 
clear and trustworthy impression of the nature 
of the man and of the development of character 
and force that made possible his all-valuable 
leadership." 

But the general reader will probably feel that 
while the collection is of considerable interest 
it hardly measures up to the standard suggested 
by Mr. Putnam. It would not be fair to the 
great general to say that these papers are of 
extraordinary value; they are straightforward, 
frank, and brief, and they show a development 
of character from first to last; but they do 
not reflect the whole nature of the man as do 
the Sherman letters. Compared with the pri- 

*LETTBRS QF ULYSSES S. GRANT to his Father and his 
Youngest Sister, 1857-78. Edited by his nephew, Jesse 
Grant Cramer. Illustrated. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



vate letters of his chief lieutenant, Grant's are 
somewhat dry and reserved. Sherman poured 
out on paper his plans, feelings, affections, 
disappointments, hesitation, prophecy; Grant, 
for the most part, confines his correspondence 
to simple statements of concrete facts, in sim- 
ple language, with a lack of imagination and 
absence of prophecy. His " Memoirs " are less 
reserved, and must be used with the letters to 
give a fair picture of the man's character. 

The letters do have, however, considerable 
value. For one thing, they throw light on the 
seven years before the Civil War, when, accord- 
ing to some unfriendly critics and ill-advised 
admirers, Grant was living in the depths of 
poverty. This tradition is now effectively dis- 
posed of. The letters show that he had "a 
large farm," " 200 acres of ploughed land and 
250 in pasture"; that at one time he had three 
negro slaves, and at another "seven negroes 
were sick"; that he raised six different kinds 
of crops; and that, like Lincoln, he split some 
rails, though probably they were few. 

Most of the letters, which were written to his 
father and his youngest sister, contain news 
about family matters, how the children are 
growing and studying ("Fred does not read"), 
visits to and from relatives in Kentucky and 
Illinois, and, before 1861, about business mat- 
ters. In a letter of 1857 this wish is expressed: 
"I am anxious to make one more visit home 
before I get old." He hesitates about his wife's 
visit to Kentucky because the boat will make so 
many landings in free states, and the "servants 
may cause trouble." 

After selling his farm and going into the real 
estate business in St. Louis, Grant seems to have 
taken an interest in politics. He was defeated 
by the Free-soilers when he ran as a Democrat 
for county engineer, and later he failed to get a 
desired position in the custom house because he 
was not sufficiently Democratic. Of his politics 
he wrote in 1859: "I never voted an out and 
out Democratic ticket in my life. I voted for 
Buchanan to defeat Fremont, but not because 
he was my first choice. In all other elections 
I have universally selected the candidates that 
in my estimation were the best fitted for the 
different offices, and it never happens that such 
men are all arrayed on one side." The letters 
of 1861 contain but little speculation about the 
outcome of the Secession movement ; in two in- 
stances only does the writer venture to predict 
the future: "My opinion is that the war will 
be of short duration," and "the negro will never 
disturb this country again." A few weeks later 



302 



THE DIAL, 



[April 1 



he withdraws from the field of prophecy with 
the remark, "I have changed my mind so much 
that I don't know what to think." Grant's 
opinion of secessionists may be seen in the fol- 
lowing extract from a letter of April, 1861 : 

" Great allowance should be made for South Carolin- 
ians, for the last generation have been educated, from 
their infancy, to look upon their Government as oppres- 
sive and tyrannical and only to be endured till such 
time as they might have sufficient strength to strike it 
down. Virginia, and other border states, have no such 
excuse and are therefore traitors at heart as well as in 
act." 

That Genera] Grant was sometimes somewhat 
annoyed by his father, who was proud of the 
growing fame of his son, is shown in the war- 
time correspondence. The father thought that 
his soldier son was neglected by the newspapers 
and the authorities, and he sometimes made 
public his opinions of military leaders and public 
men, much to the embarrassment of General 
Grant. The father also requested favors for 
friends and neighbors, which the son did not 
wish to grant. The following passages exhibit 
the irritation of the son: 

" I cannot take an active part in securing contracts. 
If I were not in the army I should do so, but situated 
as I am it is necessary both to my efficiency for the 
public good and my own reputation that I should keep 
clear of Government contracts." 

" You are very much disposed to criticise unfavorably 
from information received through the public press, a 
portion of which I am sorry to see can look at nothing 
favorably that does not look to a war upon slavery." 

" I would write you many particulars but you are so 
imprudent that I dare not trust you with them; and 
while on this subject let me say a word. I have not an 
enemy in the world who has done me so much injury as 
you in your efforts in my defence. I require no defend- 
ers and for my sake let me alone." 

" You are constantly denouncing other general officers 
and the inference with people naturally is that you get 
your impressions from me. Do nothing to correct what 
you have already done but for the future keep quiet on 
this subject." 

" I have no hobby of my own with regard to the 
negro, either to effect his freedom or to continue his 
bondage. If Congress pass any law and the President 
approves, I am willing to execute it. Laws are certainly 
as binding on the minority as the majority. I do not 
believe in even the discussion of the propriety of laws 
and official orders by the army. One enemy at a time 
is enough and when he is subdued it will be time enough 
to settle personal differences." 

The post-bellum correspondence is scanty and 
of less interest ; but here and there are strik- 
ing passages, for example, he says that the 
strikes of 1877 "should have been put down 
with an iron hand and so summarily as to pre- 
vent a like occurrence for a generation . " In 1 8 8 
he fears that the Democratic party will return 
to power, but, he says, " I sincerely hope that 



the North will so thoroughly rally by next elec- 
tion as to bury the last remnant of secession 
proclivities, and put in the Executive chair a 
firm and steady hand, free from Utopian ideas 
purifying the party electing him out of exist- 
ence." Perhaps the most characteristic letter in 
the collection is the following brief note to a 
relative, in which he breaks the news of his 
financial misfortunes : 

" I regret that I have not more cheerful news to 
write you than I have. Financially the Grant family 
is ruined for the present, and by the most stupendous 
frauds ever perpetrated. But your Aunt Jennie must 
not fret over it. I still have a home and as long as I 
live she shall enjoy it as a matter of right; at least 
until she recovers what she has lost. Fred is young^ 
active, honest, and intelligent, and will work with a vim 
to recuperate his losses. Of course his first effort will 
be to repay his aunts."

RECENT FICTION.* 



When Roland, the twelfth Baron Burdon, was 
killed fighting on the Indian frontier, he left his 
affairs in a sad mess. The estates and title went 
to a distant relative, whose wife was a selfish and 
worldly woman, and their child Hollo became the 
prospective heir. Now this was all wrong, because 
Roland had been secretly married before leaving for 
India, and had put into his wife's hands the com- 
plete documentary evidence of her marital status. 
When the news of her husband's death reaches Lon- 
don, she makes one despairing effort to assert her 
rights, in the interests of the child that is soon to 
come. Being rebuffed, she becomes delirious, and 
soon thereafter dies in childbirth. The issue, a 
lusty boy, is taken in charge by her maiden sister, 
who also discovers the all-important documents, and 
she brings the child up in ignorance of his birth- 
right, nursing through all the years a bitter hatred 
of the usurpers, and a fixed determination to humble

them when the child Percival shall have reached his 
majority. But fate so has it that Percival and Hollo 
are thrown together as children, and become devoted 
friends. As they approach manhood, both love the 
same girl, who loves the former, but becomes pledged 
to the latter through the urging of her match-making 
mother. Then the great revelation is made to Per- 
cival, who cannot bring himself to accept, at the cost 
of his comrade's happiness, the title which might be 
his. The matter is brought home to him poignantly 
when he finds that the secret is also known to a lackey, 
crazed with socialistic folly, who is determined to 
reveal it. Percival has an encounter with this fel- 
low, and the Gordian knot of the whole complication 
is cut when he receives a fatal wound in his struggle 
for the mastery. Thus does he finally qualify for 
the ascription of the title which Mr. Hutchinson has 
given to the story, and which is meant for its hero. 
This is a very beautiful and vital book, with a great 
deal of outdoors in it, besides its other elements of 
humor, pathos, movement, suspense, and romance. 
Its outdoor phase is chiefly related to the gypsy car- 
avan with which Percival travels for a time, and in 
which he becomes an adept in the "manly" art. 
His fight with the bully of the caravan is one of the 
most vivid in literature, and is hardly surpassed by 
either Borrow or Meredith. The character of the 
gypsy girl whose love for Percival remains unre- 
quited is one of the most striking and sympathetic 
in the novel, and hardly less so is that of her phil- 
osophical father. The book is one that stands out 
conspicuously among the novels of the year. 

A forecast of the future is essayed by "G. A. 
Birmingham " (the Rev. J. O. Hannay) in "The 
Red Hand of Ulster," the latest of his delightful 
inventions. The deadly seriousness of the discus- 
sion which has attended the Home Rule bill during 
its stormy passage through the House of Commons 
is relieved by Mr. Hannay's humorous handling of 
the subject, which toys with this grave political 
problem in the most delightful fashion. One J. P. 
Conroy, an Irish- American of great wealth, casting 
about for something which shall bring the element 
of excitement into the monotonous course of his 
existence, turns his attention to Ulster, and resolves 
to finance the revolution which he sees to be impend- 
ing. One would suppose that the sympathies of such 
a man would be with the Nationalists, but to join 
forces with them would be too tame a proceeding, 
and the romantic possibilities of an alliance with the 
unionists, determined not to be set under the heel of 
a hated alien government, prove irresistible in their 
appeal to him. There is evidently much more fun 
to be got out of a revolution than out of mere acqui- 
escence in the ruthless plan of the government to 
crush the liberties of the protestant counties of the 
north of Ireland. So Conroy lays his plans, and 
pulls the right strings, in consequence whereof the 
revolt is soon organized, and preparations for armed 
resistance to the change of government are well 
under way before the authorities have any definite 
notion of what is going on. A situation which is 



likely to become grim reality in the near future, if 
the government persists in its mad plan to coerce the 
liberties of a brave and determined people, is thus 
foreshadowed by the novelist, whose belief in the 
righteousness of Ulster's cause is very evident, 
although he never loses his temper in talking about 
it. He is not one of those who say that "Ulster will 
blaster, but Ulster will not muster," for he knows 
too well the temper of the people among whom he 
lives, believing that they will fight for their liberties,, 
if forced to take that stand, in the spirit of the 
covenanters or of Cromwell's soldiers. But the 
author cannot discuss even so grave a problem as- 
this other than good-naturedly, and so, when it 
comes to actual fighting in the streets of Belfast, he 
keeps the carnage well out of view. The city is 
bombarded from the harbor, and the fire from, 
machine-guns sweeps its thoroughfares, but nobody 
in particular seems to get killed, and the worst 
damage recorded is the shattering of a statue of 
Queen Victoria. But the government does not dare 
to force the issue to a desperate conclusion, and makes 
terms with the insurgents, agreeing to their stipula- 
tion that it shall withdraw from Ireland altogether. 
Thus the delightfully illogical outcome of a rebellion 
against the imposition upon Ireland of a limited sort 
of home rule is that the government concedes un- 
limited home rule, and the rebels cheerfully accept 
it as what they have been fighting for all the while. 
The whole story is told in the gayest of spirits, and 
the various types of character that such an agitation 
brings forth the official, the agitator, the indiffer- 
entist, and the fiery "patriot" are limned with ex- 
traordinary skill and insight into human nature. The 
imperturbable good nature and comic opera spirit 
of the narrative make it one of the most delightful 
that the author has written. But the matter of 
which it treats is too serious to be disposed of by 
solventur risu tabulae, and we apprehend that his- 
tory will record for it an outcome considerably less. 
farcical than that which is here chronicled. 

Mr. W. B. Maxwell's novels have a way of mak- 
ing themselves remembered. Thinking over the 
four or five of them that we have read during the 
past ten years, we find that they stand out in the 
memory in theme and general outline far more 
clearly than most other novels of the same period. 
Each of them has either a distinctive central char- 
acter or a definite central situation so clear-cut 
in its presentation, and so skilfully built up out 
of a multitude of significant details that it makes 
an impression not easily effaced. There are few 
digressions or irrelevances, and not much episod- 
ical matter for the distraction of the attention. 
These considerations apply to "General Mallock's 
Shadow," which is a fine example of the art of 
writing a strong and interesting novel. General 
Mallock is a man who nurses a grievance until his 
mentality shades into monomania, and his brain is 
on the verge of collapse, when its equilibrium is 
restored by a sharp crisis in his life, which calls 
into renewed activity his old-time powers, effectively

arresting the forces of decay. Many years before 
the story opens, he had been the commander of a 
forlorn hope on an outpost of the Indian frontier, 
and had surrendered to the enemy to save the lives 
of the women and children. For this he had been 
severely censured, and his name had been removed 
from the army list. Now, in his solitary house on 
the Yorkshire moors, he is found brooding, as he 
has done ever since the disaster, over the injustice 
done him by the authorities. His household includes 
a son and two daughters, and over them all the 
shadow has lain from their childhood. For the 
hand of his elder daughter, whose life is devoted 
to the care of her ageing parent, there appear two 
suitors a country physician, and a titled land- 
owner among whose properties is a large stone- 
quarry. The latter has difficulties with his men, 
which culminate in a strike and much violence. 
In the denouement, the house is attacked by several 
hundred angry rioters, for the purpose of capturing 
an obnoxious manager who has taken refuge within 
its walls. It has for its defense the General and 
his daughters, the two suitors, and a few servants. 
In this crisis, the old General throws off his lethargy, 
becomes once more the commander in the field, 
and takes complete direction of events, giving his 
orders with sharp decision. After a four hours' 
siege, the enemy is repulsed, and this defeat puts an 
end to the strike. All England rings with the ex- 
ploit, and both compliments and honors are heaped 
upon the old man, making tardy but complete repa- 
ration for the disgrace of many years before. The 
stirring scene, and the moving narrative of what fol- 
lows, bring the story to a fine ending. 

"The Royal Road" (an ironical title) is the story 
of Teddy Hankey, a London workingman in the 
fierce grip of circumstance, told in staccato style by 
Mr. Alfred Ollivant. Teddy is a very common 
sort of individual, the type of his class, who saddles 
himself with a family before his prospects warrant 
such a venture, and then runs through all the gamut 
of distress and illness until fate is too much for him, 
and he becomes a victim of the great white plague. 
It is a pathetic story of the slums, intense in its 
development, and minute in its sordid realism, and 
doubtless the counterpart of what occurs to thousands 
who struggle for a livelihood in the Great Wen. 
Teddy has a spring of hope in his breast which 
keeps him buoyant nearly to the end, and the vision 
of what may be a pitiful cockney vision, at best 
makes his path to the grave a " royal road " in some 
sort of transcendental sense. 

A story of purely human interest, unconcerned 
with any problem and not depending upon any 
historical setting as a lure to the attention, a story 
of fine texture and engrossing charm, is found in 
Mr. Ronald McDonald's " Lanchester of Braze- 
nose." Lanchester is a successful novelist and war- 
correspondent, happily married, as he supposes. 
Returning to London late one night, some hours in 
advance of his expected arrival, he discovers a man 
in the house, and his wife in a suspicious state of 



agitation. She has certainly been indiscreet, and, 
despite her protestations of innocence, he leaves his 
home, engages lodgings elsewhere, and the next day 
sends for his personal belongings. Soon thereafter, 
two letters are interchanged, hers to the effect that 
she has not been unfaithful, his to the effect that 
whether unfaithful or not she has shattered his idol. 
Her letter is returned as an enclosure with his, and 
thereby ensues a complication not fully to be un- 
tangled for years. These two letters are captured 
by a prying nurse-maid, who substitutes blank sheets 
for them, and burns the latter at the command of 
her mistress, and in her presence. Lanchester, after 
reflection, finding himself unwilling to return to his 
wife, takes the quixotic position that the divorce 
must come from her, and manufactures evidence 
that shall be sufficient to convict him of both cruelty 
and adultery. Thus he makes himself a kind of 
outcast, and spends several years in foreign wander- 
ings. During these years, one of his oldest friends, 
believing her to be a deeply injured woman, wins 
the love of the divorced wife, and persuades her to 
marry him. Returning to England, Lanchester 
learns what has happened, and becomes greatly con- 
cerned about his child, custody having been given 
to the mother by the court. He learns that the child 
is deprived of a mother's love, and, although well 
cared for, is growing up into a mollycoddle through 
lack of judicious education. He is determined to 
get possession of his boy, and, having no legal rights, 
resorts to kidnapping. The plot is successful, and 
all England rings with it, thus bringing the secreted 
letters back into the story. For the woman who 
holds them writes to the mother threatening their 
disclosure to the husband unless the child is per- 
mitted to remain with his father. At this point the 
story takes a new angle, for the father, hastening 
from pursuit with his child, falls in with an old 
Oxford acquaintance, now the actor-manager of a 
provincial theatrical troupe. He asks to be taken 
in as a member of the company, which he believes 
will prove an effective mode of concealment. His 
request is granted, and from now on the story has 
a strong theatrical tinge. It is " Wilhelm Meister " 
over again, and all the other novels in which the ex- 
periences of a travelling theatrical company are made 
a means for the development of character and the 
devising of plot. Lanchester becomes the good angel 
of the company, helps it over many a rough spot, 
writes a play for it, leases a London theatre, and 
falls in love with the young woman known as 
" Divvy-Di," who is the genius of the troupe. 
Meanwhile, the child is very happy with his newly- 
found father and friends, and rapidly developes the 
manly qualities that his father so wishes, and that 
have never before had a chance. When the com- 
pany comes to London, the secreted letters make a 
final appearance in the plot, for the ci-devant nurse- 
maid has a husband, who steals them, and proceeds 
to use them for blackmailing purposes. How Lan- 
chester and " Divvy-Di " get on his track, hunt him 
down, and get hold of the letters, is a thrilling

story all by itself, and fills the closing chapters of 
the novel. The letters are destroyed, Lanchester's 
former wife is freed from her haunting fear, and 
Lanchester wins in the new love more than he had 
lost in the old one of years agone. This summary 
is far from doing justice to either the ingenuity, the 
dramatic force, or the all-pervading charm of the 
novel, which is one of the very best of the year's 
output. 

For a story of adventure, thrilling to the last 
degree, and free from descriptive or psychological 
padding, Mr. Frederick Ferdinand Moore's "The 
Devil's Admiral" is to be highly commended. It is 
a story of the China seas, where "the devil's ad- 
miral" is a name to conjure with. He is a mysteri- 
ous person, who somehow boards one ship after 
another, and works his fell purpose to such effect 
that the ship is never heard of again, and no one is 
left living to tell the tale of its tragic fate. It is 
left to an English journalist to solve the mystery, 
and put the fiend out of business. The action takes 
place on the Kut Sang, bound from Manila to Hong 
Kong, and a sanctimonious missionary, calling him- 
self the Reverend Luther Meeker, is revealed as 
''the devil's admiral." He has a gang of allies in 
the ship's company, and when the hour is ripe, they 
mutiny under his direction, take possession of the 
ship and its consignment of specie, and bury the 
loot upon a desert island. But the journalist and 
the Yankee skipper outwit the pirate chief, put an 
end to his evil life, and recover the gold. It is almost 
as good as "Treasure Island," and will delight the 
hearts of all boys, young and old alike. 

Mr. Robert Herrick has long been recognized as 
one of the most minutely observant and conscientious 
interpreters in fiction of American life. Despite 
his absolute lack of the vital quality of humor, and 
despite the jaundiced eye which reports his search- 
ing, and often clinical, investigations, his work has 
the sharpness of etching, and one is always conscious 
of the acid which bites the lines. "One Woman's 
Life " is the title of his new novel, and it is exactly 
descriptive, for the work is just (imaginary) bio- 
graphy, remorselessly detailed, with no more plot 
than the average commonplace life exhibits, and no 
moments more dramatic than are likely to be found 
in the career of the ordinary mortal. It is the life- 
history of Milly Ridge, between the ages of sixteen 
and forty. Milly is a girl without education, and 
with no social position except what she can make for 
herself, a girl of humble station with which she is 
anything but content, a girl determined to "get on," 
a girl who realizes that there are better things in life 
than her immediate environment offers, and whose 
instincts lead her unerringly into the ways whereby 
these desirable things may be encompassed. She is 
a good girl, conventionally virtuous, kindly of dis- 
position, but firm in the conviction t hat the world is 
her oyster, and determined to possess herself of its 
succulent contents. When she comes to Chicago in 
1885 at the beginning of the story, fate plants her 
upon the West Side, and she makes the best of it 



by going to the right church, cultivating the right 
acquaintances among the congregation, and getting 
herself sent to the right school. Then she contrives 
to get her father to plunge into business for himself, 
and to take an expensive house on the North Side, 
where her beauty and amiability soon make her a 
social favorite. About the time of the World's Fair, 
she engages herself to a wealthy bachelor, but after 
a while balks at his personal characteristics, and 
breaks off the match in a pet. Then a visit to 
Mackinac, "on the shore of Lake Superior," leads 
to a quasi-engagement with a well-to-do California 
fruit-grower. Before this is consummated, however, 
she becomes fascinated by a young newspaper-artist 
who earns thirty dollars a week, and throws discre- 
tion to the winds by marrying him. They go abroad, 
live in Paris for a couple of years, and a child is 
born to them. But European life under these con- 
ditions is not what fancy had painted it, and she is 
not sorry to return to America when their funds 
give out. Settled in New York, she develops gifts 
as a spender which drive her husband to overwork, 
and he succumbs to pneumonia. Then Milly culti- 
vates the acquaintance of a celibate woman, the 
successful manager of a laundry, and enters into a 
housekeeping arrangement with her. Becoming 
restless, she conceives the plan of starting a French 
pdtisserie in Chicago, and persuades her friend to 
stake her capital upon the venture. The Cake Shop 
is triumphantly successful for a year or two ; then 
the expert servants drift away, the cakes get soggier, 
and the trade falls off until the doors of the estab- 
lishment have to be closed. At this juncture, the 
California suitor opportunely turns up, and Milly is 
willing to become the mistress of his ranch. She is 
thus comfortably provided for, and the story ends, 
or rather dribbles out, as most actual life-stories do. 
Milly has had many kinds of experiences, and has 
learned shrewdly to profit by them. She has got 
from the world less than she wanted, but probably 
more than she was entitled to expect. Her story is 
that of "one woman's life," but it is typical of all 
the class of ambitious, restless, dissatisfied women 
which is at least a numerous one in our dynamic 
civilization. We think that the author places him- 
self a little too much upon Milly's side in her rebel- 
lion against surroundings in which a woman of better 
poise and more normal temperament would find a 
reasonable degree of satisfaction. Mr. Herrick has 
now lived in Chicago for the greater part of twenty 
years, and all the time he has been pouring forth a 
stream of caustic comment upon the many phases of 
its life. He does not like the place, and assumes to- 
ward it invariably the offensive attitude of the superior 
person. And to him the West Side, with its church- 
going habits, its na'ive domesticities, and its feeble 
gropings after culture, is simply "impossible." Yet 
the West Side is preeminently that part of Chicago 
in which the wholesome life of the home is most in 
evidence, and in which the simple virtues which lie 
at the basis of American civilization are most gen- 
erally practiced. But to Mr. Herrick it is, even 



306

[April 1 



more than Chicago as a whole, the quintessence of 
meanness, sordidness, and vulgarity. 

Mr. James Lane Allen's latest story, like his 
others of recent years, is an example of maundering 
that is extremely disheartening to those of us who 
discerned in "The Choir Invisible" and some of 
the earlier books an artistic distinction which almost 
seemed to promise us a second Hawthorne. Mr. 
Allen seems now to have made fetich of style, in 
which he is not above toying with conceits and to 
lead his story-telling gift into a morass of psycho- 
logical analysis. " The Heroine in Bronze " has no 
story worth speaking of. It tells (in the first person) 
of the calf-love of a poor young author for a girl of 
wealth and high social position. He is a bumptious 
youth who cannot possibly be taken at anything like 
his own valuation. That the girl eventually does so 
take him does more credit to her heart than to her 
intelligence. Here and there, the story has pages 
of beautiful prose that is unmarred by affectation 
or preciosity, but as a narrative, or as a serious 
depiction of character, it is naught. And such 
stilted conversation as engages the youth and the 
maid bears little resemblance to the actualities of 
human or even of lovers' intercourse. 

The publishers of "My Little Sister," by Miss 
Elizabeth Robins, describe the work as "an intense 
story," which it assuredly is. Three-quarters of it 
describes the life of an English country household 
a mother and two daughters in intimate portrayal 
and keen characterization, but all the time with a 
sense of impending disaster. Then the tragic climax 
comes, swiftly and sharply, with the sister's journey 
to London to visit Aunt Josephine, whom neither of 
them has ever seen. For one of the vultures who 
prey upon girlhood has learned of the visit, and the 
girls are met at the station by a procuress, imper- 
sonating their aunt, who carries them off to " one of 
the most infamous houses in Europe." During the 
evening, the eyes of the elder sister (who tells the 
story) are opened to their situation, and a man 
among the company who has not lost all sense of 
decency helps her to escape from the house. She 
rushes frantically to the real aunt, and to the police, 
for assistance, but in her excitement she has for- 
gotten to locate the house of sin, and cannot guide 
the rescuers to the place where her sister is held. 
All her efforts are fruitless, and the sister sinks out 
of sight forever. The book, which has great power, 
is obviously written as a tract, and gives one a grip- 
ping realization of the horrors of white slavery. It 
must be urged against it that a girl of such a family, 
of such high social standing, would be less likely 
than another to be sought as a victim of such designs, 
which inherent improbability considerably weakens 
the tragic force of the very moving and poignant 
narrative. 

Mrs. Wharton's "The Reef" has all the charm 
of diction and subtlety of elaboration that we are 
accustomed to expect from her work; it only just 
misses the kind of distinction that characterizes 
"The Valley of Decision," for example. We could 



imagine it to have been written by any one of sev- 
eral other people, something which we could not 
possibly imagine of the masterpiece which we have 
just named. George Darrow, a young English 
diplomat, is on his way from England to France to 
meet the woman whom he has long loved, and who 
he hopes will consent to become his wife. She is 
Anna Leath, a widow with a child and an adult 
stepson. On the way, he receives a telegram which 
postpones his visit, and he is considerably upset 
thereby. Among his fellow-passengers is a girl who 
seems to be in distress, and he befriends her. She 
is a "companion" out of a situation because she 
could not put up with a cantankerous employer. 
Friendless and almost penniless, she accepts Dar- 
row's proffered friendship, which includes compan- 
ionship as well as material aid. They spend a few 
days in Paris, seeing the sights and going to the 
theatres, and then they part. This is "the reef" 
upon which Darrow's happiness is wrecked. It all 
seems innocent enough, and we hardly suspect, not 
having the cynical viewpoint, that it is not. But 
when Darrow eventually finds himself the guest of 
Mrs. Leath, he discovers his travelling acquaintance 
installed in the household as a governess to the child, 
and already the object of the stepson's affections. 
Mrs. Leath gets wind of the girl's previous acquaint- 
ance with Darrow, and puts the worst possible con- 
struction upon it, a construction which we are con- 
strained to accept from his admissions as the true 
one. Up to this point the reader, although he may 
have had suspicions, has on the whole believed 
Darrow to have been guilty of nothing more than 
an indiscretion, and to have given this impression 
is obviously a fault of construction. As a result of 
this complication, both engagements are broken off, 
and the girl goes off to India with her former em- 
ployer. The situation becomes very tense at the 
height of the argument, and is handled with Mrs. 
Wharton's marvellous skill in the analysis of motive. 
But we cannot escape many a pang of sympathy for 
the four lives thathave broken to pieces on "the reef."

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The presidents Mr. Ernest Alfred Vizetelly's "Re- 

mSSSSH f P ul > lican France 1870-1912 " (Small, 
France. Maynard & Co.) contains a survey of 

the history of the ^French Republic from the war 
with Germany to the end of the administration of 
President Fallieres. The author is, we believe, an 
English newspaper correspondent who has spent 
most of his life in France and has enjoyed the 
acquaintance of a large number of French scholars 
and men of affairs, concerning many of whom he 
writes with the information that comes from per- 
sonal knowledge. He describes in turn the war with 
the Germans, the work of the national assembly and 
the government of Thiers, the efforts of the pretend- 
ers and their followers to re-establish the monarchy,

the administrations of all the Presidents beginning 
with Thiers, the rise and fall of the more than fifty 
cabinets that have governed the Second Republic, 
French, foreign, and colonial policy, the relations 
between Church and State, the rise and collapse of 
the Boulangist movement, the Panama scandal, the 
anarchist terror, the Dreyfus affair, and various 
other events and movements, political, social, and 
industrial. Some of his narrations, such as those 
on the rise of Boulanger and the Dreyfus affair, are 
very informing; but at times he descends to exces- 
sive detail, and indulges in trivialities that scarcely 
deserve mention in a serious history. His portraits 
of French statesmen, with many of whom he was 
personally acquainted, are generally interesting. 
For Gambetta he expresses high admiration; but he 
does not ignore, as many historians do, the faults of 
that great man. GreVy he pictures as personally 
a very honest and able man, though an impersonal 
President who in his last years was too old and 
infirm to exert any marked influence on public 
affairs. Carnot, unlike GreVy, travelled much about 
France, showed himself to the people, took part 
in their national fetes, and was widely popular. 
Casimir-Perier was a man of great wealth, and did 
not desire the Presidency. He possessed masterful 
qualities and was a fighter, in consequence of which 
he was quite out of place as President ; for the Presi- 
dent of France is expected to play an impersonal 
role, and leave the government to the Parliament 
and ministers. He had a deep sense of his respon- 
sibility as the chief executive, and when he found 
that his office was one of impotency he resigned in 
disgust after having occupied it less than six months. 
Faure, like Carnot, was fond of travelling; but he 
was a man of inordinate vanity, addicted to display, 
and he introduced at the Elyse'e ceremonies such as 
had characterized the court functions of the days of 
the Empire and the Monarchy. Nevertheless, while 
Faure had his faults he possessed certain good qual- 
ities. France did well, we are told, when it chose 
Loubet to the Presidency. He was the best man 
available, and history will eventually assign to him 
a really high place in the history of the Republic. 
"No worthier man was ever President of France." 
He was firm in his republicanism, tolerant in his 
religious views, shrewd in his judgment of men, 
sincerely patriotic, benevolent to the poor, a staunch 
friend of every good cause, simple in his life, and 
extremely solicitous for the well-being of the masses. 

The wakins-up The author of One Way Out," who 
of a sleepy signs himself " William Carleton," 

farming town. nas f o u owe( i up that notable success 
in realistic autobiography and sound democratic 
doctrine with an even more remarkable narrative 
of personal experience in "New Lives for Old" 
(Small, Maynard & Co.), in which he tells how he 
and his wife took hold of an abandoned New En- 
gland farm and made it a source of health and 
happiness and pecuniary profit to them, while at the 
same time they awoke the community to a realization 



of its wasted agricultural opportunities and instituted 
a cooperative system of market-gardening which 
brought prosperity to the town of "Brewster" and 
all the " Brewsterites " fictitious names, evidently. 
The place had been a great unused industrial plant, 
like hundreds of other neglected farming regions 
in our eastern states, until the author discerned its 
possibilities as a feeder to the large city (Boston, 
presumably) twenty miles distant; then, with his 
ideas and example acting as a leaven, the whole 
lump of fatalistic indifference and indolence was 
made effervescent with ambition and activity. It 
was simply the spirit of our pioneer ancestors that 
he breathed into their degenerate descendants, 
awakening them to the opportunity knocking un- 
heeded at their very doors, but being eagerly re- 
sponded to by the Italian and other foreign tillers of 
the soil who were taking up as fast as they could 
the unappreciated acres of the old settlers. The 
plea that western farming has killed eastern farming 
is shown to be invalid in these days of rapidly rising 
prices for agricultural products. To effect this 
re-awakening of a lethargic community, various 
expedients were adopted, such as brass bands and 
moving pictures, a social club and lecture courses, 
old-fashioned agricultural fairs and cash prizes for 
best results in rural industries. Advice and help 
from the State College of Agriculture were asked 
and gladly given, which at first went much against 
the grain of the hayseeds and the moss-backs. The 
book is a fine and inspiriting record of what one 
man with ideas and initiative and force can do. If 
every farming town that has gone to sleep could be 
aroused in like manner, "high cost of living" might 
become a meaningless phrase for a large part of the 
country. 

English and In examining Mr. C. H. Moore's 
French church "Mediaeval Church Architecture of 
architecture. England " (Macmillan) , the less care- 
ful readers of this author's earlier work on Gothic 
architecture may be surprised to find that he is not 
blind to merit in the mediaeval architecture of coun- 
tries other than France. The more careful readers, 
whether they agree or not, have understood his con- 
tention to be that the French architecture differs 
from the others in its fundamental principle. In 
his latest book he explicitly disavows any condem- 
nation of English architecture. Nevertheless, he is 
still insistent on its inferiority to that of France. 
He also reaffirms with greater emphasis than ever 
its totally different structural character, and conse- 
quently, in his view, its essential difference of style. 
He is now less dogmatic in asserting that the word 
" Gothic " should be confined to the style of the 
Ile-de-France, though the title of the new book in- 
dicates that his own preference in the matter has 
not changed. The essential difference in structural 
principle between English mediaeval architecture 
and French can hardly be questioned by one not 
blinded by chauvinism. Although Mr. Moore min- 
imizes instances of similarity, he rightly maintains 



308 



THE DIAL 



[April 1 



that the English structural system was based pri- 
marily on direct resistance to vault thrusts by sheer 
massiveness of wall ; the French, primarily on trans- 
mission of thrusts through an organic skeleton. That 
this difference constitutes a difference in architect- 
ural style depends on whether structural character 
is an adequate criterion of style. May not general 
artistic impulse be an equally valid criterion ? 
Charles Eliot Norton, more appreciative of spiritual 
forces, says in his " Historical Studies of Church 
Building in the Middle Ages ": "The motives which 
inspired the great buildings of this period, the 
principles which underlay their forms, the general 
character of the forms themselves, were in their es- 
sential nature the same throughout Western Europe 
from Italy to England. The differences in the work 
of different lands are but local and external vari- 
eties." " Christian," indeed, might be a better name 
for this pervading architecture; yet the attempt to 
confine " Gothic " to any single division of it, how- 
ever superior, is to wrench an accepted term by mere 
definition. The superiority which Mr. Moore accords 
to the French structural system, though generally 
acknowledged, rests likewise on assumptions which 
are perhaps open to question. No argument is 
adduced that the French churches are stronger, or 
that their piers obstruct less of the view into the 
nave, for instance. The superiority advanced is 
solely one of abstract logicality, in the economical 
and expressive adaptation of structural members to 
their functions. Yet if one can detach one's self 
from accustomed veneration of the French monu- 
ments, one may feel a lack of underlying logic. Its 
possession becomes very dubious when 'one considers 
the tremendous complexity of the means necessary 
to obtain the desired effect, and the proved frailty 
of this system of construction, the original purpose 
of which was permanence. That the surrounding 
nations felt this defect may have been a reason why, 
though they adopted the French forms, they did not 
abandon their own more conservative systems of 
construction. Mr. Moore's special plea seriously 
limits the general usefulness of his book. The stu- 
dent, however, will find in it a wealth of accurate 
observations and painstaking drawings, which make 
it indispensable in any collection of books on the 
subject. 

Two new books on social ethics from 
SL r cSU. the point of view of Christianity and 

the Church Bishop Chauncey B. 
Brewster's "The Kingdom of God in American 
Life" (Whittaker) and Professor Scott Nearing's 
"Social Religion" (Macmillan) add to the sym- 
posium in which we are vigorously engaged. Can 
there be too many speakers? one begins to ask. 
Hardly, for each has a word of his own to say, and 
a special group ready to listen. Bishop Brewster 
of Connecticut, for instance, addressing an Anglican 
audience, has little that is new to present to those 
already liberal in their way of social thinking. It 
is the conservative who may profit by this cautious, 



well-balanced, and honest book; and to him its 
absence of partisan spirit, its grave recognition that 
we are entering a crisis, even its intelligent cogni- 
zance of the more radical contemporary forces, 
may well bring genuine illumination. Like Dr. 
Rauschenbusch, Bishop Brewster finds in the infu- 
sion of the ideal of the Kingdom of God the remedy 
for our social ills. Unlike the bolder thinker, how- 
ever, this infusion is perceived by him as affecting 
details rather than as transforming fundamental 
economic relations. Professor Nearing's book, orig- 
inally an address given before the Society of Friends, 
breathes a warmer and more invigorating air. There 
is little that is penetrating or broadly synthetic about 
the author's thinking, and his constructive sugges- 
tions are no more definite than those of Bishop 
Brewster. But the constructive spirit is present, 
and any progressive (with either a small or a large 
P) might find himself quickened to greater clarity 
of vision and warmth of feeling by this fearless dis- 
cussion. The author has marshalled his case against 
modern society well and succinctly, with an abun- 
dance of telling illustration and sound information. 
The book is a useful compendium of effective facts 
which a reformer might well carry in his pocket. 
And the insistence in both these books on the service 
which the Christian Church must be roused to render 
in the process of socializing democracy, through the 
intellectual attitude as well as through the active 
work of its members, is an inspiring sign of the 
times. 

Bird life in ^ lover of birds and a close observer 
the Scottish of their peculiarities, Mr. Seton Gor- 
highiand*. don? F.z.S., M.B.O.U., writes about 
them in much the same engaging manner as does Mr. 
John Burroughs, enlivening his pages with char- 
acteristic anecdotes of bird life and generously shar- 
ing his ornithological discoveries with the reader. 
"The Charm of the Hills" (Cassell) is made up of 
selected articles of his that have appeared in various 
British periodicals, such as "Country Life" and 
"The Scotsman," and they are profusely and admir- 
ably illustrated from photographs taken by the au- 
thor. That he has been able to obtain near views, 
of so many wild creatures, often in lofty, and diffi- 
cult situations, speaks well for his zeal and skill and 
hardihood. Photographs of the snow bunting amid 
the eternal snows of its mountain haunts, of the 
young of the golden eagle in their initial flight from 
the eyrie, of the brooding ptarmigan on her nest, 
with others of equal interest, make up a collection 
of bird pictures of rather unusual character. In 
number they exceed four-score. Highland scenery 
and other occasional forms of wild life beside birds 
receive appreciative attention. The concluding four 
of the book's thirty-five chapters take the form of 
notes appropriate to the four seasons of the year, 
and these are followed by a good index. In illustra- 
tion of the author's habit of observing the unusual 
or otherwise interesting in bird life, here is an anec- 
dote. "I was once," he says, "the witness of a

somewhat novel affray between a green plover and 
a heavy-looking cormorant. The cormorant was 
winging his way up the estuary of a river, and was 
flying at a great speed, helped by a following wind, 
when a lapwing, feeding on the river-side, suddenly 
swooped out and attacked the stranger with great 
fury. The unwieldy bird was quite taken aback, 
and after attempting for some little time to avoid 
the determined onslaught of "the green plover, half 
fell to the water, and sought to escape from his 
enemy by swimming low. The lapwing was evi- 
dently satisfied at the sign of surrender on the part 
of the cormorant, for it flew off highly gratified with 
the result of its impromptu sally." 

Eighteenth Mr ' AuStin Dobson ' s latest book > 

century "At Prior Park and Other Papers " 

by -ways. (Stokes), is an excursus into the by- 

paths and along the hedge-rows of the eighteenth 
century. No one knows this century better than 
Mr. Dobson, and few make better guides. Only 
two men of first importance find a place in this vol- 
ume, and they only in the obscurer events of their 
lives. Garrick's Grand Tour and Fielding's sojourn 
in Lisbon are what concern us here with these men. 
Fielding's life is illuminated by the "find " of two 
of his letters to his brother, which last year sold for 
305. Two of the most interesting papers are on 
places, Prior Park and Stowe, haunts of famous lit- 
erary men of the century. The essays on Gray's 
biographer, Mason, and on Robert Lloyd suggest an 
invidious contrast. Mason inherited an estate of 
1500 a year, and combined " the most lofty views 
on poetry with the keenest eye for the financial 
results"; Lloyd's melancholy story "exemplifies 
most of those ills which his great contemporary 
had gloomily declared to be the allotted portion of 
letters : 

' Toil, Envy, Want, the patron, and the Jail.' 
But he was spared the Patron." Other papers 
are on the painters, Carmontelle and Loutherbourg, 
and on the French pre-revolutionary sailor, Bailli 
de Suffren, who came into quite close touch with 
the English in war. Carmontelle has given us the 
single picture of the two Garricks, the tragic and 
the comic; Loutherbourg, besides being an R.A., 
was for a while scene painter for Garrick. 

A disappearing The Rev. Peter H. Ditchfield, blessed 
ngure in the with the leisure of a country clergy- 
life of England. man> an( j putting it to good use in a 
literary way, adds to his admirable studies of the old- 
time parson and the parish clerk a third antiquarian 
treatise, of a flavor not destitute of piquancy, on 
"The Old English Country Squire" (Doran), a 
personage now rapidly going the way of the dodo 
and the ichthyosaurus, and therefore caught by Dr. 
Ditchfield's camera just in the nick of time. The 
book completes the author's rural trilogy, and pre- 
serves in convenient and attractive form much scat- 
tered information, from books and from unpublished 
sources, on a character full of picturesque interest 



to every lover of English literature and English 
history. Viewing the squire from all sides and in 
every possible light, the author sketches for us the 
squire of ancient days, the Elizabethan squire, the 
seventeenth-century squire, the squire in his attitude 
toward religion, the sporting squire, the Yorkshire 
squire, the squire in literature, popular squires, eccen- 
tric squires, and other sorts of squires; also the 
squire's lady, his house, his garden, stories of squires, 
Macaulay's caricature of the old-time squire, and a 
German view of the English squire. Not unnatur- 
ally the writer is indignant at the Whig historian's 
unflattering picture of Tory squires and parsons, a 
picture which he reproduces in full before proceed- 
ing to prove it a monstrous caricature. For the 
purposes of this demonstration he avails himself 
of Sir George Reresby Sitwell's privately printed 
"Letters of the Sitwells and Sacheverells," with 
other information more or less curious and rare. 
But after all, as the general reader will still remain 
convinced from his studies in English history and 
literature, the old-time squire was not a person of 
polish or even of great intelligence, however useful 
and praiseworthy as a part of the established order 
of things. The " German view " above-named is the 
work of a certain Professor von Holtzendorff, and 
was given to the world half a century ago. It now 
furnishes matter for a readable chapter in Dr. 
Ditchfield's book. Many illustrations, chiefly from 
old prints, and eight of them in color, enliven the 
work. 

A transplanted Mr " Arthur K Bostwick, born and 

Easterner in bred in the East, where he rose to a 
the Middle West. p O8 iti O n of responsibility in the New 
York Public Library, but for the last few years a 
resident of the Middle West, where he is doing good 
work as head of the St. Louis Public Library, is 
well qualified to contrast the manners and customs 
of these two sections of the country, as he does in a 
bright and entertaining fashion, with play of humor 
and apt introduction of anecdote, in his book on 
"The Different West" (McClurg), the adjective 
having reference to the points of unlikeness between 
East and West. His brief chapters, written in the 
briskly journalistic style of one who is more than a 
mere reporter, treat chiefly of flying impressions, of 
the East's misunderstanding of the West and the 
West's misunderstanding of the East, of the West's 
political and economic unrest, of education and lit- 
erature, science, and art, in the West, of society in 
the West, of the sources of the West's population, 
and of the speech and manners of the West. A 
dexterous use of new or unusual terms, as "hyste- 
resis " (of obvious Greek derivation) to denote a 
certain slowness of perception, heightens the enjoy- 
ment here and there. The tone of the book and its 
author's style are well illustrated in the following 
passage : " I have sat in a faculty group in a western 
state university, in the rooms of one of their num- 
ber. All were merrily jesting and drinking beer, 
and with them sat the honored president of the

university, similarly employed. Many holders of 
western chairs, if perchance their eyes fall on this 
page, will ask, with open eyes, ' Well ! why not ? ' 
There is absolutely no reason ' why not '; but if you 
go to Cambridge, or New Haven, or Princeton to 
see a similar gathering, you will wait until the infer- 
nal regions are sheathed with a very heavy coating 
of ice." The treatise is not profound, and is not 
meant to be, but it abounds in shrewd observation 
and illuminating comment. 

An anthology Mr ' W ' H< Beveridge's "John and 
of thoughts Irene" (Longmans) has for its sub- 
about women. title u ^ Anthology of Thoughts on 
Women." The sub-title best describes the work, 
for the "John and Irene" part consists only of a 
prefatory note of about a dozen pages. John, it 
seems, was a feminist with advanced ideas about 
woman. He met Irene, who was not a feminist, 
wooed her, wedded her, and awakened her mind to 
such an extent that she soon distanced her husband 
in championship of her suppressed sex. Then she 
read one of Mr. Bernard Shaw's books, and came 
to the conclusion that a true woman could not live 
in the degradation of the marriage bond. She ac- 
cordingly parted from her husband, who became a 
misogynist ; but the work goes on, for the torch has 
passed into Irene's hands, and she sees that the 
light is kept burning. We could wish that there 
were more of this story, for the anthology which it 
prefaces is not nearly as interesting. This is to be 
taken, we are told, "as being an accompaniment to 
that story, a sort of continuous Greek chorus of 
general reflections, indicating the topics and the 
tendency of the drama, but forming part of it only 
at rare moments of crisis." There are some eight 
hundred extracts altogether, classified progressively 
under the heads of "The Meeting," "The Conver- 
sations" (which are very lengthy and comprehen- 
sive), "The Quarrel," and "Convalescence." The 
compiler of this anthology has roamed far and wide 
in search of his citations, and his collection of com- 
ments with a cynical turn is particularly choice. 

Further Sir Henry Lucy's chatty volume, 

memoriet of " Sixty Years in the Wilderness," 
" Tob V' M - p " has been followed with little delay by 
a second of the same title, with the added sub-title, 
" More Passages by the Way " (Button). This 
later selection of memories and letters was half 
promised in the preface to the earlier, where the 
author wrote in regard to his decision to limit his 
first venture to one volume : " If the gentle public 
please, they shall have the other at a later time." 
And now an "exceeding generosity of response en- 
courages fulfilment of the conditional undertaking." 
From 1870 to the end of 1891 the reminiscences, 
with extracts from the author's diaries and corre- 
spondence, ramble agreeably through the field of 
European and especially English politics, with many 
side excursions into adjacent domains. On an early 
page is found a contribution to the history of English 



literature, in the form of an extract from " The 
Sporting Magazine " describing the Derby of 1837, 
set side by side with Disraeli's account of the same 
famous race in his " Sybil." The two are almost 
identical. Among the many pen portraits of celeb- 
rities is one of Arabi Pasha in his exile at Colombo, 
studying English and making translations in an 
exercise-book, and exulting with almost childish 
vanity in his fancied progress in the language. 
General Boulanger, too, is shown in a near view, 
not greatly to his advantage. Since their recent 
appearance in the " Cornhill " these " passages by 
the way " have been considerably amplified. Punch's 
cartoon ( " Sir Toby, M. P.") celebrating the knight- 
ing of its famous contributor appears as frontispiece. 

The creator of The new biography of James Fen- 
"Leather- imore Cooper, by Miss Mary E. 

stocking." Phillips, will be welcomed as a sup- 

plement to Professor Lounsbury's admirable critical 
account of the novelist. Miss Phillips 's emphasis 
is exclusively on the man, not the author ; by means 
of a wealth of illustrations (hundreds of them, in 
fact) and of quotation " from every available source 
since the earliest mention of the author's name, both 
in print and out," the physical appearance of Cooper, 
his mode of life at home and abroad, and his vigor- 
ous personality are presented with great distinct- 
ness. As a biographer, Miss Phillips is agreeably 
nawe and pious rather than gossipy in the usual 
sense. Amazingly uncritical at times, she has clogged 
her pages with inane quotation and countless irrele- 
vancies and nothings; but she has done so with a 
simple faith that wins an unfailing indulgence on 
the part of the reader. After all, there are two 
kinds of small talk, one springing from a talent 
for triviality, the other from a genius for admiration ; 
and Miss Phillips's is clearly the latter. Although 
the book adds nothing of importance to our knowl- 
edge of Cooper, and although it is not written with 
judgment or with felicity of style, it has ample rea- 
son for existence in the fact that it is the first delib- 
erate and elaborate record of Cooper the man. The 
volume contains a rather brief index. (Lane.) 

Old and new Mr ' Francis Gribble, author of many 
stories of the books of entertaining biography, 
French stage. believes that biographers, like histo- 
rians, should explore the "sources" for every obtain- 
able word of truth, and should publish their discov- 
eries as unreservedly as do the historians, whether 
the critics pronounce them to be edifying or the re- 
verse. Acting on this principle, he has made his 
"Romances of the French Theatre" (Appleton) an 
undeniable contribution to the general reader's 
knowledge of sundry stars, now long extinct, of the 
Paris stage. For instance, the life of Marceline 
Desbordes-Valmore, poet as well as player, has 
recently been illumined with a flood of fresh light 
thrown upon it by certain unpublished documents, 
and this illumination is reflected in some of Mr. 
Gribble's pages. Likewise Mile. Montansier and

Mile. George and Talma and others are revealed 
more fully to English readers than has hitherto 
been attempted. Other familiar names that meet 
the eye are those of Adrienne Lecouvreur, Mile. 
Gautier, Mile. Clairon, Rachel, and the royal and 
noble lovers dangling in the train of this and that 
and the other stage beauty. By a curious error in 
the index, the references to Mile. Gautier, known in 
her later and repentant years as Sister Augustine, 
are entered under "Gautier, The'ophile." A half- 
dozen portraits adorn the book, which is a substantial 
octavo of three hundred pages. 



BRIEFER MEN TION. 

A new volume in the admirable " Musicians' Library " 
(Ditson) is the " Selected Piano Compositions of Franz 
Schubert " edited by Mr. August Spanuth. A dozen of 
the " Impromptus " and " Moments Musicals " are given, 
and nine other pieces, including the C major Fantaisie 
and the Sonata in A minor. There are also a portrait, 
a biographical sketch, and a bibliography. 

Two volumes of " French Classics for English Read- 
ers " (Putnam) are at hand. Professor Adolphe Cohn 
has edited Florio's Montaigne for the series, and Pro- 
fessor Curtis Hidden Page has edited a volume of selec- 
tions from Rabelais, as translated by Urquhart and 
Motteux. The introductions to both volumes are valu- 
able critical essays upon the respective authors. 

Aurelian Townshend, over whose name "oblivion 
has scattered her poppy effectively enough," has been 
resurrected by Mr. E. K. Chambers, who publishes 
through the Oxford Clarendon Press an edition of 
" Aurelian Townshend's Poems and Masks " the 
poems rescued from song-books and manuscripts, the 
two masks reprinted from the original editions of 1631. 
Volumes V.-VIII. of the " Imperial " edition of Sir 
Gilbert Parker's works (Scribner) are at hand. They 
give us " Cumner's Son and Other South Sea Folk," 
" When Valmond Came to Pontiac," "The Trail of the 
Sword," "The Translation of a Savage," "The Pomp 
of the Lavilettes," " At the Sign of the Eagle," " The 
Trespasser," and The March of the White Guard." 
Not the least of the services which this new edition does 
for us is that of calling renewed attention to the author's 
half-forgotten earlier works, which are, if anything, 
better tban his " best sellers " of recent years. 

The interesting " Cambridge Manuals of Science and 
Literature " now number an even fifty volumes. The 
latest issues are : " The Civilization of Ancient Mexico," 
by Mr. Lewis Spence ; " China and the Manchus," by 
Professor Herbert A. Giles; " Brasses," by Mr. J. S. M. 
Ward; " The Individual in the Animal Kingdom," by 
Mr. Julian S. Huxley; "Brewing," by Mr. A. Chaston 
Chapman; " The Psychology of Insanity," by Dr. Ber- 
nard Hart; and "The Work of Rain and Rivers," by 
Dr. T. G. Bonney. These volumes compete very suc- 
cessfully with those of the " Home University Library," 
and, like them, deserve to be widely known. 

Two small volumes of " Short-Story Masterpieces," 
containing characteristic stories of ten French authors 
translated into English, with Introductions, by Dr. J. 
Berg Esenwein, editor of " Lippincott's Magazine," are 
issued under the imprint of the Home Correspondence 
School of Springfield, Massachusetts. The writers rep- 



resented are Coppe'e, de Maupassant, Daudet, Me'rime'e, 
Pierre Loti, Balzac, Hale"vy, Theuriet, Gautier, and 
Anatole France. In the general introduction the trans- 
lator analyzes the French short-story as a national genre, 
principally from the point of view of technique, and also 
suggests a few of the important forces in French life 
which have influenced its highly individualized content. 
A brief essay on the author prefaces each of the short- 
stories. 

Mr. John Macy thinks that most manuals of Amer- 
ican literature fail to exhibit a proper sense of propor- 
tion. Believing that " a living lion is better than a dead 
mouse," he would give Mr. Riley a place rather than 
Bryant, and Father Tabb rather than Taylor. He also 
claims that a chapter on William James belongs in any 
book " in which a chapter on tbat dreadful bore, Jona- 
than Edwards, would pass unchallenged," which seems- 
to us a happier opinion tban tbe other. It is in the spirit 
of these observations that Mr. Maey has written hi* 
breezy work on " The Spirit of American Literature " 
(Doubleday), a work which the young lions of news- 
paper criticism will doubtless take to their hearts. It 
will not be taken very seriously by anyone else. 

Two new additions to the " Macmillan Standard Li- 
brary" are Lafeadio Hearn's "Japan: An Attempt at 
Interpretation " and Mr. Liberty H. Bailey's " The 
Country Life Movement in the United States." Nearly 
forty volumes are now ready in this series, comprising 
some of the most noteworthy recent contributions to 
serious thought. Such books as these, in so substantial 
a form and at so low a price (fifty cents), constitute a 
decided boon. The same publishers have begun publi- 
cation of a " Modern Fiction Library," in similar form 
and at the same price. The first volumes are Mr. 
James Lane Allen's " The Reign of Law," Mr. William 
Stearns Davis's "A Friend of Caesar," Mr. Richard 
Washburn Child's " Jim Hands," and Mr. Jack Lon- 
don's " Burning Daylight." 

Mr. L. P. Gratacap's " Popular Guide to Minerals " 
(D. Van Nostrand Co.), now in its second edition, is 
intended chiefly for the use of visitors to public cabinets 
'and collections of minerals, but is so arranged that it 
forms an adequate text for elementary teaching in 
mineralogy as well. Its value as a universal guide-book 
is enhanced by the fact that the system of classification 
here adopted is the same as the succession observed in 
the fifth and sixth editions of Dana's " System of Min- 
eralogy." To those unacquainted with the general 
scientific aspects of mineralogy and its connection with 
related sciences, the introductory chapters will prove 
of interest. A new chapter on the Bement Collection of 
minerals in the American Museum of Natural History 
has been added. 

It can hardly be said that Mr. W. H. Hudson's 
" Story of the Renaissance " (Cassell) fills a long-felt 
want, but it does put into convenient form a treatment 
of tbe various aspects of the Renaissance, and will serve 
admirably as an introduction to a more extended course 
of reading or study in the history, art, and literature of 
this period. The book does not pretend to be an orig- 
inal contribution; it does not do more than bring to- 
gether facts that are familiar enough to the scholar for 
the benefit of his zealous brother who would extend the 
boundaries of his learning beyond those set in the edu- 
cative pages of tbe popular magazine. The author is a 
staff Lecturer to the University Extension Board of tlfe 
University of London, and the book smacks of the Ex- 
tension course. At any rate it would form an admirable 



312 



THE DIAL 



[April 1 



book of reference for such a course. It is none the worse 
for this, but one should not go to it with the expectation 
of finding in it any new thing. 

A second edition of " Food in Health and Disease," 
by Dr. Nathan S. Davis, Jr., is published by Messrs. 
P. Blakiston's Son & Co. The author's aim has been 
to provide an up-to-date and practical hand-book of 
dietetics; and recent additions to the knowledge of 
physiology and the management of diseases by diet have 
demanded a revision and rewriting, in large part, of the 
original text. The main sections of the book are de- 
voted to discussions of the general principles of diet, 
diet in health, and diet in disease ; and, aside from its 
technical value, the book should appeal to all who take 
more than passing interest in matters pertaining to the 
preservation of health. In its present form it consti- 
tutes one of the fullest treatises on the subject of non- 
medicinal therapeutics yet contributed by an American 
author. 



NOTES. 



The plays of Mr. J. M. Barrie are being collected for 
publication in book form during the autumn. 

Mr. John Masefield's latest narrative poem, "The 
Daffodil Fields," will be issued at once in book form 
by the Macmillan Co. 

A book of Central American travel entitled " The 
Southland of North America," by Mr. George Palmer 
Putnam, editor of the Bend (Oregon) " Bulletin," will 
be published this month by Messrs. Putnam. 

A magazine serial of unusual interest begins in the 
April " Scribner " with the opening chapters of Mr. John 
Galworthy's latest novel, " The Dark Flower." This 
is described in a sub-title as " The Love-Life of a Man: 
Spring, Summer, Autumn." 

Mr. Winthrop Ames, director of The Little Theatre, 
New York, is offering a prize of $10,000 for the best 
play by an American author, submitted before August 
15 of this year. Particulars of the contest may be 
obtained from Mr. Ames. 

That Mr. Kipling's popularity is not yet on the wane 
is indicated by the fact that a new English edition of 
his works, limited to one thousand sets and priced at 
twenty-three guineas, has been entirely subscribed for 
two months in advance of the appearance of the first 
volumes. 

Some personal recollections of the Irish playwright 
J. M. Synge, by Lady Gregory, appear in the March 
" English Review." This issue also contains an inter- 
esting study of "George Meredith: Freethinker," by 
Mr. G. W. Foote, embodying some unpublished letters 
of Meredith's. 

The address delivered by Dr. William Lyon Phelps, 
Lampton professor of English literature in Yale Uni- 
versity, before the recent meeting of the American 
Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Institute 
of Arts and Letters, is published for the first time in 
the April " Century." 

We learn from Mr. Clement Shorter's always- 
interesting literary letter in the London " Sphere " 
that Sir William Robertson Nicoll has been engaged 
for some time upon an elaborate history of Victorian 
literature, that the work will consist of six volumes of 
200,000 words each, and the first volume will be pub- 
lished in October of next year. 



Scholarly readers everywhere will rejoice in the an- 
nouncement that the famous " Bohn's Library " is to 
be reissued in pocket volumes, cloth-bound, at a shilling 
each. An initial batch of twenty volumes will appear 
at once. " Bohn's " holds a place apart among all 
standard series. Emerson once said that " the transla- 
tions of Bohn's Library have done for literature what 
railroads have done for internal intercourse." 

" Bedrock," the new English quarterly journal of 
scientific thought, will be published in this country by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., beginning with the April 
issue. The contents of the forthcoming April issue of 
the magazine will include the following articles, among 
others: " Mimicry, Mutation, and Mendelism," by E. B. 
Poulton; "Modern Vitalism," by W. McDougall; 
and " Japanese Colonial Methods," by Ellen C. Semple. 

A committee, composed of Messrs. Arnold Bennett, 
John Galsworthy, C. H. Herford, H. G. Wells, and 
others, is inviting donations for a memorial to George 
Gissing. This memorial will take the form of a scholar- 
ship for the encouragement of literary studies, and will 
be attached to the University of Manchester, which 
Gissing attended in his early days. It is hoped that not 
less than 2000 may be raised, of which amount 200 
has been promised. 

A study of Dickens by Mr. Swinburne, hitherto 
unpublished, is soon to appear in London. Two other 
volumes on the novelist, announced for spring publica- 
tion, are " Studies in Dickens," by Sir W. Robertson 
Nicoll, and "Charles Dickens: Social Reformer," by 
Mr. W. Walter Crotch. We understand, also, that a 
son of Dickens's famous illustrator and intimate friend, 
Hablot K. Browne ("Phiz"), is preparing from his 
father's letters and papers a volume of reminiscences 
of the writer. 

Mr. Henry Frowde, the Publisher to the University 
of Oxford, has just retired at his own wish, after thirty- 
nine years of work as manager of the London busi- 
ness of the Oxford University Press. Mr. Humphrey 
Milford, who has for some years been associated with 
Mr. Frowde, has been appointed as his successor. 
Though Mr. Frowde is retiring from the active supervis- 
ion of the business, he will, it is understood, be available 
for consultation, so that his knowledge and experience 
will not be lost to the Press. 

An unusual number of promising literary biographies 
appear in the English publishers' spring announcement 
lists. Some of the more important of these are : " Swin- 
burne," by Mr. John Drinkwater; "William Morris: 
Poet, Craftsman, and Social Reformer," by Mr. Arthur 
Compton-Rickett; "Early Friendships and Surround- 
ings," by Professor Knight; "Jane Austen," by W. 
Austen Leigh and R. Austen Leigh; "The Life and 
Friendship of Mary Russell Mitford; "The Youth of 
Goethe," by Mr. P. Hume Brown; and a " Life of Cer- 
vantes," by Mr. J. Fitzmaurice-Kelly. 

A new series for children, to be edited by Miss 
Florence Converse and depicting school-life in various 
lands, is announced by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., 
under the title of "The Little Schoolmates" series. 
The first volume will be " Under Greek Skies " by 
Madame Dragoumis. Professor Katharine Lee Bates 
of Wellesley will tell of the children of Spain under 
the title, "Queen Esther's Make-Believe." Professor 
Margarethe Miiller, also of Wellesley, will tell of Ger- 
man child-life; and Mr. Padraic Colum of Irish children. 
Other volumes will be announced later.

NEW SCRIBNER BOOKS 1913 



By HENKY JAMES 

A Small Boy and Others 

This is the story of Henry James's own boyhood. The 
little figure of himself, which he sees with characteristic 
detachment, is as happily depicted as any he has ever 
drawn. Among the surroundings of a New York that 
seems to belong to past ages, the small boy learns his 
different worlds : that of his family, sharply individualized 
types, as they must have seemed even without the help of 
his unequalled characterization, of his schools and tutors, a 
delightful procession drawn with quite irresistible humor, 
of his schoolmates and playmates, and of the half-compre- 
hended but endlessly interesting circle of "grown-ups" 
that make one of the unconscious studies of a child.

What is the Truth about Jesus Christ? 

Problems of Christology Discussed in Six Haskell Lectures 

at Oberlin, Ohio. 

No recent book in print is better calculated to give the 
skeptic pause, to abash the theological philistine, and to 
reassure and fortify the truly devout. After Harnack, the 
writer is the greatest living German authority on the history 
of Christian doctrine, and this volume forms a continuous 
and ordered presentation of the single theme expressed in 
its title. $1.25 net; postage extra.

The Enjoyment of Poetry 

A delightful inquiry into the nature of poetry, which will 
intensify the pleasure of those who love it, and may well 
open the eyes and ears of those insensible to it. 

But its prime value lies in the entertainment it gives ; 
for though its interest is serious indeed, the wit humor, and 
lightness of the writing make it the reverse of abstruse or 
pedantic. It should be read for its own sake.

Plays by Bjornstjerne Bjornson 

"THE NEW SYSTEM," "THE GAUNTLET," 

" BEYOND HUMAN POWER." 

Translated from the Norwegian by Edwin Bjorkman. 
These plays by the famous Norwegian suit the temper of 
the time, "The Gauntlet" particularly. It is a sharp 
challenge of the double moral standard of the sexes ; will 
startle a reader into vivid realization, like the blow of a 
glove upon his cheek. But all three, though restrained 
and, in form, almost classic, radiate the spirit of the day.

Monarchical Socialism in Germany 

" Monarchical Socialism," a splendid paradox, stands for 
the combining of apparently incompatible principles by 
splendid statesmanship. Germany, right or wrong, has 
gripped, and seems now to control those great forces of 
capital and labor with which we grapple. Her methods of 
handling trusts, railroads, labor bodies, and so on, are here 
set down by a student of them. And he has done it in a 
small volume by throwing off all superfluous words and 
statistics. $1.25 net; by mail $1.36 

By FREDERIC C. HOWE, 
Author of " The City : the Hope of Democracy." 

European Cities at Work 

Dr. Howe, looking upon the development of city adminis- 
tration as the great hope of future civilization, presents in 
this book a constructive vision of the city of to-morrow. 
He places emphasis on the social side of city life, the new 
art of community living : planning for health and beauty 
with an allowance for future growth, laying out suburbs 
like garden cities, building model apartments, founding 
municipal pawnshops and savings-banks. It is a thorough 
study of deep human appeal heavy with human sig- 
nificance. $1.75 net ; postage extra.

FOUR NEW NOVELS 



THE JUDGMENT HOUSE 

By SIR GILBERT PARKER 

" Never has Sir Gilbert written a novel more filled with 
keen and poignant sense of life than is this story, woven 
of London and the veld, of England and her policies, 
South Africa and her struggles during the Boer war. . . . 
It is a thrilling, majestically moving story." New York 
Times. 

'' Brilliant and powerful, worthy of its author's proved 
gifts. War and passion make it a legitimate melodrama. 
Love and hate keep it impressively human." New 
York World. 

Illustrated. Post 8vo. Cloth. $1.35 net 

THE SOJOURNER 

By ROBERT D. ELDER 

A story of the West, with realistic descriptions of adven- 
ture and life that recall Bret Harte, and a tender love 
story. The hero, a popular senior at Princeton and son 
of a multi-millionaire, had apparently a smooth way of 
life ahead of him. Yet fate and his own idealism led 
him into rough roads. A woman tried to wreck his life, 
and nearly succeeded.

DESERT GOLD 

By ZANE GREY 

Author of " Riders of the Purple Sage. ' 
" But it is melodrama pure and undefiled," said one 
reader of " Desert Gold." " What 's melodrama? '' he 
was asked. " A glorified dime-novel written with splendid 
distinction, with red vigor, but still it is a sort of dime- 
novel. There 's the same galloping succession of events, 
the same tense situations only it is all presented with 
such delicacy, such literary charm one almost forgets the 
plot." That 's the story after all.

THE WINGS OF PRIDE 

By LOUISE KENNEDY MABIE 

The first time is always the best. Then comes the joy 
of discovery, of exploring new fields. Something of all 
this we ask you to share with us in this new writer and 
her new-born book. Her story of young love's awakening- 
is as dewy fresh as the dawn, the tale of a natural story- 
teller the setting American and the plot enticing, 
charming, delightful. Will you be among the first to 
acclaim her ?

SCIENTIFIC AUCTION BRIDGE 

By E. V. SHEPARD 

" I have read all the books on auction bridge. E. V. Shepard's is the best of them all. I doubt if a better one will 
ever be written. Other writers teach by illustrative hands which you may never hold. He gives simple rules for 
bidding and playing any hand possible to deal. Every feature of the game is discussed in a way to aid both beginner 
and expert player. The work is not based upon personal opinion, but is founded upon mathematical facts. Every 
player should own a copy of this work." A. L. ROBINSON, Vice-President Knickerbocker Whist Club.

THE BEND IN THE ROAD 

By TRUMAN A. De WEESE 

This book was written to show the man of the city the way to health and contentment through a return to pleasant 
pastoral pursuits. The longing for the land is deep rooted in our natures and there comes a time to almost every 
one, says the author, when the poultry catalogues and colored pictures of fruit and vegetables prove far more 
attractive than "the best seller." The city toiler of moderate means will learn from this book how easy it is to 
acquire a small " country place " not far from the scene of his daily employment, where he can spend blossom and 
fruit-time ; where he can find that rare contentment which comes from living in intimate relation with the soil.

A SENSATIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO THEATRICAL ART 

Towards a New Theatre 

By EDWARD GORDON CRAIG 

Mr. Craig has a very genuine message to the world of art which he is demon- 
strating in the School of Dramatic Art of which he is the founder. Its value 
was first recognized on the Continent where May Reinhardt. the foremost 
expositor of the methods of the "new theatre" has unquestionably been 
influenced by it ; the Russian stage has seized upon it with enthusiasm. The 
forty designs for stage scenes with critical notes by the inventor in this 
volume illustrate ideas which bid fair to overturn all theatrical tradition. 
The book arrests attention instantly and is more than stimulating.

A new poem by JOHN MASEFIELD 

Author of " The Everlasting Mercy " and " The Widow in the Bye Street," " The Story of a

John Masefield's new poem, " The Daffodil Fields," is a vivid expansion of the wonderful narra-

characters of two men and a woman, the story leads with tragic foreboding from Shropshire, England,

its vigor and reserve the poem again stamps Masefield as the greatest artist of the day.

AMBASSADOR PAGE. 

Three times and out! President Wilson's 
third choice for the most important of our 
diplomatic posts is one that does the highest 
credit to his intelligence and sound judgment, 
and the country is to be congratulated upon the 
acceptance of this exalted position by one who 
is an embodiment of the finest qualities of Amer- 
ican idealism. Mr. Walter Hines Page is a man 
who will really represent us, and whose name 
will not seem out of place in the list that includes 
the names of George Bancroft, Charles Francis 
Adams, James Russell Lowell, and John Hay. 
The President's first choice for this post occa- 
sioned some misgivings, for Mr. Olney was too 
deeply implicated in the blustering infamy of 
the Venezuelan episode of 1897 to seem entirely 
qualified to serve as the official cementer of cor- 
dial relations between the two chief branches of 
the English-speaking race. The choice of Pres- 
ident Emeritus Eliot was not open to any such 
criticism, and was wholly admirable, except for 
his advanced age, which would seem to qualify 
him better for the part of wise counsellor to his 
fellow-countrymen at home than for his active 
participation in diplomatic affairs. But neither 
of these objections, nor any other that occurs to 
us, can be made to Mr. Page, who is in the prime 
of life, and who has done nothing to our knowl- 
edge which should make him persona non grata 
to any considerable section of the English 
people. 

Not the least conspicuous merit of this ap- 
pointment is the fact that it puts an end to the 
period of vulgar ostentation in our London 
embassy. Mr. Page will not, we are safe in 
assuming, spend several times his official stipend 
in the rent of a house. That stipend is a nig- 
gardly one, all things considered, but those of 
our representatives abroad who cut their coats 
according to the cloth thus provided are the ones 
who display the truest patriotism and set the 
finest example. If there is any discredit in the 
simple living thus conditioned, it is at least not 
personal ; and if it in any way redounds to the 
disadvantage of the country, the country has 
the remedy in its own hands. But remembering 
how well Mr. Phelps served his country a quar- 
ter of a century ago in the modest apartment 
which he occupied, we cannot believe that the 



328 



THE DIAL 



[April 16 



splendors of Dorchester House have given us as 
a nation any prestige that was worth buying at 
such a price. The most thoughtful organs of 
British opinion have been prompt to applaud 
this appointment and to recognize its signifi- 
cance. The London "Nation" makes the 
following comment : s 

" President Wilson has made an interesting experi- 
ment. He has boldly reverted to the scholar-diplomat 
as the type of man most qualified to represent the United 
States abroad. In doing so he has paid a silent but 
striking compliment to the good sense of the British 
people. He has assumed that what we most value in 
an American ambassador is not his wealth and his ability 
to lavish it on magnificent houses and huge entertain- 
ments, but his personality and his achievements and the 
extent to which he brings with him the true flavor of 
American life." 

The appointment "fits in with one's conception 
of what America should be and at her best 
really is, and it may not be without its useful- 
ness in restoring to London society a more just 
sense of values." In conclusion, we are assured 
that Mr. Page "will be recognized as the au- 
thentic salt of Americanism, and will gain much 
and suffer nothing by coming to the London 
embassy simply on his own merits as a citizen 
and a servant of the republic." 

One important thing to be said about Mr. 
Page is that he will represent the whole country. 
A Southerner by birth, whose active years have 
been spent almost wholly in the North, he has 
made it his special mission to bind up the 
nation's wounds, and all his work as editor, 
publisher, author, and public speaker has been 
done with an eye to the special needs of the 
section that has not even yet wholly freed 
itself from the incubus of the social system that 
caused the great cataclysm of our history. In 
his denunciation of the old-time prejudices that 
yet linger, and in his constructive suggestions 
for the future, he has made a powerful plea, 
and one that has not gone unheeded, for the 
saving ministries of education and industry. 
Several years ago, he formulated a creed which 
we will reproduce: 

" I believe in the free public training of both the 
hands and the mind of every child born of woman. 

" I believe that by the right training of men we add 
to the wealth of the world. All wealth is the creation of 
man, and he creates it only in proportion to the trained 
uses of the community; and, the more men we train, 
the more wealth everyone may create. 

" I believe in the perpetual regeneration of society, 
in the immortality of democracy, and in growth ever- 
lasting." 

It is a good creed, even if it does not embody 
the whole sum of social idealism, and at least 
implies most of the things that it does not ex- 



press. And it has this proposition for a corol- 
lary : " It is a shining day in any educated man's 
growth when he comes to see and to know and 
to feel and freely to admit that it is just as im- 
portant to the world that the ragamuffin child 
of his worthless neighbor should be trained as 
it is that his own child should be." 

We do not suggest that our new ambassador 
is going to lecture the English people on their 
shortcomings in the matters of education and 
industry. He could be no more guilty of such 
tactlessness than of following the amazing exam- 
ple of his chief when the latter recently exacer- 
bated English feeling by injecting his own dog- 
matic opinions into the field of partisan English 
political controversy. He will commit no blaz- 
ing indiscretions for the sake of the Irish or 
any other vote. But he will be the spokesman 
of democracy as Lowell was, and like his pre- 
decessor, will charm his hearers by the persua- 
siveness of the gospel that will be implicit in 
his public utterances. He will represent us at 
our typical best, as Lowell and Phelps and Bay- 
ard and Hay and Choate represented us, and his 
advances will meet the same generous response 
that was accorded to those men by all the 
cultivated and high-minded elements of English 
society. 

In the appointment of Mr. Page the Presi- 
dent has given earnest of his disposition to set 
our diplomatic service upon a high plane of 
character and intelligence. The number of 
foreign posts that have been filled by mere poli- 
ticians or mere plutocrats has of late years been 
discouragingly large. We believe that the 
President has a higher conception of these 
offices than that of using them for the payment 
of political debts, and that fitness will be the 
foremost consideration in filling them. Above 
all, we trust that he will avoid the blunders of 
sending men to countries of whose language and 
history they are ignorant. It would perhaps be 
too much to demand that the Chinese embassy 
should be filled by a Sinologist, but it is not too 
much to insist that our representative in almost 
any European country should be a man having 
some acquaintance with the language of the coun- 
try to which he is sent. There is plenty of the 
right sort of material to choose from, and when 
a man who does not know Italian or Spanish is 
sent to Italy or Spain, or when one who does 
not know Danish or Dutch is sent to Denmark

and no President can afford to give us another 
horrible example of that sort. The character 
of an administration is perhaps better revealed 
in its diplomatic appointments than by any 
other test, and we confidently hope that the 
President will follow the fine lead which he has 
given us in his appointment to St. James. From 
a series of such appointments it will not be a 
long step to the final goal of our desire to the 
goal of a permanent diplomatic service in which 
demonstrated capacity shall mean life tenure, 
and every trace of spoils shall disappear from 
the administration of the State Department. 



HISTORIES OF LITER A TURE AND 
A RECENT EXAMPLE. 



What mysterious law of Nature exists which 
compels a History of English Literature written by 
an Englishman or an American to be dull, is prob- 
ably beyond investigation. The fact is there, how- 
ever. The sprightliest and most vivacious writers, 
once submitting to the sad mechanic exercise of 
grinding out chronicles of the intellectual life of 
our race, become apparently hopeless and produce 
books calculated to repress the enthusiasm of youth 
and chill the reasoned ardor of age. Is it because 
they assume extra-judicial functions in their efforts 
to balance the claims of a thousand writers, and 
cease to be light-hearted advocates and appreciators? 
Or is it because the great masters of literature in 
such a book appear like painted spaces on a card, 
red, yellow, blue, green, scarlet, turquoise, which 
the historian revolves slowly, so that they run into 
each other, yet do not make a dazzling white, only 
a muddy kind of grey? Or is it because they are 
like objects in a museum of natural science, and we 
wander among them and the curator points them 
out with his wand and seems to triumph over them 
with his interminable drone, as though to say, "Poor 
wretches ! You were once alive but now you are dead 
and stuffed and shelved and ticketed in this morgue, 
and depend entirely on me to rehearse the lively mo- 
tions of your prime " ? Certainly the chief impression 
one gets from such books is that the writers of the past 
are dead. The ethereal music and glowing imagery 
of Shakespeare and Milton and Shelley become thin 
and ghostlike ; the wit of Dryden and Congreve and 
Pope evaporates; the thronging characters of the 
novelists and playwrights cannot lift themselves up 
from the dismal pages. Yet if we only throw our his- 
tory of literature aside and go to the books it treats 
of, we find them as much alive as ever. Nothing 
that is really great in literature ever does die. 

Yet there have been histories of English litera- 
ture, histories of other literatures, which were worth 
while. Taine's book, being a work of genius, is full 
of faults. Its central conception of literature as an 



utterance of a great national organism, leaves out 
of account the accidental, the inspirational, the uni- 
versal. And to English readers, at least, there are a 
thousand errors of proportion and detail. But what 
vitality, what power ! The masters of our verse and 
prose stride about like gods and giants playing with 
the dominions of the world; the humblest reader 
feels the contagion of their force, the lift of their 
tone, and thinks more nobly of himself because he 
is sealed of their race. It is a book to breed great 
writers. Then there is Symonds's "Greek Poets." 
No doubt there are many persons living who date 
their knowledge of and love for Greek literature 
from the reading of this book. Perhaps it is the 
novel and unfamiliar view-point which makes an 
alien's opinion of any literature startling and vivi- 
fying. Use and custom dull our outlook. We are 
like people who dwell by a bay of the sea with 
great hills and mountain ranges piled around us 
and behind. But always the same peaks jut up 
in the same place, the same slopes fall down in 
the same way. The scene becomes monotonous. 
Then a voyager comes along and invites us to enter 
his boat and circumnavigate our island or patrol 
the front of our continent. Immediately the land- 
scape begins to dissolve and recreate. New moun- 
tains arise, the old ones change their relation to 
each other, and everything has a different bearing 
and aspect. This is the service that such writers as 
Taine and Brandes do for us. 

Mr. Lang's "History of English Literature" is 
no worse than its precursors of the kind; in some 
respects it is better. For one thing the glad and 
tricksy spirit which dominated Lang's style would 
not always be denied, and often raises him above 
the official showman's drone. For another thing, 
though the tone of his whole picture is drab enough, 
yet, as far as may be, the values are preserved ; the 
proportions are correct. But the work is utterly 
uninspiring. Even the best sections, those on Shake- 
speare and Scott, are uninspiring. And Mr. Lang's 
treatment of the mass of his writers, well ! 

" He is more than usual calm, 
He does n't give a single damn." 

There is one matter, however, for which we in 
America owe the memory of Mr. Lang the sincerest 
thanks. For the first time, we imagine, in a work 
of this kind, American writers are used with absolute 
respect. They are given as full a share of space 
as their English compeers, and their treatment is 
not any more colorless. Mr. Lang suggests that 
we ought to accept Whittier as our national poet. 
Perhaps this is only his fun. More probably, though, 
it is a half-unconscious expression of a settled En- 
glish opinion as to our rights and privileges. A 
travelling acquaintance of ours has always been very 
indignant at the citizens of modern Rome because 
they prefer to live in new and comfortable houses. 
Ruins are their forte, he insists, and they ought to 
stick to ruins. Similarly, or conversely, the English 
demand that American writers shonld deal with the 



330 



THE 



DIAL 

A

new and crude of our country, and leave the rest of 
the world and the whole backward of time to their 
own piratical plundering. No one denies the spirit 
and interest of Whittier's home-made verse ; but if 
he is the best we have had, we are still in the horn- 
book state of tutelage. If to be a national poet, a 
writer must deal with home scenes and near times, 
what national poet has England ? It cannot be 
Spenser, for his scene is laid in Fairyland. Nor 
Shakespeare, for two-thirds of his plays deal with 
foreign lands and peoples. Nor Milton, for Hebrew 
antiquity furnishes the basis for the bulk of his work. 
Nor Byron, who dealt with Italy and the East. Nor 
Shelley, nor Keats, nor Tennyson, for they revived 
the legends and the life of Greece. Less than any 
other nation has England built its literature up out 
of its own materials and within its own confines ; 
yet that is what its critics insist upon Americans 
doing. However, Mr. Lang's suggestion is only a 
slight one ; and, as we have said, his treatment of 
American authors, if not enthusiastic (he is hardly 
ever enthusiastic) is eminently fair. 

We do not suppose for a moment that Mr. Lang, 
in writing this book, had any idea of changing or 
reforming the opinions of real lovers of literature. 
It is a piece of bookwork intended primarily for 
young students. But herein, it seems to us, resides 
its danger, and the danger of all such dry-as-dust 
compilations. If we could point to any one thing 
calculated to disinherit such students of their rightful 
estates in the realms of gold, disenchant them with 
the charm and nobility of great literature, and de- 
press them in their own ambitions, it would be the 
ordinary school history of literature. The young 
student does not need a wide knowledge of even our 
own literature : that will come in time if he begins 
right. He does not even much need instruction in 
balancing the claims of innumerable authors. What 
he needs is inspiration. He needs to have his sen- 
sibilities aroused, his enthusiasm awakened. It is 
better for him if he can come to thrill with the magic 
of a single poem of Coleridge or Keats than if he 
knew the dates of every English writer from Anglo- 
Saxon times to the present, and had their official 
rating firmly fixed in his mind. The temptation in 
schools is to substitute a history of literature for lit- 
erature itself. Always students should be directed 
to the originals. These need neither be many nor 
recondite, to guide good taste. The old books of 
Elegant Extracts, so much ridiculed now, had their 
uses. They probably helped to breed many gener- 
ations of real readers. If criticism must be offered 
to young students it should be the best, the most 
vivid, the most inspiring. A small volume could be 
put together of essays by Dr. Johnson, Coleridge, 
Hazlitt, Lamb, Arnold, and Lowell, which would 
cover the great epochs and major writers of English 
literature, and which would be more valuable to 
students than any historic survey on the market.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE PROBLEM OF BOOK-DISTRIBUTION in a 

country so poorly provided with bookshops as our 
own, and where the carriage of books by mail or 
express is relatively so expensive, and where also 
the mere calling of the would-be purchaser's atten- 
tion by advertisement to the particular book he 
would gladly buy is so uncertain and difficult and 
costly, is not the least of the problems every year 
becoming more perplexing to the American pub- 
lisher. Mr. George P. Brett, president of the 
Macmillan Company, dwells at length on this 
question in a current "Atlantic " article on "Book- 
Publishing and its Present Tendencies." Although 
our annual book-production has doubled in twenty 
years, running now as high as thirteen or fourteen 
thousand new publications, the total annual sales 
are little if any in excess of those prevailing in that 
earlier period ; and this, Mr. Brett believes, is due 
to the inadequacy of our means for getting the 
books to the people who want them. Even in 
fiction, which always finds the readiest sale, the 
increase in production has been attended by no 
corresponding increase in total circulation. Dr. 
Edward Everett Hale used to maintain, as Mr. 
Brett recalls, that no work of general literature had 
ever been adequately distributed or "published," 
in the literal sense of that word. The costs of such 
distribution are prohibitive. Some new and efficient 
method of bringing books and their most likely 
purchasers together is what is needed. Where is the 
inventive genius that shall devise the machinery? 
In England a classified card-catalogue system of 
British book-buyers, so far as the names and 
addresses of such buyers can be obtained, is 
undergoing trial at the hands of a certain firm of 
booksellers. Notices of new books likely to interest 
the person thus catalogued are sent to him from 
time to time, and results gratifying to all concerned 
ought to follow. But, as Mr. Brett says, such a 
plan is far less practicable with our much larger 
and less stable population. After all is said that can 
be said on the subject, our publishers should not be 
made to bear the blame for evils which they, more 
than anyone else, deplore. They rejoice in the 
discovery of a meritorious manuscript among the 
thousands submitted to them, though they can pub- 
lish only a fiftieth part of such submitted works; 
and when they do issue a book, their profit on it 
is commonly about one-half that of the author. The 
publisher's position is surely no fat-salaried sinecure. 
As a concluding suggestion on this whole subject, 
one might query whether an increasingly effective 
agent of distribution may not be found in the public 
library. The rather rapid extension of the free- 
library system, in the founding of new libraries, the 
multiplication of branches, and the growth of travel- 
ling libraries, furnishes a ready means for reaching 
a constantly enlarging reading public and, to some 



1913]

extent, a buying public. At any rate, the libraries 
themselves constitute a purchasing class of no 
mean proportions, and these proportions are on the 
increase. European bookshops excel ours in num- 
ber and excellence, but American public libraries 
acknowledge no superiors. 



A TOUR DE FORCE IN LIBRARY-RECONSTRUCTION 

is to be credited to Director J. I. Wyer, Jr., and his 
corps of assistants at the New York State Library. 
Two years have passed since the destructive fire in 
the capitol at Albany almost wiped out of existence 
the most valuable State collection of books and manu- 
scripts in the country. But the proverbial alacrity 
in locking the stable door after the horse is stolen 
showed itself, and an adequate fire-proof building 
was speedily erected to receive the new collection 
for which a wisely compliant legislature voted an 
appropriation of one and a quarter million dollars. 
The story of the shifts and expedients, the embar- 
rassed labors and the baffling problems, of those 
intervening months of stress and strain, as told by 
Mr. Wyer in a recent Report, will convince the most 
incredulous that even the librarian's life may have 
elements of strenuosity. Especially interesting is 
his account of the rescue of charred manuscripts 
from the glowing embers, at considerable personal 
risk, and of the restoration of these damaged treas- 
ures, so far as restoration was possible. One would 
like to know what proportion of manuscripts and of 
books was saved out of the whole collection, but we 
are merely left to infer that the salvage was incon- 
siderable. The rapidity with which new books and 
other material have been bought is marvellous. Com- 
plicating the whole situation has been the necessity 
of conducting the Library School without interrup- 
tion ; but even this, with help from Washington and 
elsewhere, has been achieved. Librarianism hath 
her victories no less renowned than certain other 
callings commonly regarded as more arduous or 

more heroic. 



MR. GORDON CRAIG'S "SCHOOL FOR THE ART 
OF THE THEATRE," so inspiringly mapped out in 
his book of last year, has lately become a reality. 
When Mr. Craig's mother, Ellen Terry, celebrated 
her sixty-fifth birthday a few weeks ago, one of the 
pleasantest features of the day was Mr. Craig's 
announcement that, through the generosity of Lord 
Howard de Walden, the projected "School for the 
Art of the Theatre " was established upon a sound 
financial basis. This school, as is obvious to anyone 
familiar with Mr. Craig's theories, will differ essen- 
tially from any of the existing dramatic academies. 
The final plan involves two great divisions. The 
experimental school, to which Mr. Craig attaches 
the greater importance, will aim "at infusing the 
life of imagination into every art and craft connected 
with the stage, so that fresh vigor will be given to 
the creative power of those actively connected with 
the drama." It will gather a body of. earnest and 
thorough workers, who, under Mr. Craig's direction, 



will undertake theatrical productions in any part of 
the world. The preliminary work will be done at 
the school's theatre, where, also, the members of the 
secondary school for the study of stage crafts will 
find opportunity for practical work. All students 
in this course must study speech and movement; and 
they may choose, in addition, one " elective " from 
such crafts as costume- making, lighting, preparation 
of properties, and so on. The course will cover three 
years, and at the end of the first year examinations 
will be held to weed out the unfit. Disciples of the 
feminist movement will be annoyed to find that Mr. 
Craig absolutely excludes women from his experi- 
mental school. ... 

THE BUFFALO EDUCATIONAL UNION, already 
noticed by us, is intelligently developing its powers 
for usefulness. The cooperating bodies are the 
Society of Natural Sciences, the Fine Arts Academy, 
the Historical Society, the Grosvenor Library, and 
the Public Library. Mr. Walter L. Brown, head of 
the last-named institution, says in his current Report : 
"This Union has already resulted in several discus- 
sions of the field of work and in a better under- 
standing than before existed. The present plans for 
work are mainly in the direction of publicity. A 
poster is now being printed picturing and describing 
the means and kinds of education offered free by 
these five institutions. It is designed that this poster 
shall be hung in the schools and in other places where 
many people gather or where many are employed. A 
directory of all the means of education available in 
the City of Buffalo is proposed. Another plan, which 
the Union has under way, provides for talks illus- 
trated by lantern slides to be given to the pupils of 
night schools and to club organizations, describing 
the work of the societies and what they offer to the 
residents of Buffalo." Probably no other city of 
the size of Buffalo has its library needs ministered 
to by so many agencies branches, deposit stations, 
school libraries, travelling collections, and so on. 
These run into the hundreds. There are forty-two 
"firemen's libraries," to say nothing of hospitals, 
settlement houses, clubs, police stations, and other 
societies or institutions that receive special attention 
from the public library. An interesting statistical 
summary shows a nearly steady increase, during the 
last sixteen years, in those figures that a librarian 
likes to see increase, and an equally steady decrease 
in that one department of circulation he likes to see 
decrease, fiction. From a percentage of 72.7 in 
1897 it has declined to 59 in 1912. 



THE COLOR OF WORDS, to those who tend to see 
all things in terms of color, is very real and often 
very vivid; and there are probably few persons to 
whom certain words do not at least suggest bright- 
ness and certain other words gloom. Mr. Yoshio 
Markino, the Japanese artist whose oddly charac- 
teristic literary style has attracted many readers, 
entertained and amused most of them, and stirred 
the unsympathetic merriment of a few, is evidently 



332 



THE DIAL 



[April 16 



one who finds something in words that appeals 
strongly to sense perception. His article on " Emo- 
tion and Etymology " in the April "Atlantic " is a 
curious study of that quality in words which no mere 
effort of the intellect can grasp. All-important is 
the feeling behind the words and showing through 
them. The ability to make the same vocables ex- 
press a great variety of meanings by variations of 
tone and accent is probably more characteristic of 
the Chinese than of the Japanese. At any rate, it is 
a peculiarity developed comparatively little in other 
languages. What Mr. Markino has to say in his 
essay will interest some readers less than his inim- 
itable manner of saying it. Let us quote a few 
sentences. "There are quite many people who are 
over-cautious even when they are among their most 
sympathetic friends. They are frightened to utter a 
single word in fear that ' it might make the listeners 
misunderstand.' These people are evidently trying 
to make the world deadly dull. It is all through 
their lack of sense and wisdom as well as sympathy, 
and I simply get sick of them!" One willingly 
excuses the triteness of some of Mr. Markino's 
observations because of their amusing oddity of 
form. For example: "There is some difference 
between the public speech and private conversation. 
Just the right words for the public speech may 
become too much superfluous for the private con- 
versation. Too much exciting gesture and too many 
emphasized words are absolutely unnecessary to 
convey our emotion among a few people. You 
would not shoot partridges with the twelve-inch 
gun, would you ? " Mr. Markino closes with an able 
defense of his style against the charge of "pose," 
and with his reasons for spelling his name as he 
does rather than without the r, as he has been told 
he ought to do. 

THE TRU-BLU SPELLING-REFORMER will giv a 

harty welcome to the latest innovations adopted 
by the Board. He will not be bacward in accepting 
this further economy of the alfabet now accomplish! 
by the hed reformers in council assembled. Some 
of the nu words may look strange, but nothing is too 
stif in this sort to disharten him. Let others snif or 
laf or turn away in a huf ; he is not of that kidny, 
and you can safely bet your mony on his stedfastness. 
All thot of weakening is foren to his nature, and he 
regards the half-harted with sovren contempt. He 
writes the nu spellings on the tables of his hart in 
bold blac inc, the blacer the better. Let those scof 
who will ; by no caitif dout is he ever distraut. Tho 
there be wailing and nashing of teeth thruout the 
ranks of the anti-reformers, naut will ever make him 
untru to the cause. It may be a weary jurny to the 
complete metamorf osis of our written language, but 
long enuf hav the unregenerate spellings held undis- 
turbed their ancient rein. No, THE DIAL has not 

turned its coat, seamy as is the appearance of the 
foregoing, but is merely trying to keep itself and 
its readers at least partially informed of the latest 
indignities offered to our orthography by certain 



misguided zealots. One feels moved to ask the 
spelling-reformer, as Cicero on a certain occasion 
demanded of Catiline, Quousque tandem abutere 
patientia nostra? Quern ad finem sese effrenata 
jactabit audacia ? 

A MEMORIAL TO A MASTER OF THE SHORT STORY 

is likely before long to greet the visitor to North 
Carolina's new Hall of History and Literature. 
Professor Archibald Henderson, of the University 
of North Carolina, issues a booklet setting forth the 
plan and purpose of this memorial. He says : " At 
the last meeting of the State Literary and Historical 
Association of North Carolina a movement was be- 
gun for the purpose of preserving memorials of all 
sorts pertaining to the literature of North Carolina 
and its makers. In the new Hall of History it is 
expected that a section will be reserved for Litera- 
ture. Here may be placed busts, medallions, por- 
traits, miniatures, autograph letters and documents, 
original manuscripts of literary works, autographed 
copies of the works of native men and women of 
letters, etc., etc." The one whose genius it is now 
proposed to commemorate with a bust or medallion 
is that favorite of short-story readers, William Sidney 
Porter, better known as " O. Henry," who was born 
at Greensboro a little more than fifty years ago, and 
whose writings have just achieved the distinction 
(comparatively rare in the case of magazine stories) 
of a complete edition, in twelve volumes. Contribu- 
tions for the memorial are solicited, and may be sent 
to Professor Henderson at Chapel Hill, N. C. 



LURING THE LITTLE FOLK TO THE LIBRARY 
means, as a rule, the winning of life-long friends to 
good books. At St. Joseph, Mo., this end is hastened 
by the distribution of copies of an attractive folder, 
explanatory and hortatory, among the ten thousand 
school children of the city ; and these folders, going 
into the homes of some fifty thousand persons, work 
their charm on others beside the juvenile members 
of the community. The librarian informs us that, 
incredible though it may seem, within the first four 
days after the distribution of the folders began, the 
demand for books on the part of borrowers showed 
an increase of fifty-nine per cent. The little sheet 
contains a short list of " books for young people," 
one of "books for women," a note on "books for 
men," a general invitation to the library, with a few 
words on the freedom of its privileges, a brief note 
"to the boys and girls," and, under an outline sketch 
of a St. Joseph little girl absorbed in a book, the 
following : " Good books are my friends they bring 
me wisdom and happiness. In our Public Library 
I have found hundreds of pleasant books to read. 
I am only one of over 13,000 others who read there. 

Are you?" . . . 

THE DECLINING PERCENTAGE OF FICTION in the 

publisher's output and, to some extent, in the public 
library's circulation, is attributed to a recent marked 
increase in the demand for books on such subjects 
as sociology, economics, useful arts, medicine, hy- 



1913]

giene, applied science, sports and games, nature- 
study, and even religion, philosophy, and poetry and 
the drama. Mr. Fred E. Woodward, of Washing- 
ton, D. C., has been gathering statistics for " The 
Literary Digest," and his figures, with accompanying 
diagrams, are interesting. From them it appears 
that whereas in 1890 the whole number of books 
published in this country was 4,559, of which nearly 
a quarter were works of fiction, in 1912 the whole 
number had risen to 10,135, of which not quite a 
tenth part were in that class. Indeed, the decline 
in novels seems to have been absolute as well as 
relative, from 1,118 to 1,010. But the statistician 
notes 733 reprints among the novels issued twenty- 
two years ago, while he fails to indicate their num- 
ber for last year. Thus it may be that new novels 
are appearing in larger numbers now than formerly ; 
and indeed one must believe this to be so until proof 
to the contrary is brought forward. The relative 
decline, however, seems indisputable, and is not to 
be regretted. 

A SUN-DIAL INTERESTING TO BOOKMEN has been 

set up in the garden of the Country Life Press at 
Garden City, Long Island; and an artistic little paper- 
covered book descriptive of its curious construction 
is issued by the same press, with the imprint of 
Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. Mr. Walter Gilliss, 
the designer of the dial, writes the description, and 
excellent illustrations are added. " A Printers' Sun 
Dial" is the title of the treatise, and it tells how the 
dial came to be erected, how the Gutenberg Bible, as 
the first of printed books and the "Book of Books," 
was chosen for representation on its face, and how 
the marks of twelve early printers were selected for 
the twelve hour spaces. No expense seems to have 
been spared in making the dial a thing of beauty 
and a most solid and lasting construction. Its ped- 
estal extends three and a half feet below the surface 
of the ground, to ensure against disturbance by frost, 
and concrete, cement, and brass are the materials 
used, with a perdurable composition of an unnamed 
sort as filling for the engraved lettering on the open 
pages of the Bible, which itself is said to be exactly 
reproduced from the fifty-thousand-dollar copy 
secured at the late Hoe sale by Mr. Henry E. Hunt- 
ington. Appreciative visitors are welcome in the 
" cedar room," as it is called, of the beautiful garden 
where the Printers' Sun Dial is to be seen. 



THE STORY OF A RARE COPT OF "AL AARAAF," 

an early product of Poe's pen, is going the rounds. 
Two women, mother and daughter, both of advanced 
age, living in Washington, D. C., called in a local 
dealer in second-hand books a few weeks ago to ap- 
praise a small collection of their own. But it held 
nothing to attract the eye of a connoisseur, and he 
was about to depart when he chanced to notice a 
pasteboard-bound volume serving in place of a lost 
caster to a bureau in the room. "What's this?" 
he asked, stooping to look at the book. " Oh, that's 
nothing," replied the daughter. "It's by Mr. Poe. 
He used to call on Adeline and Alvina Wolfe, two 



women who lived in Baltimore, and he gave it to 
them. It fell very flat when it was published." 
The book proved to be a first edition of " Al Aaraaf , 
Tamerlane, and Minor Poems" (Baltimore, 1829), 
a copy of which recently sold, it is said, for twenty- 
seven hundred dollars at auction; and the dealer 
could have had the thing for the price of a new 
caster. But he chanced to be a man of honor, and 
so he paid the poor women two thousand dollars, be- 
ing glad enough to secure the treasure at that price. 



COMMUNICATION. 

"AIN'T I." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Mr. Wallace Rice, in the latest issue of THE DIAL, 
speaking of the colloquial use of " are n't I " and " an't 
I," remarks: "A later and still more illiterate form is 
ain't." It is rather odd to find in Charles Lamb's writ- 
ings not infrequent use of this vulgarism, not only in his 
letters but also in his more serious works. I suspect 
it will be found not to be a later form but as old as spoken 
English. I have heard it on the lips of men and women 
of comparatively high culture in the country districts 
of Maine, where it is also used as a contraction for "are 
not " and " is not," as for example, "ain't you going?" 
and " 't ain't neither." In the same way " hain't " is 
used for " have not " and " has not," as in " I hain't 
seen her," " Hain't John got one ? " 

I must confess to a lingering fondness for these 
delightful old colloquialisms. All kinds of dialects 
are interesting, and the dying " Yankee dilact " which 
Lowell treated so sympathetically and which one may 
occasionally come across even now in out-of-the-way 
places has a flavor particularly its own. My Uncle 
Isaiah, who was one of the most particular of men and 
who at his death left in manuscript a universal Gram- 
mar of half a dozen different languages working on it 
served him in place of a lung for many years ! some- 
times in his speech fell instinctively into the old habit 
of saying " ain't " and doubling his negatives, as if he 
were speaking Greek, which he knew as few men do. 
Up till within a few years in Templeton, Massachusetts, 
there were relics of the local dialect of the English dis- 
trict from which the early settlers came. At Ogunquit, 
Maine, until recently an isolated fishing- village, you still 
hear "the natives" speak of a man as a " cutter," though 
they call an animal a " critter." The mother of a patri- 
archal family, when some surprise was expressed by a 
summer visitor at the number of her offspring, remarked : 
" Yes, 't is a fruitsome place." Even our characteristic 
or supposedly characteristic American humor, that of 
exaggeration upwards or downwards, is really an im- 
portation. An early sixteenth century writer in one of 
his books speaks of the Atlantic Ocean as "the ditch"! 

I vastly prefer " ain't " for " am not " to the wretched 
French idiom beginning with " it was," followed by 
" that " instead of " when," i.e., " It was on the sixteenth 
of June that he came." It may be occasionally effective 
to introduce a clause with " It was . . . that," but its 
universal and spreading use in newspapers, magazines, 
and books, with sometimes four or five instances of it 
in a single page, is excessively annoying to one who likes 
a clear concise style. It is like a blight ruining idiomatic 
English. NATHAN HASKELL DOLE.

A NEW ENGLAND WORTHY OF THE 
17TH CENTURY.* 

More than seventy years ago the late Mr. 
John Wingate Thornton began a loving study 
of the history of his ancestor, Daniel Gookin ; 
more than thirty-five years ago this work was 
taken up by his kinsman, Mr. Frederick William 
Gookin. The exhaustive record of the Gookin 
family in America, and of its descendants, which 
resulted has proved as yet too extensive for pub- 
lication. The privately printed Life of Major 
General Daniel Gookin, lately issued in Chicago, 
would alone justify all the pious care bestowed 
on the subject through two generations. 

In all respects the book is admirable : to the 
eye, at first, as one delights in the beauty of its 
printed pages ; to the mind , as one perceives 
the compact solidity of its substance and the 
secure certainty of its composition ; to the finer 
sesthetic sense, as one begins to feel the implicit 
excellence of its style, never obtrusive and never 
inadequate, an almost imperceptible vehicle of 
the meaning which comes straight to the reader 
with no conscious effort in the reading. Above 
all, it is admirable in its full and final effect. 
The name of Daniel Gookin has hitherto been 
little more than a name to those who knew it 
at all ; to any who read this book it must surely 
become the token of an individual life, bravely 
lived and singularly typical of what we love to 
believe most deeply characteristic of the America 
he helped to found. 

Among the worthies of our seventeenth cen- 
tury, Daniel Gookin was almost unique in being 
at once of Virginia and of New England, in 
both colonies a man of rank. He sprang from 
a family of Kentish gentry, of which the origin 
and the affiliations are in this book abundantly 
recorded. His father, courageously adventur- 
ous in the full spirit of Elizabethan adventure, 
settled himself for a while in Ireland, in the 
very year when Shakespeare died; five years 
later he was in Virginia, on his own adventure, 
with fifty colonists under him; and when in 
March, 1622, a rising of the Indians drove the 
other planters to shelter, " only Master Gookins 
at Nuport's-news would not obey the Commis- 
sioners' command in that, though he scarce had 
five and thirty of all sorts with him, yet he

thought himself sufficient against what could 
happen, and so did, to his great credit." Ten 
years later he died in Ireland. At that time 
two of his sons, neither more than twenty years 
old, were probably on his Virginian estates. 
John died there in November, 1643, being 
about thirty years of age; his tombstone is 
the oldest now legible at Church Point, Lynn 
Haven. Daniel, the subject of the volume be- 
fore us, survived to the age of seventy-five; 
and lies in the old graveyard of Cambridge in 
Massachusetts, opposite the gates of Harvard 
College. 

He had removed to New England just about 
the time of his brother's death. Puritan in 
conviction, as were most of his English kinsfolk, 
he had found himself unwilling to live under 
the Virginian Act of Conformity. Arrived in 
Massachusetts, he had presently become there a 
man of consideration. His first intimate friend- 
ship, which was life-long, seems to have been 
with the celebrated John Eliot, minister of Rox- 
bury, and still remembered as the " Apostle to 
the Indians." In Eliot's noble philanthropy 
Daniel Gookin was his most constant associate 
throughout; to the end, Gookin's devotion to the 
welfare of the New England Indians remained 
faithful. This alone would have made him mem- 
orable; so would the record of his other and 
constant public services. Being "a very for- 
ward man to advance Marshal discipline, and 
withal the truths of Christ," he was for some 
forty years captain of the train-band of Cam- 
bridge; and in 1681 he was made Major Gen- 
eral, or commander-in-chief of all the military 
forces of the colony. Meanwhile he was often a 
deputy to the General Court and for a time its 
speaker; he was for a long time Assistant, or 
one of the Council of eighteen magistrates to 
whom, with the Governor and Deputy Governor, 
the government of the colony was entrusted. 
During a visit to England in 1655, he had been 
charged by Cromwell, apparently in person, 
with the fruitless task of endeavoring to per- 
suade good people of New England to transfer 
themselves as colonists to the newly captured 
island of Jamaica. During another visit abroad, 
just before the Restoration, he had been for a 
while Collector of Customs and Deputy Treas- 
urer at War in Dunkirk. He finally returned 
to New England in the same ship with the 
regicide judges, Goffe and Whalley. Thence- 
forth to the end there, the record of his life is 
one of unbroken devotion to public duty, in no 
aspect more excellent than when, during the 
janics of King Philip's War, he stoutly de-

fended, in the face of popular clamor, the rights 
of such Indians as had not proved themselves 
hostile or treacherous. He had planned the 
writing of a History of New England. Of this 
only two fragments remain, probably all he ever 
finished. Both deal with the New England 
Indians one to the year 1674, the other dur- 
ing the three years ensuing; the former was pub- 
lished by the Massachusetts Historical Society 
in 1792, the latter by the American Antiquarian 
Society in 1836. It is by these publications 
that he has hitherto been known, so far as he 
has been known at all. The book now before 
us, faithfully collecting and collating what 
letters and documents of his and concerning 
him remain, at last revives his worthy memory. 

What Mr. F. W. Gookin writes of him sums 
him up best : 

" Altruism is of all the virtues the most difficult to 
acquire and practice. It is also the hardest for the 
selfish multitude to fathom. . . . Had Daniel Gookin's 
talents been devoted to his own advancement, he might 
be better known to the world at large. Instead he 
chose the nobler part. ... In whatever aspect [his] 
life and character be regarded, he stands the test of 
the most rigid scrutiny. . . . His mind was that of a 
statesman. The public documents prepared by him 
attest his sagacity and skill, the breadth of his outlook, 
and his understanding of his fellow men. . . . The 
calm certainty of his judgment is a salient trait. . . . 
Though never vacillating, he was never rash. . . . 
What he had to say he set down in a simple and direct 
manner. His concern was with the substance of his 
remarks rather than with their form. [And] from the 
inflexible firmness with which [he] stood for every speci- 
fic right of the colonists he has been called * the origin- 
ator and prophet of that immortal dogma of our national 
greatness no taxation without representation.' " 

When he died in Cambridge on the 19th of 
March, 1686-7, the colony had lost its charter; 
the pristine theocracy in which he believed had 
fatally fallen; the causes for which he had 
lived seemed desperate. But, if we may credit 
Sewall's dream of him, his courage never failed : 
Sabbath, Dec 30th* 1688 

"Last night I dreamed of military matters, Arms 
and Captains, and of a suddain Major Gookin, very well 
clad from head to foot, and of a very fresh, lively coun- 
tenance his Coat and Breeches of blood-red silk, 
beckened me out of the room where I was to speak to 
him. I think 't was from the Toun-house." 

All that was more than two centuries ago. 
More than once between whiles, as to many 
nowadays, the outlook of our country has 
seemed dark and threatening. Beyond all 
things else, such faithfulness to duty as Daniel 
Gookin's has kept alive what we still love to 
believe the true spirit of ancestral America. As 
we, of his children, look back on his memory, 
there can surge up no more fervent hope than 



that in times to come the children who shall 
spring from us may find us worthy of the tra- 
ditions which, for our little while, we hold in 

trust from him. , Tr

IRISH PLAYS AND PLAYERS.* 



The Irish Players have recently finished their 
secotid American tour, not counting the Fay 
brothers' earlier engagement to furnish curtain- 
raisers for a conventional farce-comedy, under 
the Frohman management. Their appearances 
this winter have witnessed no recurrence of the 
riotous disapproval that greeted the first Ameri- 
can performances of " The Playboy " a year ago. 
As far as we know, Lady Gregory, though she 
accompanied the Players again this winter, has 
given no more lectures on the Irish Literary 
Renaissance and the Abbey Theatre movement. 
Lady Gregory's talks last year were explanatory 
and more or less defensive. The necessity for 
defending the Players, or their plays, is now 
happily past; America has accepted the Irish 
Players and the Irish drama as a character- 
istic and altogether delightful feature of the 
contemporary theatre. The American audi- 
ences have not always been large, but they have 
been, like the Dublin audiences, eager and con- 
stant attendants; and, if opportunity is given, 
we feel sure that, like the Dublin audiences, they 
will grow ; for a person of discrimination who 
has seen the Irish Players once, will come and 
bring his friends to see them through their 
repertory. And the next year, if they repeat 
their performances, he will repeat his. 

The account of a large and vital movement 
before lecture audiences must of necessity be 
brief and incomplete. Lady Gregory and Mr. 
Yeats satisfied only in small measure the curious 
interest that the Irish Players, with their nat- 
uralness, their eloquence, their dignity, their 
versatility, the convincing impression they give 
of being actors born, not made, had aroused 
in us. And now the spoken words of Mr. Yeats 
and Lady Gregory have been worthily supple- 
mented by more detailed and comprehensive 
accounts of the whole dramatic movement in Ire- 
land, from the pen of Mr. Cornelius Weygandt. 
Mr. Weygandt, from the vantage-point of an 
American University, has followed the Irish 
revival with sympathy and interest from its 
beginnings; and he has come close to it by 
repeated visits to London and Dublin, and by

gandt. Illustrated. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co.

THE DIAL 



[April 16 



friendly intercourse with many of the leaders of 
the movement. " Irish Plays and Playwrights M 
is therefore written from a point of view that 
delightfully combines sympathy and understand- 
ing with the breadth of view and the detachment 
essential to the success of so detailed a study. 
It is a book to delight all good lovers of Irish 
drama, and to bring it to the attention of many 
drama-lovers who have hitherto ignored the Irish 
playwrights. Portraits of a dozen or more of 
these writers, with one of Sara Allgood, the 
"leading lady" of the Abbey Company, add 
vividness and interest to the text. 

Mr. Weygandt, easily recognizing the source 
of American interest in his subject to be the 
Irish Players, wisely begins his work after a 
brief general survey of the theme with a 
chapter on "The Players and their Plays, their 
Audience and their Art." His estimate of 
the Abbey Theatre's achievement, the history 
of which he traces with understanding and 
lucidity, is summed up in his concluding 
tribute : 

" I think the dramatic movement the most significant 
part of the Celtic Renaissance, a movement to me the 
most original movement in letters the world has known 
since that movement in Norway which so definitely 
stimulated it, a movement that gave Bjornson and Ibsen 
to the world." 

That the Abbey Theatre and its modest pre- 
decessors gave the dramatic literature its reason 
for being, furnishing a poet and dreamer like 
Yeats, a genius like Synge, a practical reformer 
like " A. E.," and patriotic Irish writers such 
as are nearly all the Abbey playwrights, with 
an opportunity, and even with a demand for 
Irish drama that could not but put them to 
work, is Mr. Weygandt's excuse, if one were 
needed, for beginning where he does. In suc- 
ceeding chapters dealing with Mr. Yeats and 
Lady Gregory, Mr. Edward Martyn and Mr. 
George Moore, the four founders of the Abbey 
Theatre ; with Mr. George W. Russell ( A. E."), 
who shares with Dr. Douglas Hyde the honor of 
having inspired the Celtic revival ; with John 
Millington Synge, in Mr. Weygandt's opinion 
" the greatest dramatist in English that our stage 
has known in a century"; with the younger 
dramatists, Messrs. Colum, Boyle, Robinson, 
Mayne, and the rest ; and finally with William 
Sharp, friend of Mr. Yeats and "A. E.," writer 
for the Irish stage, and chief commentator in 
the English reviews on the work of the Irish 
writers : in the course of these studies there is 
drawn an increasingly clearer picture of the 
movement. Relationships are explained, plays 
are sketched, ideals developed, purposes made 



plain. And all this is done with enthusiasm 
tempered by a discriminating judgment trained 
by the study of drama in many languages and 
of many schools. 

Possessing sympathy and fine feeling, Mr. 
Weygandt is naturally able to express his crit- 
ical estimates in a fashion to make them ap- 
peal strongly. Apropos of a meeting with Mr. 
Yeats at Lady Gregory's hospitable country- 
house, he writes thus of the poet of " the Other 
World": 

" There is a side of Irish life, the side the world 
knows best, that Mr. Yeats does not present, but that 
which he does present is true, though the poet's per- 
sonality is so dominant that we get more of this than 
of Ireland in his poetry. So it should be, so it is with 
every artist. All the world can ask of him is his inter- 
pretation of what he knows. Yet so native is Mr. 
5Teats that the atmosphere of his poetry is the very 
atmosphere of Ireland. The artist and the setting of 
his art are in an unwonted harmony. No reader of 
Mr. Yeats who knows the brooding landscape of West 
Ireland can escape that realization, but only he who has 
met the poet amid the scenes that inspired his verse 
may know how complete is their accord. Such a meet- 
ing was mine one lowering August day, in whose late 
afternoon we walked in the Woods of Coole. Then I 
knew at last what Mr. Yeats meant by ' druid charm ' 
and ' druid light.' I felt the < druid charm ' that was 
potent in gray skies over gray water and gray rock and 
gray-green woods ; the bewildering ' druid light ' flashed 
out as the sun followed westward the trail to Hy Brasil, 
leaving in the Atlantic skies wild after-glow of winter 
yellow." 

And thus, with fine discrimination, does he 
sum up the wild, erratic genius of the poet- 
playwright Synge: 

" The freshness and audacity of his imagination, and 
the beautiful extravagance of his speech, a speech 
modulated to a rhythm that Synge was the first to catch, 
are in themselves enough to give distinction to almost 
any subject. There was granted Synge more than this, 
however, a keenness of vision into the pathetic hu- 
manity of ugly things and a power to realize this with 
a beauty that was granted to no one before, though to 
Swift it was granted to see the ugliness as a bitter thing. 
Borrow had, indeed, a glimpse now and then of the 
pathetic beauty there is in ugliness, . . . and Whitman, 
too ; but no man before Synge had the power at once to 
see the ugly subject as beautiful from a new angle of 
vision, humanize it, irradiate it with a new glow of 
imagination, reveal it through a style that for the first 
time ennobles English prose drama as blank verse has 
long ennobled English verse drama." * 

Mr. Weygandt has put us deeply in his debt 
for a study of the Irish plays at once exact and 
interesting, dramatic and carefully proportioned. 
Lovers of Irish mysticism and lyric poetry will 
find his point of view, notably upon Synge, 
" Fiona Macleod," and Messrs. Yeats and Rus- 
sell, broad enough to include much that, while 
contributing indirectly to the poetic feeling that

gives grandeur to the Irish drama, still would 
lie outside a narrower and slighter conception 
of the subject. Mr. Weygandt's essays belong 
to the vital literary output of the year.

A REALISTIC PROGRAMME AND 
PLATFORM.* 



The temper of the speculative science of the 
latter half of the nineteenth century was marked 
by nothing so much, perhaps, as by the qualities 
of caution and of humility. Concerning the 
primacies and ultimacies of existence it bowed 
its head and said, " Agnosco." To it the " real " 
was the "unknowable," and its unknowable 
shapes were unknowably protean. Nothing, 
again, is so striking in the temper of the specu- 
lative religion of the same period as its caution 
and humility. Concerning the ultimacies and 
primacies of existence, it contented itself with 
*' I believe." Its attitude was assumptive and 
positive where that of science was skeptical 
and negative, its sentiment fideistic where that 
of science was agnostic. Dogmatism had gone 
from both, and seemed to have gone forever. 
Speculative thinking had acquired an unpre- 
cedented lability, attributable chiefly to the 
victorious confirmation of Darwinism and the 
entry of " evolution " into the commonsense and 
the vocabulary of the daily life. 

Darwinism carried within itself, however, the 
embryo of a renewed dogmatism. Regarding 
all things from the standpoint of natural selec- 
tion and the struggle for survival, it inevitably 
implied that intellect and thinking are a biolog- 
ical function having for aim the survival of the 
thinker, and that consequently intellection is 
merely derivative, secondary, symbolic, while 
those aspects of our nature which are biologically 
prior, which are non-reflective, are more akin 
to the stuff and inward go of reality, and hence 
more able to apprehend it. This hypothesis got 
considerable confirmation from the experimen- 
tation in biology and the psychological analysis 
in religion which ensued close upon the fading 
of the war of words. They made prominent 
two points. First, that living matter seemed 
to contain something altogether refractory to 
laboratory methods and elusive to scientific anal- 
ysis. Second, that religious experience seemed 

*THE NEW REALISM. Cooperative Studies in Phi- 
losophy. By Edwin B. Holt, (Walter T. Marvin, William 
Peppernell Montague, Ralph Barton Perry, Walter B.

to reveal something altogether refractory to the 
methods of psychological experimentation and 
the logic of science. In both, this refractory 
something seemed to be a thing potent to deter- 
mine the nature and constitution of what was 
amenable ; in both it seemed a thing fluid, fleet- 
ing, always escaping thought, and somehow so 
altering what did not escape as to vitiate all of 
thought's conclusions concerning that. Intui- 
tion, will, whatever acts, could touch it; intel- 
lect never. 

Events like these are clearly not calculated 
to keep speculative religion humble in belief. 
Science fails, it boasted triumphantly, science 
fails again and again. Thought cannot tell. 
It is a mean thing, surely nothing more than 
ancilla vitce. And in my deeps, my religious 
experiences, my operations and intuitions, there 
is no thought, there is the very reality itself in 
all its effulgent bliss and power. I need no 
longer be confined to belief. I have a way of 
knowing. I do know, and knowing, I am saved 
forever. 

From ancilla vitce to ancilla theologies is 
but a change of words : for is not God always 
described as the source of life and love, their 
very substance and efficacy ? and the change of 
words is easily and fluidly made. The outcome 
of the change is the dominant systematic phil- 
osophies of the present day. Vary as these may 
in background, personal flavor, and literary 
character, they are unanimous in the vitalistic 
criticism of science and intellect and the dog- 
matic assertion of a saving "spiritual force" 
knowable in non-intellectual ways. The modern- 
isms of both Protestant and Catholic theology, 
the obscurantistic sentimentalism of Eucken,the 
somewhat transcendental evolutionism of Berg- 
son, are all at one in these matters, however else 
they may differ otherwise. 

The apparent shortcomings of science in biol- 
ogy and the psychology of religious experience 
were, however, more than balanced by her aston- 
ishingly rich positive results in mathematics 
and in the " new " psychology, fields of enormous 
philosophic interest. The latter succeeded in 
analyzing experimentally into objective rela- 
tions of space, time, and motion even so purely 
"subjective" and psychological entities as sec- 
ondary qualities like color and so on. The 
former became experimental and empirical, even 
with respect to arithmetical systems, and pro- 
ceeded to reconstruct the great continua of space 
and time, the complexities of causality, of 
motion, and promises to reconstruct organic 
existence out of simpler and simpler elements,

ultimately, out of instants of time ancTpoints of 
space, with the relations between them. Neither 
the achievements of psychology nor of mathe- 
matics were so easy of accomplishment nor so 
unanimous as the critical analyses of the biologiz- 
ing and religionistic tempers. The mathema- 
ticians are divided into two schools intuitionists 
and formalists, and it is only for the formalists 
that the reconstruction of reality from mathe- 
matical entities is an assured and real thing. 
And psychologists are far from agreed on the 
"independent" reality of secondary qualities, 
and on the identity of their underlying constitu- 
tions with the elements of space and of time. 

A new scientific dogmatism, consequently, 
which should confront the new theological dog- 
matism, had of necessity to be somewhat slower 
in getting under way than its opponent. For 
one thing, its task is harder : for its task is that 
of constructive analysis, whereas religionistic 
dogmatism has primarily that of destructive 
criticism. For another, it is compelled to pay 
close attention to the course of experience and 
to exhibit the harmony of its reconstructions 
with every detail of experience, whereas its 
opponent need and does merely attach the epi- 
thet "appearance" to experience, and then 
apply to its own desiderated dogmas the eulo- 
gium of "reality." However, slow as the new 
scientific dogmatism was in coming, it is here at 
last. And it is here in the shape of this co- 
operative philosophical enterprise, " The New 
Realism." 

The essays herein brought together are un- 
even in stylistic quality and philosophic value, 
varying as they do from the clumsy, redundant, 
inaccurate, and question-begging rehashing of 
mathematical commonplaces by Mr. Spaulding 
to the incisive, epigrammatic, and somewhat 
bad-tempered though highly original contribu- 
tion on the reality of illusions and hallucinations 
by Mr. Holt. But the book as a whole repre- 
sents a systematically developed body of doc- 
trine, which is perhaps the most significant 
philosophic utterance in the English-speaking 
world since the publication of William James's 
"Pragmatism." It marks the fact that the 
cohorts have gathered again, that the dogmas 
of sentimentalism are again confronted by the 
dogmas of intellectualism, and that the era of 
agnosticism in science, even as the era of mere 
belief in religion, is at an end. Again men are 
assured they know. The truce is over and the 
immemorial war between sentiment and sense 
is on again. 

The book therefore is not only a citadel of 



intellectualism, it is an attack as well. Its nov- 
elty, which lies there, consists rather in the radi- 
cal use it makes of its doctrines than in these 
doctrines as such. Its most interesting hypoth- 
esis that of the reality of illusions, of secondary 
qualities is common to all materialisms. It is 
a commonplace of the Epicurean systems, and 
Lucretius devotes the major part of Book IV., 
in " De Rerum Natura " to a demonstration of 
this reality. Hobbes offers analogous arguments 
both in the " Leviathan " and " De Corpore." 
The " New Realism " differs from these older 
materialisms in its sources rather than its con- 
clusions. Like these, it is synchronous with 
changes in mathematical methods and dis- 
coveries ; and, like them, it is enamoured of 
mathematical rigor in demonstration that reality 
can be analyzed into mathematical elements 
and can be reconstructed from those elements. 
It asserts, indeed, as did Spinoza, that all exist- 
ence can be treated in mathematical terms, and 
when it has cleared away the objections of the 
enemy will proceed to do so. 

New Realism offers itself first as a polemic. 
To it, the whole philosophic doctrine of the 
opposition is vitiated by one or more fallacies 
the fallacy of believing that because you must 
be aware of the thing you know, your knowing 
the thing creates it ; the fallacy of supposing a 
thing to be simple when it really is n't or may 
not be ; the fallacy of supposing that a thing 
can have only one character at a time, so that 
T. R. cannot be a father and an American citi- 
zen at the same time ; the fallacy of assuming 
that the beginning of a thing determines its 
nature ; the fallacy of supposing that there must 
be an all-inclusive something, in which all things 
are united ; the fallacy of verbal suggestion, ap- 
pearing in such terms as "Eternal,'" "infinite," 
"highest," " Unity"; the fallacy of attributing 
importance to a thing which does n't really 
have it. 

To avoid these fallacies common to all philos- 
ophies, neo-realism proposes the scrupulous use 
of words, the most careful definition of the 
terms it uses, rigorous analysis, regard for logi- 
cal form ; particularly, division of the question, 
and the formulation of all points of explicit 
agreement among philosophers. It proposes, 
furthermore, "the separation of philosophical 
research from the study of the history of phil- 
osophy." Neo-realism proposes, in a word, 
mathematical rigor in method. It suggests the 
starting-point of a new scholasticism, the 
scholasticism of science. As such, it offers 
itself as a common platform to the special 



1913]

sciences, as a coordinator, synthesizer, and gen- 
eralizer of them, in a real world metaphysically 
plural in which cognition has the role of an ex- 
ternal relation of the organizer to an independ- 
ent environment ; in which, that is, knowledge 
does not constitute or alter the nature of what 
is known. 

" The world is of an articulate structure that is 
revealed by analysis, consisting of complexes, like 
bodies, persons, and societies as well as of simples. 
The simple constituents of the world comprise both 
sensible qualities and logical constants. Both enter 
into the tissue of fact, and both possess an inherent 
and inalienable character of their own. There is no 
safe refuge from this conclusion in the abandonment of 
intellectual rigor. Hence all speculative versions of 
the world that require the withholding of analysis, or 
that depend on the unique and preeminent status of the 
act of cognition, must be rejected, no matter how eagerly 
they may be desired for the justification of faith. They 
must be rejected in favor of such hypotheses as may be 
formulated in terms of the evident composition of the 
known world, and verified by its actual interrelations, 
history, and trend." 

The book consists from here on of an elabor- 
ation of this dogma. Inasmuch as epistemology 
is the stronghold of the idealistic conception of 
the world, Mr. Walter T. Marvin shows that 
metaphysics is independent of epistemology. 
Since, in epistemology, the argument for ideal- 
ism turns on the conception that the things we 
know depend for their existence on our knowing 
them, it becomes needful to demonstrate that 
being known and being dependent are not the 
same, and that conversely being known is a case 
of " independence." This makes needful a defi- 
nition of independence, which Mr. Kalph Bart- 
on Perry supplies, not altogether successfully. 
Since the new dogmatic sentimentalism bases 
so much of its construction on the criticism of 
intellect and analysis, there is needful a defense 
of analysis. This is made by Mr. Edward 
Gleason Spaulding, but it is error to think that 
analysis is any better off when he is done. With 
Mr. Spaulding's work the road is cleared, and 
the constructive papers begin. The first, by 
Mr. William Peppernell Montague, offers a 
"realistic theory of truth and error" unusually 
like Spinoza's, and unusually out of sympathy 
with the conceptions of his comrades of the book. 
Then follow Mr. Edwin B. Holt's papers on the 
place of illusory experience in a realistic world, 
and Mr. Walter B. Pitkin's paper on "Some 
Realistic Implications of Biology." Both are 
hard and too compact, but they are well worth 
the effort of reading. The upshot of their keen 
analyses is the mathematization of the universe, 
but it has still to be shown that a universe 
aboriginally through and through mathematical 



is not quite as wonderful a piece of imagination 
as a universe aboriginally through and through 
psychological. And there is some advantage 
in being able to build on facts instead of being 
compelled to deny them.

THE GENESIS OF ENGLISH CHIVALRY.* 

Chivalry as a living force in modern civiliza- 
tion, as a guide to conduct, and as an inspiration 
to nobler conceptions of human duty is the theme 
of Professor Schofield's new volume, which is 
an amplification of lectures delivered at the Sor- 
bonne and at the University of Copenhagen. In 
his Introduction the author says : 

" My object in these lectures is to show, if I can, by 
an examination of the life and works of four celebrated 
English writers, how the ideal of French chivalry entered 
into English literature and thereby affected the attitude 
of the English-speaking world. ... I shall endeavour, 
in sum, to indicate the genesis of the idea conveyed by 
the English word gentleman,' with all that it suggests 



in our use. 



Much enthusiasm will be awakened by the 
sensitive and high-minded way in which Professor 
Schofield has illuminated certain of the ideals 
of chivalry, and has indicated their share in 
forming the ethical standards of a race famous 
for courage and honor. Sketching briefly the 
essential details of biography, he proceeds to 
point out the specific illustrations of chivalric 
ideals in the work of Chaucer, Malory, Spenser, 
and Shakespeare, and to phrase each author's 
peculiarly individual attitude towards mediaeval 
chivalry. 

There is something pleasantly paradoxical in 
this spectacle of an American defining to a 
French audience the way in which the English 
race has refined and polished French ideals. 
Comparative literature is fast breaking down 
our preconceived notions about sharply-defined 
racial differences of imagination, and we are 
emerging from our bigoted belief in instinctive 
national virtues; yet there is danger that we 
may be led astray by apostles who discover too 
many resemblances and too much consanguinity 
in interpreting a theme. This, in some degree, 
is a fault of Professor Schofield's book, for he 
fails to do justice, in his study of chivalry, to 
those qualities which are derived not from French 
but from Germanic sources. He says, quite

specifically (p. 272): "In Northern heathen- 
dom, warriors were sturdy, but they believed in 
brag; they were straightforward, but given to 
ferocity; to them revenge was a duty, and sweet." 
Was Roland free from brag, were Arthur and 
Launcelot and Gawain free from ferocity, was 
revenge a duty to Charlemagne after Roland's 
death? Surely a dispassionate reader will find 
in Beowulf a courtesy, a graciousness, a love of 
truth and steadfastness as noble as in any French 
knight. The German stock does not yield to 
the French in stability of purpose, in grim deter- 
mination and perseverance, and we will not cede 
to the French complete domination over our 
ideals of "Trouthe and honour, fredom and 
curteisye." It must be remembered that the 
words trouthe and fredom (generosity) are 
Saxon by derivation, by inheritance, and by 
loyal service. 

The essay on Chaucer seems the most satis- 
factory, partly because Chaucer is closer to the 
mediaeval world, and partly because it is less 
difficult to choose the significant aspects of his 
work. The account of Chaucer's life and the 
exposition of his spiritual development are ex- 
cellent, for here are classified many traits in 
Chaucer which have hitherto been treated ob- 
scurely. Special note should be taken of Pro- 
fessor Schofield's observations upon the French 
source of Chaucer's description of the knight. 
This is a contribution to Chaucerian scholarship 
that will not soon be forgotten. 

Next in order of importance is the account of 
Spenser, for here the mood of the Renaissance 
is interpreted very eagerly and appealingly by 
the author, who "through infusion sweet" is 
quick to appreciate the philosophy of the poet. 
Genuine admiration and scholarly understand- 
ing characterize this study of Spenser. 

To Malory and to Shakespeare the author 
has not given as significant treatment as to the 
other two writers, and in these discussions 
appears a flaw in his presentation of chivalry. 
No true conception of the mediaeval knight can 
ignore the part which warfare occupied in his 
life. In serving his God, his lord, and his 
lady, he had, perforce, to do battle, furious and 
bloody. The chevalier was a warrior, and in 
Spenser's "Faerie Queene" we read again and 
again how 

" He stroke, he soust, he foynd, he hewd, he lasht." 
Our modern repugnance to war cannot excuse 
us from placing a proper emphasis upon this 
crude and bloody element in mediaeval chivalry. 
The beauty of Malory's book lies very largely 
in his pictures of the brilliant pageantry of 



battle, where struggling, baffled, yearning 
knights blunder along their mortal pathway and 
slowly learn that spiritual strength was his "who 
only overcame himself." The militant note in 
chivalry should be more strongly emphasized, 
for the warring and crusading strength of the 
knight has been a high ideal to many a modern 
Englishman who has scorned to sit in noble 
contemplation while there were wrongs to be 
righted by action. 

In the essay on Shakespeare it is unavoid- 
able that there should be unevenness, and that 
topics should be merely touched upon rather 
than developed adequately. While there is 
much that is true and suggestive in the study 
of Shakespeare's conception of honor, and in the 
account of his presentation of love from the 
chivalric point of view, it seems as if Professor 
Schofield conveys an impression of far deeper 
obligation than Shakespeare ever owed to chiv- 
alry. Could any foreigner, hearing this account, 
doubt that Shakespeare was essentially imita- 
tive? It is because Shakespeare so supremely 
exceeded his traditions and his reading, because 
he went so profoundly to the original heart of 
things, that it is unfair to trace his conceptions 
of honor and of love back to knightly codes. 
If he does use the diction associated with chiv- 
alry, he is not indebted to that for his ideals. 
From Plutarch and from Homer, as well as 
from French chivalry, did Shakespeare derive 
ideals of honor and of noble loyal love, but his 
own imaginative penetration was the formative 
element in his philosophy of true gentility. 
Either less should be said about chivalry or 
more about his original and distinctive outlook, 
if we are to have a right opinion of Shakespeare's 
philosophy of honor.

WOMAN AND THE SOCIOLOGISTS.* 

Twenty-five years ago, when sociology was in 
its infancy, great were the victories predicted 
for the " new science " when it should achieve 
maturity. Taking the field of sociology at large, 
this prediction will doubtless be accomplished. 
But in so far as the woman question is concerned,

gives the reader pause. In other sciences the 
body of fact is larger, the liberty of personal 
interpretation on important points much less. 
This should work out to enrich the reference 
and text books on this subject; what really 
happens is that they tend to become a little 
dry and erratic, this tendency being obviously 
limited in accordance with the insight, depth of 
nature, and extent of experience of the individ- 
ual author. You cannot write conclusively or 
acceptably, for the mature mind, about woman's 
place in the social order without these three 
qualifications. It is rare that the academic 
sociologist possesses them all in over-flowing 
measure, and yet he needs them greatly. He 
lias in his hands a most powerful lever affecting 
human action. It will not matter very much in 
after-life if the college-student should accept 
unsound doctrine in physics or geology or even 
biology, but if he accepts it in sociology it may 
matter greatly. It is perhaps for the best that 
youth grows less docile under instruction in these 
latter days ! 

Sociological speculation is probably as desir- 
able as it is inevitable, but it is equally desirable 
that there should be some line of demarcation 
in teaching between the body of facts common 
to all in the profession, and the purely personal 
interpretation of them. One finds illustrations 
of individual bias even in the most open-minded 
writers. " The Woman in Modern Society," 
'by Professor Earl Barnes, is lucid, cautious, 
and sane beyond the wont of such studies, but 
the author regards the modern family as one of 
our institutional forms much in need of revision. 
Though he is as far as possible from irrational 
denunciation of any of civilization's existing 
moulds, he seems to think that marriage as it is 
must eventually go to the scrap-heap. He is 
especially opposed to any sacramental theory of 
marriage, regarding this as entirely a church- 
made product resting upon theological dogma. 
The young person studying these pages would 
never guess that the Church did not "make 
marriage a sacrament " by arbitrary fiat, but, 
instead, acknowledged openly a secret human 
belief whose roots run down to the core of being. 
Such beliefs may change their names or their 
forms, but they do not pass away. They remain 
to be reckoned with while civilizations rise and 
fall, and sociologists needs must reckon with 
them. 

Mr. and Mrs. Nearing's " Woman and Social 
Progress" is simply and clearly written, as for 
beginners in thinking. It discusses in lively 
fashion the influences that have shaped the 



American woman, with especial reference to 
the breadth of her present opportunities and her 
best use of them. Young readers will find it 
sincere and helpful, especially in the chapters 
dealing with woman's opportunity through eu- 
genics, education, domesticity , and philanthropy. 
The authors wisely recognize that a woman's 
best work will be done with the grain of her 
tastes and characteristics rather than against it ; 
but the older reader wonders how they harmonize 
the sweeping statement that "some industrial 
occupation is necessary" for several classes, in- 
cluding all girls between school and marriage, 
for all young wives and all middle-aged women, 
with the just stress they lay upon the creation 
of atmosphere in the home. For atmosphere is 
not a work of art, once created and forever en- 
during ; it is a laboratory product that must be 
distilled daily, and while woman can, and does, do 
most things excellently well to-day, she cannot in 
one life-time do all things and do them well. 

The author of "Why Women Are So" 
adopts as a working hypothesis the theory that 
"the characteristic behavior called feminine" is 
an attitude of mind produced by coercive social 
habits of the past. She deals especially with 
the women of the nineteenth century, finding 
that they were for the most part what men 
expected them to be, their foibles being due 
to sex-tradition rather than sex-characteristics. 
This hypothesis is much more reasonable than 
the method Professor Coolidge takes to prove 
it. The first half of her book is very amusing, 
but hardly susceptible of verification. She 
assumes a typical woman of sixty years ago, re- 
creating from the pages of "Godey's Ladies' 
Book" and the "Books of Beauty" a frail, 
ignorant, silly, would-be genteel little person. 
She compares this invention, not with the 
hobble-skirted, heavy-hatted bridge-fiend of 
the last decade, but with the finest twentieth- 
century type imaginable, and then belabors the 
poor creature, her virtues, habits, education, 
clothes, all that is hers, until the reader revolts. 
Surely the author must, even now, meet many 
of the still-surviving nineteenth-century women 
of the better class. Few younger matrons have 
the force, wit, intelligence, and the curious depth 
of personality to be found in hundreds of the 
dames now between seventy and ninety-five. 
With all the modern girl's fine qualities, her 
opportunities are too numerous to profit by, 
and, as compared with her grandmother, she 
sometimes lacks depth and exhibits egotism. 
Nevertheless, it would be most unfair to re- 
construct her, some sixty years hence, from

our current fashion plates and Mr. Harrison 
Fisher's pretty but soulless pictures. When 
Professor Coolidge abandons the attack on this 
mid- Victorian Frankenstein and begins to fore- 
cast the future, her observations, which are 
always entertaining, become at once judicious 
and as sound as it is possible to be upon a 
subject so little permitting dogmatism as the 
coming woman. 

The gist of the lay reader's complaint against 
current sociology, when dealing with woman, is 
that it lacks insight into many elemental con- 
cepts of human nature and many long-established 
standards of worth ; that it loses sight of all but 
economic values, and is pragmatic in the de- 
based sense of demanding that woman's work 
for society be such as can be appraised in dollars. 
Just in so far as it does these things, it becomes 
arid and unprofitable. Few writers make all 
of these mistakes, and some make none of them. 
The author of " Woman's Share in Social Cul- 
ture " has achieved the feat of becoming a soci- 
ologist and remaining exquisitely reasonable and 
human. The book has atmosphere, perspective, 
human interest ; it is full of stimulus to thought 
and of an admirable justice and right-mindedness. 
To the sanity and lucidity so necessary in such 
studies, the author unites a keen sense of the 
eternal values. We have a right to demand this 
latter quality in work which cannot be broadly- 
based without it, yet thus far sociological writers 
have met that demand but meagrely.

SHAKESPEARE'S SPOILED CHILD.* 



. " There is no drama, as all the world knows, upon 
which so much has been written as Shakespeare's 
' Hamlet.' Quick-witted heads (Herr Rotscher's ex- 
cepted) have all had their say about it. After all sorts 
of fashions, lofty, profound, radical, superficial, polished, 
crude, desultory (Herr Rotscher's lucubrations not ex- 
cepted), it has been aestheticised about, romanced about, 
dogmatized about, bemastered, berated, cut up, quibbled 
at, be-Hegeled, and be-Rotschered. A critical tower of 
Babel of amazing height and breadth has been reared, 
and for the same purpose as in the Scripture : to scale 
celestial heights, and, as the people see, with the same 
result. The celestial heights remain unsealed." 

These words, in German, were written in 1846. 
Since then, "as all the world knows" and 
sometimes wishes it didn't "Hamlet" criti- 
cism has not stood still. But the celestial heights 
still remain unsealed. And if the author of our 
quotation could have known the reception a later

generation was to give to the Werder lectures, 
published in 1875, he might have disapproved 
the connection of his name with Werder's as 
heralding a solution of the problem, he might 
have disclaimed scaling any heights himself, and 
have suggested that Werder had missed his foot- 
ing by proving too much in the concluding lec- 
ture of his course, where, with characteristic 
vigor in animating the minutest incidents of a 
scene, the inquiry is implied whether the revenge 
of the Ghost is accomplished after all, whether 
the minds of the assembled court know, or even 
suspect, the existence of a ghost, the murder of 
a king, the minds that delay the revenge, ac- 
cording to the Werder argument; or whether, 
in the minds of the court, and perhaps the 
twentieth century audience of the play, the re- 
venge of the Queen prompts Hamlet to actions 
or whether the King's real object with the 
poisoned cup and the envenomed point excite ; 
a revenge in Hamlet easier understood by the 
audience for whom the play was written an 
audience among whom duels were honorable and 
ghosts able to execute their own commands. 

In any event, the Werder theory has re- 
ceived more adherents than any that have gone 
before. And certainly the vigor and terseness of 
Werder's style, in connection with the eloquence 
inspired by the rapture of his "discovery," have 
had the effect of rejuvenating a literary interest 
in the play. Werder aroused the combative 
spirits. Professor Bradley's work, published in 
1905, took issue with the Werderites, and since 
then the Werder stock has been falling, while 
a new crop of Hamlet theories is materializing. 
Mr. Arthur Stringer has discovered Hamlet's 
malady to be Shakespeare's neurasthenia; and 
Dr. Ernest Jones has discovered it to be some- 
thing worse, or better, according to your appre- 
hension of his theory ("The CEdipus-Complex 
as an Explanation of Hamlet's Mystery: A 
Study in Motive," by Ernest Jones, M.D., 
"American Journal of Psychology," January, 
1910). Not being a physician, I must leave 
Mr. Stringer to Dr. Jones, and Dr. Jones to 
his fellow-practitioners. 

Mr. Venable's theory has been proclaimed 
as original, and certainly it is more intelligible 
to a layman than some of greater pretensions. 
That theory, briefly, is of a mystery within 
Hamlet, as well as in his external difficulties. 
Mr. Venable presents Hamlet as a reflex of our- 
selves, reflecting experiences in an inner world 
that are common among all human beings of 
every age and clime. Here are Mr. Venable's 
own words: 



1913.] 



THE DIAL, 



343 



" In view of the breadth of the author's design in this 
tragdy and the organic relation of the central person 
to that design, one conclusion is unavoidable : that since 
Hamlet, in the many-sidedness of his character, may be 
said to typify mankind, representing, as it were, the 
universal human, his internal struggle must be typical 
and representative." 

This theory does not, however, in its main 
outline, differ materially from that propounded 
in 1888 by Mr. Martin W. Cooke, and answered 
in 1910 by Mr. Robert Russell Benedict ("The 
Mystery of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," Lip- 
pincott), who maintained that "Hamlet is plainly 
not a type, but one individual," for 

" Shakespeare shows in all his other plays his interest 
in and knowledge of the individual, and it is this inter- 
est and knowledge, together with his poetic imagination, 
that have given us that gallery of human portraits which 
we recognize at a glance, and linger to study and enjoy. 
Nothing is more improbable, nor impossible, than that 
he should, or could, have entirely changed his mental 
habit and method of work in writing Hamlet." 

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Mr. 
Venable's eloquent treatment of his subject is 
the importance he gives the soliloquies as rep- 
resenting Shakespeare's method of shedding 
light upon the progressive action of the drama. 
He represents these soliloquies as expressions 
in gradation "from immature to mature man- 
hood, a mental and spiritual ripening." At the 
opening of the play, Hamlet is a "blown youth" 
the inference of Mr. Venable being that he 
is considerably younger than at the close of the 
play, where the capricious text is accepted that 
suggests Hamlet has reached the mature age of 
thirty. It seems to me that in some of the earlier 
passages, notably in the scene with the Ghost, 
and in the scene where he unmasks his school- 
fellows, the Prince has the poise of a seer, is 
rich in experience, acumen, and wisdom. The 
scene in Ophelia's grave is excused by some as 
an outburst of youthful passion. While there 
is anything but mature mind here, the scene 
may be a concession by Shakespeare -to the 
Elizabethan passion for personal combats, espe- 
cially when a woman's honor was involved. It 
was not needed for the advancing of the action. 
Laertes was already in a vengeful state. 

In any event, the soliloquies cannot be relied 
upon to explain away all the difficulties in the 
play. In passing, mention should be made of 
the doubt which the soliloquy in Act IV., Sc. 
iv., caused Shakespeare. It was dropped in the 
First Folio, and Professor Miles is entitled to 
more attention than he has received in what he 
has to say on the subject. In the words of Mr. 
Venable, his "Review of Hamlet" is a "sane 
appreciation" of the play. But Mr. Venable 



fails to mention this doubt, which it is perfectly 
clear Shakespeare had. 

With regard to the celebrated speech of 
"To be, or not to be," Mr. Benedict and Mr. 
Venable are far apart. Mr. Benedict can see 
nothing in the passage but a rhythm so perfect 
in wording that it "drugs the senses and lulls 
the reader into a repose that neither doubts nor 
questions." It is incoherent in argument, and 
a dramatic discord in the play. Mr. Venable says 
nothing about its setting, but is impressed with 
its implication "typifying a universal human 
experience." 

Mr. Venable's and Mr. Benedict's essays 
should be read together. They help each other 
by their opposite methods of treatment. Each 
whets an interest in the play. Each writer is 
charmed with this child of Shakespeare's brain. 
Perhaps the play cannot be spoiled so long as 
the critics use the rod only on each other.

THE LUBE OF THE LAST WEST.* 

If there were any doubt as to the widespread 
interest in Western Canada, it would be dispelled by 
a glance at the publishers' announcements. Hardly 
a month goes by without one or more new books on 
some phase of life in the country east and west of 
the Canadian Rockies that vast region of prairie, 
foothill, and mountain, fertile valley and primeval 
forest, product of Nature's most opulent mood. Of 
five such books lately issued, the first describes a 
series of expeditions into the mountain region be- 
tween the Kicking Horse Pass and the headwaters 
of the Fraser River; the second gives an account 
of an adventurous trip from Edmonton through the 
Yellowhead Pass, up the Fraser River, by Giscome 
portage to the Parsnip, down that stream to the 
Peace, through the mountains again to Fort Vermil- 
lion, north to the Hay River, and down that almost 
unexplored river to the magnificent Alexandra Falls ; 
the third deals largely with northern British Colum- 
bia, that immense district, the resources of which 
are on the point of being opened up by two new 
Canadian transcontinental railways, the Grand 
Trunk Pacific and Canadian Northern ; the fourth

takes us to the extreme western limits of the country 
the almost unknown islands of the north Pacific 
coast; while the last describes a journey down the 
Mackenzie River to Fort McPherson and up the 
Yukon to Dawson City. 

In an entertaining volume of some 350 pages, 
Mr. Stanley Washburn describes his adventures in 
the Canadian Rockies, between the years 1897 and 
1909. During this period he made some half-dozen 
trips into the mountains, at first confessedly as a 
" tenderfoot," afterward as a more or less experienced 
traveller. Sometimes with pack-trains, sometimes 
with canoe, he wandered far and wide throughout 
the lofty borderland between Alberta and British 
Columbia, camping by unknown rivers, or at the 
foot of towering, unnamed peaks, hunting mountain 
sheep and smaller game, or filling his kettle with 
fish from the clear, cold waters of some mountain 
stream. The book has the defects as well as the 
advantages of a gossipy, discursive narrative; but 
through it all runs the compelling charm of the 
wilderness, of days and nights beneath the stars, of 
misty mountain peaks, dancing streams, and the 
whispered music of the pines, of the trail that leads 
you know not whither, of unforgetable glimpses of 
Nature's fairyland, of the camp-fire, the evening 
pipe, and the yarns of hunter and trapper. And 
with it all is much practical comment on railway 
building, grades through the mountains, and the 
coming era of development in the new country to 
which the Yellowhead Pass is the gateway. Much, 
too, gleaned from old trappers and pioneers, of the 
vanishing days of the fur-trade, when Jasper House 
and Boat Encampment and the Tete Jaune Cache 
were familiar names, and the all-powerful H. B. C. 
ruled over an almost continental empire. That six 
summers in the mountains have not weakened the 
influence of the wilderness, would appear from Mr. 
Washburn's concluding words. "If all goes well," 
he says, "by the time these pages reach the printer's 
hands, Fred Stephens [the well-known mountain 
guide] and myself will be well down the turbulent 
waters of the old Fraser, poking into the lair of cer- 
tain grizzly bears that he knows about, with the roar 
of the river, unlocked from winter's grasp, as our 
lullaby while we sleep with the blue canopy of heaven 
overhead and a foot of pine needles for our couch." 

Mr. Hulbert Footner modestly disclaims his fit- 
ness to describe the " New Rivers of the North " 
which form the subject of his narrative. " It needs," 
he says, "a geologist, a botanist and a poet to do 
them justice." It is conceivable that such a combin- 
ation might not be an altogether happy one ; and on 
the whole one may safely prefer this bird in the hand 
to three perhaps discordant birds in the bush. Mr. 
Footner is the sort of travelling companion any sane 
man would choose, in preference to a geologist, a 
botanist, or even to a poet if one may say it with- 
out seeming offensive to those learned and ornamen- 
tal members of society. He is an ideal companion 
to travel with through the pages of his book, and, 
from what one sees of him there, it is equally safe 



to say that he would be an ideal companion for any 
man on such an expedition as he so entertainingly 
describes. His narrative is instinct with the pure 
joy of the wanderer in wild places. At every bend 
of the river he makes you share the unalloyed delight 
of the traveller who knows not what may lie beyond 
that bend : what fascinating vista of mountain or 
meadow or unspoiled woodland ; what blood-stirring 
glimpse of approaching rapid or waterfall ; what 
bewildering labyrinth of islands, or lost channels, 
or elusive portage. He does not attempt to gloss the 
discomforts of such a journey : the inevitable rainy 
days, the accidents that must sometimes happen to 
canoe or tent or provisions, the inquisitive black fly 
and the industrious mosquito ; but he makes one feel 
that with good health, an even temper, and the saving 
gift of humor, even the deadly " galley-nipper " may 
be endured, for the sake of the many things that are 
worth while in such an expedition. The earlier part 
of Mr. Footner's journey was over waterways which, 
although unfamiliar to most of us, were not altogether 
untravelled. When, however, he reached the banks 
of the Hay River, he was almost in unexplored ter- 
ritory. Bishop Bompas had descended the river in 
1872 and discovered the falls ; and twenty-six years 
afterward a three-man outfit, bound for the Klon- 
dike, had passed the same way. In 1887, R. G. 
McConnell, of the Canadian Geological Survey, had 
surveyed the river from its mouth up to the falls, 
but not beyond. Provisions ran short on the long 
journey down the Hay, the season was getting late, 
and Mr. Footner had almost despaired of reaching 
the goal of his ambition, Alexandra Falls, when, at 
the last moment, he came upon it unexpectedly. One 
shares his enthusiasm as he stands at the brink, where 
the great river " steps off into space." 

"After the invariable flatness and tameness of all the 
country above, this sudden cleft in the world impressed one 
stunningly. It had the same dramatic effect as the passion 
of a quiet man. I can only compare it to Niagara on a 
smaller scale, but Niagara as it must have burst on La 
Salle's eyes, sans tourist-hotels, power-houses, and railway 
bridges. Its charm was in its insolent wildness." 

Mr. Footner secured a number of remarkable photo- 
graphs of the falls, and these and many others taken 
elsewhere along his route add materially to the value 
of his volume. 

Mr. Joseph Adams's book might be described as 
the narrative of an attempt to get off the beaten 
track in Canada. That he was successful in his 
attempt, his book bears witness. From French 
River in the east to the Skeena Valley in the west, 
this indefatigable and wide-awake English traveller 
made his way into many comparatively unfamiliar 
parts of the Dominion, noting everything that a man 
of very catholic tastes could find interesting. And as 
it was necessary in order to reach the more remote 
corners of the country to pass through the Eastern 
Provinces, as well as the rapidly growing and ambi- 
tious cities of the western prairies, Mr. Adams 
improved the opportunity by studying the social, 
industrial, and political life of the people as he went 
along. His book is, in fact, something of an ency-

clopaedia of present-day Canada, written from the 
point of view of a sympathetic and fair-minded 
observer. If it has a fault, it is in the attempt to 
crowd too many topics, too many varieties of topics, 
into a 300-page volume. The reader is bewildered 
with the kaleidoscopic changes from Canadian 
scenery to Jesuit missions, politics, scientific angling, 
cooperative labor, natural history, folklore, agricul- 
ture, transcontinental railways, education, million- 
aires, chinook winds, horse breeding, irrigation, 
suffragettes, and the cost of living. On the whole, 
however, the book is well worth reading, and no part 
of it more so than the very clear and interesting 
chapter on Northern British Columbia, or New Cale- 
donia, the tremendous and varied resources of which 
are even to-day only beginning to be realized. 

Those who recall Mr. Charles Sheldon's "Wilder- 
ness of the Upper Yukon " will need no recommend- 
ation of this companion volume, "The Wilderness 
of the North Pacific Coast." If anything, the last 
book is even better than the first. Mr. Sheldon now 
takes us with him while he hunts wapiti on Vancouver 
Island, the huge bear of Montague Island, and his 
brother of Admiralty Island, and the elusive caribou 
of the Queen Charlotte Islands. But while a keen 
sportsman and scientist, he is something more, as the 
following passage will witness : 

"All winter my thoughts had turned toward Montague 
Island and its bears. Now the trip was accomplished and 
past. But all the incidents and experiences of it still linger 
with me. The beautiful, calm ocean voyage ; the village of 
Nuchek and its natives ; the snow-bound Zaikof Bay, where 
the air vibrated musically to the echoing voices of the water- 
fowl, where sweet bird notes sounded from the woods and the 
exquisite little humming-bird darted about my camp ; the 
east coast, rock and reef bound, bordered by white breakers 
and dotted far out from shore by foam from the sea surging 
over the reefs; the high, rugged snow-capped mountain 
ranges ; the hilly woods, resplendent glades, deep canyons, 
gorges, and dashing cascades ; the rumble of sliding snow 
in the mountain-girdled basins overlooking the ocean below ; 
the violent storms, and gloomy, blank days passed in the 
inhospitable barra-barras ; the irresponsible natives; the 
joyous fulfilment of spring in the wilderness." 

Here, again, one must feel grateful for the many 
excellent photographic illustrations that help so 
materially to keep the reader in intimate touch with 
Mr. Sheldon's narrative. 

In the year 1906, Mr. Elihu Stewart, as Super- 
intendent of Forestry for the Dominion of Canada, 
made a journey on behalf of the government down 
the Mackenzie River to Fort McPherson, and by 
way of the Porcupine to the Yukon and Dawson 
City. His official report is a valuable public docu- 
ment, and contains a great deal of very important 
material on the timber and other resources of the 
immense region through which he travelled ; but in 
the very nature of things, he had to omit from that 
report many interesting details of his journey, re- 
lating to the country and its native and occasional 
civilized inhabitants. These details he has brought 
together in his volume entitled "Down the Mac- 
kenzie and Up the Yukon." With the addition of 
some thirty photographic illustrations, for the most 



part taken by himself, Mr. Stewart has succeeded in 
producing a very readable book, and one that adds 
something of value to the scanty literature of this 
remote region. One incident may very well suggest 
the quality of the book. On the outer edges of civili- 
zation, before one actually jumps off into the land 
of the Indian and fur-trader, there are certain very 
primitive and uncomfortable inns called "sleeping 
places." Says Mr. Stewart: 

" I had the honour of occupying a place on a wide bed 
made on the floor of one of these road houses. Among the 
company were Bishop Young of Athabaska Landing, the 
late Bishop Holmes, then Archdeacon of Lesser Slave Lake, 
a Roman Catholic priest from Peace River, and several half 
breeds. Bishop Young and I agreed to ' double up ' under 
the same blankets, while the Archdeacon and Pere Lazaret 
made the same arrangement. After each of the men of 
Holy Orders had offered up his evening devotions in his own 
forms, the priest and the archdeacon, who were neighbours 
in the mission field, commenced a conversation, not in the 
native language of either, but in Cree. There was no affec- 
tation in this. Father Lazaret was of course familiar with 
French but knew very little English, while the archdeacon 
was not particularly fluent in French; but a common ground 
of communication was found in the tongue of the Cree Indian 
in which both were equally at home."

BRIEFS oiv NEW BOOKS. 

During the last twenty years, the 

fnmanv^ands. amovmt f S od work that has b 

done in the domain of art history, by 
the systematic and well-regulated labors of trained 
explorers and excavators, is truly enormous. Even 
the last half-dozen years have revealed some thirty 
palaeolithic picture-galleries, as well as much sculp- 
ture of the same period. Through these, we have 
learned that the origins of art are much more remote 
than formerly they were supposed to be; also, that 
even in these remote periods, there were traces of 
varying phases, sometimes spasmodic develop- 
ment, sometimes stagnation, sometimes retrogres- 
sion. Reports of these "finds" have been issued 
from time to time, mainly through technical bulletins 
or journals. Few, except specialists, perhaps have 
realized either the amount or the value of the new 
knowledge. Some general and connected narrative 
has been much needed. Hence, " The Childhood of 
Art" (Putnam), by Dr. H. G. Spearing, M.A., of 
Queen's College, Oxford, is a book to command 
attention. It is, in fact, so fully up to date that it 
makes more or less note of everything thus far 
published and of some things so new as to be yet 
unpublished. The geologist, the archaeologist, the 
ethnologist will each find something in his own field ; 
and all will be especially grateful for the 482 repro- 
ductions in black and white and the sixteen color 
plates, some of which now appear for the first time. 
The sub-title of the book is "The Ascent of Man," 
and this subject is traced from prehistoric times to 
the beginnings of Greek Art. But the volume is 
far from being merely a technical work. The style

THE DIAL 



[April 16 



is so vivid, the treatment so picturesque, that the 
narrative is as entertaining as it is enlightening. 
The cave men painted or carved, not as we do for 
decoration or diversion, but mainly for the sake of 
creating fetiches or charms, thinking thus to gain 
some mysterious power over the objects represented. 
Clean, firm, unhesitating strokes were distinctive of 
palaeolithic artists; they were mighty hunters as well 
as close observers of wild animals ; they drew neither 
from life nor from models, but from memory. 
Although the cave man must have had a hard time 
fighting for his existence, he managed to exercise 
his faculties of perception and memory and to create 
works of art that are far superior to any by the 
modern savage. What became of the palaeolithic 
man with his acute artistic perception and his simple 
manner of life, no one knows. The centre of artistic 
interest shifts next to Africa and Siberia; later to 
Egypt, Chaldea, Crete, and Greece. In each case, 
the stimulus to artistic effort was given by impulses 
wholly unconnected with any desire for works of art. 
Palaeolithic man evolved his art from a desire to have 
control over the forces of nature; the Asiatic from 
a desire to display his control over his fellow-men; 
the Egyptian from a desire to secure a dwelling- 
place for his spirit after death; the Greek from a 
desire to secure the earthly presence of his gods. 
Yet in all the Yvistory of art, there is no single in- 
stance of an artistic race going forth to conquer. 
Strange paradox of fate! The bearers of the light 
are doomed to death, and yet the light survives and 
glows. 

A scientist's ^ ne heterogeneous collection of essays 
discussion of and addresses by Sir Oliver Lodge 
varied subjects, brought together under the title, 
"Modern Problems" (George H. Doran Co.), may 
seem to some readers a mere jungle of "shoes and 
ships and sealing-wax." Still, it well deserves the 
dignity of the name "book"; for, according to the 
definition of Ruskin (whom Sir Oliver so delights 
to quote), it is "a wise man's work honestly and 
benevolently done." Through the apparent mis- 
cellaneity there is evident the unity of a great and 
sympathetic man's mind ; from the successive flashes 
on this and that subject, a reader soon learns to 
locate and revere the writer. The range of theme 
is truly amazing. It is doubtful whether any other 
recent writer in an age of specialization has shown so 
many clear-cut facets to his thinking, or approached 
so many fields with a like preparation and adequacy. 
Here one finds philosophy (" Balfour and Bergson "), 
science ("The Nature of Time"), literary criticism 
("The Responsibility of Authors"), sociology ("The 
Position of Women" and "Some Social Reforms"), 
economics ("The Functions of Money"), and ethics 
("The Pursuit of Wealth"). The author's sphere, 
so far as manifested in this book, is not creative in 
any field; there is nothing here that is altogether 
new. But there is a wealth of luminous illustration 
and a delightful lucidity and sanity of interpreting 
power. The discussion of the old fallacies of mo- 



tion, Zeno's and others, in "The Nature of Time" 
will be found good. This essay, together with 
"Balfour and Bergson," reprinted from "The Hib- 
bert Journal," "The Responsibility of Authors," an 
address delivered before the Society of Authors in 
1909, and "The Pursuit of Wealth," an address to 
Evening Students at Liverpool given in 1886, are 
among the most valuable pieces. Space will not 
permit of quotation, though many passages would 
richly merit notice for style as well as substance. 
Admirers of Professor William James will find 
numerous evidences of stylistic as well as intellec- 
tual kinship between these two great contemporary 
men of science and letters. Perhaps there appears 
more of the indulgent patriarch in these essays than 
in the writings of the American, but there is never- 
theless the same charm of intellectual camaraderie. 



Four months' on a United States battleship, 

outing with the even in the piping times of peace, is 
Atlantic Fleet. no ^ d ev oid of ever-varying interest 
and excitement, as is made evident by Mr. Robert 
W. Neeser's report of his four months' sojourn on 
the " Kansas " during a practice cruise of the Atlan- 
tic Fleet in Cuban waters. " A Landsman's Log " 
(Yale University Press) tells the story of his experi- 
ences, describing minutely and realistically the daily 
routine, the various drills and inspections, the spec- 
tacular and awe-inspiring gun-practice, the recrea- 
tions and holiday diversions of the sailors, and other 
things little known except to those who go down to 
the sea in ships of war. An early conversation with 
the Navigator of the " Kansas " left the author be- 
wildered by the variety of his new knowledge and 
unable to retain it all. " But one thing that I do 
remember," he says, " perhaps because it was the 
easiest thing to comprehend, was that part of his 
[the Navigator's] special duties that related to his 
position as librarian of the ship. And then I found 
out what a splendid collection of books, works on 
geography, history, professional subjects, travel, 
fiction and general literature, is at the disposal of 
every officer and enlisted man on board Uncle Sam's 
ships wherever they may be. . . . The American 
Navy was the first to institute the custom, and the 
first ship's library was placed on the old ship-of-the- 
line Franklin in the early twenties. Few agencies 
in recent years have done more to raise the tone of 
the enlisted men in the service, to improve their 
standards of character and efficiency, and to add 
to their contentment, than these well-selected libra- 
ries which are now placed on board our ships. Scores 
of men may daily be seen, scattered about the decks 
during the idle hours that necessarily do occur even 
in the busy life of a modern man-of-war, reading, 
or with pencil and paper working on some problem." 
Twenty-six pages of naval statistics and other related 
information follow the narrative. Some of these 
items might need correction to bring them up to date, 
as for example the average annual cost of main- 
taining a battleship, which is given as $682,517.18, 
including repairs, whereas later figures, if we mis-

take not, make it considerably more than eight 
hundred thousand dollars. At any rate, it is sure 
to reach the million-dollar mark in the super- 
dreadnaught of the near future. Many excellent 
views, mostly from the author's own camera, heighten 
the attractiveness of his volume. 



. . It is no doubt worth while, from 

social progress time to time, to attempt a survey of 
in Europe. ^ ne soc i a l achievements of the imme- 

diate past. What the nineteenth century accom- 
plished, in the way of social amelioration, will 
suggest what the twentieth century may be able to 
accomplish. Of such surveys we have already a 
considerable number; we need more of them, how- 
ever, and therefore welcome Professor Frederic 
Austin Ogg's little volume, " Social Progress in Con- 
temporary Europe" (Macmillan). One who attempts 
to cover the whole social movement in Europe 
through a century of rapid change is necessarily 
forced either to select carefully the topics for treat- 
ment, or to describe events in the barest outline. 
The latter is the alternative chosen by Professor 
Ogg. As a consequence his book reads like a 
chronicle, rather than like a history. The reader 
is inclined to put it aside as a manual for reference. 
Yet if one does read it from cover to cover, the final 
impression is inspiring. All these old institutions 
destroyed and all these new institutions created 
through the unfolding of a single vital impulse, the 
democratic movement, the realization of the aspira- 
tions of the common man ! Such at any rate is the 
philosophic basis of Professor Ogg's work. Other 
social philosophers will raise the question whether 
the social changes of the last century may properly 
be regarded as the unfolding of a single social force. 
The early nineteenth century gave us liberalism; 
the end of the century gave us social democracy. 
Are not the two principles essentially antagonistic? 
One who believes this to be true will read not 
without impatience a book which sums up under the 
caption "social progress" all movements, whether 
in the direction of liberalism or in the direction of 
social democracy. Social insurance is not progress, 
from the liberal point of view. Free trade is not 
progress, from the social democratic point of view. 
Nor is progress from the one point of view purely 
negative from the other. Accordingly it is an open 
question whether social historians can profitably 
treat of social progress at all, whether they would 
not best confine themselves to the more modest task 
of describing social change. 

The breezy American style of Mr. 
.* U ' Higinbotham's " Three 
Weeks in France " (Reilly & Britton 
Co. ) makes the book diverting from cover to cover. 
That its humor should repeatedly remind one of 
Mark Twain will, we hope, be taken by the author 
as a compliment. " There are two towns in Monaco," 
says Mr. Higinbotham, " Monaco proper and Monte 
Carlo which is not." " The American away from 



home," we read, "behaves worse than when at 
home. The Parisian does not. He cannot. He 
has not the facilities." "At Nhnes, with a cupola 
over the 'i,' we found an up-to-date hotel with an 
electric-lighted room and a bathtub resembling a 
small natatorium." A little later in his description 
of the same place, the author says, with rare con- 
sideration for the printer: "I will not mention the 
name of the town with great frequency for fear of 
running out of ' i ' shades, but you will remember 
where we are." The book, with its twenty-three 
chapters of rapid comment and description and 
anecdote, and no single page or paragraph devoted 
to Paris, proves very conclusively, if proof were 
wanted, that there is a France, and one well worth 
visiting, apart from the gay metropolis. It is a 
book that may induce readers to go and convince 
themselves of this truth by actual experience. 
" Equipped as she is with excellent railroads, com- 
fortable hotels, magnificent scenery and centers of 
historical interest, she [France] is a model host that 
all the world might copy to great advantage and 
profit. Whatever is worth doing, is, to France, 
worth doing well." Good illustrations from photo- 
graphs accompany the reading matter, but their 
lavish profusion is paraded neither on the title-page 
nor in any table of contents. 



Records of doubtless be refreshing to 

the English many readers, in these revolutionary 
house-wife. days, to turn from the teeming rec- 
ords of suffragist discussion and activities to such 
a book as Miss Rose M. Bradley 's "The English 
Housewife in the 17th and 18th Centuries " (Long- 
mans). Here, at least, one finds the old household 
gods firmly fixed in their old places. At the very 
outset, on the title-page, stands a text from that chap- 
ter of Proverbs from which our great-grandmothers 
chose the verses corresponding to their birthdays, 
embroidered them on their samplers, and founded 
their lives upon the precepts they embodied. A 
good portent this, and in the following pages it is 
easy to trace King Solomon's impress on the hearts 
of the long line of house-wives who have kept faith 
from Tudor days, through the varying fortunes of 
the reigns of the Stuarts with the chill interreg- 
num of the Commonwealth to the larger oppor- 
tunities of Georgian days. Much gossip, it is true, 
enlivens Miss Bradley's chapters, but there is also 
an abiding sense of honest scholarship in the patience 
with which old letters, old diaries, old cookery books, 
and old ledgers have been studied, and made to yield 
so much that is valuable as well as interesting. It 
was not an easy thing to rule the household province 
over which the lady the loaf giver of the past 
was set. Her duty it was to see to the spinning 
and weaving of the flax and wool, which furnished 
the bedding and napery for her great family ; hers 
to keep the plate and pewter ; to oversee the cooking 
and the labors of the still-room. She it was who 
must see that her servants were fittingly clad; as 
well as that her sons went to the wars, her daughters

to their bridals, and herself and her lord to the pleas- 
ures of the town and court in seemly comfort and 
splendor. She had the ordering of orchard and 
garden and herh-beds, of poultry-yard, of dairy, and 
often of the preserving of game. Upon her shoulders 
were laid the care of the aged, and the medication 
of the ill; and all the gentle graces of hospitality 
must be at the tips of her capable fingers. Some- 
times she had a long purse at her command, some- 
times but a short one; but throughout her story, 
shifting from generation to generation, one is always 
conscious of the basic qualities of devotion to duty, 
of regard for position, and of a sincere wish to be 
helpful and gracious. Several illustrations from old 
sources add to the interest of Miss Bradley's enter- 
taining volume. 

A cruise to the The awe and mystery of the wide 
tropics in a ocean and the nameless terrors of the 
tramp steamer.. <jense tropical forest are just suffi- 
ciently felt by the reader of "The Sea and the 
Jungle" (Button) to make him glad to take on trust 
the somewhat rough experiences therein described, 
and to leave to the author, Mr. H. M. Tomlinson, 
the actual encounter with the varied hardships and 
dangers through which he seems to have a happy 
faculty for making his way unharmed. From Swan- 
sea to South America, up the Amazon and far up the 
Madeira River, in the tramp steamer " Capella," 
Mr. Tomlinson made his adventurous way, and some- 
what in the manner of Mr. Joseph Conrad he tells 
his story, interweaving as he proceeds the yarns spun 
on shipboard by one and another of his mates. The 
voyage into that density of luxuriant tropical growth 
appears to have been undertaken to ascertain the 
feasibility of opening a route for freight boats in con- 
nection with a new railway line projected by some 
daring capitalists, and having its location near the 
boundary line between Brazil and Bolivia. Para, " a 
flat congestion of white buildings and red roofs in 
the .sun," is touched at on the way, and is made the 
subject of a good descriptive passage. The captain 
of the "Capella" is an interesting character with 
an almost superstitious aversion to talking about 
" getting there," as if such talk invited disaster. 
" He laughed from his mouth only, throwing his 
head back, showing surprisingly perfect teeth, and 
laughter did not change the crystalline glitter of his 
eyes." Portions of the book have already found 
acceptance in various leading periodicals. 

Wordsworth as " The histor y of Wordsworth's mental 
poet of nature and spiritual unfolding" is usually 
and poet o/ man. more interesting to the student than 
consideration of his style, and it is this former aspect 
that Professor Elias Hershey Sneath considers in his 
volume entitled " Wordsworth, Poet of Nature and 
Poet of Man" (Ginn). The French critic, M. 
Legouis, has already admirably covered this field as 
far as the early life of Wordsworth is concerned; 
and in his treatment of the same period Professor 
Sneath does not vary much from his predecessor, as 
he readily admits by frequent quotation and refer- 



ence. Naturally the Frenchman pays considerably 
more attention to the influence of the Revolution, 
and to the personal contact of the poet with Beaupuy 
(who is mentioned only once in the volume under 
review and that quite casually) than does the Amer- 
ican. For all spiritual biographies of Wordsworth, 
" The Prelude " is, of course, the ultimate source ; 
and Professor Sneath uses it on every page, espe- 
cially for those years of the poet's development when 
he was tried in the fire and not found wanting. The 
more familiar poems are also used to furnish forth 
a conception of Wordsworth's teaching about man 
and nature, especial attention being given to the 
great " Ode " and " The Excursion." The poet is 
made his own interpreter, by means not only of the 
poems but also of the critical prefaces and letters, 
so that one is enabled to study him at first hand. 
While it can hardly be said that we have in this 
volume a distinctive contribution to Wordsworth 
scholarship, we have nevertheless a sympathetic pre- 
sentation, from the point of view of the student of 
philosophy, revealing Wordsworth as the poet of our 
common humanity, as one who has realized the joy 
that comes through suffering. 

TWO opposite The Druggie between paganism and 
tendencies idealism, a strife that some writers 

in literature. cnO ose to speak of as the conflict 
between Hellenism and Hebraism, serves as the 
main theme of "Among Famous Books" (Doran), 
by John Kelman, D.D. English authors are mainly 
chosen for treatment in illustration of these two con- 
trary tendencies, though the opening chapter is de- 
voted to the gods of Greece, and the third contrasts 
Goethe's "Faust" with Marlowe's "Dr. Faustus." 
Bunyan, Pepys, Carlyle, Pater, the late Francis 
Thompson, and a number of living English writers, 
give matter for comment and discussion in the re- 
maining eight papers or lectures for as such they 
were originally prepared and delivered of this at- 
tractive volume. In his assertion that Pater "does 
not force himself upon his readers, nor tempt even 
the most susceptible to imitate him," the author 
ignores the parodies and the imitations that "Marius 
the Epicurean " and other productions of the same 
pen have actually evoked; but he well says that 
"unless a man's style is absolutely offensive, which 
Pater's emphatically is not, it is a wise rule to accept 
it rather as a revelation of the man than as a chance 
for saying clever things." There is much excellent 
reading in Dr. Kelman's book, and perhaps it is all 
the more enjoyable if one does not try too hard to 
separate the paganism from the idealism in the 
authors discussed. We are all partly pagans and 

partly idealists. .

The Italian as Bagot > g little book on The Italians

ularly to refute the widely circulated calumnies upon 
the Italian army in its late conflict with Turkey.

THE DIAL

Mr. Bagot has lived long in Italy, and has learned 
to know the people as few foreigners ever take the 
trouble to do. His earlier volume, " My Italian 
Year," made this evident; and his present work reit- 
erates things there said, and adds new ones. Begin- 
ning near the bottom, he describes first the peasant, 
then the artisan, after that the professional classes, 
and continues with chapters on "Government and 
Aristocracy," "Church and State," and "The Ital- 
ian Soldier." A short chapter on "Modern Italian 
Literature" calls attention to foreign ignorance of 
all but a very few present-day Italian authors, those 
few having enjoyed the advantage of wide advertise- 
ment without being necessarily the best or the most 
representative of their class. What Mr. Bagot has 
to say on anti-Italian calumnies is uttered with 
warmth and in a persuasive manner. The proba- 
bility undoubtedly is that he is better informed than 
were the English and other newspapers that first 
printed these accounts of alleged discreditable pro- 
ceedings on the part of the Italian government and 
the Italian army. The book is highly readable and 
leaves an impression of fair-mindedness and first- 
hand knowledge. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. Alfred W. Benn's " History of Modern Philos- 
ophy " (Putnam) is a manual of modest dimensions, 
written in the lucid and distinguished manner which we 
expect from the author. Mechanically, the book makes 
the fatal mistake of exchanging the portraits of Hegel 
and Schopenhauer, which has certainly made the latter 
philosopher turn in his grave. 

Messrs. Hinds, Noble, & Eldredge publish a volume 
which will be peculiarly acceptable to high-school stu- 
dents who are interested in debating. It is entitled 
Both Sides of 100 Public Questions Briefly Debated," 
and has been compiled by Messrs. E D. Shurter and 
C. C. Taylor. The subjects are all questions of the day, 
and the references, although adequate for high-school 
purposes, are not overwhelming in quantity. 

The American Book Co. are publishing a series of 
" Masterpieces of the English Drama," under the gen- 
eral editorship of Professor Felix E. Schelling. Each 
volume includes four or five plays, and the following 
three have appeared : Marlowe, by Professor W. L. 
Phelps, Webster and Tourneur, by Professor Ashley H. 
Thorndike, and Beaumont and Fletcher, by Professor 
Schelling. The collection bids fair to become an 
American " Mermaid Series." 

" Alphonsus Emperor of Germany " is an Elizabethan 
play which was published in 1654. Professor Herford 
characterizes it as " a crude and sanguinary travesty of 
an imperial election dispute in which the chief interest 
attaches to a wholly mythical love affair." The play is 
attributed, uncertainly, to Chapman, whose name is on 
the title-page. Mr. Herbert F. Schwarz has edited a 
facsimile reprint of the work, which is now published 
by Messrs G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

The second series of " Famous Speeches," selected 
and edited by Mr. Herbert Paul, comes from Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. The addresses included are 
representative specimens of modern and contemporary 



oratory, and reveal to the student of public speaking 
(for whom the collection is intended) the constantly 
widening of scope and subject matter in the eloquence 
of to-day, the comparative concentration and use of facts 
and reasons in modern addresses, as well as the gradual 
development of oratory in accordance with traditions 
and ideals of the past. 

The inexperienced author will find in Mr. R. D. 
Blackman's "Composition and Style" (Edinburgh: 
John Grant) a serviceable manual dealing with the use 
of correct English as well as with the general details 
of printing and publishing. Since the first edition 
appeared, several years ago, numerous handbooks 
similar in character have been issued from time to time ; 
but the clearness and explicitness with which it sets 
forth rules of best usage, with free use of illustration, 
will maintain for Mr. Blackman's manual a permanent 
place among books with rival claims. 

In "Childhoodin Art" (Chicago : Altrua Art Library), 
Mrs. John B. Sherwood aims to summarize briefly a 
few of the best-known pictures of children, representing 
the work of artists since the time of the Renaissance to 
the present day. Numerous illustrations accompany 
her sympathetic descriptions, and convey in part the 
evanescent spirit of childhood which only a limited num- 
ber of the world's great artists have caught successfully. 
The small volume also contains a list of over one hun- 
dred paintings of children, with the name of the artist

In " A Handbook of Norse Mythology," Mr. A. 
Clinton Crowell has made a translation from the Danish 
of Karl Mortensen's popular handbook of the myths and 
sagas of the North, long in use for the study of Norse 
mythology in the schools of all the Scandinavian coun- 
tries. The author traces in his introduction the general 
outlines of Norse mythology,contrastingits more sombre 
aspects with the brighter myths of the Greeks. The 
stories are told in a clear and vivid style, and a chapter 
on the hero sagas poetic representations of life mid- 
way between myth and history concludes the volume, 
which is published by Thomas Y. Crowell Co. 

"The Family: An Historical and Social Study," by 
Dr. Charles Franklin Thwing and Carrie F. Butler 
Thwing, is reissued in revised and enlarged form by 
Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co. Since 1885, when the 
book was first published, the demand for it as a college 
text-book in sociology has steadily increased, carrying 
with it in recent years a parallel demand for bringing 
its figures and statistics down to date, as has been done 
in the present volume. Tested by several years of use, 
the soundness and permanency of its historical parts in 
particular are generally accepted; the chapters devoted 
to sociological study have been rewritten in the light of 
the results of recent social investigations. 

Mr. Le Roy Jeffers, of the Circulation Department 
of the New York Public Library, has prepared a second 
and revised edition of his useful " List of Economic 
Editions " (of well-known books), which the Publishing 
Board of the American Library Association issues in a 
32-page pamphlet. The editions named are not to be 
regarded as in all instances desirable, except for inex- 
pensiveness, and this is clearly stated in the Introduc- 
tion. If it were practicable, in any future revision of 
the work, to indicate such editions as are both cheap 
and otherwise desirable, especially in the matter of 
durability, the usefulness of the list to libraries and 
individuals forced to study economy would be increased.

tation from Carlo Gozzi; Mr. Jerome K. Jerome's " The

It is good news that "Cymbeline," in the "New Vari- 
orum " edition, is now in press and will be published 
in the early summer by Messrs. Lippincott. " Julius 
Caesar," the seventeenth volume of the set and the third 
play edited by Mr. Horace Howard Furness, Jr., is 
appearing this month. 

All persons possessing letters of the late Clara Barton 
are earnestly requested to send them to Mr. Stephen E. 
Barton, 85 Water Street, Boston, Mass., for use in con- 
nection with the preparation of the authorized biography 
of Miss Barton. All letters sent will be carefully handled, 
copied, and originals will be promptly returned to the 
owners. 

The important " Cambridge History of India," re- 
cently announced in these pages, will be published in this 
country by the Macmillan Co. It is planned now to pub- 
lish the first volume of the history, which is to be com- 
plete in six volumes, within a year, the remaining instal- 
ments to appear subsequently in chronological order at 
regular intervals of six months. 

A notable series of books on the social evil, prepared 
under the auspices of the Bureau of Social Hygiene, of 
which Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., is the chairman, 
will be published by the Century Co. The first volume 
of the series, " Commercialized Prostitution in New York 
City," by Mr. George J. Kneeland, is now in press, and 
will appear in May. This will be followed in the early

Abraham Flexner. Other volumes will be announced 
later. 

Among the books on Messrs. Holt's spring list which 
have not previously been announced in these pages are 
the following: "On Ten Further Plays of Shakespeare," 
by Dr. Stopford A. Brooke; "The World Soul," by Mr.

Lady Scott, the widow of Captain Scott, has tele- 
graphed from New Zealand that her husband's journal 
is in her possession " excellent and complete." The 
journal will be published in London by Messrs. Smith, 
Elder & Co., in its entirety, while the " Strand Maga- 
zine" will print two or perhaps three preliminary 
articles. No arrangements have yet been announced 
regarding American publication. 

"The Letters, Speeches, and Correspondence of Carl 
Schurz," which will appear this month under the imprint 
of Messrs. Putnam, has been prepared for publication 
under the general auspices of the Carl Schurz Memorial 
Committee, which was formed in 1906. The work, 
complete in six volumes, has been in the hands of a 
sub-committee, of which Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard 
has been chairman, and the editing has been done by 
Mr. Frederic Bancroft. 

Mr. Everard Meynell, a son of Mr. Wilfred Meynelb 
has now nearly finished the " Life of Francis Thompson' 
upon which he has been engaged for several years. It 
is based on unpublished letters, fragments of diaries* 
the reminiscences of friends, and other trustworthy 
sources of information. The collected edition of 
Thompson's verse and prose, edited by Mr. Wilfrid 
Meynell, will be published immediately in three vol- 
umes. A large amount of hitherto unpublished 
material will appear in this edition. 

Mr. Bernard Shaw, as we learn from the London 
" Nation," has in hand the interesting task of complet- 
ing perhaps the best of his earlier works, " The Quintes- 
sence of Ibsenism." The earlier book was written before 
the appearance of " John Gabriel Borkman," " Little 
Eyolf," " The Master Builder," and " When We Dead 
Awaken," all plays of great beauty and significance, 
and marking a separate period of Ibsen's dramatic 
method and critical thought. These works, Mr. Shaw 
insists with some truth, are treatments of dead people 
of men and women who have done something, but whose 
life-work is finished when as yet the death of the body 
is remote a numerous and worthy class in this country 
and elsewhere. Mr. Shaw also proposes to describe the 
changes in dramatic technique which Ibsen introduced 
and developed in the series of realistic plays beginning 
with " The Doll's House." 

Edward Dowden, the Shakespearean scholar and for 
over forty-five years professor of English literature 
in the University of Dublin, died in that city on the 
4th of this month. He was born at Cork in 1843, and 
received his education at Queen's College, Cork, and 
Trinity College, Dublin. In 1888 he was elected 
President of the English Goethe Society, succeeding 
Max Miiller; and has held honorary positions in several 
other literary or educational organizations. His pub- 
lished works are numerous, and cover a wide field of 
literature. Besides " Shakspere : His Mind and Art," 
the " Shakspere Primer," and his editions of the 
Sonnets and individual Shakespearean plays, he wrote 
" Studies in Literature," " Southey," " Life of Shelley," 
"Transcripts and Studies," "New Studies in Literature," 
" The French Revolution and English Literature," " A 
History of French Literature," " Puritan and Anglican," 
"Robert Browning," "Michel de Montaigne," "Essays: 
Modern and Elizabethan," a volume of original verse, 
and editions of several modern poets.

A Synthetic Philosophy of Ontology 
By WILLIAM ELLSWORTH HERMANCE 

$2.50 net. By mail, $2.75. 

The author's conceptions are Idealistic in theory, 
Materialistic in fact, Dualistic in energy, and Mon- 
istic in being. His contentions in many cases run 
counter to the more orthodox school of philosophy 
and give the reader an opportunity to pass upon the 
validity of some of the more common theories that 
are held to-day.

JULIUS CAESAR 

Edited by HORACE HOWARD FURNESS, Jr. 

Being the Seventeenth Volume of a NEW VARIORUM EDITION of the 
WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 

Royal Svo. Cloth. Gilt top. Uncut edges. $4.00 net. Half Morocco. Gilt top. Uncui edges. $5.00 net 

The publication of a new volume of the Variorum Edition is always an event in the literary world and 
it is therefore with pleasure that we announce the completion of the Seventeenth volume. 

The preparation of the new Variorum Edition of the Works of Shakespeare was the life work of Dr. 
Horace Howard Furness, who is acknowledged to have been the world's greatest authority on Shakespeare. 

For many years he was assisted by his son, Horace Howard Furness, Jr., who has contributed two 
volumes to the set Richard the Third, and a revised edition of Macbeth. The publication of these volumes 
demonstrated the wisdom of Dr. Furness in associating his son with this invaluable work so stupendous as to 
be beyond the ability of a lifetime to complete. 

To Horace Howard Furness, Jr., now falls the task of editing the remaining plays. This important work 
will, therefore, be continued along the same lines laid down by Dr. Horace Howard Furness.

The Story of My Boyhood and Youth 

By JOHN MUIR 

IN "MY BOYHOOD AND YOUTH," John Muir begins the long and eagerly awaited story of his unique life. 
Born in Scotland and brought at an early age to the Wisconsin Wilderness, educated in a Western University 
during the time of its picturesque beginnings, Mr. Muir's boyhood was varied and full of interesting and 
characteristic adventures. He tells the story with the vividness and absorbing interest that readers of his books well 
know and with the added fascination of autobiographical narrative that should give this volume an even wider public. 
" This is one of the autobiographies that will live long and be ever new." Pittsburgh Gazette-Times. 

"There is nature in it, of course, and plenty of human nature, too. Mr. Muir gives his reminiscences in happy fashion, and the 
interest in the narrative, early aroused, suffers no check." Newark News. 

" Every page is fascinating and its quaint beauty is thrilling." Lexington (Ky.) Herald. 

" To this book belongs a singular charm, the charm of brilliant, adventurous, and wholesome boyhood boyhood spent among the 
at forests and broad plains of a land that had not yet learned the weary lesson of civilization." New York Times.

The Fall of the Dutch Republic 

By HENDRIK WILLEM VAN LOON 

"The book delights me. It is eminently readable. But its 
bluff honesty, its insight, its humor, its bold perspective, its keen 
sense of what a modern reader (and, above all, an American 
reader) can care to know, and withal the whimsical but high- 
souled companionable personality of its author, give it qualities 
higher than readableness." Professor George L. Burr of Cornell

By LIEUTENANT WAGNER 

"The book is excellent. Herr Wagner was brought up to the 
Balkan languages. He knows the country well, has studied war, 
and by some influence or other has obtained a good deal of special 
information. His accounts of the Bulgarian people, their 
history, character, objects, leading men, and generals, are

The True Story of the Tragic Death of Rudolph, 
Crown Prince of Austria 



MY PAST 



Reminiscences of the Courts of Austria and of Bavaria 

By the COUNTESS MARIE LARISCH, nee Baroness Von Wallersee, Daughter of, Duke Ludwig of Bavaria 

and Niece of the Late Empress Elizabeth of Austria. 

8vo. With twelve illustrations from original photographs. $3.50 net. By mail, $3.75. 
A more interesting volume of personal biography has rarely dropped into the midst of a jaded world, for it is not 
every day that the private lives of the members of Europe's royal families are viewed with the candid eyes of one 
who belongs to the inner circle of courtly exclusiveness. The royal tragedy in the death of Rudolph, Crown Prince 
of Austria, has caused much speculation and many futile guesses and attempts to solve it have been made. Like the 
identity of the Man with the Iron Mask, it has always been regarded as one of the mysteries of history that defied 
solution. But at last the one woman in possession of the facts has spoken, and the cogent and dramatic account she 
gives an account as unshakable in its veracity as the Rock of Gibraltar itself leaves no doubt as to the reason 
for the Prince's taking off. 



The Son of a Servant 

By AUGUST STRINDBERG 
Translated, and with Introduction, by CLAUD FIELD. 

I2mo. $1.25 net. By mail, $1.35. 
A powerful indictment, not only against parental 
tyranny, but against the ill-considered tuition which the 
child received at school, and the want of understanding 
on the part of the teachers to whom his up-bringing 
was entrusted. No one can understand Strindberg who 
has not read this powerful book.

Rambles and Observations in Central America 
during the Year 1912 

By GEORGE PALMER PUTNAM 

8vo. With nearly 100 illustrations. $2. SO net. 

By mail, $2.75. 

A very graphic, entertaining, and informing account of 
the Central American States of 1912. Through import- 
ant connections in the regions described, the author had 
exceptional opportunities for gaining an insight into 
many things that are denied the less favored observer. 
The result is a volume that leaves untouched no import- 
ant phase of the little-known countries visited.

8vo. $2.50 net. By mail. $2.75.

ious or political, and the mental and emotional make-up 
of the leaders of such movements, with very special and 
detailed consideration of the French Revolution.

THE MEANEST OF TAXES. 

The tariff bill now under consideration by 
Congress is, viewed as a whole, a rational 
embodiment of the pledges of the party which 
was given control of the administration for the 
express purpose of enacting such a measure, and, 
as such, offers cause for congratulation to those 
who understand the simple proposition that all 
forms of special privilege are undemocratic and 
inimical to the interests of the whole people. It 
makes a notable extension of the free list, and 
it reduces to reasonable proportions many rates 
of duty that have been swollen to outrageous 
figures by the gluttonous greed of the hogs that 
have been permitted to crowd about the tariff 
feeding-trough for many years past. But in the 
general chorus of approval that comes from the 
throats of all save the above-mentioned animals 
(whose grunts of dissatisfaction supply the har- 
mony with its basso ostinato), there is one dis- 
cordant strain of disgust and indignation that 
deserves a hearing, because it voices the disap- 
pointment of all educated men at the discovery 
that the tax on knowledge is to remain as a 
disgrace to our statute-book. 

President Wilson is so obviously and typically 
a representative of the scholarly class of our 
citizenship that it seems almost unbelievable 
that he should not have used his utmost influ- 
ence to secure the abolition of the import duty 
on books. When the measure at last found its 
way into print, we turned to it with the confi- 
dent expectation of finding that this obnoxious 
tax had been deleted, and found, to our amaze- 
ment, that it had merely been made the subject 
of a compromise that fifteen per cent had been 
substituted for the twenty-five per cent hitherto 
assessed. It is a case in which the principle is 
so much more important than the amount of the 
tax that we are unable to say "for this relief, 
much thanks," and must continue to protest 
against the new rate, as we have always pro- 
tested against the old one, as an intolerable 
exaction, as an expression of a spirit that gives 
the lie to all our boast of encouraging education, 
or of caring for the higher interests of civiliza- 
tion. When even the tax on art is no longer 
left to shame us in our own eyes and in the eyes 
of the enlightened part of the world, the far 
more atrocious tax on learning is, it seems, to 



364

be perpetuated. Our laws discriminate every- 
where, and quite properly, in favor of religious 
and mofral endeavor, in favor of the special 
claims of women and children to protection, in 
favor of charity and philanthropy, in favor of 
art and science and education, and here, in a 
violent contradiction of spirit, they still propose 
to discriminate against the cultivation of intel- 
ligence by putting an artificial difficulty in the 
way of the scholar who seeks to secure the pro- 
fessional tools of his trade. The physician, 
the clergyman, the engineer, the historian, the 
philologist, the poet, and all the others who 
constitute the class of our most desirable citi- 
zens must continue to be taxed by the national 
government upon the instruments necessary to 
their efficiency. It is surely a topsy-turvy civ- 
ilization in which such a thing is possible. 

The amount of the tax, it need hardly be 
urged, is not the question at issue. The real 
objection to the imposition is twofold, resting 
upon both theoretical and practical grounds. 
As a matter of principle, the tax is indefensible 
because it places a stigma upon forms of en- 
deavor that it is the duty of every civilized 
government to encourage. As a matter of 
practice, it makes it impossible for a scholar to 
send to London for a book that he needs, and 
have it brought to his house by the postman ; to 
obtain an English book that is dutiable is now 
a complicated enterprise that has to be care- 
fully planned out. It involves not only paying 
the few cents of the tax, but also the paying of 
various fees and a certain amount of vexatious 
correspondence. In the simplest case, when the 
victim is fortunate enough to live at a port of 
entry, it involves an interview with the collector 
of customs, and a possible altercation as to the 
value of the book which the postal authorities 
have delivered up for duty. What it means to 
a scholar who lives in some town far removed 
from a custom-house, we can only conjecture, 
never having had his experience, but it prob- 
ably means that he will go without the desired 
book rather than suffer the many annoyances 
attendant upon getting it. 

And all for what? To the government, for an 
amount of revenue that is absolutely insignifi- 
cant, to say nothing of the moral cost at which 
it is secured, for an amount of revenue that is 
perhaps two per cent of that which the govern- 
ment renounces by putting sugar on the free list. 
To the American printer, for a remotely possible 
and minutely fractional reduction in the total 
of his type-setting. To the American publisher, 
for a problematical slight increase in the sale 



of the very few books that may be sufficiently 
similar to those desired from London to be pur- 
chased instead. And with every such sale, a 
burning indignation in the breast of the cus- 
tomer because he is forced to do with the 
makeshift. For it cannot be too emphatically 
pointed out that the taxation of English books 
does not, except in very rare instances, protect 
American publishers in the sense of enlarging 
the sales of their own publications. One book 
does not, as a general rule, compete with another, 
and the scholar who is thwarted in getting what 
he wants is not very likely to substitute for it 
something which he wants much less, if at all. 
And yet, every argument that is ever advanced 
in favor of the taxation of English books is 
advanced as ostensibly in the interest of the 
Treasury, the typographical union, or the Amer- 
ican publisher. Besides these, there is only the 
chauvinistic plea that all foreign ideas and pro- 
ducts (especially in thought and art) are under 
suspicion as corrupting to our robust Amer- 
icanism. But these arguments and pleas, mis- 
erable as they are, trivial, unworthy, and 
narrow-minded, have for many years burdened 
our intellectual life with what we have called 
the meanest of taxes, and seem likely to be 
allowed to continue so to burden it, unless the 
outcry against the tax shall acquire sufficient 
volume to force its way into the pachydermatous 
minds of our national law-makers, and awaken 
some glimmering consciousness of the unintelli- 
gence of their present determination in this vital 
matter of their attitude toward education, and 
scholarship, and spiritual enlightenment. 



OPEN MINDS: A TEXT FROM 
WILLIAM JAMES. 



William James's vigorous onslaughts on the closed 
systems of rationalism, together with his insistence 
on "pragmatic openness of mind," will very likely 
be remembered when the substance of his philosophy 
if one may disengage it from his attitude shall 
have been forgotten. Like Emerson, he will doubt- 
less be finally esteemed as a knight-errant of the 
human spirit, intent not on gathering his intellectual 
wealth within an imposing and impregnable fortress, 
but rather on freeing the aspirations of men and en- 
abling them to enjoy " a healthy-minded buoyancy" 
in the wide, open universe. In all his writings, I 
think there is nothing more typical of his attitude 
than this phrase: "and thereupon to come to a full 
stop intellectually." No land could be so fair that 
one might wisely linger in it; no reading of earth 
could be profitable if one read only a few chapters. 



1913]

Movement, to James, is the first essential of mental 
life and movement without a terminus. 

It must be added, though hardly in detraction, 
that in preaching eloquently the value of open- 
mindedness, James was not so much a prophet of the 
next age as a typical voice of his own our own 
time. The open mind is particularly abundant rather 
than particularly rare to-day. Dogma has perhaps 
never been so unpopular; written creeds are inter- 
preted with comfortable laxity, unwritten creeds are 
very fluid; few men can support a panacea for a 
lifetime ; in the arts, in criticism, one will seldom 
detect standards. "The bellyband of its universe," 
says James of rationalism, "must be tight"; but 
although a few of our philosophers may affect a 
tight bellyband when they dress up the universe, 
the age is for the most part shockingly negligie. 
We do not require that a man, in his acts and utter- 
ances, be consistent with his past; instead, we merely 
expect him to look toward the future. No one is re- 
spected so heartily as the man with the open mind. 

Now, it would be absurd to regard open-minded- 
ness as intrinsically more desirable than thick- 
headedness. Pragmatism, if nothing else, would 
quickly lead us to that conclusion. As every virtue 
has its defect if we let it sprawl, so to speak, open- 
mindedness may mean nothing better than intellec- 
tual confusion. "Our past apperceives and coOper- 
ates," writes Professor James; "and in the new 
equilibrium in which each step forward in the pro- 
cess of learning terminates, it happens relatively 
seldom that the new fact is added raw. More usually 
it is embedded cooked, as one might say, or stewed 
down in the sauce of the old." But to point out the 
exact stage of the process when the new knowledge 
is thoroughly cooked is extremely difficult; and one 
suspects that, after all, a great deal is added raw 
or only slightly cooked. 

To be open-minded often implies, in this strangely 
confused, mirthful, aspiring twentieth century, that 
we are fervid in the causes of out-door sleeping, 
psychical research, woman's suffrage, eugenics, the 
latest species of socialism, moving pictures in the 
church, perhaps even free love. If you shy at any 
one of these, and dash down the road to the old and 
tried pastures, you are a "reactionary," a term of 
abuse which I venture to think no more opprobrious 
than Cotton Mather's "Frenchman." (Speaking of 
Mather one might, by the way, raise the interesting 
question whether he was or was not open-minded in 
believing in witchcraft, that curious progenitor of 
psychical research.) But if you decide to be a "pro- 
gressive " and espouse the causes of the day, what 
shall you do in the event of their failing? To-day 
you are open-minded if you believe in out-door 
sleeping; but if the physicians tell us to-morrow, as 
they may be expected to do, when we are all sleeping 
under the stars, that out-door sleeping is unquestion- 
ably the cause of appendicitis, why then you will be 
open-minded if you buy an old-fashioned four-poster 
and sleep in your bedroom. 

Readiness to receive anything and everything 



into one's mental storehouse we might call demo- 
cratic open-mindedness. Under this form of intel- 
lectual government all ideas enjoy sufferance, or if 
you will suffrage. In religion, the democratic open 
mind will declare that Christ was assuredly divine 
and that there is no reason why we should refuse 
to believe in miracles, even though the charming 
assertions of the higher criticism and of evolution 
are equally true; in politics, it will accept radical 
forms of direct popular government and remind you 
that the idea of representative government must be 
retained in its purity ; in music, it will applaud the 
person who remarks that Beethoven has never been 
improved upon, and at the same time it will main- 
tain that Debussy has ushered in a new and glorious 
era of musical history; in literature, it will grant 
the preeminence of Fielding and Thackeray, on 
hearsay, perhaps, and rise to effervescent enthu- 
siasm over the novels of Mr. Bennett and Mr. Wells ; 
in painting, it will adore Titian and Velasquez and 
think that the eccentricities of Post-Impressionism 
are sublime ; in the enchanting world of sports, it 
will assert that football is superior to any other 
sport save baseball, cricket, hockey, and a dozen 
others, that walking is the noblest form of recrea- 
tion but that an automobile tour is the "greatest 
thing ever." It will embrace all things with appa- 
rently the same degree of fervor; and if you suspect 
it of mental indigestion, will look so robust that you 
would be quite tactless if you voiced your suspicion. 
The democratic open mind is so optimistic and 
genial that it is immensely popular it is supremely 
adapted to the mood of society, having no rough 
edges, no prejudices, no reticences. 

Indeed, so desirable is the democratic open mind, 
from the social point of view, that it is often imitated 
by those who are temperamentally unfit for it. In 
such cases the result is generally uncomfortable to 
the imitator and to society. The sense of incon- 
gruity is as obvious as in cases of "kittenish" de- 
portment on the part of elephantine persons, or 
stylish dress indulged in by those whom the styles 
do not fit. Your imitator of the democratic open 
mind is always aware of the inconsistencies that 
his attitude toward life is based on, and they make 
him very unhappy. He 

" Knows what he knows as if he knew it not, 
What he remembers seems to have forgot. 
His sole opinion, whatsoe'er befall, 
Centring at last in having none at all." 

He is not born to the part, and consequently totally 
lacks the magnificent impudence of the genuine 
democratic open mind. 

A much commoner creature than either of the 
above is the snobbish open mind. The snobbish 
open mind welcomes only what is unhackneyed, 
prizes only what has an indefeasible claim on nov- 
elty. Now, novelty may imply newness of more 
than one kind. In a period when the leaders of 
thought look to the past for inspiration and au- 
thority, novelty will mean what is very old may 
apply to Pre-Raphaelitism as well as to Post- 



366 



THE DIAL 



[May 1 



Impressionism. To-day, however, when the old is 
anathema, novelty has in strictness only one mean- 
ing what is so modern that it would have startled 
the old fogies. The snobbish open mind is primarily 
interested in what is recent, and will prefer contem- 
porary third-rate or fifth-rate excellence to the first- 
rate excellence of the past. It is in perpetual alarm 
lest the name or the cause that it celebrates should 
meet general recognition and thus lose the essential 
trait of novelty. A few years ago one could easily 
make a blue-book or a black list of the snobbish 
open minds by recording the membership of the 
Browning Clubs. To-day Browning has receded 
into the past, he has won a fairly definite and secure 
position, and the Browning Clubs, alas, are becoming 
more and more " respectable." Your snobbish open 
mind ignores him as it ignores Donne, and bestows 
its affection on the performance of M. Bergson and 
his fascinating trained bear, the 6lan vital, or on the 
scintillant heterodoxy and orthodoxy of Mr. Shaw 
and Mr. Chesterton. It admires Debussy, though 
less emotionally than a few years ago, and is inclined 
to scorn Bach and Beethoven and even the more 
recondite Brahms. Could Bach have composed a 
"L'Isle Joyeuse "? it does not occur to the snob- 
bish open mind that Debussy could never compose 
a " Das wohltemperirte Klavier." The sober, old- 
fashioned people who shudder at discord and refuse 
to grant that Debussy has " form," are promptly re- 
minded that the heresy of one period is the orthodoxy 
of the next ; and if the old-fashioned people humbly 
suggest that not all heresy is finally orthodoxy, that 
some of it is merely forgotten, they are asked what 
they know about it, since the future alone can tell 
what will happen in the future. 

From a social point of view, the snobbish open 
mind is of course less desirable than the democratic. 
Since there are many people who unite the qualities 
of excellence and conservatism, the snob finds him- 
self engaged in incessant petty frays and now and 
again a pitched battle. Whereas the democratic 
open mind instinctively adopts the opinions that it 
encounters, the snobbish open mind is given to a 
fondness of 

" contradiction for its own sweet sake," 
and is a little hurt if you agree with it. It has no 
love for flabby democracy ; if the topic of eugenics 
is broached, and if you emit a spark of enthusiasm, 
the snob has no opportunity to display his superiority. 
If, however, you hint at your disapproval, up goes 
the defiant chin, the eyes rain fire as from batteries, 
and verbal arguments pour into you like grape and 
canister. No quarter is given, the ammunition is 
inexhaustible, even the call to dinner may afford no 
refuge ; and if you do escape, how bourgeois you 
feel ! One can hardly say that the snobbish open 
mind is desirable socially. It is vehemently pre- 
judiced, and may be termed open only in the sense 
that it welcomes every fad. 

These several types of open mind well nigh ex- 
haust the possibilities. Clearly, they are, as we 
have intimated, not preferable to the thick heads 



that oppose them and that help to make this world 
so delightfully diverse. But there is another type 
of the open mind, a type entirely admirable, more 
useful, indeed, than any kind of thick-headedness. 
It is not democratic does not espouse everything; 
it is not snobbish does not choose the unusual on 
the assumption that the unusual is superior; it is, 
rather, aristocratic, in a good sense, holding to 
that which is best. It is this type, I suppose, that 
William James implied by his phrase "pragmatic 
openness of mind," though for my part I suspect 
that pragmatism tends to be somewhat democratic. 
The following passage from James's address at 
the Emerson centenary in Concord illustrates pretty 
clearly what I mean by the aristocratic open mind : 

" Such a conviction that Divinity is everywhere may 
make of one an optimist of the sentimental type that 
refuses to speak ill of anything [this is our democratic 
type]. Emerson's drastic perception of differences kept 
him at the opposite pole from this weakness. . . . Never 
was such a fastidious lover of significance and distinction, 
and never an eye so keen for their discovery. His optimism 
had nothing in common with that indiscriminate hurrahing 
for the Universe with which Walt Whitman has made us 
familiar." 

Whitman is an excellent example of the demo- 
cratic open mind, having as few prejudices as any 
human being is likely ever to have; and Emerson is 
an excellent example of the aristocratic open mind, 
not because he had many prejudices an open mind, 
by definition, cannot have but because he had that 
love of significance and distinction that James de- 
scribed so well. Wherever Emerson went, he went 
as a learner, believing that each man sees Truth 
from a different angle and might give him what he 
could not get unaided. He was ready to test the 
virtue of the most unpromising Transcendental 
whims, even when they sent him to his study break- 
fastless. Believing that work in the garden might 
be ennobling, he plied the spade at the risk, as his 
little son once remarked, of digging his leg. But 
having been open-minded enough to experiment, he 
was also open-minded enough to recognize that the 
experiments failed henceforth, like a wise man, 
he enjoyed his breakfast and did little work in the 
garden. Without accepting recklessly, he tried 
everything, believing that "man was made for con- 
flict, not for rest. . . . The truest state of mind 
rested in becomes false." His greatness consists 
largely in his discriminating type of open mind, just 
as Cardinal Newman's conspicuous limit consists in 
the fact that his mind, though it contained untold 
wealth, was deliberately kept shut. 

The sifting instinct that is essential in the 
aristocratic open mind is dependent on standards. 
Emerson's standards were those of individualism, 
the unfolding of the self according to natural ten- 
dency. In Arnold, who had in some respects a 
more open mind than Emerson, the standards were 
those of culture, of humanism the symmetrical 
development of man to his highest capacity, which 
involved a regard for institutional life that was 
absent in Emerson. Standards of some kind are

the primary requirement of aristocratic open- 
mindedness. To-day, unhappily, standards are 
excessively rare. Those who possess them are gen- 
erally thick-headed, and at best remind us of Dr. 
Johnson's highly engaging prejudices. Abundant 
as the democratic and the snobbish open minds are, 
we have few aristocratic open minds. And we ur- 
gently need more of them. NORMAN FOEBSTER. 



CAS UAL COMMENT. 

FOND MEMORIES OF BOOK-LAND, as it revealed 
itself to the eager eyes of unspoilt childhood, are 
cherished by all adults who have not been the victims 
of literary starvation in those hungry years from 
infancy to adolescence. A responsive chord will be 
struck in many a breast by Mr. Henry James's 
account of the effect produced on his young imagi- 
nation by " Uncle Tom's Cabin." In " A Small Boy 
and Others," reviewed elsewhere in this issue, he 
says : " We lived and moved at that time, with great 
intensity, in Mrs. Stowe's novel which, recalling 
my prompt and charmed acquaintance with it, I 
should perhaps substitute for The Initials, earlier 
mentioned here, as my first experiment in grown-up 
fiction. There was, however, I think, for that tri- 
umphant work no classified condition ; it was for no 
sort of reader as distinct from any other sort, save 
indeed for Northern as differing from Southern : it 
knew the large felicity of gathering in alike the small 
and the simple and the big and the wise, and had 
above all the extraordinary fortune of finding itself, 
for an immense number of people, much less a book 
than a state of vision, of feeling and of consciousness, 
in which they did n't sit and read and appraise and 
pass the time, but walked and talked and laughed 
and cried, and, in a manner of which Mrs. Stowe 
was the irresistible cause, generally conducted them- 
selves." How much of boyhood's actual impressions, 
and how much of Mr. James's later conception of 
what those impressions must have been, or ought to 
have been, is to be found in his interesting and 
always characteristic references to books read and 
things seen and persons met in those formative 
years, who can say ? 

THE LATE EDWARD DOWDEN'S LITERARY 
ACHIEVEMENTS, in the way of number and quality 
of his published works, make an impressive showing 
when summed up in obituary notice of the lamented 
scholar and critic whose recent death leaves a sad 
gap in the ranks of the older English writers of solid 
attainments and recognized authority. His long 
term of service as Professor of English Literature 
at Dublin University, where he was educated and 
where he received his appointment in 1867, at the 
age of twenty-four, was diversified with the produc- 
tion of many critical studies for a larger public than 
that with which he came in contact as teacher and 
lecturer. His various writings on Shakespeare are 
among the best fruits of his scholarship and industry, 



as is also his elaborate biography of Shelley, even 
after all deductions have been made which the 
reader of Mark Twain's famous onslaught on the 
book may feel inclined to make. Wordsworth and 
Southey were also among Dowden's favorites, and 
so were Browning and Montaigne; and of them all 
he wrote with critical appreciation and in a manner 
acceptable to readers. His various collections of 
shorter essays, such as ''Transcripts and Studies," 
"Studies in Literature," and ''New Studies in 
Literature," have brought him deserved fame as 
a sound literary critic and an engaging writer. 
Characteristic of Dowden the bookman was the fact, 
recorded in " Who's Who," that his chief recreation 
was book-collecting. Born in 1843 (May 3), he had 
nearly completed his seventieth year when death 
overtook him. 

THE PUBLIC LIBRARY ON THE PRAIRIE is not yet, 
and for some time will not be, the most conspicuous 
feature of the landscape. In the State of Iowa, for 
example, where the Public Library Commission is 
only about as old as the century, it is announced by 
the Secretary of that body, in her current biennial 
Report, that the number of free public libraries on 
the municipal tax basis has now reached one hun- 
dred and twelve, with one additional library main- 
tained by private endowment ; also, within the past 
year, two additional county-seat towns have voted in 
favor of the establishment and maintenance of public 
libraries, thus reducing the number of shire towns 
without libraries to fourteen. A striking contrast 
this, of course, to the condition of things in the 
thickly-settled Eastern States, where the town or 
village without some sort of library privileges is fast 
becoming the exception. But Iowa has made a good 
beginning and will achieve great results in time, 
though when it is remembered that there are in the 
State not far from two hundred towns with a popu- 
lation of one thousand or more, of which little above 
one-half are yet provided with libraries to say 
nothing of the smaller settlements the task for 
the future will be acknowledged to be a big one. 
Travelling libraries, however, and local library asso- 
ciations are sowing the seed of future permanent 
libraries. An interesting fact to be noted in this 
connection is the liberality shown by Mr. Carnegie 
in helping on the movement ; either alone or, in a 
few instances, with other benefactors he has provided 
with buildings seventy-four of the one hundred and 
twelve public libraries in Iowa. 



HOW TO PRESERVE ONE'S SELF-RESPECT, THOUGH 

A WRITER, is a problem of vital interest to compara- 
tively few, but to those few it is indeed something 
more than an academic question. A contemporary 
author of distinction has been heard to declare that 
he should be ashamed to have written a book that 
had sold to the extent of one hundred thousand 
copies. There is somewhere in Crabbe's poems a 
delightful character, a scholar, who "might have 
writ a book but that his pride in the not writing was

more gratified" the quotation may not be exact. 
Charles Lamb, racking his brain for a daily half- 
dozen jokes for the newspaper press, and receiving 
a paltry sixpence apiece for his witticisms, and at 
about the same time writing for the" Morning Post," 
" where more than two-thirds of his materials are 
superciliously rejected," as Mr. Lucas tells us, pre- 
sents a rather pathetic spectacle. In the " Open 
Letters " of the April " Century " many readers 
will have noted Mr. Simeon Strunsky's shrewd com- 
ments on certain features of present-day journalism. 
In the form of a letter "to a future graduate of the 
School of Journalism," he amusingly contrasts the 
methods of the writer for pay and the writer for 
something less expressible in terms of dollars and 
cents. To a supposed reporter of the latter class 
he says, in closing : "You will have to work for a 
respectable newspaper and be a thirty-dollar man 
for some years to come. But, after all, is n't it true 
of every calling that you must pay back your em- 
ployer for the self-respect he permits you to retain? 
... In general, you will be granted the luxury of 
so doing your work as to inflict a minimum of pain 
on the weak and the innocent. . . . And I imagine 
you will find the thirty-dollar job quite as profitable 
as the other kind, in the long run." Yes, there are 
destinies more unenviable than that of him who 
adopts the motto of the early Edinburgh Reviewers 
and cultivates the Muse on a little oatmeal. 



THE DIGNITY OF THE LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE Will be 

belittled by no librarian worthy of his high calling. 
Others may here and there be found who hold in 
too little esteem both that official himself and the 
position he occupies. Even our honored Emerson, 
no scoffer in general, allows himself something like 
a sneer at the profession in his assertion that the 
custody of books carries with it no guaranty of 
superior learning in the custodian. Evidently he 
had not read and pondered the words of that excel- 
lent bibliothecary, Jared Bean, who in his justly 
famous "Old Librarian's Almanack" thus expresses 
himself : " I am sensible that there will be some who 
will enquire as to what qualities should be possess'd 
by him who stands thus as Guardian of the Books. 
These may think (if perchance the hasty and frivol- 
ous workings of their ill-taught minds may be so 
dignified as to call it thinking) that it matters little 
what the character of the Librarian be. Such as 
these cannot too soon become aware of their error. 
For how can it be possible that a man can act as 
Warder of the accumulated record of the world's 
wisdom, piety, learning, & experience, and hold the 
same in necessary reverence, if he be not a person 
of sober and Godly life, learn'd, virtuous, chaste, 
moral, frugal, and temperate?" A worthy follower 
in the footsteps of Jared Bean is the head of the 
Leavenworth Free Public Library, who, entering 
upon his present duties within the past year, so 
conceives of the true significance of his office that 
in the very opening sentence of his current Report, 
after proper salutation to the Board of Directors, he 



declares : " Without doubt the occurrence of greatest 
importance to the Library in the course of the year 
has been the change of librarians." And the pages 
that succeed this remark carry conviction to the 
reader that under its new administration the Leaven- 
worth Library is growing in usefulness. Its cir- 
culation advances, its book-collection increases, its 
activities widen. 

THE INSISTENT DEMAND FOR ART IN THE 

THEATRE for the play with an idea behind it and 
originality in its accessories* continues to upset 
the complacency of the commercial managers and to 
put the thinking public, which is proving itself to be 
hopefully numerous in some quarters, in the mood 
for theatrical experiments by managers in the mood 
to try them. One of the most recent of these is the 
opening of the Princess Theatre in New York, where 
a clever and versatile repertory company, under the 
direction of Mr. Holbrook Blinn, will devote its tal- 
ents to the production of short plays, such as have 
made the fame of the "little theatres" of Paris. 
The capacity of the Princess is about the same as 
that of Mr. Ames's Little Theatre ; and its decora- 
tive scheme, if not so original as Mr. Ames's, is still 
unusual and very beautiful. The theatre's policy of 
producing short plays of merit, hitherto relegated to 
the menial position of "curtain-raisers" (when they 
were fortunate enough to be produced at all), is one 
to arouse enthusiasm in the hearts of drama-lovers 
imbued with the modern spirit. The opening bill, 
consisting of two comic skits, and one grimly, one 
gaily tragic piece, is novel and engrossing enough 
in material, and played with sufficient cleverness 
and versatility, to presage some measure of success, 
at least, for the experiment of the Princess Players. 
The Parisian flavor of the entertainment is unneces- 
sarily accentuated at present, but it is not essential 
to the idea ; and as the one-act playwrights discover 
the Princess and the Princess discovers them, New 
York's first " theatre a cote"" will, we hope, develop 
a flavor of its own, as clever and as modern as 
its Parisian counterparts, but saner and more thor- 
oughly artistic. m m . 

IMPROVIDENT POETS not only escape the serious 
censure of posterity for their unthrifty habits, but 
even have a way of winning added favor by reason 
of this very lack of worldly foresight. Poe's ina- 
bility to extricate himself from his pecuniary straits 
endears him the more to his readers and admirers ; 
Whittier's Quaker thrift gains our approval and 
esteem, but excites no warmer feeling. Shelley's 
impulsive giving of his precarious income to Godwin 
and others, followed by a compulsory avoidance of 
impatient creditors, seems quite in keeping with 
the poet temperament; Browning's sleek and pros- 
perous appearance moves the observer to question 
whether that can indeed be the author of "The 
Ring and the Book." The late Francis Thompson, 
who seems to be more and more coming into his 
own now that he is no longer among us to serve as 
fortune's plaything, is said to have been so poor a

manager of his own business affairs that he was as 
likely as not to throw into the fire the checks received 
by him in payment for his poems. Another poet 
(probably less esteemed now as a poet than as an 
eccentric humorist and a delightful letter- writer) 
who could show now and then a splendid indiffer- 
ence to his own pecuniary interests, was Edward 
FitzGerald. On one occasion, after receiving a 
periodical payment of interest on a mortgage note 
from a debtor of long standing, he calmly tore up 
the bond of indebtedness in the man's presence and 
told him the payments had gone on about long 
enough and the account might now be considered 
as squared. The Woodbridge recluse's habit of 
using Bank of England notes as book-markers is 
a further illustration of his little regard for the 
sacredness of property (when it chanced to be his 



A REMINDER OF BALZAC, and of the terrors that 
his manuscript is said to have had for the composi- 
tor, is about to pass away in the demolition of his 
house in the Rue Visconti, or the Rue Marais, as it 
was called in his time. The lengthening of the 
Rue de Rennes, or other change in the topography 
of the left bank of the Seine, appears to be causing 
this removal of ancient Paris landmarks. The storied 
Passage du Pont Neuf, familiar to readers of Zola's 
" The'rese Raquin," is already doomed, and now the 
old house in which Balzac established his printing 
office must go. And this recalls the ruinously ex- 
pensive method of literary composition adopted by 
the always debt-oppressed author of the "Comedy 
of Human Life." His novels were practically writ- 
ten on a series of printed revises, " Ce*sar Birotteau " 
being, it is said, recomposed fifteen times in the 
twenty days during which it grew and repeatedly 
reshaped itself under his hand. A compositor, 
Champfleury has told us, "did his hour of Balzac 
as a convict did his time in prison." A veritable 
fiend at cancellation and interlineation the novelist 
must have been considered by the luckless manipula- 
tor of the types. Probably Balzac never read (or if 
he read it he failed to heed it) Chesterfield's counsel 
to his son not to allow himself on any pretext the 
weakness and folly of crossing out a word and writ- 
ing another over it a sure sign of indecision and 
temperamental flabbiness, though those are not the 
Earl's exact words. Balzac's method was that which 
the careful Pater afterward made his own, without 
carrying it to such extremes. 



MR. MORGAN'S LIBRARY, of which he never en- 
couraged the publication of any detailed description, 
has for those who are fond of rare books and costly 
manuscripts an interest and a charm intensified by 
something of myth and mystery. We know that 
that beautiful marble building adjoining his New 
York residence holds the most splendid private col- 
lection of incunabula and illuminated manuscripts 
and other literary treasures that can anywhere be 
found ; and it is also averred that, like Lorenzo the 
Magnificent, the late owner of this princely library 



not only possessed the taste and the means to acquire 
the best that was to be had in literature and art, but 
also was thoroughly familiar with his acquisitions 
and appreciated their value. A few of the choicest 
of these treasures may here be named : the " Golden 
Gospels " of Henry the Eighth, the "Naples Offices 
of Giulio Clovio," and many other illuminated manu- 
scripts of priceless worth, Caxtons in considerable 
number, perfect Aldines and "tall" Elzevirs, Byron 
manuscripts, Blake's original drawings for the " Book 
of Job," the originals of Horace Walpole's letters, 
the manuscript of Keats's "Endymion," Shelley's 
notebook, letters of St. Francis de Sales and of other 
saints, the originals of many of Burns's poems, 
manuscripts of Dr. Johnson, Swift, Scott, including 
nine of the Waverley Novels, and a great number of 
other masterpieces in the original manuscript; also 
rare and costly bindings such as nowhere else are 
to be found. ... 

A DRAMATIC MEETING OF EXTREMES IS to be 

found in the twentieth-century cinematographic 
presentation of the "Odyssey," written or sung 
eight hundred years before Christ. Though the 
scenes and incidents thrown on the screen may not 
all be free from anachronisms and other errors, the 
general effect ought to awaken interest in the great 
epic and to win fqr it not a few new readers. The 
time and money required for the preparation of this 
elaborate production have been more worthily spent 
than is commonly the case in motion-picture dis- 
plays. Whatever the crudities of the presentation, 
it at least helps to familiarize the public with the 
name of Homer. A similar graphic introduction to 
the "Iliad" might be made both instructive and 
entertaining. Such incidents as the fetching of 
Briseis from the tent of Achilles, Ulysses rebuk- 
ing and smiting the impudent Thersites, Patroclus 
donning the armor of Achilles and driving the 
Trojans before him, his fatal encounter with Hector, 
the combat between Hector and Achilles, and Priam 
begging the body of his son for burial, would serve 
to outline the famous story of the wrath of the Greek 
chieftain and its momentous consequences. The 
people, especially the young people, insist on having 
their motion-pictures ; let them, then, have such as 
may incite them to the reading of good literature.

THE FULL NAMES OF WELL-KNOWN AUTHORS are 

often as little familiar to their readers as is the fur- 
ther side of the moon to astronomers. Not one in 
twenty of those who have read Oscar Wilde could 
give his baptismal names unabridged, Oscar Fin- 
gall O'Flaherty Wills. Likewise few know that 
Charles Lever's full name is Charles James Lever, 
that Victor Hugo is short for Victor Marie Hugo 
(perhaps he had other names also), that Woodrow 
Wilson was named Thomas Woodrow, that Charles 
Dickens received at the baptismal font the fuller 
designation of Charles John Huffam, and so on. A 
few weeks ago there appeared in the New York 
" Sun " a communication from Mr. William Henry

Irving," but that, though he regarded the signature 
as good evidence of Irving's having been christened 
in the fuller form thus indicated, he had been unable 
to confirm this assumption by other testimony. The 
biographers and the compilers of biographical dic- 
tionaries do indeed seem to be uninformed of this 
apparent suppression of his first name by Irving in 
his ordinary correspondence. But our researches in 

the matter have not been exhaustive. 



AN EVENT OF SIGNIFICANCE IN THE PUBLISHING 

WORLD was the recent quarter- centennial celebration, 
at Philadelphia, of the Jewish Publication Society 
of America, an organization that has its headquarters 
in the Quaker City and that has done much to prove 
to the world the high quality of Hebrew scholarship. 
It takes pardonable pride in its early recognition 'of 
Mr. Israel Zangwill's merit as a writer, and in the 
fact that some of that author's first works bear the 
Society's imprint. Good English translations from 
ancient and modern Hebrew literature are among 
its noteworthy publications. That the Jew has a 
way of demonstrating his ability and zeal in what- 
ever he undertakes is generally recognized. In our 
public schools, the intellectual battle-ground of the 
youth of many nationalities, no class of pupils can 
be found of greater average quickness to learn and 
desire to learn than the children of the Ghetto ; and 
in our public libraries they are much in evidence as 
the most earnest and industrious and intelligent of 
readers. 



COMMUNICA TION. 

MR. EZRA POUND AND "POETRY." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Our national aphorism, "Some things can be done 
as well as others," may be, as Mr. John A. Hobson has 
pointed out, a great asset in material affairs, but when 
it is acted upon in matters of art its value grows 
doubtful. We have dramatic enthusiasts ignorant of 
the art of acting, amateur stage managers unable to 
manage, compilers of verse without judgment, editors 
who have never before edited, all seeking to uplift 
masses eager to learn, yet all placing stumbling-blocks, 
through their own lack of standards, in the way of 
those earnestly aspiring to the heights. 

Though no one can quarrel with literature in its 
highest form, nor with any periodical devoted to such 
a cause, one must regret that " Poetry " is being turned 
into a thing for laughter. No one need offer any par- 
ticular criticism of the earlier work of Mr. Ezra Pound; 
it is as he prefers it. But with the practical identifica- 
tion of " Poetry " and Mr. Pound one may pick a very 
pretty quarrel, since it involves not only a lowering of 
standards, but a defense of the thesis, unusual in " A 
Magazine of Verse," that poor prose must be good 
poetry. Take this from the April number: 

" O my fellow sufferers, songs of my youth, a lot of asses 
praise you because we are 'virile,' we, you, I! We are 
1 Red Bloods ' ! Imagine it, my fellow sufferers our male- 



ness lifts us out of the ruck. Who'd have foreseen it? O my 
fellow sufferers, we went out under the trees, we were in 
especial bored with male stupidity. We went forth gathering 
delicate thoughts, our ' fantasikon' 1 delighted to serve us. 
We were not exasperated with women, for the female is 
ductile. And now you hear what is said to us : We are com- 
pared to that sort of person who wanders about announcing 
his sex as if he had just discovered it. Let us leave this 
matter, my songs, and return to that which concerns us." 

Is this anything but prose? and dull prose? Is it 
interesting, except to psychopathologists and students 
of barbaric survivals in .the twentieth century? Does 
it reveal a personality, or hint at work one would like 
to know better? " But," some of Mr. Pound's admirers 
have answered, " it has subtle rhythm." To which the 
obvious reply is that English poetry has no subtle 
rhythm, nor can it have until its ictus, the strongest and 
most insistent in the history of speech, becomes subtle. 
The technical problem of English verse is largely the 
variance of rhythm, but the variances, again, are seldom 
subtle. The subtler rhythms in English literature are 
in its prose; and, it may be added, if subtlety implies 
difficulty of immediate discernment, the worse the prose 
the more subtle its rhythm. 

Take an instance from another source: 

" When Narcissus died, 
The pool of his pleasure changed 
From a cup of sweet waters 
Into a cup of salt tears, 
And the Oreads came weeping 
Through the woodland 
That they might sing to the pool 
And give it comfort. 

"And when they saw that the pool had changed 
From a cup of sweet waters 
Into a cup of salt tears, 

They loosened the green tresses of their hair, 
And cried to the pool, 
And said : 

" ' We do not wonder that you should mourn 
In this manner for Narcissus, 
So beautiful was he.' 

" * But was Narcissus beautiful ? ' 
Said the pool. 

" ' Who should know better than you ? ' 
Answered the Oreads. 
' Us did he ever pass by, 
But you he sought for, 
And would lie down on your banks 
And look down at you, 
And in the mirror of your waters 
He would mirror his own beauty.' 

"And the pool answered : 
' But I loved Narcissus 
Because as he lay on my banks 
And looked down at me, 
In the mirror of his eyes 
I saw my own beauty 
Mirrored.' " 

This is not an unusually beautiful example of vers 
libre. On the contrary, it is Oscar Wilde's " The Dis- 
ciple," which its author called a " poem in prose." And 
it is prose poetic prose assuredly, but prose. Wilde 
did not write it as it is written here, in what might be 
called Jerked English, any more than Mr. Pound wrote 
the previous specimen with the lines run together. 
Wilde knew his to be prose and wrote it accordingly; 
Mr. Pound believed his to be poetry and so wrote it. 
Certainly " The Disciple " is the more poetic of the two. 

But whether a given literary composition is poetry 
or not, does not depend upon the manner in which the 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



371 



type is arranged on the printed page. If this were so, 
the printer would be the poet, not the writer. When 
Mr. Pound's various examples of what he considers 
poetry are printed as prose, they are prose. In con- 
trast with Wilde's in any form, they are prosy prose. 

Mr. Pound's admirers insist, however, upon the essen- 
tial originality of his recent writings, and say that in 
destroying the conventions of rhyme and rhythm he is 
expanding the province of poetry. It is possible that, 
following the manner of Whitman, he is aiding in the 
fixation of a third form of literary expression, prose in 
form, poetic in content. But surely, after Macpherson 
and Whitman, that is no claim to originality. 

One of Mr. Pound's defenders has said in words 
what " Poetry " has been teaching by implication, that 
" formal rhythm is not necessary to poetry." Such a 
statement involves complete confusion between two sig- 
nifications of the word poetry. We speak with pro- 
priety of a sermon, an essay, an oration, a novel, a prose 
drama, indeed of any work of art, as " poetic," meaning 
thereby that it arouses in us emotions similar to those 
excited by poetry. 

But poetry, like every other Art or art, is concerned 
with form as well as substance. It is the metrical ar- 
rangement of words to express beauty, Poe's " Music 
plus Idea," and formal rhythm is as essential to it as to 
its sisters by birth, Music and the Dance. To deny that 
is to deny poetry, alone among the Arts and arts, the 
possession of a technic, reducing it forthwith below the 
level of literary prose, which unquestionably has technic ; 
it will be recalled that Walter Pater refused through 
life to write poetry because it confused this. And it is 
to deny the technic of ascertained metre unchallenged 
through thirty centuries. In this sense alone Mr. 
Pound's work is original. 

The attitude of " Poetry " toward poetry is that of 
Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy toward Medical Science. 
Yet, if poetry have no technic and, left formless there- 
by, is at one with illiterary prose, why devote a maga- 
zine to it ? Every newspaper, programme, advertise- 
ment contains similar English and English quite 
without false pretence. As has been pointed out, technic 
qua technic possesses charm for the cultivated mind. 
It is hardly too much to say that nothing atechnical has 
survived in any Art. Reduced to its simplest terms 
technic is knowing how the experience of the ages 
manifesting itself in practice. Moreover, within the 
canons of the art there is perfect freedom; without, the 
baldest enslavement to every passing fad and fancy 
as here. 

Remember that youth essaying his first poetic flights 
draws strength for his wings largely from the greater 
poets who precede him and leave him heir to their 
powers. Every beginner imitates, and one familiar 
with his predecessors has little trouble in naming the 
sources from which he chooses his forms of expression, 
if not his thoughts. It is not until he has outgrown 
this period of unconscious assimilation and attained his 
own manner that he is worthy the name of poet. For, 
as Mr. Pound has observed, " Any donkey can imitate a 
man's manner." 

In the April number of " Poetry " there are a dozen 
examples of Mr. Pound's work. Much the larger part 
of them are prose, like the one cited. The origins of 
all are evident. Whitman at his prosiest accounts for 
much, and in one Mr. Pound insists that he and the 
older bard have one sap and one root. There are 
touches here and there of MM. Maeterlinck and Albert 



Mockel, and something of Mr. W. B. Yeats. Nor 
should Stephen Crane be forgotten. The last instance 
is Japanese in content, though without the beautiful 
definition of the Japanese form. In other words, Mr. 
Pound's lines are derivations, experiments in the man- 
ner of a novice, searchings after individual expression 
without attainment. His roots are far back in the 
traditional past, inevitably. 

If one searches for originality of thought, it is not 
here. Whitman had something to say and said it; Mr. 
Pound is still occupied with youthful Bohemianism and 
impudence. His intense egoism, too intense to carry 
self-confidence with it, is apparent. The power of self- 
criticism implied in a sense of humor is lacking. A 
care for syntax has gone the way of other traditions. 
One of his efforts has the ring of Mr. Roosevelt before 
a vice commission. Feeling for words and for form 
is slight. Imagination is in abeyance. The Song of 
Solomon fathers the most poetic of his work in style 
and substance. Thought is everywhere tenuous and 
capable of compression in statement, and the philosophy 
is uncertain. Some of the lines seem written for inde- 
cency's sake, which is more than those contending for 
" art for art's sake " ask for. Most objectionable is the 
familiar attitude of the charlatan, announcing that his 
is the only cure, and that those disagreeing with him 
are the real quacks. 

But Mr. Pound may be left to the court of appeal 
the years will hale him before, if he survive. Many 
young men write verses, or wish to, and are impatient 
at the restraints which lack of technic imposes. If one 
of them lives to attain full poethood, the verses of his 
artistic adolescence meet with one of three fates : they 
are suppressed, they are completely rewritten, or they 
appear in his published works as juvenilia, itself an 
apology for their survival. 

The case is different with the magazine which has 
chosen to employ and exploit this young man. It has 
been able to do this consistently only by a supercilious 
dismissal of the great tradition of English poetry, using 
" traditional " as a term of contempt. And there is so 
much for it to do by a maintenance of the standards. 
We have seen the tradition expanded by men dead only 
yesterday, Swinburne and William Vaughn Moody. 
Mr. Yeats has enlarged its boundaries by a little. The 
modern social feeling, the growing solidarity of women, 
the wonders of science are clamoring for poetic expres- 
sion. Though there be no great poets among us, John 
Churton Collins has pointed out that from their lesser 
brethren " it is in some respects but a step to the work 
of the great poets of the next age." The editors of the 
usual magazines have their own standards, and many 
of the singers of the day know their best work to be 
at variance with these standards. It was hoped that 
" Poetry " would search out these poets and such poems, 
many of them of much significance and beauty. 

So far there has been little done in these directions. 
The quest has seemingly been for the bizarre, for the 
astonishing, for the novelty for novelty's sake, even for 
the shocking. The paper of the magazine .has been 
poor, the type that of the newspapers, the cover and 
form inadequate to the dignity of the cause, the proof- 
reading heedless. The editor too seldom allows a num- 
ber to go out without containing her own verses, though 
these show a steady retrogression from a once high 
standard. Her own sense of self-criticism in abeyance, 
Mr. Pound was bound to occur. WALLACE RICE.

MR. JAMES'S MEMORIES or BOYHOOD.* 

As a work of art, which from its very 
authorship it could not fail to be, Mr. Henry 
James's latest book, " A Small Boy and 
Others," might be said to belong to the Im- 
pressionist school, with perhaps here and there, 
in the extraordinary elaboration of certain 
minor details, suggestions of Pre-Raphaelitism. 
Whether any touches of later schools, of Post- 
Impressionism, Cubism, Futurism, are to be 
discerned in its pages this question it might 
be unwise to answer too emphatically either in 
the affirmative or in the negative. At any 
rate, the work is a piece of exquisite artistry, 
with all the characteristics of its author's style 
raised to their highest power. 

Impressions of childhood, veiled more or less 
darkly by the intervening years, form the 
substance (though that is too strong a term to 
apply to things so nebulous in their general 
outlines) of Mr. James's twenty- nine autobio- 
graphic chapters. Starting avowedly with the 
purpose " to place together some particulars of 
the early life of William James and present 
him in his setting, his immediate native and 
domestic air, so that any future gathered me- 
morials of him might become the more intelli- 
gible and interesting," the writer soon found his 
own boyish figure so unavoidably present in the 
forefront of all those childhood scenes of half 
a century and more ago, that he gave over the 
attempt to restrict his reminiscent narrative to 
its first-chosen subject, considering it a sort of 
" cold impiety " to suppress even his own part 
in the juvenile drama now rendered sacred by 
the death of its senior performer. But any- 
thing like close companionship with that older 
brother seems to have been rendered impossible 
by the immense gap of sixteen months' differ- 
ence in age ; so that the younger " never for all 
the time of childhood and youth in the least 
caught up with him or overtook him." 

" He was always round the corner and out of sight, 
coming back into view but at his hours of extremest 
ease. We were never in the same schoolroom, in the 
same game, scarce even in step together or in the same 
phase at tone same time ; when our phases overlapped, 
that is, it was only for a moment he was clean out 
before I had got well in. How far he had really at any 
moment dashed forward it is not for me now to attempt 
to say ; what comes to me is that I at least hung invet- 
erately and woefully back, and that this relation alike

to our interests and to each other seemed proper and 
preappointed." 

Pathetic and comical is the picture later pre- 
sented of the smaller boy offering his company 
when it was not desired, and of the larger 
"putting the question of our difference at rest, 
with the minimum of explanation, by the re- 
sponsible remark : ' / play with boys who curse 
and swear!" The rebuffed one had sadly to 
recognize that he didn't, that he couldn't pre- 
tend to have come to that yet. Not unnaturally, 
he wonders now, hardly less than he wondered 
then, in just what company his brother's privi- 
lege of profanity was exercised; and he con- 
tinues, in delightfully self-revealing vein : 

" It was n't that I might n't have been drawn to the 
boys in question, but that I simply was n't qualified. 
All boys, I rather found, were difficult to play with 
unless it was that they rather found me; but who would 
have been so difficult as these? They account but little, 
moreover, I make out, for W. J.'s eclipses; so that I 
take refuge easily enough in the memory of my own 
pursuits, absorbing enough at times to have excluded 
other views." 

It is, then, with his own pursuits, his own mem- 
ories and impressions, that Mr. James chiefly 
concerns himself in his chapters; and with a 
few more glimpses of his boyhood world, as seen 
through his eyes, this review will have executed 
its pleasant task of introducing the book to the 
reader. 

Early in the volume the origin of its author's 
partiality for England and things English is 
ingeniously and at some length traced. The 
parents had visited London with their two infant 
children, and there inoculated them with the 
virus, or dosed them with the "poison," as the 
writer himself calls it, which rendered the 
younger boy, at least, thenceforward unrespon- 
sive to the call of patriotism. Moreover, a ma- 
ternal aunt, member at one time of the James 
family circle, "had imbibed betimes in Europe 
the seeds of a long nostalgia," and her memories, 
"through some bright household habit, over- 
flowed at the breakfast table" this breakfast 
table, by the way, having its place alternately 
in New York, Albany, Fort Hamilton, and New 
Brighton. It was home talk of this sort that 
created and strengthened the belief that "En- 
glish life" was the superlatively desirable life; 
and furthermore, 

" My father had subscribed for me to a small peri- 
odical of quarto form, covered in yellow and entitled 
The Charm, which shed on the question the softest lustre, 
but of which the appearances were sadly intermittent, 
or then struck me as being; inasmuch as many of our 
visits to the Bookstore were to ask for the new number 
only to learn with painful frequency that the last con.

signment from London had arrived without it. I feel 
again the pang of that disappointment as if through 
the want of what I needed most for going on; the En- 
glish smell was exhaled by The Charm in a peculiar 
degree, and I see myself affected by the failure as by 
that of a vital tonic. It was not, at the same time, by 
a Charm the more or the less that my salvation was to 
to be, as it were, worked out, or my imagination at any 
rate duly convinced; conviction was the result of the 
very air of home, so far as I most consciously imbibed 
it. This represented, no doubt, a failure to read into 
matters close at hand all the interest they were capable 
of yielding; but I had taken the twist, had sipped the 
poison, as I say, and was to feel it to that end the most 
salutary cup." 

A migratory hotel life at home, varied with 
occasional sojourns abroad, brought the observ- 
ant and reflective lad into some sort of personal 
though quite distant and bashful contact with 
an occasional person of note, the recollection of 
whom heightens the charm of his narrative. 
From these recollections let us quote first a 
passage relating to certain vaguely- remembered 
school days at the "Institution Vergnes," in 
lower Broadway. 

" To a ' French school ' must have been earnestly 
imputed the virtue of keeping us in patience till easier 
days should come; infinitely touching our parents' view 
of that New York fetish of our young time, an ' acqui- 
sition of the languages' an acquisition reinforcing 
those opportunities which we enjoyed at home, so far 
as they mustered, and at which I have briefly glanced. 
Charming and amusing to me indeed certain faint echoes, 
wavering images, of this superstition as it played about 
our path: ladies and gentlemen, dimly foreign, mere 
broken syllables of whose names come back to me, 
attending there to converse in tongues and then giving 
way to others through failures of persistence whether 
in pupils or preceptors I know not. There hovers even 
Count Adam Gurowski, Polish, patriotic, exiled, tem- 
porarily famous, with the vision of his being invoked 
for facility and then relinquished for difficulty; though 
I scarce guess on which of his battle-grounds he was 
so polyglot that he even had a rich command of New 
Yorkese." 

Recalling his juvenile impressions of current 
politics, the author says: 

" The field was strictly covered, to my young eyes, I 
make out, by three classes, the busy, the tipsy, and 
Daniel Webster. This last great man must have rep- 
resented for us a class in himself; as if to be 'political ' 
was just to be Daniel Webster in his proper person and 
with room left over for nobody else. That he should 
have filled the sky of public life from pole to pole, even 
to a childish consciousness not formed in New England, 
and for which that strenuous section was but a name in 
the geography-book, is probably indeed a sign of how 
large, in the general air, he comparatively loomed. The 
public scene was otherwise a blank to our young vision, I 
discern, till, later on, in Paris, I saw for at that unim- 
proved period we of the unfledged did n't suppose our- 
selves to meet ' Charles Sumner." 

Boyish memories of famous English artists 



and actors, as seen in their several perform- 
ances, on canvas and behind the foot-lights, 
fill one enjoyable chapter, in which the author 
blushes to acknowledge that " the grand man- 
ner, the heroic and the classic, in Haydon, came 
home to us more warmly and more humanly 
than in the masters commended as ' old,' who, 
at the National Gallery, seemed to meet us so 
little half-way, to hold out the hand of fellow- 
ship or suggest something that we could do, or 
could at least want to." . From memories of the 
London stage at that time, the following is of 
interest : 

" Our enjoyment of Charles Kean's presentation of 
Henry the Eighth figures to me as a momentous date in 
our lives: we did nothing for weeks afterwards but try 
to reproduce in water-colours Queen Katherine's dream- 
vision of the beckoning, consoling angels, a radiant 
group let down from the skies by machinery then 
thought marvellous when indeed we were not parad- 
ing across our schoolroom stage as the portentous 
Cardinal and impressively alternating his last speech to 
Cromwell with Buckingham's, that is with Mr. Ryder's, 
address on the way to the scaffold. ... I was to have 
my impression of Charles Kean renewed later on ten 
years later, in America without a rag of scenic rein- 
forcement; when I was struck with the fact that no actor 
so little graced by nature probably ever went so far 
toward repairing it by a kind of cold rage of endeavour." 

We get a passing glimpse of Thackeray, who, 
the author says, " struck me, in the sunny light 
of the animated room, as enormously big and 
who, though he laid on my shoulder the hand 
of benevolence, bent on my native costume the 
spectacles of wonder." The "native costume," 
of which the wonder-exciting portion consisted 
of a short and tight brass-buttoned jacket, is 
shown in the frontispiece portrait of the small 
Henry standing with one hand resting on the 
shoulder of his father, who is seated. General 
Winfield Scott is another whose personal ap- 
pearance photographed itself in heroic propor- 
tions on the young memory and imagination. 
"We must have been for some moments face 
to face," he says, recalling a walk in Fifth 
Avenue with his father, when the veteran soldier 
emerged from a cross street, " while from under 
the vast amplitude of a dark- blue military cloak 
with a big velvet collar and loosened silver clasp, 
which spread about him like a symbol of the 
tented field, he greeted my parent so clear is 
my sense of the time it took me to gape all the 
way up to where he towered aloft." 

Little, indeed, do we see of the boy William 
James in all these vivid and engrossing pictures 
of the past ; and this is to be regretted. But 
there is hope that fuller memorials of him will 
appear in the collection of his letters to be pub-

lished later. The " small boy," however, who 
serves as the central figure of the book, is 
sketched before our eyes in such strokes as it is 
a marvel and, to lovers of Mr. Henry James's 
books, a delight to follow. The whole is exe- 
cuted in that master's most unmistakable man- 
ner ; and even the less ardent admirers of his 
style cannot but feel the charm of the book as 
soon as they get fairly into the swing of its 
peculiar mode and method. It is a remarkable

A DELIVERANCE ON THE DRAMA.* 

Can we by taking thought add a cubit to our 
stature? Can the winds by lashing the waves 
raise the average level of the ocean a single inch? 
But at least by effort and exercise we can keep 
ourselves supple and undiminished, and the 
agitations of the sea prevent it from stagnating. 
In this view all the recent discussion of the 
things of the theatre, the formation of drama 
leagues, the production of plays by small reper- 
tory companies and at half private theatres may 
work for good. 

There are two factors needed for the produc- 
tion of a powerful and significant drama. The 
first is the appearance of a great dramatist or 
group of dramatists. These are far more rare 
than great comets. Hardly more than a score 
all told can be numbered in the history of the 
world. The second factor is the rage or mania 
for dramatic representation sweeping through 
the general mind. This is similar in its quality 
and action to other great instincts or possessions 
which at different times have seized upon the 
world the instinct for building cathedrals, 
for picture painting, for music, or for novel 
writing and reading. When the two elements 
in the case come together, we get a drama which 
is worth while. When they do not cohere, lit- 
erary creators who are potentially great drama- 
tists, Scott and Dickens for example, turn to 
other forms of their art. Or the people at large 
cease to crave the profound and powerful mo- 
ments of the drama and use the theatre merely 
as a means of amusement. Perhaps by much 
talking to, the people may be headed off and 
compelled to take an interest in serious dramatic 
work, if only as a fashion, but creative power

cannot be so compassed. We may call up spirits 
from the vasty deep, but will they come? 

Few contemporaries have a better right to 
speak about the possibilities of reviving the 
drama than Mr. Henry Arthur Jones, the distin- 
guished English playwright, whose "Founda- 
tions of a National Drama" is recently published. 
It is a collection of essays, addresses, and letters 
relating to the modern theatre and its produc- 
tions. As the book is so miscellaneous in form 
we cannot do better than give Mr. Jones's gen- 
eral summary of what he is arguing for, the 
things really needed by drama and stage. 

"1. To distinguish and separate our drama from 
popular amusement. 

"2. To found a national or repertory theatre where 
high and severe literary and artistic standards may be 
set. 

" 3. To insure that a dramatist shall be recognized 
and rewarded when and in so far as he has painted life 
and character and not according to his ability to tickle 
and bemuse the populace. 

" 4. To bring our acting drama into living relation 
with English literature : to win from critical opinion the 
avowal that the drama is the most live, the most subtle, 
the most difficult form of literature: to bring about a 
general habit of reading plays such as prevails in France. 

" 6. To inform our drama with a broad, sane, and 
profound morality; a morality equally apart from that 
practised amongst wax dolls and from that which allows 
the present sniggering, veiled indecencies of popular 
farce and musical comedy. 

" 6. To give our players a wide and varied training 
in their art. 

"7. To break down as far as possible the system of 
long runs. 

" 8. To distinguish between the play that has failed 
because it has been inadequately interpreted and one 
that has failed on its own demerits. 

" 9. To bring the drama in relation to other arts : to 
establish it as a fine art." 

Three of the points in this list seem to us of 
supreme importance: to get people to distinguish 
between real drama and "anything to amuse"; 
to get them to accept plays as literature and to 
read them ; and the question of morality. There 
is another point which Mr. Jones does not 
include in his summary, though he treats of it 
elsewhere in the book, and that is the issue be- 
tween the playwright arid the player, the strug- 
gle as to which is to dominate the theatre. Two 
nations, France and England, have adopted 
absolutely opposite methods in this matter. In 
France the play has always been the first con- 
sideration ; in England and America, the actor 
or actress. The result is plain enough, one 
would think. In France there has been a living 
and interesting drama for three centuries. The 
very best French men of letters have practiced 
as playwrights. In England there have only 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



375 



been sporadic specimens of brilliant drama, and 
the great writers have written poetic plays for 
the study. 

Amusement is a necessity of the human 
mind, and Mr. Jones admits that people will 
not pay to be bored. " Legs and tomfoolery," 
he says, are necessary on the stage. The trouble 
which the serious playwright has to confront is 
this, his work has to bring in a large amount 
of money at once or it cannot appear. His rivals 
in other serious kinds of literature may be able 
to wait ; he cannot. He must succeed now, if 
at all. How many copies of the works of Dar- 
win, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Wordsworth, 
Shelley, or Keats were sold in the lifetime of 
those writers ? If any one of them had been 
compelled to get a return of from five to ten 
thousand dollars the first week one of their 
books was published, the book would never have 
been published at all. There are apparently 
only two ways in which the problem can be 
solved for the serious dramatist. He may throw 
enough amusement into his work to carry its 
profundity, or else national, patriotic, or reli- 
gious forces may come to his aid and establish 
theatres of a high standard. 

The question of bringing the drama into 
relation with literature is a question of getting 
people to read plays. Once a published play 
sells even a reasonable edition it will not be 
ignored. Why the habit of reading plays ever 
went out is a curious matter to consider. As 
late as the days of Goldsmith and Sheridan, a 
playwright after a successful first night could 
be sure of a large fee from a publisher for his 
work. And even a later generation, that of 
Lamb, Hazlitt, and Hunt, habitually read and 
discussed recent dramatic productions. It was 
the novel which eclipsed the play, as it did the 
poem. The last two forms of literature require 
some intellectual effort from the reader. In 
the novel everything is done for him, it is, one 
may say, predigested food. A good play, which 
is only one-fifth as long as the average novel, 
may contain as much mental nutrition, hence 
intellectual dyspepsia to those unaccustomed to 
such strong food. But as our great desire to- 
day is to save time, as the short story has largely 
displaced the long novel, the very brevity of the 
play ought to recommend it to readers. 

The greatest stumbling-block in the path of 
the drama, however, is the question of morality. 
The best way to meet it, is to ask how it is 
possible to frame a story of any kind without 
some threatened or actual fracture of a good 
law, custom, or habit of mankind. You can as 



little have an action without sin as a man with- 
out a shadow. Even Sunday-school tales have 
to project vices such as pride, gluttony, selfish- 
ness, and so forth. Even our tea-cup American 
novelists have to deal with infractions of social 
usage and taste. Mr. Howells in his charming 
" Lady of the Aroostook " makes an awful 
tragedy out of a young girl crossing the ocean 
unchaperoned, though in the care of an elderly 
sea captain. If we are to have a drama at all 
we must let it deal with life in all its height, 
depth, and breadth. Possibly human beings 
would be better without any such knowledge 
of life, but to attain a really satisfactory state 
of ignorance and innocence we should have to 
abolish Bibles, books, newspapers, conversa- 
tions, law proceedings, in fact the whole organ- 
ization of the world. English and American 
theatre-goers are still in the stage of a country 
audience which identifies the man who plays 
the villain with his part and proceeds to throw 
bad eggs at him. There was an instance of this 
kind in the early career of Henry Irving. He 
was inclined towards the gruesome, and what 
with playing "The Bells" and reciting" The 
Dream of Eugene Aram" he got on the nerves 
of some of the London critics, who suggested 
that an actor with such a penchant for murder 
must be himself a doubtful character. Irving 
brought suit against the worst of his libellers 
and received substantial damages. We do not 
say that the dramatist who deals with the most 
extreme exhibitions of passion, vice, sin, and 
criminality does so primarily with the idea of 
saving the souls of his auditors. He deals with 
them because in them reside the most tremen- 
dous effects of human nature, and every dra- 
matic instinct in him responds to their appeal. 
But in all probability they do much to save 
souls, as thunderstorms clear the air, as the 
spectacle of the drunken Helot frightened the 
Spartan youth into virtue. 

Mr. Jones's book is rich in suggestive themes, 
and it is impossible to touch on all of them. 
Here and there we think he betrays a bias. 
For instance, he is pretty hard on the English 
dramatic writers preceding his own era. Now 
we are inclined to think that, admitting all 
charges of fustian and staginess, such produc- 
tions as " Virginius," "The Hunchback," 
" Richelieu," " Money," "The Lady of Lyons," 
" Caste," " Home," and "Our Boys " are good 
plays. They have an essential humanity in 
them, and certainly the breath of theatrical life. 
They have kept the boards down to a very recent 
date, and we think it is doubtful whether Mr.

Jones's generation of playwrights will furnish 
as many successes for posterity. Another in- 
sistence of Mr. Jones's is his demand that play- 
wrights shall be thoroughly trained in the tech- 
nique of their art. What technique? Greek, 
Shakespearean, Sheridanic, Sardouesque ; the 
training of the Lyceum, the music halls, or the 
transpontine drama ? Apparently anything in 
monologue or dialogue can be put upon the 
stage and can succeed. It is probably well to 
have some connected story, but nobody has ever 
yet solved the mystery of the plot of " The 
Black Crook." It is probably advisable not to 
split your play into innumerable scenes, but 
" Peer Gynt " has been presented with success. 
It is probably the right thing to tell your story 
by means of action rather than of narrative, but 
the great effects of the Greek theatre were got 
by narrative. There is absolutely no rule which 
a great dramatist cannot violate, and which an 
audience will not ignore if it pleases them to do 
so. Many brilliant dramatic writers have won 
their first successes when they were too young 
to know what training was. Congreve, aged 
twenty-one, goes up to London with " The Old 
Bachelor " and makes a hit. Sheridan, at about 
the same age, goes up to London with " The 
Rivals " and wins instant fame. Boucicault, still 
younger, goes up to London with "London Assur- 
ance " and it is the one permanent production 
of his life. Here, as in all arts, the intangible 
unexpected thing called genius is all in all. 

Mr. Jones's style is sometimes, especially in 
the addresses delivered to University audiences, 
a little stilted and extra-literary. When he lets 
himself go, however, he can be brilliant. He 
does let himself go most of all in the letters on 
the Censorship muddle, where he is not only 
thoroughly sound but very amusing. That is 
a complication, by the way, which we do not 
have to deal with in America, though we 
believe the Mayors of some of our cities have 
assumed censorial functions.

MAX AS A MACHINE.* 



It was inevitable that the general acceptance 
of the doctrine of evolution should affect our 
ideas concerning the causes and nature of be- 
havior. To the question, why do I do this or 
that, it is no longer sufficient to give a simple

answer. Had the verses about Mary and the 
lamb been written in these latter days, we should 
have been obliged to refer to the well-known 
gregarious tendencies of the Ovidse, and a num- 
ber of other matters, to explain why the lamb 
loved Mary so. Dr. Parmelee, having in mind 
the unity of the whole evolutionary process, be- 
gins his book with the proposition that "psychi- 
cal and social phenomena should be reduced as 
far as possible to biological terms, just as vital 
phenomena should be reduced as far as possible 
to chemical and physical terms." He therefore 
discusses the physico-chemical basis of behavior 
in general, and then the anatomical and physio- 
logical basis, following the matter up through 
the different groups of animals, only reaching 
man at the latter end of the book. We are thus 
led to see in human behavior a complex and 
special type of that organic response to stimuli 
which has been observed all along the line, from 
the protozoan up ; but which has from time to 
time entered upon phases distinct enough to re- 
quire separate classification. We also see that 
this evolution has been conditioned by the evolu- 
tion of bodily structures, and in particular of 
the nervous system. It follows from all this 
that the sociologist or psychologist cannot afford 
to consider man alone, since so much of what he 
must observe and describe has its roots in the 
distant past, long prior to the appearance of 
our species in the world. 

It must be admitted, then, that Dr. Parmelee 
is entirely right in urging that biology and com- 
parative psychology are necessary for the correct 
understanding of human behavior, and is to 
be commended for the attempt to supply, in a 
clearly written and not too voluminous work, 
the more essential data for this purpose. On 
the other hand it seems to me that the book as 
a whole may be justly criticised, not so much 
for its own peculiar faults, as for the pedagog- 
ical spirit which it represents. The author seems 
to confuse classification with explanation. In 
classifying animals, it is useful and necessary 
to note that eagles and chickens alike are birds, 
and dwell upon the common characteristics 
which make them so ; it is essential to observe 
that birds, reptiles, and fishes alike are verte- 
brates, and so on ; but the true zoologist never 
forgets that these great categories are merely, 
as it were, the bindings of the great books of 
nature, the pages of which are so numerous and 
so diversely illustrated. It is necessary to be 
synthetic, but the tendency may go so far as to 
be vicious. This we see in our everyday affairs, 
where so much harm arises from our off-hand 



1913] 



THE DIAL, 



377 



classification of people as good and bad, honest 
and dishonest, stupid and clever, and so forth. 
What we need so much in practical life is the 
ability to see in each other, not examples of 
classes, but rather special and unique personal- 
ities, each to be treated on its own peculiar 
merits. In doing this we are indeed synthetic, 
in that we find a single personality in the mul- 
tiple phenomena afforded by the individual, but 
this is naive or intuitive synthesism, not that of 
the comparative psychologist or anatomist. 

Evolution has been so enormously complex, 
that were we in possession of all the data we 
could not comprehend them. On the other 
hand, the fundamental principles of biology, 
which give us a broad understanding of evolu- 
tionary processes, are relatively simple ; so 
simple, in fact, that no reasonably competent 
person should grow up without some knowledge 
of them. Teaching directed to this end ought 
to be wholly beneficial, but I believe that it is 
so only when care is taken not to implant in the 
minds of young people the thoroughly vicious 
idea that everything in man and nature is " ex- 
plained " by a few simple rules. Artificial, 
bogus simplification is perhaps the dominant 
error of modern science, as taught in the schools. 
It represents a necessary tendency carried much 
too far, and perhaps as a corrective to this we 
may find it desirable to introduce detailed tax- 
onomic studies, which will at any rate bring 
the student into contact with the " number of 
things " of which this world is so full. 

As an extreme example of the condition of 
mind possible to a "reducer" of biological phe- 
nomena, we may take ProfessorParmelee's treat- 
ment of consciousness. In the following quota- 
tions I have italicized the significant words : 

" For the reasons given above, we are justified in be- 
lieving that consciousness is objective if it exists at all, 
and that consequently it is possible to study it scienti- 
fically. What, then, is consciousness as an objective 
phenomenon, if it exists at all? I have already suggested 
that it may be a form of behavior" (pp. 313-314). 

" We have seen that we have no tangible evidence of 
such a thing as consciousness" (p. 319). 

The reader will have difficulty in believing that 
this is anything but a burlesque on a certain 
school of modern psychologists and physiolo- 
gists ! 

The discussion of the theories of evolution, 
occupying the greater part of two chapters, 
seems rather inadequate and superficial, and 
raises the question whether the topics included 
under this head should not be treated in every 
case by a biologist. The easy way in which 
difficulties are smoothed over is shown by the 



following : " As we have already seen, the gen- 
erating of the primordial protoplasm, similar to 
crystallization, takes place in large part as a 
result of the molecular forces inherent in the ele- 
ments which constitute organic matter." What 
will the student gather from this ? Literally, it 
is so meaningless that it is difficult to say whether 
it is accurate ; but it quite leaves out of account 
the fact that we know actually nothing of the 
genesis of the primordial protoplasm, and that 
the occurrence, whether explained by " molecu- 
lar forces" or otherwise, was perhaps the most 
tremendous event in the history of the world.

THE WRITERS OF THE ENGLISH 
ROMANTIC PERIOD.* 



In referring to "the modern vice of reviewing 
a book without giving a clear image of its con- 
tents," Professor Elton, of the University of 
Liverpool, unintentionally sets up a standard 
that may well appal the reviewer of his two 
recent volumes. They contain together a total 
of 830 pages, and the number of words to the 
page is from four to five hundred. The author's 
purpose is thus stated in his Preface: 

" This work has been termed a survey and not a his- 
tory, though it contains matter for the historian, and his 
point of view has been kept in mind throughout in the 
arrangement of the theme. But the historical aspect 
is meant to be subordinate; and the book is really a 
review, a direct criticism, of everything I can find in 
the literature of fifty years that speaks to me with any 
sound of living voice. As the motto on the title-page 
may indicate, it is a series of judgments upon works of 
art. I do not know what literature is unless it is an 
art. Life and ideas, society and manners, politics and 
affairs, must always be studied in order to understand 
that art and to judge of its productions. But on each 
of these productions our last word must be an answer 
to the questions, Is it well done? Does it last ? What 
is it to me ? Even the further question, How does it 
arise ? is less ultimate and imperative. It is of course 
equally right and needful to study literature for the light 
which it may cast upon other things upon thought or 
ethics or national character; but that is a different 
enterprise, not to be confounded with the present one, 
although the material may often be the same in the two 
cases." 

Though he confines himself to a survey, and 
stresses letters rather than thought, Professor 
Elton is right in saying that his work contains 
matter for the historian. To be sure he excludes 
formal treatment, not only of contemporary life, 
but of other interesting topics of scholarship,

such as the mental relationships with Germany, 
and the indebtedness of romanticism to antiquity. 
He even resists the temptation to follow the 
side-trails that lead from individual men, such as 
the discrepancies between Wordsworth's theory 
of education and that of Rousseau, and Cole- 
ridge's " plagiarisms " from Schelling and A. W. 
Schlegel. But he fully understands that "in 
this second English Renaissance, ... as in 
the first, there is not only a great and successful 
flowering of creative art; . . . many of the 
seeds are brought from other lands, or else are 
handed down alive, after a long residence in 
darkness, from the ancient world." And though 
he may not consider these cognate and germinat- 
ing forces en masse, he shows their main bear- 
ings in his treatment of the several authors. 
"The Prelude," for example, is connected not 
only with the secular confession which sprang 
from the desire to expose one's self, but also 
with the Puritanic or Protestant mania, which 
reveals itself in Bunyan and even the more re- 
strained Milton, for recording the history of the 
soul " for the good of the world." In fact, there 
is nothing in the survey more praiseworthy than 
its absence of the provincial note, its easy readi- 
ness in linking the romantic writers with kindred 
or contrasting spirits of other races or times. 
Yet it is mainly concerned in making us see 
them as literary artists. It is little hampered 
by the furious squabble between "classic " and 
"romantic," and is faithful to the motto from 
Hazlitt: "I have endeavored to feel what is 
good, and to give a reason for the faith that was 
in me, when necessary, and when in my power." 
That Professor Elton admits, though " with 
some hesitation," summaries and studies of 
tendency, may be seen from such of his chap- 
ter titles as "The End of the Classical Verse: 
Crabbe," "The Novel of Manners and Jane 
Austen," "Prose of Doctrine: Scottish Phil- 
osophy, and Burke," "The Official Reviewers," 
" Historians and Other Prose Writers." It may 
be seen especially in the initial and the closing 
chapter. Here forty pages are consumed in 
sketching the background and tracing the chief 
characteristics of the period. Because of the 
very generalizations which Professor Elton else- 
where tries to avoid, and because of the state- 
ment of his conception of the age as a whole, 
these chapters claim our attention. The roman- 
tic age is found to inherit three mental features 
from the period 1700-1780: (1) the impulse 
of criticism, . . . "a thorough, hostile scrutiny 
of received opinions in metaphysical, moral, and 
social science, and in art"; (2) the use of learn- 



ing and science for reconstructive effort; and 
(3) the growing tendency of " the shaping spirit 
of imagination " to recover its higher uses. The 
last of these qualities dominates the new age. 

" Poetry is in the ascendant, and nearly all the best 
prose is creative, and is doing the work of poetry. The 
imagination is working freely, and not, as it must in 
history or sociology, under the restrictions of fact. . . . 
This reunion of poetry and prose under the rule of the 
free imagination is the great mark of our literature 
from 1780 to 1830." 

And the ultimate secret of this changed imagi- 
nation is "the convalescence of the feeling for 
beauty." This manifests itself in three ways. 

" First of all, the senses of the artist are regenerated ; 
this is at the bottom of everything. Secondly, his 
renewed perceptions of the face of living nature are 
attended by a vision of humanity, a new passion and 
humor, the expression of which is brought under the 
law of beauty. Thirdly, this new knowledge and self- 
knowledge are read in the light of new ideas; philo- 
sophical conceptions and visions invade literary art, and 
are brought under its law." 

But before these new senses, new sympathies 
and passions, and new ideas could be brought 
under aesthetic restraint, the central problem 
of the new literature had to be solved the 
problem of diction. To be adequate, the lan- 
guage of the age had to be sensuous and con- 
crete; it had, on some occasions, to regain its 
fitness for the lofty and heroic style ; and it had, 
at the other extreme, to press plainness to the 
lowest poetic limit. In spite of mistakes, all 
three of these necessary ends were attained. 

Nevertheless it is the study of individual 
writers upon which Professor Elton throws the 
emphasis. To " give a clear image " of the sub- 
stance of each separate study is out of the ques- 
tion. The substitution of an inquiry into general 
methods and values is imperative. We shall 
restrict ourselves to three things the author's 
style, the scope of his investigations, and the 
Tightness of his conclusions. 

The style is clear, flexible, pleasing. It 
meets the exactions of long journeyman service. 
It rarely draws attention to itself, and is satis- 
fied to reflect ideas. Aptness of phrase is not 
lacking : " everywhere in Lockhart we have the 
sense of something bigger than his set "; Sydney 
Smith's " usual tone is that of a man exposing 
stupidity to the stupid "; the " Annals of the 
Parish " has the effect " of a piece of history 
seen through near-sighted eyes "; and some of 
Scott's songs swing along " with a galloping, 
abducting kind of tune, like ' Young Loch- 
invar.' " Yet this aptness is at the farthest 
possible remove from affectation. The power 
to condense as much a habit of mind as of 



1913] 



THE DIAL

language is revealed again and again. Cow- 
per, we hear, " was inspired by the love of 
Milton and the love of simplicity, and his real 
feat is to have found a poetic language that 
reconciled these two affections." And once 
more: "Of women, Landor, Scott, Words- 
worth, and Shelley always write like gentle- 
men ; while Byron, Moore, and Keats can never 
wholly be trusted to do so." Another trait 
likewise inseparable from the thought behind 
it is the ability to make effective comparisons. 
Two examples must suffice. The first has to 
do with two sets of personages from the 
standpoint of the kind of conversations they 
engage in : 

" Meredith's make many wonderful strokes and 
dozens of false ones, but are so heady and high-spirited 
that they carry the game through and disarm criticism. 
Peacock, we feel, has scored out every word which he 
feels will not ring as sharply fifty years afterwards. 
Yet he does not write, like Sheridan, up to a prepared 
joke; he does not seem to know himself what is coming; 
there is the true air of impromptu, only no misses are 
allowed." 
The second is self-explanatory : 

" With Milton we fly by the map, taking our bearings 
amidst the evenly-whirling spheres, and seeing hell and 
heaven at a measurable distance in a certain direction. 
With Keats we fly like a bee, near the ground, from one 
cup of honey to another, and with long alightings. But 
with De Quincey we are in absolute space, which has 
no bearings, or firm earth, or north or south ; and yet it 
is peopled with human faces and memories and monu- 
ments themes to fix and control the imagination, which 
else would stray intolerably." 

A study of all the writers of the period strikes 
one as a pretty large order ; perhaps most 
readers would test its thoroughness by seeing 
what had been done with such minor figures as 
Godwin, Leigh Hunt, or the " Ettrick Shep- 
herd." The present reviewer makes such a 
touchstone of Gait. But Professor Elton does 
not stop with men like these ; he patiently ex- 
amines others yet humbler, even such as are 
not primarily literary at all. Numbers mean 
little ordinarily, but some idea of the amount 
of space devoted to out-of-the-way men, period- 
icals, and topics may not come amiss. A page 
is given to each of the following: William 
Maginn, Charles Lloyd, Crabb Kobinson, and 
"Baron Munchausen." Half as much again 
falls to Dugald Stewart and the researches in 
the ballad between Percy and Scott. The 
"Retrospective Review," Robert Eyres Landor, 
and Hartley Coleridge are alloted two pages 
each. Scott's narrative metres claim more than 
three pages, and Praed is given four. It must 
not be supposed, however, that the author has 
extended himself in a kind of printer's ink tour 



deforce. On the contrary he has had his say, 
without troubling himself about the space con- 
sumed, and without either halting or hastening. 
When it is perceived that the discussion of every 
individual, whether major or minor, leaves the 
impression of completeness, of being everything 
the author thinks necessary, 830 pages seem 
amazingly few. The present reviewer recalls 
but two persons who fail to receive proper re- 
cognition : surely Lord and Lady Holland were 
too inextricably interwoven with the literature 
of the time to be ignored. 

The method of studying individual men, 
instead of starting with hard and fast prin- 
ciples and commending or condemning as these 
are observed or violated, is justified upon two 
grounds. In the first place, the controversy 
between "classic "and "romantic" a contro- 
versy that can never terminate in the complete 
victory of either has blinded many critics to 
the actual achievements of the age. In the 
second place, " there is no orchestra in roman- 
ticism"; it gives us, rather, "many songs by 
no means in accord." It is necessary that the 
writers be studied separately, and it is necessary 
that each be approached with an open mind. 
Balance and Tightness of judgment, the power 
to detect the merits of the particular issue, is 
everything. And the importance of Professor 
Elton's work rests upon the fact that he pos- 
sesses this discriminating tolerance. One may 
not agree with each separate conclusion, but one 
may be certain that no conclusion is reached in 
a hasty or partisan way. We are reassured in 
the opening chapter when, after stating that 
there are three types of poetry in the age 
that which "is content to be very good," that 
"whose aim is doctrine," and that which 
" would have been different if questions had 
not been asked or answered, but . . . are not 
asked or answered in the poem," the author 
declares that each type is good and that the 
" aim and theme [of art] may be anything 
that will admit of its working under the law 
of beauty." It is in this spirit that he reviews 
the procession of figures, great and small, that 
march through the age. A closer examination 
of his method may be worth our while. 

Though not disturbed by the combats of 
literary schools, Professor EJton acknowledges 
no compulsion to keep his hands off when he 
wishes to touch debated points. He refutes, 
partly by reference to Dr. Johnson, the idea 
that melancholy was an exclusive or necessary 
attribute of romanticism. He pictures the 
affinities with liberating forces which underlay 



380 



THE DIAL

Jeffrey's tirades against them. And he shows 
the " downright and daylight genius" of the 
Wizard of the North by quoting a passage 
Waverley alone by the unknown lake that 
"unites every element in Scott's notion of 
romance scenery, foreignness, literary mem- 
ories of ballad or lay, the sense of danger and 
wonder and solitude, and, last of all, the 
humorous return of Scott upon his hero, or 
upon himself, as he comes out of his bath of 
romance and shakes himself, and recommences 
realist and Lowlander." 

Moreover, he is not afraid to acknowledge 
the shortcomings of the romantic writers. He 
points them out frankly. He finds Byron's 
greatest weakness as an artist in his lack of 
the idea of saying a thing once for all. He 
sees the limitation involved in Scott's habit of 
extricating his heroes and heroines, of shrinking 
from the supreme subject of tragic art, "the 
play of character in an inextricable position." 
He realizes that in Wordsworth " the struggle 
is after all too simple, the circuit too narrow," 
and the artistry too unsure for him to attain 
preeminence either as a sage or as a poet. 

But along with the ability to make distinc- 
tions and to recognize faults, Professor Elton 
has the power to appreciate worth. Nor is this 
too ready to defer to conventional opinion : how 
many critics would dare to confess that to them 
personally Byron is "an inspiration and a liv- 
ing force"? This sympathetic understanding 
nowhere shows better than in the discussion of 
technical matters De Quincey's prose rhythms, 
Wordsworth's inventions of poetic forms, the 
metre of " Christabel," and the art element in 
Wordsworth's autobiographical poems. It shows 
quite as well, however, in matters where person- 
ality enters Scott's lyric gift, the revealing na- 
ture of Lamb's and Hazlitt's criticisms, Keats's 
conception of the relations between beauty and 
truth, the extraordinary progress shown in the 
last works of Byron and Shelley. If Professor 
Elton does not startle us with novel conclusions, 
he opens new vistas of understanding and enjoy- 
ment, and we feel that even in his treatment of 
the less conspicuous writers he takes a whole- 
some pleasure in distilling out the soul of their 
goodness. 

It will be seen that this " Survey of English 
Literature, 1780-1830," is a notable produc- 
tion, indispensable to the student of one of the 
crowning eras of English letters. The mechani- 
cal features of the volumes are worthy of their 
substance. Well bound and clearly printed, 
they are more than usually free from the blemish 



of typographical errors. They contain ample 
notes, mainly given to bibliographies so distri- 
buted that only the chief authorities are men- 
tioned at first and those bearing on special topics 
are introduced as the need arises. They are 
also provided with a thoroughgoing index.

A SUCCESSOR TO BARTLETT AND 
DE VERB.* 



The task of compiling a dictionary of Ameri- 
canisms is beset with many difficulties. There 
is, first of all, the difficulty of deciding upon a 
satisfactory principle of selection, of determin- 
ing, for instance, whether slang shall be included, 
or negroisms, or recent importations from for- 
eign languages. There is the further difficulty 
of making sure that a word, apparently restricted 
in its use to the United States, is not also cur- 
rent elsewhere. And there is always the diffi- 
culty growing out of the circumstance that our 
language is constantly changing, in consequence 
of which no such compilation can possibly be 
complete. 

Our latest dictionary of Americanisms, "An 
American Glossary," by Mr. Richard H. Thorn- 
ton, of the Philadelphia bar, makes no preten- 
sions to completeness. It modestly proclaims 
itself to be a dictionary of " certain American- 
isms only, those, that is, of recognized standing 
or of special interest"; and it anticipates harsh 
or unreasonable criticism on the ground of other 
shortcomings by confessing at the outset that it 
is not without faults and by inviting additions 
and corrections. 

A comparison of this new work with Bartlett's 
"Dictionary of Americanisms," the standard 
work on the subject for more than half a cen- 
tury, makes it clear at once that the earlier 
work records much the larger number of words. 
Bartlett records, by a rough estimate, about ten 
thousand words, whereas Mr. Thornton takes 
account of only about three thousand. This 
disparity is traceable in part to the fact already 
noted, that Mr. Thornton has not attempted 
to make an exhaustive collection; but it is 
mainly due, we suspect, to the fact that Bartlett 
included in his dictionary a large number of 
words that are not properly to be reckoned as 
Americanisms, words that are neither Amer- 
ican in origin nor peculiarly American in

their use. Mr. John S. Farmer's dictionary, 
" Americanisms Old and New " (1889), exhibits 
the same fault. Mr. Thornton, with the aid 
evidently of the Century and New English dic- 
tionaries, has striven to eliminate all superflu- 
ous items. At the same time, he has succeeded 
(here again with the aid of these dictionaries 
and of the Publications of the American Dialect 
Society) in collecting a good many words that 
had been overlooked by his predecessors, a 
few, indeed, which, he holds, are now registered 
for the first time. Some idea of the number of 
new items that he has collected may be derived 
from a comparison with Bartlett's dictionary 
for the letters A, M, and W. Under A, Mr. 
Thornton lists 49 words not recorded by Bart- 
lett; under M, 91; and under W, 54. The 
total number of entries made by Bartlett under 
these letters is 681, of which Mr. Thornton 
rejects all save 108. It would thus appear 
that the number of new items recorded by Mr. 
Thornton is larger than the number brought 
over from Bartlett. 

The chief excellence of these volumes is to 
be found, however, not in the number of fresh 
items that are recorded, nor in the omission of 
superfluous items, but in the abundance of the 
illustrative extracts. Of these there are, accord- 
ing to the compiler's estimate, about 14,000 in 
all. Such material is obviously very valuable. 
It will not only prove extremely helpful to those 
who will consult these volumes for reference 
purposes, but it will also be of immense service 
to future lexicographers. 

Most of Mr. Thornton's citations are drawn 
from the first half of last century, the writings 
of John Neal, Seba Smith, R. M. Bird, Ken- 
nedy, Lowell, Longstreet, Baldwin, Hooper, 
and W. T. Thompson being prominent among 
those laid under contribution. Too few of the 
illustrations are, in our judgment, drawn from 
writers of the present generation. And the 
number of illustrations has not always been 
evenly proportioned to the importance or to the 
interest attaching to the words under which they 
are cited. Under the word bar (" the liquor 
counter in a saloon "), to mention a conspicuous 
example, only one illustration is given, although 
the term must have been in general use in this 
sense for a century or more ; while the vulgar- 
ism bar (for " bear "), which is seldom heard 
to-day, comes in for eighteen illustrations. Sim- 
ilarly the phrases back-handed , back taxes, and 
black eye, all in pretty common use to-day, 
receive but one illustration each, from the years 
1842, 1788, and 1795, respectively ; while 



balance (in the sense of " remainder ") is given 
twenty-nine illustrations, boost eighteen illus- 
trations, gouge forty illustrations, and Yankee 
a total of fifty-eight illustrations. In the case 
of words in common use to-day but not fully 
illustrated, more of comment as to their vogue 
would have been helpful ; and all provincialisms, 
colloquialisms, and vulgarisms might well have 
been designated as such. 

Fault may also be found, as was perhaps 
inevitable, with some of Mr. Thornton's defini- 
tions. The word allow, for instance, in its 
provincial American use, means not only " to 
be of the opinion that, to admit," but also (as 
two of the illustrations make plain) " to declare." 
Backwoods is not exactly " the forest prime- 
val." To bone up is not " to bristle up," but 
(as Bartlett has it) "to apply one's self closely." 
June bug is not " any insect that appears in 
June "; it is the term applied in the North to 
a blundering, brownish beetle, but in the South 
(usually) to a green-backed beetle, which is of 
a quite different genus. Nubbin, which Mr. 
Thornton defines as " an imperfect or spoiled 
ear of corn," is more precisely " a small ear of 
corn." And to shuck corn is not " to pull it 
from the stalk," but " to remove it from the 
husks" (or shucks). To skunk an opponent is 
not merely "to beat him thoroughly," but "to 
win all the points, to whitewash him." A water- 
haul is not, as we know it, "a cheat, a swindle "; 
and it originated, we believe, not, as Mr. 
Thornton suggests, in a fraud practiced by cer- 
tain government contractors in hauling by water 
while charging for " land-carriage," but in sein- 
ing. The definition "lady-bird " for lady-bug 
will be ambiguous to most Americans ; as will 
also " communicate " for commune. Other de- 
finitions that are unsatisfactory for one reason 
or another are those appearing under ashcake, 
backing and filling (is the phrase properly 
accounted an Americanism?), chunk (first entry), 
Cumberland Presbyterian, dipper, Eastern 
shore, like all-possessed, phoebe, poke (second 
entry), rooter, rush (first entry), and stand 
pat. Clevis, mentioned in the preface as one 
of a number of words that survive in America 
but that have not taken root, is well-known 
sometimes with the pronunciation clivis or 
clivy in rural districts of the South, all the 
way from Virginia to Texas; and three other 
phrases, doated wood, hard favoured, and 
het (for "heated "), mentioned in the same list, 
are not infrequently heard to-day in some parts 
of the South. The same holds, also, for the 
phrase let on, in the sense of "make believe," 



382 



THE DIAL 



[May 1 



which Mr. Thornton states he is not familiar 
with. The pronunciation crick, for creek, it 
may be added, is not universal in America. 

It is to be regretted, finally, that Mr. Thorn- 
ton did not enter more fully into matters of 
derivation and word-development. The phrase 
"on historical principles," in the sub-title of 
his work, would seem to imply that a good deal 
had been made of these matters ; but although 
we do have an etymology here and there, the 
compilation is, aside from this, historical only 
in so far as the illustrative extracts are dated 
and arranged chronologically. Occasional bibli- 
ographical references mainly from " Notes and 
Queries" tend somewhat to offset this defi- 
ciency. 

In his preface, Mr. Thornton ventures a new 
classification of Americanisms, which serves 
roughly to indicate the lines along which his 
compilation has been made. Slang even col- 
lege slang has been largely excluded, in virtue 
of its ephemeral nature ; and vulgarisms receive 
but small space. Considerable space, however, 
is devoted to nicknames and kindred appellations 
popularly assigned to notable persons and places 
and to political and religious movements, a class 
of words in which American speech would seem 
to be peculiarly rich. An interesting list of the 
books and periodicals on which the compiler has 
drawn for his illustrative materials is given in 
an appendix. KILLIS CAMPBELL. 



Two BOOKS ox THE SHORT STORY.* 



The psychologists are like the armies of the 
French Revolution. They propose to remake 
the world, if not by persuasion, then by force. 
A few years ago they came to the aid of the 
advertiser, and the effect upon the high cost 
of living has astonished us all. Now it is 
the short story. This invasion, as it is mani- 
fested in Professor Walter B. Pitkin's book, 
" The Art and the Business of Story Writing," 
is not unwelcome. To deny the importance 
of technique in the short story is to confess 
ignorance of the form ; and as technique in the 
short story is chiefly concerned with the means 
of securing a certain effect, and as that effect 
must be made upon a reader's mind, psychology 
is evidently needed to explain the processes.

School of Journalism of Columbia University. New York :

STUDYING THE SHORT STORY. By J. Berg Esenwein. 
New York : Hinds, Noble & Eldredge. 



This book contains the first thorough analysis 
of the means by which character, setting, and 
plot produce the results for which the contem- 
porary editor is most willing to exchange his 
check. Professor Pitkin is as dogmatic as he 
is vivacious; in his certainty that the effect 
desired can be accurately defined he allows 
himself unlimited prejudices against all story 
methods which do not conform to his conception 
of narrative efficiency. And yet, since no one 
before has tried to get to the bottom of our 
short-story technique, it is unjust to abuse 
him for a single-minded pursuance of a critical 
method based upon premises which, if narrow, 
are sound. Indeed this is a valuable book. Its 
analyses are keen ; its comments sometimes illu- 
minating; and it should help the writer, even 
when it angers him. 

Nevertheless the book is narrow, and a little 
depressing. The writer is frank in his purpose 
to teach craftmanship rather than art ; and in 
this he does not limit his usefulness, for both 
artist and commercial writer must learn tech- 
nique, and need good books to help them. But 
though one applauds the usefulness of the pro- 
ject, Professor Pitkin's book shares a weakness 
common to every work of this description which 
has appeared in English. He is obsessed by 
the mechanics of short-story writing. In the 
tumult over "effect," "thematic development," 
and " integration," that imaginative interpreta- 
tion of life which is the raison d'etre of fiction 
is but a feeble whisper, seldom heard and soon 
forgotten. It has no emphasis, and so assumes 
no importance in the whole. And thus, not- 
withstanding its admirable practicability, Pro- 
fessor Pitkin's text is an impulse towards 
virtuosity rather than art. 

Mr. Yeats speaks of " wheels and pulleys 
necessary to the effect, but in themselves noth- 
ing," with an indirect reference to contemporary 
drama which might be aptly applied to the com- 
mercialized short story. But Mr. Yeats is an 
extremist, though on the side of genius rather 
than mediocrity. Still, good evidence of the 
false emphasis of Professor Pitkin's book is to 
be found in the impression at closing it that 
any trivial idea if properly handled may make 
a great story, a feeling, we believe, which the 
author was far from wishing to inspire. And 
good evidence of the narrowness of his psycho- 
logically developed criticism springs to sight 
when one notes that, for example, Tolstoi's 
" Master and Man " violates some of the most 
cardinal principles with conspicuous success. 

This book is useful, practical, and, for the

current American story, sound. ^Esthetically 
it is narrow, and perhaps a little blind ; and 
its emphasis is entirely upon skilful mediocrity. 
Skilful mediocrity is perhaps as far as one can 
go in teaching the short story; but it is an 
ideal only for that large and useful class who 
make a business, and a good one, of feeding the 
American imagination with stories that are not 
too humorous, or too subtle, or too satirical, or 
too intense in short, not too good for the 
average among a million subscribers. For the 
new profession of short-story making, Mr. 
Pitkin's book is best adapted; and indeed if 
he had called it " The Business of Commercial 
Short Story Writing : With Suggestions for 
Literary Workers," we should have little to 
offer by way of criticism. 

Mr. Esenwein's book is a brief encyclopaedia 
of the short story, containing some well-selected 
examples garnished with abundant quoted criti- 
cisms, and a critical and biographical sketch for 
each. With this book the student of a given 
story has his critical apparatus at hand when he 
begins to read. The scheme of printing on a 
half-page with space for annotations and com- 
ment is ingenious and probably useful. But 
Mr. Esenwein's own annotations should have 
been pruned. They are somewhat uncritical, 
and occasionally irrelevant. Their position, 
however, like guideposts pointing to a mountain 
view, is undeniably effective.

A woman's The meandering red line running 
journey through northwest and north from Haiphong 
wetter* China. to Tachienlu, on the eastern border 
of Thibet, thence northeast to Chengtu, the capital 
of S/echuen province, and eastward, down the 
Yangtse River to Hangkow, whence it turns again 
north to Peking and thence northwest across the 
desert of Gobi to Verchneudinsk in Siberia, this 
line across the map of eastern Asia marks the long 
lonely journey of an extraordinarily plucky woman. 
And yet Miss Elizabeth Kendall discusses her jour- 
ney in "A Wayfarer in China" (Houghton) as if 
it were little more than the pleasure jaunt of an 
ordinary tourist. A teacher of history by profession 
and instinctively a wanderer and a student of races, 
Miss Kendall desired to see China as nearly as pos- 
sible unaffected by treaty-port influences. She, 
therefore, got into western China by the most direct 
route, and moved north through the two great south- 
western provinces of Yunnan and Szechuen. This 
first portion of her journey as far as Chengtu 
was the most unusual until she reached Kalgan in 



the extreme north of China proper, and undertook 
to cross the desert of Gobi in an American buggy. 
The whole story of her experiences is very enter- 
taining. The absence of dangerous adventures with 
the rough element of the population of western 
China will surprise most readers. Certain it is that 
no Chinese woman could travel across the United 
States alone and report to her Chinese readers that 
she had met with impolite treatment only once, and 
then in a mild form. Miss Kendall found her chair- 
bearers and baggage coolies cheerful, willing, and 
obliging. They extended to her many thoughtful 
courtesies, plucking wild flowers for her by the 
wayside, insisting upon the best accommodations for 
her at the inns, carrying her little Scotch terrier 
whenever his short legs gave out. The uniform 
friendliness between traveller and coolies speaks as 
loudly for the good temper of the American woman 
as for the good nature of the burden-bearers. Miss 
Kendall has many complimentary things to say of 
the Chinese people, and her judgment of the work 
of the missionaries is decidedly favorable. One 
receives from her bird's-eye survey of the western 
Chinese at home a fresh impression of those sub- 
stantial race virtues which the friends of China rely 
upon to insure the Republic a long and honorable 
career. The force of this impression is not at all 
lessened by the rapidity with which Miss Kendall 
accomplished her long journey by chair, ship, pony, 
and buggy; for she brought to the observation of 
country and people trained and mature powers, and 
she shows unusual self-possession, intelligence, and 
sympathy. 

Sociological To most readers history means a 
interpretations record of political developments, an 
of history. account that notes especially the 

activities and policies of rulers, cabinets, and legis- 
latures. There are, however, a number of special 
types, such as literary, economic, and military his- 
tory. Recently the sociologist has begun to write 
history from his own particular point of view, and 
we now also have what claims to be sociological 
history. Mr. J. M. Robertson, a well-known En- 
glish critic, is the author of a new work entitled 
"The Evolution of States" (Putnam), which he 
offers as an illustration of the sociological type of 
history. Mr. Robertson's effort has been to find and 
discuss the great social forces that have directed and 
determined the careers of the more important states. 
These are, he believes, to a large extent economic, 
though he admits that racial differences and the 
strife of ideas have also affected the course of events. 
His work is, therefore, essentially an interpretation ; 
a historian in the accepted sense of the word, Mr. 
Robertson cannot claim to be. He has made no 
study of first-hand materials: he takes the conclu- 
sions of men who have searched the sources, and 
from these he attempts to construct his system of 
interpretation. Where authorities disagree, he ap- 
pears to select the opinion that appeals to him or 
that best suits his purpose ; any effort to test the

[May 1 



correctness of this by documentary investigation is 
not apparent. The author believes that he has found 
a principle "which may safely be brought to bear on 
the study of practical politics, because it is an axiom 
alike of inorganic physics and of biology. . . . This 
is the simple principle that all energy divides osten- 
sibly into forces of attraction and repulsion." His- 
tory is, therefore, the outcome of constant grouping 
and constant strife, strife between classes, between 
religions, and between nations. It is a dangerous 
procedure to apply a single principle to the entire 
course of history, and of this truth Mr. Robertson's 
" Evolution of States " provides an excellent illus- 
tration. His theory appears to fit the facts at every 
point, but it is a carefully selected group of facts. 
And back of the " principle " lie the questions : what 
led to the formation of the contending groups ? what 
in each case was the fundamental cause of the strife? 
To these his "laws of socio-political development" 
do not give sufficient answers. The work, never- 
theless, has its value : it shows that the author has 
thought deeply on social questions in their wider 
aspects; and his views are always interesting and 
often rational and plausible. A little more than one- 
third of the book is devoted to ancient history, to 
the political, economic, and cultural forces of Greece 
and Rome. Another third is given to the Italian 
republics and the lesser European states ; the re- 
mainder is devoted to English history down to the 
eighteenth century. Of the greater European states, 
Austria, France, Germany, and Russia, there is no 
separate discussion. Of particular interest are the 
author's views as to the needs of modern democ- 
racies : " To flourish they must have peace ; they 
must sooner or later practice a scientific and humane 
restraint of population . . . ; they must check in- 
equality, which is the fountain of domestic dispeace ; 
and they must maintain a progressive and scientific 
culture." These conditions he finds generally want- 
ing except, perhaps, in the Scandinavian countries, 
which with " continued peaceful evolution in the 
direction first of democratic federation and further 
of socialization of wealth . . . may reach and keep 
the front rank of civilization," 

A near mew of Mr ' Harry A. Franck has earned 
Panama and the the reputation of " a born story-teller 

Panamanian. an( J a j, orn tramp." His latest book, 

" Zone Policeman 88 : A Close Range Study of the 
Panama Canal and its Workers" (Century Co.), is 
just such a rollicking account of new and eagerly- 
desired experiences as the late George Borup gave 
to an appreciative circle of readers in his North- 
Polar narrative of two years ago. One book takes 
us to the frigid zone, the other to the tropics ; but 
there is in each the same remarkable command of 
apt and expressive slang, the same zestful welcome 
of every fresh experience, the same Yankee adapta- 
bility to whatever of unexpected and nerve-testing 
the day's work may have in store. For about six 
months, apparently, Mr. Franck was on the pay-roll 
of the Isthmian Canal Commission, first as census- 



taker, then as " plain-clothes " man on the police force, 
thus enjoying the best of facilities for seeing things 
in the Zone from the inside. He remarks on an early 
page that " the Zone is no easy dwelling-place for the 
non-employee. Our worthy Uncle of the chin whiskers 
makes it quite plain that, while he may tolerate the 
mere visitor, he does not care to have him hanging 
around; makes it so plain, in fact, that a few weeks 
of sight-seeing on the Zone implies an adamantine 
financial backing." It was his command of Spanish 
that first procured the author his position among the 
servants of our chin-whiskered Uncle, and inciden- 
tally his colloquial readiness in a number of other 
tongues helped him out in his varied experiences 
among the polyglot population of the Zone. Here is 
a passage humorously descriptive of his duties as a 
government detective: "A box billed from New 
York to Peru had been broken open on Balboa 
dock and one bottle of cognac stolen. Unfortu- 
nately the matter was turned over to me so long 
after the perpetration of the dastardly crime that the 
possible culprits among the dock hands had wholly 
recovered from the probable consumption of the 
evidence. But I succeeded in gathering material 
for a splendid type-written report of all I had not 
been able to unearth, to file away among other price- 
less headquarters' archives." The book is lavishly 
illustrated from photographs, and both pictures and 
reading matter are full of entertainment and infor- 
mation. _ 

In * he first issue ? f THE DlAL 
published exactly thirty-three years 

a g O? there appeared from the pen of 
its editor an article on the poetry of Mr. Austin 
Dobson, occasioned by the appearance of his work 
in an American edition. This volume of " Vignettes 
in Rhyme and Other Verses," with its dedication to 
Dr. Holmes and its introduction by Mr. Stedman, 
found wide and immediate favor; but we are glad 
to believe that nowhere was it given more cordial 
welcome than in the pages of THE DIAL. A new 
edition, the ninth, of Mr. Dobson's "Collected 
Poems" (Dutton) has just reached us at this appro- 
priate time. To the "Vignettes in Rhyme" is now 
added the later product of nearly a third of a cen- 
tury, yet the bulk of the volume is not great. Our 
facile versifiers of to-day often publish as much in a 
year or two as Mr. Dobson has produced in a life- 
time, and with a corresponding difference in qual- 
ity. Of the additional group of twenty-seven pieces 
published for the first time in this ninth edition, none 
are new in the sense of having been recently written. 
Indeed, save for a few occasional verses, Mr. Dob- 
son's muse has been quiescent these past five years. 
At three score and ten, the singing time is over, and 
even so mellow-hearted a poet as Mr. Dobson is 
" Not ill-content to stand aside, 
To yield to minstrels fitter 
His singing-robes, his singing-pride, 
His fancies sweet and bitter." 

But alas ! what younger minstrel of to-day is capable 
of wearing those robes with equal grace and honor?

The ability to produce, as well as to enjoy, the sim- 
pler sort of poetry, wherein delicacy and tenderness 
of fancy are wedded to refinement and lucidity of 
form, seems to be fast dying out. Yet nevertheless 
it will probably be long before Austin Dobson fails 
of his fit audience of "thinking hearts," however 
few, whose feeling toward his poetry will always be 
akin to that which he has suggested in his lines on 
the thirteenth century missal, 

' Then a book was still a Book, 
Where a wistful man might look, 
Finding something through the whole, 
Beating like a human soul." 



An American 
traveller 
in India. 



"Who wants more books on India?" 
With this rather daring challenge 
Mr. M. M. Shoemaker opens his 
"foreword" to "Indian Pages and Pictures" (Put- 
nam), and the reviewer has regretfully concluded 
that the attractive looking volume does not furnish 
a satisfactory answer to the rhetorical question. 
Of course India is always interesting, even when it 
is described superficially by a hurried traveller ; and 
no harm is done by a sketchy treatment of selected 
parts, unless the work is taken seriously by the 
author or the untravelled reader. But our present 
writer formally declares that he has tried "to omit 
all with which the readers at home are so well 
acquainted," and ostentatiously passes over the Taj 
Mahal. Yet he records all sorts of well-known 
things, and describes Fatehpur-Sikri and Akbar's 
tomb in such a way as to make it frankly clear that 
he covered them both in the same day, which must 
have been a pretty strenuous effort in appreciation, 
even for one of our most active countrymen. Nor 
is it easy to see why page after page should be filled 
with the petty incidental annoyances of travel and 
shopping, or why the poor old "P. & O." voyages 
should be rehashed to the extent of two chapters. 
Furthermore, the public surely has a right to expect 
that even a " travel-and-place " book should be well 
written, with the material decently organized, and 
with some attention to relevance. It is very discon- 
certing to have an attack on the Parsi disposal of the 
dead interjected into a peaceful chapter on "Akbar's 
Town of Victory." However, it is a pleasure to 
report that the reader will find many interesting 
chapters in the four hundred and sixty-seven pages 
of this volume. By far the most attractive are 
those dealing with the parts of the peninsula in 
which Mr. Shoemaker and his party moved more 
leisurely. In the Northwest and Kashmir he had 
glorious possibilities, and he offers enjoyable read- 
ing under such captions as "The Khyber Pass," 
" Life on a ' Bed of Roses,' " " The Vale of Kashmir," 
and "Magnificent Shalimar." If he had been will- 
ing to take this part of his material, work it over 
carefully, and present it in a smaller volume, he 
would have deserved our gratitude. As it is, one 
can only say that our traveller has added a unit to 
the large number of readable but negligible books 
on India. The illustrations are strikingly good. 



The beaver, intellectually the most 
g^ed of rodents, if not indeed of 
all animal-kind, has a notable book 
devoted to his accomplishments and habits in Mr. 
Enos A. Mills's finely-illustrated and thoroughly 
interesting volume entitled "In Beaver World" 
(Houghton). For twenty-seven years Mr. Mills has 
been a student of beaver life in all parts of North 
America where the animal was to be found, in all 
seasons of the year, and in conditions that allowed 
the most intimate and prolonged observation of the 
marvellous dam-builder and wood-cutter. "Beaver 
have been my neighbors since I was a boy," he says. 
"At any time during the past twenty-five years I 
could go from my cabin on the slope of Long's Peak, 
Colorado, to a number of colonies within fifteen min- 
utes. . . . Sixty-four days in succession I visited 
these colonies, three of them twice daily." Such 
close study has brought its reward in the discovery 
of certain beaver habits or accomplishments unre- 
corded by other naturalists. For example, this ob- 
server has on a few occasions seen the beaver sup- 
plement his ordinary carrying capacity by an adroit 
use of the curiously-flattened tail, which can be drawn 
between the hind legs and pressed against the belly 
in such a way as to hold a lump of mud or a small 
bundle of sticks. The beaver is man's friend, the 
first of conservationists in point of time, a strict 
vegetarian, easily domesticated, and an agreeable 
and interesting pet when thus tamed and cared for. 
Few readers of Mr. Mills's account of beaver habits 
and beaver industries can fail to agree with him in 
ascribing something very like reason to this remark- 
able rodent. Indeed, no less an authority than Mr. 
Romanes, whom Mr. Mills quotes, finds himself 
forced to grant that the beaver shows the possession 
both of "faculties undoubtedly instinctive" and of 
"faculties no less undoubtedly intelligent." A bibli- 
ography of beaver literature in English, inconsider- 
able in quantity as yet, is appended by Mr. Mills to 
his book, which itself will rank among the foremost 
works on the subject. 

That Ruskin was one of the most kind 
and helpful and encouraging of men 
to anyone of earnest purpose who 
sought his personal counsel, is a fact of which, as 
time goes on, we are constantly receiving new proofs. 
The latest witness is provided in the beautiful quarto 
volume called "Homes and Haunts of Ruskin" 
(Macmillan). Sir Edward T. Cook, the editor and 
biographer of Ruskin, has supplied the letter-press; 
but, as he explains in his preface, the book really owes 
its origin to the choice illustrations twenty-eight in 
color and sixteen in black and white, reproduced 
from drawings by Miss E. M. B. Warren. When 
still a very young girl, Miss Warren had the benefit 
of art lessons, encouragement, and commissions from 
Ruskin. After his death, she conceived the happy 
and pious idea of making an artistic pilgrimage in 
Ruskin's footsteps to the places where he had lived or 
which he had loved. Although Ruskin did not travel

widely, he knew a few places thoroughly. He was, 
by adoption, a child of the Lake Country, as he 
himself puts it, "a Cumberland-built soul"; as a 
child, he had two well-loved homes in Scotland; a 
year in which he did not see the mountains of Switzer- 
land or of Savoy was considered i: ill-spent; he had 
the artist's eye for the pleasant lands of provincial 
France; and as for Italy, especially Venice, he may 
almost be said to have Discovered it to the modern 
world. Although attracted to Venice, in the first 
instance, by love of Byron, his Venetian studies soon 
opened his eyes to the fact that Byron's view of Venice 
was melodramatic and by no means accurate. The 
significance of art, and especially of architecture, as 
an historical document was what governed his own 
work and has made him the vade mecum of all 
visitors to Venice since. But, at the last, the first 
love conquered, he heard and obeyed the call 
of his own Lake Country. At Brantwood, on the 
shore of Coniston Lake, he spent the last thirty years 
of his life ; in the churchyard, on the opposite shore, 
he rests, as he had wished it, "beneath the crags of 
Coniston." All of these places and many more are 
delightfully pictured by Miss Warren and described 
by Sir Edward Cook, in the present volume. A more 
fascinating book for Ruskin lovers would be difficult 
to imagine. 

The horrors Mr ' Francis McCullagh, English war 
of a recent correspondent with the Italian army 

inglorious war. in Tripoli, and author of "Italy's 
War for a Desert" (F. G. Browne & Co.), is no 
admirer of the Italian as a soldier. "The Italian 
soldier is a poltroon," he roundly asserts. " When 
not a poltroon he is an Anarchist or a mutineer." 
Mr. McCullagh's book, "dedicated to my colleagues 
and fellow-correspondents, British, German, Austro- 
Hungarian, Russian, and French, who were not afraid 
to tell the truth," is an emphatically anti-Italian ac- 
count of the late conflict between Italy and Turkey, 
illustrated and enforced by things seen and heard 
which certainly do not redound to the glory of 
those who undertook the "pirate-raid," as Hamilcar 
Cipriani himself designated the Tripolitan expedi- 
tion. Both the bone of contention between the two 
disputants was of little worth to Italy, the author 
declares, and the manner of its snatching from its 
ancient possessor was disgraceful and, in some of its 
details, unspeakably revolting. Incidents in plenty 
are supplied to prove the inhumanity of the invad- 
ing army but is war ever other than inhumane? 
and the upholders of Italy's policy and practice in 
the whole affair will find themselves hard pushed 
to make out a good case for the defence. More 
than once is Mr. Richard Bagot especially, whose 
recent book on "The Italians of Today" contains a 
warm word in deprecation of just such assaults as 
Mr. McCullagh delivers, called to account for his 
alleged refusal to admit the truth. There are two 
sides to every question, of course, and readers of 
"Italy's War for a Desert" will do well to read 
also Mr. Bagot and other writers of pro-Italian 



sympathies, although at best the sanguinary struggle 
for the possession of Tripoli can never be made 
to appear as anything but a deplorable mistake. 
Many illustrations from photographs, mute witnesses 
to the truth of Mr. McCullagh's careful narrative, 
are to be found in the book.

shall mankind trust its intuition rather than its 
reason? On ultimate analysis, does the tremen- 
dously expedient, the hypothesis of God, for ex- 
ample, prove to be the same as the actually true? 
Is there any final relation between the "will to 
believe" and objective reality? Can a belief whose 
falsity is recognized by keener intellects be justi- 
fiably and helpfully propagated among men and 
women of less enlightenment? These and kindred 
questions are the subjects of discussion in " Vernon 
Lee's " latest book, which bears the significant title, 
"Vital Lies" (Lane). " Pragmatism " in philosophy, 
"Modernism" and "Anthropological Apologetics" 
in religion, and the "Syndicalist Myth" in social 
morals are passed in searching review and con- 
demned in all their ramifications as phases of "Ob- 
scurantism," theoretical or applied. Unquestionably 
many readers will lay the book aside as only another 
clever expression of agnosticism or materialistic 
realism. To others, and the present reviewer among 
them, these two volumes must seem to contain not 
only criticisms that are generally sound but also 
many suggestions that are constructively helpful. 
By thoughtful readers of either class the work will 
be pronounced the product of a pen that has achieved 
an admirable style, of a personality that is keenly 
alive to human problems, and of a 'cultivated mind 
that has an enviable knowledge of art and general 
literature, as well as of philosophic thought from the 
layman's point of view. One will seldom take equal 
pleasure in reading five hundred controversial pages 
on similar themes. The volumes are pleasing in 
exterior form, with their simple binding and legible 
type; but one notices an unpardonable number of 
slips in the proofreading, particularly in the quota- 
tions from French authors.

volume on "The Public Library: Its Place in Our 
Educational System" (Toronto: William Briggs). 
"The thesis is herein maintained," he explains in 
his preface, "that the public library in Ontario is 
historically and logically a part of the educational 
system of the Province" a proposition not very 
difficult to prove, surely. In the author's prelimin- 
ary historical sketch of the public-library movement 
in the world at large and in his own part of it in 
particular, the fewness of libraries in Canada outside 
of Ontario is brought to the reader's attention. In 
fact, the public-library movement in Canada has until 
very recently confined itself to this more favored 
province, beyond whose borders there are probably 
not twenty-five Canadian free libraries. Mr. Hardy's 
second chapter discusses the purposes of the public 
library, then he considers its "general activities," 
its "special activities in relation to education," and 
finally some essentials to its success. A short bibli- 
ography follows, after which are appended papers 
read at late meetings of the Ontario Library Asso- 
ciation. Views and plans of a few recent library 
buildings, five in Ontario and one in Maine, are 
interspersed. Although, as in so much of library 
literature, there is in the book, perhaps necessarily 
and properly, a certain tendency to prove the obvi- 
ous and elucidate the self-evident, it is a handy little 
manual and conveys some information not too famil- 
iar to library workers on this side of the Canadian 
boundary. 

BRIEFER MENTION. 



Dr. Herbert H. Gowen's "Outline History of China " 
{Sherman, French & Co.) probably covers the thousands 
of years of Chinese history as satisfactorily as the task 
could be accomplished in less than two hundred pages. 
It is to be questioned, however, whether the object for 
which the book was written could be attained in less 
than twice the space allowed. The author desired to 
interest American readers in the history of China prior 
to the modern period of European influence, but the 
limitation of space forces him to reduce his account dur- 



ing one half of that earlier period to a mere thread of 
dynasties and rulers. The latter half is more entertain- 
ing, and the writer could have added much to the respect 
of Americans for China had he enlarged his scope. 

Dr. Henry Osborn Taylor's important and exhaustive 
work on " Ancient Ideals," described in its sub-title 
as " a study of intellectual and spiritual growth from 
early times to the establishment of Christianity," is now 
reissued in a second edition (Macmillan). Originally 
published seven years ago, the work was reviewed in our 
issue of June 16, 1897. Save for a few verbal changes, 
no revision has been attempted in this new edition, as 
the author feels that this " might have impaired the 
equal temper and conviction which seem to me to give 
the book unity." 

Among the authentic collections of poems of the Civil 
War is a Southern piece written just after the close of 
the great struggle, entitled "The Land Where We Were 
Dreaming." Its author was then a young Virginian, 
afterwards Judge Daniel B. Lucas, whose recent death is 
commemorated by the publication (Richard G. Badger ) 
of a volume of his poems under the title of the one 
just named, which is the most famous and significant of 
his pieces. The volume is supplied with an apprecia- 
tive Introduction by Professor Charles W. Kent of the 
University of Virginia ; and some interesting Notes by 
the poet's daughter, Miss Virginia Lucas, attest the filial 
devotion to which the appearance of the volume is 
doubtless due. 

Mrs. Mary Ridpath-Mann, who claims her father's 
love of history as an inheritance, has written a pleasant 
little account of four " Royal Women " (McClurg) in 
support of her claim. The four women dealt with are 
Queen Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots, Marie Antoin- 
ette, and the Empress Josephine. Each is treated very 
simply and very briefly, with no attempt to tell more of 
the life than is necessary in order to give a vivid picture 
of the personality. The book is so attractively written 
that it might be read with pleasure and profit even by 
those - if there were any such who had previously 
known nothing of these romantic lives. It owes its 
charm largely to the fact that the author has visited 
almost every locality mentioned, at least as far as 
England and France are concerned. The volume is 
illustrated with about fifty reproductions of paintings, 
photographs, etc. 

In their volume of "Representative Essays in Modern 
Thought " (American Book Co.), Messrs. Harrison Ross 
Steeves and Frank Humphrey Ristine have brought 
together nineteen more or less classic approaches to the 
most important phases of modern thought, ranging in 
point of time from Mill's " Of the Liberty of Thought 
and Discussion " to Dr. Charles Fletcher Dole's "Truth 
and Immortality." In some instances both sides of a 
moot question are presented in opposing essays, as in 
the case of W. K. Clifford's " The Ethics of Belief " 
and William James's " The Will to Believe," and in 
Matthew Arnold's " Sweetness and Light" and Huxley's 
" Science and Culture." The purpose of the compilers 
has been to provide a basis for composition which would 
" serve the purpose of not merely developing a formal 
accuracy in writing, but of expanding the student's ideas 
and increasing the number of his points of contact with 
vital questions." But a great many readers outside the 
classroom should welcome a volume which embraces so 
much material of the first importance, gathered from 
such scattered sources.

NOTES. 



Mr. William English Walling, author of " Socialism 
as It Is," has in press with the Macmillan Co. a new 
volume dealing with "The Larger Aspects of Socialism." 
Still another eye-witness's account of recent events 
in the Balkans is promised in a volume entitled " With 
the Bulgarian Staff," by Mr. Noel Buxton, which the 
Macmillan Co. will publish. 

" The New Tendency in Art," a little book by Mr. 
Henry R. Poore dealing with the various " isms " now 
agitating the art public, is announced for early issue 
by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

The first instalment of a new serial by Mrs. Humphry 
Ward, entitled "The Coryston Family," appears in 
" Harper's Magazine " for May. It is a novel of to-day, 
and is described as " a love story pure and simple." 

An interesting collection of " Sentence Pictures," 
from the writings of Mr. Will Levington Comfort, has 
been made up in pamphlet form for gratuitous distribu- 
tion by Mr. Comfort's publishers, the J. B. Lippincott Co. 
Miss Evelyn Underbill, whose volume on "Mysti- 
cism " has won a prominent place in philosophical litera- 
ture, has prepared a new work in the same field "The 
Mystic Way," which Messrs. Button will publish imme- 
diately. 

A biographical and critical study of George Meredith, 
by Mr. Constantine Photiades, is announced by Messrs. 
Scribner. The opening chapter records the visit of the 
author to Box Hill, and his detailed interview with 
Meredith. 

Mr. Arthur Jerome Eddy's " The New Competition," 
a detailed analysis of and argument for cooperation in 
mercantile and industrial pursuits, will be re-issued 
immediately by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. in a new 
and cheaper edition. 

Under the title of " Zones of the Spirit," Messrs. 
Putnam will soon publish an English translation of 
August Strindberg's Blau Buck, his last work. The 
translation has been prepared by Mr. Claud Field, M.A., 
and Mr. Arthur Babillotte contributes an introduction. 
A new refutation of " The Baconian Heresy " has 
been made by Mr. J. M. Robertson in a volume to be 
published at once by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. " No 
Baconian can ever raise his head again after reading 
this book," assert the publishers, who are evidently not 
familiar with the Baconian's peculiar psychology. 

In addition to the selection from Goldwin Smith's cor- 
respondence now being made by Mr. Arnold Haultain, 
we a.re also to have before long a volume of personal 
reminiscences by Mr. Haultain to be entitled " Goldwin 
Smith as I Knew Him." These reminiscences will deal 
with the last twenty years of Goldwin Smith's life. 

Quite the best thing in the " The English Review " 
for April is Mr. Arnold Bennett's " Seeing Life," the 
first of a series of essays on " The Story Teller's 
Craft." Two long poems of fine quality are contrib- 
uted by Messrs. W. H. Davies and John Helston; 
while Mr. R. A. Scott-James has a thoughtful discus- 
sion of " Literature as a Fine Art." 

A second volume of collected essays by William 
Graham Sumner is announced by the Yale University 
Press under the title of " Earth Hunger and Other 
Essays." The volume is planned to include all Professor 
Sumner's work as yet unpublished, and every effort is 
being made to make it complete, even to occasional 



utterances, often unsigned. A complete bibliography 
will be appended to the work. As in the case of "War 
and Other Essays," Professor Albert G. Keller will act 
as editor. 

The Countess Marie Larisch's forthcoming autobio- 
graphy, while somewhat in the nature of a chronique 
scandaleuse, is likely to prove of considerable legitimate 
interest. The author is a niece of the late Empress 
Elizabeth of Austria, being the daughter of Duke Lud- 
wig of Bavaria, the favorite brother of the Empress. 
Messrs. Putnam will publish the book immediately in 
an English translation entitled " My Past." 

Clarence Walter Ayer, librarian of the Cambridge 
(Mass.) Public Library since 1904, died suddenly at his 
home on the morning of April 12. Teaching, library 
work, and music had been his chief interests since his 
graduation from Harvard in 1885. A prof essorship of 
English at Western Reserve University from 1892 to 
1894, the care of the reference department of the Har- 
vard University Library for the following four years, 
and after that the post of librarian at the Brockton 
(Mass.) Public Library until 1904, were the principal 
positions filled by him before assuming the duties which 
he was still discharging at the time of his death. Born 
at Haverhill in 1862, he was cut off in the prime of his 
powers. 

Lester F. Ward, one of the most widely known of 
American writers on scientific subjects, died April 18 in 
Washington. He was born in 1841, at Joliet, 111. After 
serving in the Civil War, and graduating from Colum- 
bian (now George Washington) University, he went 
into government work first in the Treasury Depart- 
ment, then with the geological survey. His published 
works include the following: "Guide to Flora of Wash- 
ington and Vicinity," " Dynamic Sociology," " Sketch of 
Palffiobotany," " Synopsis of the Flora of the Laramie 
Group," " Types of the Laramie Flora," " Geographical 
Distribution of Fossil Plants," " Psychic Factors of Civ- 
ilization," " Psychological Basis of Social Economics," 
" Political Ethics of Spencer," " Principles of Sociol- 
ogy?" " Outlines of Sociology," " Sociology and Eco- 
nomics," and " Pure Sociology." 

To the lay reader, the most interesting feature of 
" The Hibbert Journal " for April is Mr. John Gals- 
worthy's suggestive discussion of " The New Spirit in 
the Drama." This new spirit is Sincerity "fidelity 
to mood, to impression, to self." There is the usual 
strong array in this issue of articles on religious and 
philosophical subjects. We note in Mr. John A. Hob- 
son's essay, " How Is Wealth to Be Valued ? " an 
instance of misquotation good (or bad) enough to de- 
serve recording. Evidently wishing to quote Brown- 
ing's lines, 

" Oh, the little more, and how much it is ! 
And the little less, and what worlds away ! " 

Mr. Hobson gives us this poetic gem : 

" A little more, and what a difference ! 

A little less, and oh ! what worlds apart ! " 
The latest of several new periodicals devoted to the 
interests of poetry is " Poetry and Drama," a quarterly 
edited by Mr. Harold Monro and published from his 
Poetry Bookshop in London. The first issue, just put 
forth, makes an imposing appearance, and presents an 
interesting list of articles, reviews, and verse. Like 
its English contemporary, " The Poetry Review," Mr. 
Monro's venture aims more at discussion of poetry 
than the presentation of original verse. This plan

seems to us likelier to advance the interests of the muse 
than such exploitation of mediocre bards as has so far 
found too large a place in the poetry magazines pub- 
lished in this country. Unlike our own ventures, also, 
the two English reviews are dignified and handsome in 
appearance, as well as impeccable typographically. 
They deserve the cordial support of American poetry- 
lovers. 

News reaches us as we go to press of the death, on 
April 27, of Andrew Sloan Draper, first commissioner 
of education in New York State, and for ten years 
(1894-1904) president of the University of Illinois. 
He was born at Waterford, New York, in 1848, gradu- 
ating from the old Albany academy and Albany Law 
school of Union University. During his practice of law, 
lasting fifteen years, he served as member of the state 
legislature. In 1885 he was appointed member of the 
court of commissioners for the Alabama claims, and on 
conclusion of the commission's work became state super- 
intendent of public instruction. This post he held for 
six years, then became superintendent of public instruc- 
tion in Cleveland, which position he left in 1894 to go to 
the University of Illinois. The highest educational post 
New York City had to offer him after the unification of 
the boroughs he declined after election, leaving Illinois 
only to take the work as the head of the New York state 
schools. For more than ten years he had been a mem- 
ber of the board of United States Indian Commissioners. 
Besides numerous published addresses, he was the au- 
thor of "The Rescue of Cuba" and "American Edu- 
cation."

lishers. You will receive more attention and 
quicker service at the same prices.

month reviews and criticisms of new busi- 
ness books that appear. Impartial infor- 
mation about the contents of business books

A BOOK OF VITAL SIGNIFICANCE 

The Children in the Shadow 

By ERNEST K. COULTER. Introduction by JACOB A. RIIS. 
Judge Franklin Chase Hoyt, of the Children's Court of New 
York, says: "It is brimful of real life. There are graphic pen 
pictures showing ' the three delinquents ' the child, the parent, 
and the community, as they actually are; pictures from what 
Mr. Coulter properly calls the world's greatest social clinic. 
The worst offender is, as Mr. Coulter point* out, the community. 
But with all, a big stream of good humor and hopefulness runs 
through the book, the hopefulness that reflects an awakening 
sense of responsibility to our neighbors and brothers. THE 
WORLD SHOULD BE BETTER FOR READING ' THE 
CHILDREN IN THE SHADOWS "

Through Siberia, an Empire in 
the Making 

By RICHARDSON L. WRIGHT and BASSETT DIGBY 
The authors of this book crossed the breadth of Siberia with

pine forests where the wolf packs are still a menace, and by boat 
down the ice- choked Shilka and Amur Rivers to the Manchurian 
border. They saw the real Siberia, shorn of all glamor of romance 
and fiction. Illustrated. $2.00 net. Postage 16 cents.

The indestructible character of life must be explained morally as well as mechan-

The Call of Science to the Church H. E. JORDAN 

The church has put too much emphasis on the future life and has not taken 
into account the things of this world. Progress means change and the church 
stands still. Eugenics, the new science, offers the church her great opportunity.

The Spirituality of the East and the West STANWOOD COBB 

Every one of the great world religions has arisen in the East and had its concep-

mind. The West is ever striving for mastery over matter. Either without 
the other is but half right.

LIST OF NEW BOOKS . . 426 



FEANCIS FISHER BROWNE, founder of THE 
DIAL, and its Editor from the first issue (May, 
1880) to the present, died at Santa Barbara, 
California, on May 11, after a long illness. A 
sketch of his life and work, with a supplemental 
reproduction of a recent portrait, will be given 
in our next issue. 



THE PUBLISHER AND THE READER. 

Book publishers naturally wish to sell their 
books, and, as a rule, we believe that they wish 
to publish the best books that can be sold at a 
reasonable profit. They have not yet, for the 
most part, sunk to the level of those newspaper 
publishers who avow no higher aim than that of 
providing "what the public wants," or what a 
mean conception of its tastes makes them think 
it wants. Even in their case, we fancy that the 
wish, rather than any exhibition of the public's 
real desire, is father to the thought. A book 
publisher is doubtless glad when his list is found 
to contain a best-seller, but deep down in his 
consciousness there is a feeling of disgust at the 
public taste which has thus singled out a work 
which he knows to be vastly inferior to many 
others on his list. And his satisfaction in the 
pecuniary returns from the sale of this rubbish 
lies not so much in the dollars that it supplies 
as in the knowledge that these dollars will enable 
him to keep on publishing his other and better 
books, even at a loss. Many are the publishers 
who have undertaken costly ventures based 
upon the intrinsic merit of the works alone, and 
meaning at the best returns so slow and scanty 
as to make their publication a long uncertainty, 
if not a certain final deficit. Such a publisher 
neither repines nor grumbles; he simply casts 
about for enough popular stuff of the kind that 
sells to keep his business afloat, and permit him 
to continue his indulgence in the luxury of 
doing a real intellectual service to that part of 
the public which can appreciate it. 

Mr. George P. Brett, in some notes on pub- 
lishing recently contributed to "The Atlantic 
Monthly," informs us that, whereas in 1901 



402 



THE DIAJL 



[May 16 



eight thousand volumes were produced in this 
country, the number became thirteen thousand 
in 1910, and seems to be steadily increasing. 
This is not surprising, in view of our increasing 
population, but it is surprising to learn that the 
book trade is not appreciably greater in volume 
than it was ten years ago. The book-reading 
public seems to be " a more or less constant one 
in point of numbers," not appearing to "grow 
in proportion to the general growth of the popu- 
lation," and especially " its growth is not nearly 
commensurate with the growth of the population 
in education and wealth, with the accompanying 
increase in leisure and general culture." If this 
is so, the publisher is an object of pity, for the 
gross amount of his sales must be applied to a 
fifty per cent increase of his costs. The author 
is in similar case, because he must now write 
three books to earn the royalties that formerly 
accrued from two. Yet neither publisher nor 
author is discouraged to the point of giving up, 
and the fecundity of the latter continues to be 
amazing. Of his output, 

" The printed part, though far too large, is less 
Than that which yet unprinted waits the press," 

for Mr. Brett informs us that "the number of 
books that appear in print is usually only about 
two per cent of the total number of manuscripts 
submitted to the publishers for examination." 
This must mean, we fancy, what one publishing 
house does with works offered it, not taking into 
account the fact that the rejected ninety-eight 
per cent go the rounds until many of them at 
last grope their way to the daylight. One who 
knows what traps are baited for unwary ama- 
teur authors, and what incredible stuff actually 
conies to an imprint, is loath to believe that there 
still remains a submerged forty-nine fiftieths 
of all the "literature" that gets as far as the 
manuscript or type- written stage. 

Obviously, the publishers as a class have their 
choice between two courses of action. Either 
they should cut down the number of their books 
until they publish no more of them than the 
stationary reading public will buy in quantities 
assuring a reasonable profit, or they must con- 
trive means to enlarge that public. It is cap- 
able of indefinite enlargement, if only one knew 
how to set about the task. The essential prob- 
lem is that of the distribution of books, and to 
this Mr. Brett mainly directs his attention. Of 
course, there is advertising, but few publishers 
seem to have learned how to advertise with dis- 
crimination and effectively. The hit-or-miss 
methods now in vogue do not accomplish the 
desired purpose, and the waste resulting from 



advertisements in the wrong places is enormous. 
Contracts are made with hundreds of news- 
papers which exert no appreciable influence 
over the public that desires to read books ; and 
these advertisements, although cheap in terms 
of money, are dear in relation to the returns 
from them. " My eyes have become trained," 
says Mr. Brett, " until I think I can say that I 
never see the advertisements in my morning 
newspaper. Perhaps this is a peculiarity of 
mine, but I suspect it is becoming general with 
the public." Of course, advertising in the better 
class of magazines, and in the journals largely 
devoted to literature, is another matter ; they 
make a special appeal to the book-buying public, 
and their advertisements of books are a part of 
their reading contents which every subscriber 
would miss were it not generously furnished. 

The writer deplores the fact that good books 
are no longer helped on their way, as they 
formerly were, by being made the subjects of 
general conversation. Once, "there were, in 
considerable numbers, among the general public, 
book-lovers whose chief delight consisted in the 
discovery of the new author and the new book 
of merit. The discoverer would tell all his 
friends of his find, to the great advantage of the 
publisher and author. Many a dinner-table 
in these days was made pleasant by such book- 
ish talk. It is, alas, very rare to-day. The 
late Goldwin Smith, the last time the writer 
saw him in New York, remarked that he had 
not heard a book mentioned at a dinner-table 
for several years." The last statement is ex- 
tremely significant, and means a noteworthy 
decline in the intellectual interests of society, 
for it will hardly be urged that the subjects of 
the conversations that formerly had to do with 
books have anything like the same stimulating 
intellectual quality. Automobiles and airships 
and athletics are not exactly the themes that en- 
courage readers of the sort we wish to multiply. 

The conditions of our feverish modern life do 
not tend to produce serious readers, and it is a 
wonder that the number of them remains even 
stationary. There are too many distractions, 
especially for the young, who regard sitting 
down with a book as extremely "slow." More- 
over, the reading matter that is brought to their 
attention consists mostly of snippets, and what 
reading habits they form are hardly worth ac- 
quiring. The picture supplants the printed page, 
and the faculty for serious reading becomes 
atrophied. " The kinematograph is one of the 
most powerful energies yet devised for the de- 
bauchery of our common stock of imagination,"

says "The Saturday Review," and it is probable 
that this evil more than counterbalances the 
educational benefits that the prevalence of the 
moving-picture bestows. The illustrated sec- 
tions of the newspaper catch the child's atten- 
tion, and keep it from the dull columns of print 
that might contribute to his fund of knowledge 
and his power of thought. The popular maga- 
zine is for him first a picture-book, next a story 
book, and last of all an agency for the cultiva- 
tion of his mind. The degenerative process 
begins in the home at a very early age the 
age in which our more fortunate elders were 
reading the Hollo books and the injury has 
become almost irreparable before the parents 
realize that the plague has fastened itself upon 
their offspring. There is little hope of recon- 
stituting a reading public like that of the last 
generation when neither the home nor the school 
does its duty by the young in guarding their 
minds from the sources of infection. 

Mr. Brett has not much to offer in the way 
of constructive suggestions. He thinks that 
books ought to be published at lower prices, and 
blames their authors for refusing to accept re- 
duced rates of royalty. Here his logic is clearly 
at fault, for there is no reason why a fifty-cent 
book should not bear the same rate as a two- 
dollar one. Suppose the experiment be made 
of republishing a book in a cheap edition at one- 
fourth of the original price, is there any suffi- 
cient reason why the same ten or twenty per 
cent of the lower price should not be ear-marked 
as the author's share and allowed for in the 
estimates of cost ? Classified card-catalogues of 
the reading public, as prepared by many pub- 
lishers here and abroad, are recommended as a 
means of calling the attention of individuals to 
the works in which they are likely to be inter- 
ested. This is undoubtedly better than indis- 
criminate advertising, and we may expect it to 
come more and more into use. The postal 
authorities now discriminate against books in 
two ways, in favor of magazines and miscellan- 
eous merchandise, and this is an evil that surely 
ought to be remedied. Perhaps the most im- 
portant thing that the publishers should work 
for is the rehabilitation of the book store, which 
is rapidly becoming extinct. But the funda- 
mental thing is to educate the public to realize 
that a house without books is an unfurnished 
house, and that a household of children who do 
not see books read and hear them familiarly 
discussed every day is a household that is neg- 
lectful of its paramount duty to itself and to 
the rising generation. 



A REPUBLIC OF BOOKS* 



The average man, the man who does not read 
anything but newspapers, thinks of books as the 
sealed packets of an exotic intelligence, which it will 
not do him much good to open. He knows nothing 
of the fine salt-reek in the pages of Hakluyt, or the 
hearty strain of the ballad-book, 

" It fell about the Lammas tide 
When the moor-men win their hay." 

But by this neglect he leaves unused his sixth 
sense, that which quickens all the others, that 
which can add rooms to his house and a region to 
his brain. If over-night he has been in Nantucket 
with the American Farmer, De Crevecceur, or walk- 
ing the Edinburgh Canongate with Sir Walter Scott, 
he has a fresh vista to his street when he turns out 
in the morning. 

In this faith, some six or seven years ago, we 
set out to build our new republic a Library-in- 
Being, that should have in view throughout the 
play of literature upon life. It did not signify 
where we began, so long as we took for the begin- 
ning a handful of live books, authors who had 
stood the racket of time and the changes of fashion. 
Once chosen, their elective affinities would do the 
rest. We pitched, as it happened, first on Boswell, 
since his Doctor Johnson is not only a man, but a 
whole tract of human nature, with London and Fleet 
Street for a background, and the Big Dictionary for 
a sign. A better inductor to the commonwealth 
than Dr. Johnson could hardly be desired. As we 
read his biography, he starts up in the book, more 
alive than most of us who think we live. One 
Monday morning, to be exact October 4, 1779, 
Boswell relates how he went to see the Doctor 
before he was yet out of bed. "He sent for me to 
his bedside," says Boswell, and seemed "as pleased 
as if he had been in the gaiety of youth, and called 
out briskly, 'Frank, go and get coffee and let us 
breakfast in splendour!'" A few days later and a 
little discussion of the Art of Coaxing a Fire leads 
to a piece of folk-lore, and to the aphorism, "Be 
as wise as you can." This is from the life, and 
human nature is re-kindled in the page. Another 
page, and Dr. Johnson recommends to Boswell a 
Greek Lexicon, a translation of the first book of the 
Iliad, and Hesiod. In fact, while he was a great 
viveur, a man who lived for life, and never book- 
ish in the dull way, he loved a cordial writer, said 
" the chief glory of every people arises from its au- 
thors," and waxed eloquent over the life and death 
of words, "some budding, some falling away." 

We did not wish, however, to construct a Dr. 
Johnson Academy of Letters, nor a Boswell group 
in the Senate. We tried to keep in mind the sort 
of young man who once wrote confidentially to say 
that " his specialty was the universe." So we went 

*This article, written by the editor of "Everyman's 
Library," is a statement of the editorial plan and purpose 
of that enterprise. 



THE DIAL 



[May 16 



on boldly, knitting up antiquity with our new time, 
and adding Athens to Boston, and Emerson to my 
Lord Verulam, and in our second relay contrived 
even to make near neighbors of that most engaging 
book of wit and wisdom, "The Autocrat of the 
Breakfast Table," and Plato's "Republic." 

From the last-named work we took a parable, 
that of the transcendent thirst, the desire in the soul 
for something more than meat or drink. There 
are authors who create this thirst, and if biography 
is specially good for the purpose, so is fiction. Your 
real novel is an admirable incentive: familiar his- 
tory itself, it leads to history. We soon had Balzac 
on the list, opening the great human comedy as he 
conceived it with his Peau de Chagrin, which is 
the fable of Everyman's strife with death and time ; 
just as Everyman looks for his own plight of memory 
and age in Rip Van Winkle or in Colonel Newcome. 
Balzac holds a master-key to the treasury of the 
republic. What did he say in the confession of 
faith that opens his encyclopaedia of human nature? 
"I attach to common everyday facts and acts of 
mere individual lives, and to their causes and prin- 
ciples, the importance which historians have hitherto 
ascribed to the events of public national life." He 
expanded this idea in constructing his history. He 
wished, in fact, to construct a republic all of his own 
making. "My work," said he proudly, "has its 
geography, as it has its genealogy and its families, 
its places and things, its heraldry, its nobles and 
commoners, workmen and peasants, senators and 
dandies; its army, too, in short a whole world of 
its own." 

What Balzac tried to do in his single discharge, 
it ought to be possible to carry out, we thought, in 
the wider circles of human interest. Take Pepys's 
Diary, for instance. There is a book that is centrif- 
ugal : you do not get far in its pages without being 
infected by the gossip's curiosity. What of the plays 
he went to? " Bartholomew's Fair," by Ben Jonson, 
which he saw more than once; or Beaumont and 
Fletcher's "Philaster," or Shakespeare's "Twelfth 
Night." 

Pepys, though living under Charles II., and aware 
of Nell Gwynn, did very well as a citizen of the lit- 
erary commonwealth. And it was easy, while the 
theatres were in demand, to move from English to 
Greek drama. ^Eschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, had 
followed as a matter of course, and we presently 
found it necessary to put Ibsen by Euripides. We 
would have followed Aristophanes with George 
Bernard Shaw, and Shaw with Synge, but for re- 
strictions of copyright, against which the free spirits 
that are in books mutiny in vain. But we were able 
to map out other town-lands with some completeness. 
We could have Grote's "Greece," and Finlay's, to 
eke out our spiritual Athens. We could build around 
Gibbon's "Rome" with Sismondi's "Italian Repub- 
lics," and Macchiavelli could have his vital supple- 
ment and counterblast in Mazzini. As the scheme 
developed, it became clear that the value of the 
structural idea on which it was ultimately to rest 



had not been exaggerated. Our silent republicans 
were in their way very effective. They made their 
colony in every quarter of the known world. They 
seemed of themselves to make their own groups and 
installations, as if to reaffirm Emerson's theory of a 
new dynamic quality of mind that travelled by day 
and night, moving in concentric circles. By their 
law of interfusion, the spirit in each great author 
found out its congenial spirit in another, and the 
acquisition of truth and .reality in any one quarter 
was proved "so much good to the commonwealth of 
souls." 

The one portion of the commonalty which we 
feared the average man was most likely to neglect 
was that of Philosophy. Everyman finds something 
alarming in the idea of Plato, something disturbing 
in the mere notion of taking up a book by Rene* 
Descartes. Yet who that lights on an account of 
the life Descartes spent as a soldier in the Low 
Countries camp life with a mixture of fighting and 
high thinking is satisfied to pause there ? A page 
of military strategy, leading on to a question of the 
structure of the stars and the divine proportions 
of the human body, may serve to kindle curiosity ; 
and then the reader, if he have any intellectual 
spunk, will be bound to explore the " Meditations " 
and the " Discourse on Method " for himself. In 
1619, the author of those works joined the army of 
Maximilian on the Danube, and there, he tells us, 
he passed the greatest day of his life, " being full of 
enthusiasm and having discovered the basis of true 
science." That is a personal revelation to draw the 
spirit of a Descartes close to those other free spirits, 
books and men, on whose effect the fortune of the 
literary state, invisible and spiritual, rests. From 
Descartes it is an inevitable step that takes one to a 
volume of Spinoza, or to a Bishop Berkeley who saw 
the external world as dependent for its very exist- 
ence upon the ideal. To compare Berkeley's " New 
Theory of Vision " with the pages in which Rene" 
Descartes discussed the ideas of corporeal and incor- 
poreal substance and the ideas of place and space is 
to arrive at a new sensation of the world by which 
man is environed, and the modes by which he is con- 
ditioned. On this base of relative authors, with what 
may be called Literary Architecture, or something 
akin to it, we reared our expanding walls. To go 
to Rome in Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar," or to 
Paris in Balzac's " Ce*sar Birotteau," to take up the 
" Little Flowers " of St. Francis, or the Speeches of 
Abraham Lincoln, was clue enough, we believed, to 
bring any man and every man within the structural 
lines. And once within them he was lost, or 
saved. The silent republicans had him at their 
mercy. He must submit to their law, and become 
wise as Plato, multiple as Shakespeare, impulsive as 
Burns, in spite of himself. 

This conspiracy against the literary diffidence of 
the huge public was associated very closely with the 
two main ideas that lay behind the whole scheme: 
One, that Everyman (the typical sensual "Modern 
Man" of Whitman's poem) should be able to turn to

the Library for his congenial or predestinate Book 
and find it there. The other, that every Book should 
have its correlatives, and its copesmate, in the struc- 
ture. This may seem to breathe an air of trans- 
cendentalism ; but in fact it is only another way of 
applying the democratic idea in the literary arena. 
We consulted the crowd, and believed in the instincts 
and the appetite of men and women for sheer intel- 
ligence. Let them touch the live circuit anywhere, 
and the spark must do its work. They might turn, 
hoping only for sensation and the breath of Russian 
anarchy, to a novel like Turgenev's "Virgin Soil" 
or Dostoieff sky's "Crime and Punishment." That 
would do the business. A single Dumas book would 
serve to open, although with something of melo- 
drama, the tremendous roll of the French Revolu- 
tion, and so involve the unsuspecting reader in 
Carlyle, and then in TeufelsdrOckh and in Goethe. 
A speech of Lincoln's might be the key to Grote 
and the spent democracy of Greece ; and an essay of 
Lowell's induct the Elizabethans, and they in turn 
the theatre of Ibsen, and the Ibsenites and new 
Pittites. The live book and the play of literature 
upon life, we held by these; and it almost seems 
now that our belief in our Academe or Republic is 
and will be assured. ERNEST RHYS. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GREAT POET, but 

who yielded to the force of circumstances and the 
influence of environment and became a distinguished 
prose-writer instead, has since his death been made 
the subject of warmest eulogy for his poetic gifts, 
and has called forth expressions of regret that he 
had not devoted himself entirely to that department 
of literature in which he was qualified to excel. 
Mr. J. B. Yeats, recalling his own student days at 
Trinity College, Dublin, says in a letter to the New 
York " Evening Post ": " It seems but yesterday that 
I was an anxious student in T. C. D., where the two 
Dowdens [Edward and John] shone the brightest 
stars in the undergraduate sky. Have all our hopes 
been fulfilled? Edward Dowden has written prose 
classics. He has given us but one small volume 
of poetry, yet all his love went out to that slender 
book. He once told me that when he wrote poetry 
he did it secretly and could not do it otherwise. 
For in the Ireland that he knew, men did this kind 
of good deed by stealth. It is so no longer. Thanks 
to the Irish literary movement, modern Nationalist 
Ireland, from which he shrank and which shrank 
from him, is now a land of poets. The orators are 
out of commission." From the same authority we 
learn that as a student Dowden had "a certain 
girlish distinction and purity," that he continued to 
the end "an extremely handsome man," that "he 
looked the poet and primarily was the poet," and that 
" in any other age than that of Herbert Spencer and 
George Eliot, and in any country not wholly given to 



oratory, as was then the case with Ireland, Dowden 
would have written poetry and left prose to others." 
But the silent, self-contained scholar and dreamer 
" allowed himself to become a speaker from political 
platforms. To see his distinguished figure among 
the politicians was to me a dreadful sight." Further, 
it was his close application to his books in college, 
and his brilliant success in all competitive examina- 
tions, that stunted the poet in him. Also, he mar- 
ried early, and too much domesticity may have 
clipped the wings of song. Finally, as we are told, 
"George Eliot, whose admirer he was, completed 
the mischief. This woman author, with her chilly 
east wind of science and agnosticism, was a wintry 
frost to all of us, in those far-away days." Still, 
when all is said, poets are born and not made or 
unmade; and no power on earth can suppress the 
divine frenzy in a man when it once gets possession 
of him. ... 

THE HATED NEOLOGISM, like the poor, is always 
with us, even though the neologism of one genera- 
tion may become the archaism of the following. 
A spoken language is a living thing and stoutly 
refuses to become fixed, which is fortunate; but 
nearly everyone has enough of the conservative in 
his nature to resent at first the ousting of a good old 
word by a saucy^ipstart of yesterday, or the wanton 
ascription of a new meaning to an old word when 
the language is already well supplied with accepted 
terms to express the desired meaning. For ex- 
ample, many who are not yet old will recall the 
introduction into our daily speech of the verb 
"conserve" in the sense of to husband or econo- 
mize etymologically correct enough, but striking 
the ear at first as an unnecessary or somewhat 
pedantic substitution. By this time, of course, we 
have heard so much about conservation and conser- 
vationists that we are reconciled to the word and 
its derivatives. A much more recent and less war- 
rantable innovation is the use of " consistently " for 
"constantly," or, in plain Anglo-Saxon, "always." 
The other day there appeared, editorially, in one of 
the three newspapers recognized as foremost of Amer- 
ican journals the following sentence referring to the 
late movement toward arming ocean liners : " It is 
to be said that England has consistently opposed 
such transformation at sea, but was unable to get 
its view adopted at the second Hague peace confer- 
ence in 1907." Was there in the writer's mind 
any notion of consistency or inconsistency in En- 
gland's opposition? Possibly, but the probability is 
that the adverb is simply journalese for "always." 
Another instance, of even less ambiguity, occurs in 
Mr. Noel Buxton's late book entitled "With the 
Bulgarian Staff." Speaking of Bulgaria's secrecy 
in preparing for war, and of her conveying of false 
impressions concerning her military strength, the 
author says: "It was consistently announced that 
the Bulgarian army, which, on a peace footing, 
numbered some 60,000, could be increased in war 
to 300,000." In reality this announcement was 



406 



THE DIA1, 



[May 16 



inconsistent with the actual facts, for the total mus- 
ter numbered 430,000. What the writer meant, 
then, was "constantly," or, better, "repeatedly," or 
perhaps " persistently," or " insistently," but surely 
not "consistently." By what perversity or incon- 
sistency was he led to choose just the wrong adverb 
when the right one lay so ready to his hand? 

A STEP FORWARD IN LIBRARY LEGISLATION is 

about to be taken by Massachusetts, the first State 
to establish a public library commission. At present 
writing a bill is before the legislature, and is likely 
to have become law before this is printed, for the 
appointment of an agent to assist libraries in their 
work with immigrants. Mr. Charles F. D. Belden, 
State Librarian and President of the Massachusetts 
Public Library Commission, is the moving spirit in 
this enterprise, which of course has the hearty sup- 
port of the Commission as a whole and as individuals. 
During the past winter that body has concerned 
itself especially with the work of libraries among the 
foreign-born classes, and the need has been increas- 
ingly felt of a special agent or officer to give his or 
her time and study to the questions connected with 
such work. "Provision should also be made," urges 
Mr. Belden, "for occasional assistance from com- 
petent representatives of the non- English-speaking 
races in different localities for lectures and addresses, 
and for other incidental expenses." The bill pro- 
vides that the "foreign agent," as the proposed 
officer seems to be called for brevity's sake, shall be 
appointed by the Library Commission, with the con- 
sent of the Governor, for a term not exceeding five 
years, and that an annual appropriation not exceed- 
ing five hundred dollars shall be made to meet the 
incidental expenses connected with the agent's work. 
Like the commissioners, the agent will receive for 
his services a reward not reckoned in dollars and 
cents. The consciousness of having helped to fit for 
citizenship some hundreds or thousands of our alien 
population will be better than gold from Uphaz or 
silver from Tarshish. 



THE SINCERITY OF THE NEW DRAMA, about which 

Mr. Galsworthy discourses understandingly and en- 
joyably in the April "Hibbert Journal," is regarded 
by him as its characteristic and all-important feature, 
though not the feature most likely to secure imme- 
diate commercial success. " Not till the heavens fall 
will the majority of the Public demand sincerity," 
he feels bound to admit. Conventional clap-trap and 
mock heroics we all know to be what appeals most 
unfailingly to the gallery, and indeed, as a general 
rule, to the balcony, the orchestra chairs, and the 
boxes. "The Greater Public will by preference take 
the lowest article in art that is offered to it," he re- 
marks, with a Ruskin-like despair at the degeneracy 
of the people's taste; but he still believes that "if a 
better article be substituted, the Greater Public very 
soon enjoys it every bit as much as the article re- 
placed, and so on up to a point that we need not 
fear we shall ever reach. But from this it is not to 



be inferred that 'new dramatists' are consciously 
trying to supply the Public with a better article. 
Not those who are sincere, anyway. Oh, no! A 
man could not write anything sincere with the eleva- 
tion of the Public as incentive. If he tried he would 
be as lost as ever were the Pharisees making broad 
their phylacteries. He can only express himself 
sincerely by not considering the Public at all." 
Then follows a variation of the well-known advice 
of Sir Philip Sidney to the writer, and afterward 
this hopeful view of the "new" dramatist's future: 
"Novelists, it is true, even if they have not been 
taken too seriously by the people of these islands, 
have for a long time past respected themselves; but 
the calling of a dramatist till quite of late has been 
but an invertebrate and spiritless concern. Whipped 
by the Censor, exploited by the actor, dragooned 
and slashed by the manager, ignored by the Public, 
who never even bothered to inquire the names of 
those who supplied it with digestives it was a 
slave's job. Thanks to a little sincerity, it is not 
now a slave's job, and will not again, I think, be- 
come one in this country." A new safeguard of 
the self-respecting dramatist is found in the increas- 
ing vogue of plays, " sincere " plays, as literature. 
Not merely the closet drama, but the stage drama is 
being read, is taking rank as literature, because the 
authors are learning to be faithful to themselves 

in other words, to be sincere. 



EDITORSHIP AS A PROPAEDEUTIC TO AMBASSADOR- 
SHIP receives no stinted commendation from the 
editor of "The Forum," who, in commenting on 
Mr. Page's recent appointment as ambassador to 
England, says : " He could have had no better train- 
ing for his new duties than is afforded by the edi- 
torial chair of one of the greater periodicals; and 
after the diplomacy that is sometimes necessary in 
such a position he will find his work in London 
superlatively easy." In recent times this particular 
post has been held by a number of able men of edi- 
torial training. Lowell occupied the editorial chair 
of "The Atlantic Monthly" from 1857 to 1862, 
and was joint editor with Charles Eliot Norton of 
"The North American Review " from 1863 to 1867. 
Mr. Hay, besides serving as editorial writer on the 
New York " Tribune," assumed the duties of editor- 
in-chief during Whitelaw Reid's absence in Europe 
in 1881. Mr. Reid himself had large editorial ex- 
perience, beginning with the Xenia "News," which 
he conducted in 1858-59, and ending with the great 
metropolitan journal which he edited and owned in 
later life. Mr. Page's editorship of the "Atlantic" 
from 1896 to 1899 was preceded by five year's ex- 
perience as editor of "The Forum" (whose present 
editor errs in placing Mr. Page's Boston labors be- 
fore 1891) and followed by a dozen years' superin- 
tendence of "The World's Work." Certainly the 
editor of any successful newspaper or periodical has 
to make himself a master of the suaviter in modo 
and the fortiter in re if he is to achieve the best 
results. Having done that, it may well be that the 



1913]

more or less ornamental functions of a foreign am- 
bassadorship become to him a thing of little diffi- 
culty, even if not, as the " Forum " editor expresses it, 

" superlatively easy." 



THE COURAGE OF ONE'S LITERARY LIKES AND 
DISLIKES is an admirable thing. For this we value 
Edward FitzGerald, and the more because his pre- 
ferences and prejudices generally commend them- 
selves as well-grounded, as based on the eternal veri- 
ties, so far as we have learned to know those verities. 
It is true that personal preference is often an unsafe 
criterion, and most of us hesitate to trust it implicitly. 
No such weakness, however, is discernible in Mr. 
Frederic Harrison's summary dismissal of Professor 
Bergson in his (Mr. Harrison's) recent delightful 
volume, "Among my Books." The eminent French- 
man might feel hurt were it not that Plato is dis- 
missed with equal curtness in the same sentence ; 
and to be ejected through the same door with the 
author of "The Republic " is honor enough for one 
man. In this distinguished company also a third 
name (no one would guess whose) is included. The 
English critic's words are as follows : " I care for 
Plato's metaphysics as little as I care for the rhap- 
sodical gammon of Professor Bergson or Miss Marie 
Corelli who used to be so sorry for poor Satan." 
In fairness it should be added that Mr. Harrison 
pays proper tribute to Plato's literary charm, credit- 
ing him with " the most exquisite prose style ever 
devised by the genius of man." Another passage 
from the same book may well be cited in this con- 
nection. After expressing a preference for Cole- 
ridge, Shelley, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold, 
among modern poets, the writer says : " I see all 
the beauty of Keats, of Swinburne, Rossetti, and 
others whom it is the fashion to praise, I think, in 
needless superlatives ; but for my own enjoyment 
I require sustained and original Thought, and not 
merely melodious phrase and luscious images. 
Thoughts, ideas, appeals to mind or action, are the 
essence of poetry as of all other kinds of composi- 
tion. And sweet songs about nothing in particular 
do not long hold me. Again, they who offer 
Thoughts without music should write in prose, not 
in verse." 



THE RAILROAD SERVING THE LIBRARY, and also 

lending itself to the larger purposes of educational 
enlightenment, is an edifying sight. From the 
Minnesota Public Library Commission's monthly 
" Library Notes and News " we take the following: 
"Results from the traveling libraries placed on the 
Educational train which toured the Northern part 
of the state Nov. 5-20 are shown in the following 
statement. Of the forty-five towns visited seven 
already had traveling libraries twenty -five libra- 
ries were placed at stations along the route, and 
ten more at adjoining towns. Nine towns have, as 
yet, no libraries. In some instances more than one 
library was placed at the same shipping point, but 
serving totally different communities. According 



to this count a total of forty-seven stations were 
added to the traveling library map." On another 
page of the same issue it is reported that a large 
increase in the demand for reference books for 
temporary use, in various parts of the State, bears 
evidence to the need of a parcel post that shall 
carry such books to and fro at the same rate that 
it now carries other packages. More and more the 
wonder grows that books should ever have been 
excluded from the benefits of the parcel post or, 
rather, it would grow were it not so well known 
that the collective stupidity of any legislative body 
always greatly exceeds the sum of the individual 
stupidities of its constituent members. The whole 
is sometimes greater than the sum of all its parts. 



THE UNSOPHISTICATED LITERARY GENIUS, in all 

the sublimity of his unsophistication, has never been 
better portrayed than by Mr. Woodrow Wilson, 
twenty years ago, in his book, " Mere Literature," 
a collection of essays now republished in a limited 
edition that is pretty sure to find a ready sale. In 
the essay on "The Author Himself" occurs the de- 
scription we have in mind: "The man thrown early 
upon his own resources, and already become a con- 
queror of success before being thrown with the literary 
talkers; the man grown to giant's stature in some 
rural library, and become exercised there in a giant's 
prerogative before ever he has been laughingly told, 
to his heart's confusion, of scores of other giants dead 
and forgotten long ago; the man grounded in hope 
and settled in conviction ere he has discovered how 
many hopes time has seen buried, how many convic- 
tions cruelly given the lie direct by fate; the man 
who has carried his youth into middle age before 
going into the chill atmosphere of blase sentiment; 
the quiet, stern man who has cultivated literature 
on a little oatmeal before thrusting himself upon the 
great world as a prophet and seer; the man who pro- 
nounces new eloquence in the rich dialect in which 
he was bred; the man come up to the capital from 
the provinces these are the men who people the 
world's mind with new creations and give to the so- 
phisticated learned of the next generation new names 
to conjure with." 

A LIBRARIAN'S VALEDICTORY closes the forty- 
eighth annual report of the Detroit Public Library. 
Mr. Henry M. Utley, appointed Librarian in 1885, 
and since last November holding the honored posi- 
tion of Librarian Emeritus, thus expresses himself 
in looking back over his quarter-century and more 
of distinguished service in Detroit : " In closing my 
final report, I may be indulged in a passing refer- 
ence to the Library's wonderful growth and develop- 
ment in the last quarter of a century. This marked 
and unexpected change in the institution and the 
character of its work amounts to a revolution. No 
one then could have foreseen its nature and extent. 
This was not merely an expansion along previously 
well-defined lines : it was radical and fundamental 
in its quality and characteristics. This change in

the significance of librarianship is unquestionably 
due to the influence of the American Library Asso- 
ciation, which was organized during the Centennial 
Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. That Exposi- 
tion was responsible for many changes in American 
life and thought, marking the beginning of an era. 
Nowhere is this more distinctly seen than in the 
library field." Recalling his intercourse with the 
leading early members of the Association many 
of them now no longer with us he says : " These 
men were the incarnation of the modern library 
spirit. To be associated with them was in itself a 
liberal education." 

ALERTNESS TO READERS' NEEDS is plainly discern- 
ible in certain innovations introduced at the Los 
Angeles Public Library. Two attractive lists of 
" Books on Domestic Science " and " Books on the 
Building Trades," the latter critically annotated, 
and each bearing an appropriate pictorial design on 
the cover, are issued by the Library, and contain a 
goodly showing of its literature on these subjects. 
Efficient methods of distribution are used to place 
these lists in the hands of those most likely to profit 
by them, even the grocer's delivery wagon being 
pressed into service to awaken the people to a con- 
sciousness of things worth knowing. Not long ago 
it was suggested in these columns that motion pic- 
tures might advantageously be used in familiarizing 
the public with the free library's existence and 
activities ; and now there comes to us the following 
announcement from Los Angeles : " We are using 
the motion picture slide method, and find that it 
reaches a large circle of people who do not other- 
wise seem to be informed of the library's existence. 
We have out about fifteen slides in various theatres, 
the proprietors of which are cooperating with us by 
showing these without any expense to the library." 
If the inhabitants of Los Angeles do not henceforth 
make the best and fullest use of their library, they 
will show themselves quite undeserving of a library. 



A PREMIUM ON CLASSICAL SCHOLARSHIP IS Vir- 
tually what the new rules governing admission to 
Harvard amount to. Fewer " units " of preparatory 
work will be required of those who qualify them- 
selves in both Latin and Greek than of other appli- 
cants ; and thus, apparently, it is hoped to encourage 
the study of Virgil and Homer and Cicero and 
Demosthenes. Not the worthiest incentive this to 
the cultivation of the classics ; but the difficulties of 
Greek and Latin, as compared with those of German 
and French and the rudiments of science, are cer- 
tainly such as to justify the concession made to those 
who choose the old-time rigors rather than the latter- 
day " soft " studies of college preparation. It may 
well be more difficult, even now, to enter college 
on fifteen and one-half " units," including Latin and 
Greek, than to fill up the sixteen and one-half 
required of the non-Grecians. But, after all, exter- 
nal stimuli to the study of any literature, whether 
ancient or modern, will never go far toward inspir- 



ing a love for that literature as all will admit who 
pause to look back on whatever of compulsion was 
brought to bear on their own youthful inclination 
concerning the literature of their own tongue. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

A FREQUENT MISUSE OF THE COMMA. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Of all the marks of punctuation, the comma, it is 
said, has the least power; and yet its misuse may cause 
no end of trouble and misunderstandings, even lawsuits. 
For example: quoting the opinions of three authors 
named, a writer gave only two bibliographic references. 
Of course the query at once arose whether (1) two of 
the authors were coworkers in one essay or report; 
(2) if so, which two? Or (3) were there three articles, 
one by each of the three authors, the bibliographic 
reference to one having by mistake been omitted? The 
publication of the paper was thus delayed for several 
days, a number of letters between three cities were 
required, and a deal of bother and expense followed 
before the matter was finally and correctly understood. 
The correction of the misuse or nonuse of a comma 
was necessary to avoid a far greater expense and 
bother, at some later time, as well as to give an author 
his proper place and honor. Because, omitting the 
important matter of bibliographic references, it is clear 
that Sea, Pond and Soil conveys a different significance 
from Soil, Pond and Sea, while a third variant is Sea, 
Pond, and Soil. " Philosophers such as Bergson and 
James, and Schafer and Henderson," means one thing, 
while other placings of commas would suggest de- 
cidedly different meanings. When Dean Alford said, 
" The great enemies to understanding anything in our 
language are the commas " was he not a teacher of 
indiscrimination ? His killing of a thousand of these 
" enemies " in the Greek text of the New Testament 
may have been both " war " and " magnificent," but 
fortunately our English translation was left unattacked. 
In illustration of such differences in the uses of the 
comma let me quote from John Wilson's " Treatise on 
English Punctuation." The first edition was published 
in 1826, the third in 1855, and the twenty-sixth in 1871. 
In America, therefore, the proper use of the comma has 
had sufficient authority, vogue, and time to become 
fixed. Wilson says: "In a series of words, all of the 
same part of speech, a comma is inserted between each 
particular," and some of the illustrations given are 
these: 

Industry, honesty, and temperance are essential. 

A brave, pious, and patriotic prince. 

Happy is the man who honors, obeys, loves, or serves his 
Creator. 

" Some punctuators," adds Wilson, " omit the comma 
between the last two particulars, when united by either 
of the conjunctions and, or, nor. But the propriety of 
using the comma will perhaps be obvious to anyone who 
examines the nature of such sentences : for the last two 
words of a series are not more closely connected in sense 
and construction with each other than with the preced- 
ing words; as Infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, and 
age are different stages in human life." (There follow 
certain explanations, examples, and exceptions, which 
need not be copied here.) In other words, the last and,

or or, or nor may not at one time serve both for the 
omitted comma and the conjunction. 

The " Manual of Style " of the University of Chicago 
Press (December, 1912) disposes of the matter in the 
same way. The "Style Book" of the Government 
Printing Office at Washington has nothing in regard to 
the question. Orcutt's "The Writer's Desk Book" 
fails to notice that besides and, nor and or also require 
the comma before the last of a succession of three or 
more words. 

Despite the usual assent to this rule by most author- 
ities treating of the rules of punctuation, there is an 
astonishing lack of this correct and indicated usage on 
almost every page of American and English books, mag- 
azines, newspapers, etc. One may hardly say that either 
the rule, or its opposite, is more frequently illustrated 
by our best American printers and writers; nor may one 
be very dogmatic as to the preponderant habit of the 
contrasted Americans and English. I have collected 
hundreds of illustrative instances, and, glancing over 
them, it would seem that, while all are sinners, as a rule 
the best authors of England (or their printers and proof- 
readers) have more frequently adopted the right and 
discriminating use of the comma than have we Americans. 
But, for instance, quoting the Oxford University Press 
" Rules for Compositors," the " Encyclopaedia Britan- 
nica" says: "The comma separates clauses, phrases 
and participles," thus inexcusably omitting the comma 
after phrases. In our own "Webster's New Interna- 
tional," under "Comma," we read: "to set off words, 
phrases, and clauses that are independent, parenthetical, 
or appositional," thus happily and twice illustrating 
the proper rule in its own definition. It also quotes: 
" the virtues of faith, hope, and charity." It need not 
be added that this commended use of the comma is 
that constantly exemplified in our New Testament. 
And yet so general has been the American lapse in 
" punctiliousness " that one of America's great scholars, 
a producer, during fifty years, of exquisite literary 
masterpieces, was a thoroughgoing stickler for the 
omission of the comma before " and" " or" and " nor," 
connecting the last two links in a sequence of three or 
more; or all the links in a series of greater length, or where 
each individual link consists of several words. And this, 
although he thus mistakenly gave his readers and 
pupils to understand that " the last two words of such a 
series are more closely connected in sense and construc- 
tion with each other than with the preceding words."

IN DEFENSE OF "POETRY." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your correspondent's sweeping indictment of 
" Poetry " and all its works, in your last issue, almost 
leaves me no ground to stand on. However, I still 
find room enough to question Mr. Wallace Rice's right 
to the tripod. 

" The editors who have never before edited " are 
less to be dreaded than those who have edited too much. 
Mr. Rice has edited so many anthologies among them, 
" The Little Book of Brides," The Little Book of 
Kisses," " The Little Book of Sports," that the keen 
edge of his judgment as an authority on poetry is some- 
what worn. " English poetry has no subtle rhythm," 
he drones, apparently quite unconscious that this state- 
ment is a declaration of ineligibility to the office of critic 
of poetry. It is as if some critic of painting, con- 



genitally color-blind, should announce that there is no 
difference between green and blue. 

Mr. Rice then gets on safer ground. Poetry, like 
every other Art or art, he solemnly asserts, is con- 
cerned with form as well as substance ; it is the metrical 
arrangement of words to express beauty. To deny this 
is to deny poetry the possession of a technic, to deny 
the technic of ascertained metre unchallenged through 
thirty centuries. No, we do n't deny that " poetry is 
concerned with form as well as substance " all that 
we deny is Mr. Rice's competence to discern form. We 
do n't " deny poetry the possession of a technic," though 
we are compelled to deny his narrow conception of 
poetic technic. We hardly know what he may mean 
by " the technic of ascertained metre unchallenged 
through thirty centuries," as he can hardly be familiar 
with all the languages of the earth since ancient Egypt, 
or with the vast history of human quarrels on the sub- 
ject of poetic technic since first the devil said, " Is it 
Art? " Indeed, we doubt if he knows as much on the 
subject as Mr. Pound, who has devoted some years to 
an exhaustive study of metrical forms and variations on 
the poetry of eleven languages. 

We have no intention of defending Mr. Pound's 
poetry. Quite competently it defends itself; as Mr. 
Rice says, he " may be left to the court of appeal the 
years will hale him before, if he survives." Meantime, 
as the years are long in coming, " Poetry " will not be 
able, either in his case or those of other adventurously 
modern poets, to sit on the fence of tradition until the 
verdict of time is pronounced. That would be the safe 
course, doubtless; we commend it to those who always 
think that the last word has been said. 

" And there is so much for it [that is, the magazine] 
to do by a maintenance of the standards!" Mr. Rice 
wails. "The modern social feeling, the growing solid- 
arity of women, the wonders of science, are clamoring 
for poetic expression." Quite true; if Mr. Rice will 
review the first seven numbers of " Poetry," he may 
get some light on these subjects through Moody's " I 
Am the Woman," John Reed's " Sangar," Lindsay's 
" General Booth," Towne's " Beyond the Stars," Yeats's 
allegory of his fate, Rabindra Nath Tagore's lyrics, 
and Ezra Pound's " Contemporania."

AN INADVERTENT CRITICISM OF 

NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I wish to call your attention to an error in the review 
of the Russell Sage Foundation Publication entitled " A 
Comparative Study of Public School Systems in the 
Forty-eight States," in your issue of February 1. In 
commenting on the table showing the amount of money 
paid annually for schools for each hundred dollars' worth 
of wealth in the state, your reviewer has evidently read 
the abbreviation "N. M." incorrectly, which has led 
him to make a very unjust criticism of New Hampshire. 

Even if the statement were correct, the writer of the 
article should have recognized that this table taken by 
itself is of little value. A very wealthy state with few 
children might be paying out a small percentage of its 
wealth for schools, and at the same time be paying a 
large amount per pupil. The latter consideration is of 
course the important one. C. W. Foss.

EARLY SCENES ix A GJREAT AVAR DRAMA.* 

The tyranny of timeliness constrains both 
book-publishers and newspaper-proprietors to 
get their printed product to market while the 
topics to which it refers are still in the bloom of 
their first freshness. The six volumes named 
in the subjoined footnote are with one exception 
written by journalists war correspondents 
whose eagerness to score what in their own dia- 
lect is known as a "scoop" sometimes exceeded 
their caution in the avoidance of error. It is 
still too early to undertake to point out just 
where each of these enterprising and capable 
writers, viewing necessarily but a restricted 
portion of the great war scene, has gone astray ; 
but certain striking instances of mutual contra- 
diction in two or more of the narratives can be 
cited as sufficient proof that their every detail 
should not be accepted as gospel truth. We 
know, too, that unusual obstacles were placed 
in the path of the war correspondent by both 
Balkan and Turkish authorities, so that he was 
treated more like a prisoner of war than like a 
peaceful gatherer of news, and what information 
he did obtain may well have been mixed with 
error for which he was hardly responsible. 
Moreover, as is well enough known, modern 
military tactics, with modern smokeless powder 
and artillery of long and accurate range, tend 
to make a latter-day battlefield something very 
different from the thrilling spectacle of waving 
banners and clashing arms with which we pic- 
ture to ourselves a Crecy or a Bannockburn. 
A British officer confirms what Lieutenant 
Wagner says of "the emptiness of the battle- 
field" by his statement that though he served 
through nearly the whole of the Boer War, he 
never, in all the battles in which he fought, 
actually caught sight of the enemy, nor ever

saw even a puff of smoke to indicate the enemy's 
position. When the men asked what they 
should aim at, they were likely to be told to 
aim at the sky-line, on the off chance of hitting 
a Boer on the crest of some distant ridge. Is 
there cause for surprise, then, that no single 
war correspondent at the front can furnish a 
complete and correct account of military move- 
ments? 

But while the books here brought to the 
reader's attention are largely based on such 
imperfect information as is obtainable by the 
journalist, and are issued with all possible celer- 
ity, one exception is to be noted in the modest 
volume prepared by Mr. Noel Buxtou, who went 
to the East as agent of the Balkan War Relief 
Fund, and afterward, with evident deliberation 
and care, put into writing the more noteworthy 
of his impressions and of the facts gleaned by 
him in the advantageous position of one attached 
to the Bulgarian General Staff. In addition to 
his present work, "With the Bulgarian Staff," 
two chapters of which have already appeared in 
"The Contemporary Review" and "The Nine- 
teenth Century," Mr. Buxton has published a 
book on "Europe and the Turks," which shows 
at least his intelligent interest in Balkan affairs 
in their political aspects. From the later work, 
which makes the reader acquainted with Bul- 
garian character and Bulgarian patriotism, we 
quote a passage referring to the Bulgarian 
commander-in-chief. 

" There is a massive quality about SavofiP which denes 
description: the head large; the figure not dispropor- 
tionate, and yet a short man ; genial, yet apart, with an 
air of large condescension; potentially social, but pre- 
occupied: a man to inspire confidence. He reminded 
me of nothing so much as that rare type of Englishman, 
born a squire but by nature a leader of men, occupied 
with great affairs, but when at home joining the crowd 
of commonplace people, shooting or hunting or golfing, 
without claiming special regard." 

Lieutenant Hermenegild Wagner, special 
correspondent of the Vienna "Reichspost" and 
the London "Daily Mail," gives to the public a 
book of considerable size and pretensions, well 
illustrated and provided with maps, and full of 
interesting and often instructive matter. The 
first half of "With the Victorious Bulgarians" 
sketches the events leading up to the war and 
introduces the Bulgarians to the reader; the 
second half relates the author's exploits as an 
exceedingly alert war correspondent, and gives 
as many details concerning the progress of the 
campaign as could have been expected from any 
one pen at that time. Indeed, somewhat less of 
fulness and variety in the author's report might

THE DIAL

have inspired greater confidence in his accuracy. 
But of this there will be a word to say later. 
His splendid confidence in himself, valuable in 
his hazardous and difficult undertaking, shows 
itself especially in his concluding chapter, " My 
Experiences as a War Correspondent,'' in the 
course of which he says: 

"The secret of my successful activity as a war corre- 
spondent one result of which is that in various ways 
I have had to experience the hostility of some of my 
less successful colleagues is, I confess, to be sought 
in the circumstance that I was able to bring to bear upon 
my task more certain guarantees of success than any of 
my competitors could command. Above all, I was a 
perfect master of the Bulgarian language. The son of 
an engineer, I grew up among the Balkans, and as a 
boy learned to speak Bulgarian, Servian, and Bosnian. 
Though a native of Vienna, I thus obtained such a 
knowledge of the ways and thoughts of the southern 
Slavs as one cannot acquire from any books, or any 
amount of study in later life." 

Mr. Cyril Campbell witnessed some incidents 
in the autumn campaign as special correspondent 
of the London "Times," and his book, "The 
Balkan War Drama," is a part of the fruit of 
his journalistic labors at and near the front, 
especially with the Servian forces. Its chapters 
on the political crisis in Servia and the early 
military movements of the Servians are especially 
informing. Bulgaria's part in the tremendous 
struggle also receives attention. Noteworthy is 
the fact that while most of the accounts of the 
war lay emphasis on the alleged Turkish atroci- 
ties, Mr. Campbell all but denies that there 
were any such atrocities. Toward the end of 
his book he says: 

" That the Turks have committed atrocities in the 
past is undeniable ; that atrocities have been committed 
in this war is equally undeniable, and that the Turks 
have taken part in some of these atrocities is possible. 
But it must be remembered that so far there is no direct 
proof. At the moment when the talk of atrocities and 
massacres of innocent people by retreating Turks was 
at its height, during the second week of the war, the 
following telegram reached Belgrade from the Servian 
front, after having passed and obtained the sanction of 
the official censor: 'The further progress is made, the 
more certain it is that the atrocities are due to the 
Arnauts and not to the Turks.' The Arnauts know 
nothing of Berne or Geneva Conventions, and wage war 
in their own sweet fashion." 

Already in this book, which seems to have left 
its author's hands last November, there are 
prophecies of the contentions among the allies 
which were sure to follow close upon the attain- 
ment of their purpose in the clash with their 
common foe. 

In "The Balkan War," by Mr. Philip Gibbs. 
special correspondent of the London " Graphic " 
with the Bulgarian army, and Mr. Bernard 



Grant, special correspondent of the London 
" Daily Mirror " with the Turkish army, is 
presented a well-proportioned account of opera- 
tions on both sides, as comprehensive and trust- 
worthy as it could be made in the very heat of 
the actions which it describes. But it modestly 
and wisely disclaims finality, and confesses the 
insuperable obstacles which its authors had to 
contend against in their quest for information. 
It also makes clear that the war drama is not 
all acted out on the battlefield, that " it is a 
drama of innumerable small acts of courage, of 
fear, of hardship, of misery, of horror, of despair, 
when death itself, so enormous a tragedy in ordin- 
ary life, becomes a commonplace familiar thing, 
so that living men hardly turn their heads to 
glance at those who fall dead ; when death, so 
terrible in days of peace, is indeed, to many 
men, a welcome gift, ending the sufferings that 
are unendurable " and that it is a drama of 
much else besides. No early book of the war 
has in so small a compass more of what the 
reader wishes to know. Its illustrations are 
many and good, its map useful though small. 

A view of the war from the Turkish side only 
is furnished by Mr. Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, 
special correspondent of the London " Daily 
Telegraph," aided by his brother, Mr. Seabury 
Ashmead-Bartlett. " With the Turks in Thrace " 
is a generous octavo, well printed and illustrated, 
and probably the fullest and best of the few 
accounts of the great conflict written by those 
correspondents who were fortunate enough to 
get within the Turkish lines before the Moslem 
forces were scattered like chaff by the onrushing 
Balkan troops. The book abounds in informa- 
tion unfamiliar to most readers, and in more or 
less exciting incident. More than once Lieu- 
tenant Wagner's accuracy as a reporter is im- 
pugned, and instances, some of them if not all 
corrected in his book, are cited to show that his 
zeal occasionally outstripped his knowledge ; but 
in the circumstances he is perhaps not beyond 
pardon. In contrast with the impressions of 
Turkish cruelty toward defenceless Christians 
which both Lieutenant Wagner and other 
writers give us, the following concerning the 
reputedly ferocious Redifs is of interest : 

" Poor, gentle and kind-eyed, courteous Anatolian 
Redifs ! You were starving and disorganized, and yet 
we marched with you all the way from Lule Burgas to 
Chataldja, rather more than 140 miles, without a pass- 
port or any other paper to show who we were, and with 
a cartload of equipment and stores, and none of you 
ventured to molest us. We were Christians, and King 
Ferdinand had proclaimed a Holy War, and yet one 
of you offered to share his last crust of bread with us,

because we gave him a drink of water. Nor did we see 
you massacre and ill-treat Christians or mutilate their 
women-folk, although, when you were starving, they 
used to shut their doors in your faces and refuse to give 
you of the food which they possessed in plenty. Their 
flocks also you left untouched in your extremity, and 
their chickens and their corn. Few European armies 
would have behaved in such a gentle and forbearing 
manner as you. Few races could show such a spirit of 
tolerance." 

A spirited account of personal adventure with 
the Turkish forces, up to the armistice of Dec- 
ember 3, comes from the pen of that experienced 
war correspondent, Major Lionel James, who, 
in the service of the London "Times," was one 
of the few of his craft to witness the great bat- 
tle of Lule Burgas and to learn the real causes 
of the Turkish defeat. As a corrective to such 
glowing reports of uninterrupted Bulgarian 
victories as too easily obtained circulation from 
sources subject to Bulgarian censorship, his 
book, "With the Conquered Turk," will sup- 
ply a real want. Photographs and drawings 
and maps help to make vivid and also more 
clearly intelligible his interesting narrative, 
which deserves far more extended notice than 
is here accorded to its merits.

A SCIENTIST'S HOPE FOR HUMANITY.* 

Among all the phenomena of this revolu- 
tionary era of ours, nothing is more striking 
than the ever-increasing significance of science 
as a factor in the upward struggle of humanity. 
At a time when idealism, worn with the futile 
striving of centuries, had almost begun to 
despair, she finds within her hands a sturdier 
staff than any she has yet leaned upon ; at a 
time when the voices of faith had all but 
deserted her, she catches a clearer and more 
heartening word than any that has before 
reached her ear. Her old enemy has taken on 
the guise of a savior. Science, the despised 
and the rejected, is laying the solid foundations 
beneath her tottering dream-towers, and is giv- 
ing her at last a definite hope for the future. 

To any who are skeptical of this " serene 
evangel of science," as it has just been happily 
termed,f we earnestly commend the reading of 
two books Mr. Havelock Ellis's "The Task

magazine contribution of the month. 



of Social Hygiene" and Dr. Alfred Kussel 
Wallace's "Social Environment and Moral 
Progress." The former work was discussed at 
length in these pages several months ago. Dr. 
Wallace's volume, just published, is of even 
greater importance. The author's position as 
co-discoverer with Darwin of one of the most 
momentous theories in the history of thought, 
his venerable age, his wide scientific knowledge 
and deep philosophic insight, lend to his utter- 
ances an authority such as could be claimed by 
no other living writer. 

On the occasion of his ninetieth birthday, 
celebrated recently, Dr. Wallace startled his 
journalistic interviewers by the statement that 
there has been no perceptible advance in mo- 
rality throughout the entire historical period of 
mankind, that the present social structure is 
radically defective from top to bottom, and the 
present social environment the worst in history. 
There are many who would like to dismiss this 
indictment as the fatuous wail of a superannu- 
ated pessimist ; but to do so would be merely to 
demonstrate one's own fatuity. From such a 
source, it constitutes a challenge to civilization 
that demands the closest and most impartial 
examination. In the book now published, Dr. 
Wallace outlines the historical and scientific 
data upon which are based his conclusions as to 
the past, as well as his hope for the future. 

In the first section of his volume, after estab- 
lishing definitions of such terms as morality, 
moral progress, character, etc., the author de- 
votes several chapters to suggestive historical 
evidences which have led him to conclude that 
" There has been no definite advance of morality from 
age to age, and that even the lowest races, at each 
period, possessed the same intellectual and moral 
nature as the higher. The manifestations of this 
essentially human nature in habits and conduct were 
often very diverse, in accordance with diversities of the 
social and moral environment. This is quite in accord- 
ance with the now well-established doctrine that the 
essential character of man, intellectual, emotional, and 
moral, is inherent in him from birth; that it is subject 
to great variation from individual to individual, and 
that its manifestations in conduct can be modified in a 
very high degree by the influence of public opinion and 
systematic teaching. These latter changes, however, 
are not hereditary, and it follows that no definite 
advance in morals can occur in any race unless there is 
some selective or segregative agency at work." 

What this required selective agent is, and how 
it will automatically come into action when 
society is sufficiently purged to give it play, we 
are told later on. 

The five chapters which conclude this Histor- 
ical section are given over to a specific arraign-

ment of existing social and economic conditions. 
It is in substance just such an impeachment as 
the Marxians have been hurling at our heads for 
decades; yet rarely has even the most devout 
Marxian attained to Dr. Wallace's vigor and 
thoroughness of denunciation. Social devel- 
opment during the nineteenth century is thus 
summarized : 

"We see a continuous advance of man's power to 
utilize the forces of Nature, to an extent which surpasses 
everything he had been able to do during all the preced- 
ing centuries of his recorded history. 

" We also see that the result of this vast economic 
revolution has been almost wholly evil. 

" We see that this hundredfold increase of wealth, 
amply sufficient to provide necessaries, comforts, and 
all beneficial refinement and luxuries for our whole 
population, has been distributed with such gross injus- 
tice that the actual condition of those who produce all 
this wealth has become worse and worse, no efficient 
arrangements having been made that from the overflow- 
ing abundance produced all should receive the mere 
essentials of a healthy and happy existence. 

" We have seen huge cities grow up, every one of 
them with their overcrowded, insanitary slums, where 
men, women, and children die prematurely as surely as 
though a body of secret poisoners were constantly at 
work to destroy them. 

" We see thousands of girls compelled by starvation to 
work in such an empoisoned environment as to produce 
horribly painful and disfiguring disease, which is often 
fatal in early youth, or in what ought to have been, and 
what might have been, the period of maximum enjoyment 
of their womanhood. And to this very day no efficient 
steps have been taken to abolish these conditions. 

" We see millions still struggling in vain for a suffici- 
ency of the bare necessaries of life (which in their misery 
is all they ask), often culminating in actual starvation, 
or in suicide, to which they are driven by the dread of 
starvation. Yet our Governments, selected from among 
the most educated, the most talented, the wealthiest of 
the country, with absolute power to make what laws 
and regulations they please, and an overflowing fund of 
accumulated wealth to draw upon, do nothing, although 
more people die annually of want than are killed in a 
great war, and more children than could be slaughtered 
by many Herods. 

" And while all this goes on in the depths, where 

' Pale anguish keeps the heavy gate, 
And the Warder is Despair ' 

a little higher up, among the middle-men distributors 
of the necessaries and luxuries of life, bribery, adultera- 
tion and various forms of petty dishonesty are rampant. 

" And higher yet, among the great Capitalists, the 
merchant Princes, the Captains of industry, we find 
hard taskmasters who drive down wages below the level 
of bare subsistence, and who support a more gigantic 
and widespread system of gambling than the world has 
ever seen. 

"And, finally, our administration of what we call 
' Justice ' (and of which we are so proud because our 
judges cannot be bribed) is utterly unjust, because it is 
based on a system of money fees at every step ; because 
it is so cumbrous and full of technicalities as to need 
the employment of attorneys and counsel at great cost, 
and because all petty offences are punishable by fine or 



imprisonment, which makes poverty itself a crime while 
it allows those with money to go practically free. 

" Taking account of these various groups of undoubted 
facts, many of which are so gross, so terrible, that they 
cannot be overstated, it is not too much to say that our whole 
system of society is rotten from top to bottom, and the Social 
Environment as a whole, in relation to our possibilities and 
our claims, is the worst that the world has ever seen," 

As an editorial in the "Call" or the "Clarion," 
all this might be dismissed with the old phrases 
sweet in the mouth of privilege and selfishness. 
But as the deliberate utterance of the foremost 
living scientist of our day, it is rather more 
difficult to dispose of. 

The second part of Dr. Wallace's volume is 
labelled " Theoretical," and deals almost wholly 
with the workings of the evolutionary law, in 
particular reference to social progress. We are 
shown how natural selection, which through the 
ages has moulded the infinitely varied animal 
forms into harmony with their environment, is 
in the main nullified or neutralized in its effect 
on the human organism by man's reasoning 
faculties. Thus it is that the higher nature of 
man, both intellectual and moral, has remained 
practically stationary throughout history, owing 
to the lack of a selective agency adequate to 
increase it. Such an agency is available in 
sexual selection, which if given free scope in a 
normal social environment would "elevate the 
race to whatever degree of civilization and well- 
being it is capable of reaching in earth-life." 
Sexual selection will be the prerogative of 
woman, and therefore woman's position " in the 
not distant future will be far higher and more 
important than any which has been claimed for 
or by her in the past." 

" While she will be conceded full political and social 
rights on an equality with man, she will be placed in a 
position of responsibility and power which will render 
her his superior, since the future moral progress of the 
race will so largely depend upon her free choice in mar- 
riage. As time goes on, and she acquires more and 
more economic independence, that alone will give her an 
effective choice which she has never had before. But 
this choice will be further strengthened by the fact that, 
with ever-increasing approach to equality of opportunity 
for every child born in our country, that terrible excess 
of male deaths, in boyhood and early manhood especially 
due to various preventable causes, will disappear, and 
change the present majority of women to a majority of 
men. This will lead to a greater rivalry for wives, and 
will give to women the power of rejecting all the lower 
types of character among their suitors. 

"It will be their special duty so to mould public 
opinion, through home training and social influence, as 
to render the women of the future the regenerators of 
the entire human race." 

The old " biological argument " so often used 
against the suffragists will be a weapon not 
altogether safe to handle after this !

But sexual selection can never become oper- 
ative until we have cleansed the Augean stables 
of our present social organization. The root- 
causes of evil must be attacked and vanquished, 
cooperation must be substituted for competi- 
tion, and economic brotherhood for economic 
antagonism ; we must see to it that private 
monopoly of land and capital, as well as private 
inheritance of wealth, is done away with. All 
remedies for existing conditions, Dr. Wallace 
concludes, may be condensed into one general 
proposition : 

" That it is the first duty (in importance) of a civ- 
ilized Government to organize the labor of the whole 
community for the equal good of all; but it is also 
their first duty (in time) to take immediate steps to 
abolish death by starvation and by preventable disease due 
to insanitary dwellings and dangerous employments, 
while carefully elaborating the permanent remedy for 
want in the midst of wealth." 

And his final word to the reader is this : 

" The well-established laws of evolution as they 
really apply to mankind are all favorable to the ad- 
vance of true civilization and of morality. Our existing 
competitive and antagonistic social system alone neu- 
tralizes their beneficent operation. That system must 
therefore be radically changed into one of brotherly 
cooperation and coordination for the equal good of all. 
To succeed we must make this principle our guide and 
our pole-star in all social legislation." 

Any summary of such a far-reaching argu- 
ment, in space so scant as this, must of necessity 
be almost hopelessly inadequate. But perhaps 
we have faintly suggested something of the 
book's unique significance in correlating the 
seemingly diverse paths of biological and eco- 
nomic progress, in lending the sanction of 
science to the struggle for freedom which mil- 
lions of men and women are carrying forward 
throughout the world. It comes with an au- 
thority too high to be impugned; it conveys a 
message of too grave import to be ignored. Not 
to read and earnestly ponder such a message is 
little short of a sin against the future.

GREEK ARCHITECTURAL REFINEMENTS.* 



That the Greek architects should have rested 
content with so limited a number of forms, 
repeating not only the dispositions but even 
the most minute details of their temples sub- 
stantially unchanged from generation to gen- 
eration, cannot fail to be a frequent source of 
astonishment. The conviction deepens with

Architecture. By William Henry Goodyear, M.A. Illus- 
trated. New Haven : Yale University Press. 



study, however j that these limitations were self- 
imposed, and went far to make possible a su- 
preme perfection and subtlety of design which 
could scarcely have been attained had not the 
full attention of the artist been freed from the 
cruder problems of invention and construction. 
That the Greeks' rejection of the arch, for 
instance, was not the result of ignorance, the 
walls of Pergamon and Assos abundantly testify. 
Though the hostility of tradition to the arch and 
objections to it on the ground of impermanence 
must be given full weight, allowance must also 
be made for a wish to adhere, in architecture as 
in life, to a simple well-understood type, through 
which alone the eternal desire for the good might 
hope to approach its consummation. 

To what plastic modifications of the appar- 
ently rigid temple-forms the search for infinite 
perfection in the finite could lead in the course 
of centuries, Mr. William H. Goodyear's "Greek 
Refinements " now thoroughly elucidates to the 
general public for the first time. The gradual 
refinement of the proportions in successive 
periods, the subtle swelling of the columns, have 
long been given their true value even in ele- 
mentary manuals. The curvature of the hori- 
zontal lines, the inclination of the verticals, and 
the systematic variations in the diameter and 
spacing of the columns, however, although their 
existence has been generally acknowledged since 
the publication of Penrose's exact measurements 
of the Parthenon in 1851, have been subject to 
long controversy, and to popular misinterpreta- 
tion that has even found its way into some care- 
ful works. The recent discovery, finally, of 
intentional irregularities in the plans of a num- 
ber of classic temples analogous to those more 
readily to be observed in mediaeval buildings 
has still awaited a general appreciation. 

Mr. Goodyear assumes the concurring belief 
of the reader in the original existence of all 
these subtleties, and dismisses the continued 
skepticism of Josef Durm with a rehearsal of two 
of the more forcible arguments for authenticity, 
and citations from Penrose and from Koldewey 
and Puchstein. Although Durm's contentions 
as to the poor preservation of the monuments 
at Athens, at Segesta, and at Corinth, the pos- 
sible effect of earthquakes, and so on, are met 
here only by counter assertion, the weight both 
of evidence and of opinion in favor of the 
intentional character of the departures from 
mechanical regularity is very great. 

The various theories that the curvature of the 
horizontal lines was adopted to correct certain 
optical illusions are readily shown to be untenable 



1913J 



THE DIAL 



by means of more recent evidence of curves pre- 
cisely contrary in effect to the curves on which 
the theories were based. Especially the current 
superstition that the lines were curved up in the 
centre in order to counteract an optical effect 
of sagging is attacked from all points, not only 
as contradicted by lines curved inward in the 
centre, which produce this very impression, but 
as devoid of any competent optical authority, 
and, for the lines above the eye, as contrary to 
the actual effect on the retina. The ground is 
thus cleared for the presentation of the only 
explanation acceptable where the phenomena 
discovered are so various, " that the classic hor- 
izontal curvatures were temperamental refine- 
ments inspired by the sentiment of beauty and 
artistic preference." This conclusion is fortified 
by quotations at length from a variety of authors, 
architects, archaeologists, and historians of 
art, testifying to the superior artistic value 
of the curves in comparison with straight lines, 
and to the effect of " breathing life " with which 
they endow the structures. That this alone 
suffices to account for their origin will be easily 
believed by artists, to whom dislike of the rigid- 
ity and formalism of straight lines is readily 
intelligible. 

It is conceded that some of the devices result 
in an increase of the apparent size of the build- 
ing. The lack of any features in the Greek 
Doric order which would indicate the true size, 
indeed, doubtless has a similar effect. Those 
familiar with the architect's method of approach 
to his problem, however, will agree that it is 
unlikely that this would have been the first pur- 
pose and real aim of the designer. The adop- 
tion of the entasis, almost universally recognized 
as aesthetic in purpose, offers a far more vital 
analogy. 

A further extension of such aesthetic purpose 
is made, which will meet with less general ac- 
quiescence. The departures from equality in 
apparently corresponding dimensions, found 
especially in the early temples of Magna Graecia, 
are also ascribed to artistic preference. There 
can be no doubt that some of these variations 
were not accidental, for instance the fre- 
quently greater thickness of the columns on the 
two fronts of temples, in comparison with those 
on the sides. That such inequalities were 
intended as refinements, and not enforcedly 
adopted in the effort to secure some relation 
desirable for other reasons, may perhaps still be 
questioned. Modern designers are frequently 
forced to introduce similar variations into their 
work on other than aesthetic grounds. On the 



other hand, the demonstration of unsystematic 
variations far exceeding the conceivable margin 
of mason's error shows that the Greek architects 
were indifferent to exact mathematical equality 
of dimensions, and lends color to the belief that, 
as in so many mediaeval structures, "the tolera- 
tion of asymmetry was an expression of the 
same artistic spirit which devised the definitely 
planned refinements." 

The value of the book, confessedly but a 
prologue to the author's projected work on 
mediaeval refinements, lies chiefly in its sum- 
mary of the present state of our knowledge of 
the Greek buildings, and in its assemblage and 
discussion of widely scattered opinions con- 
cerning them. The measurements which Mr. 
Goodyear himself has made have previously 
been published elsewhere. Here for the first 
time, however, are published many of the im- 
portant photographs taken by the Brooklyn 
Institute Museum surveys. Moreover, the 
effort here made to ascribe irregularities of 
dimension to positive artistic preference is the 
first which has been attempted for classic 
buildings. The arguments are not in all cases 
so cogent that other considerations might not 
be urged which might supplement or qualify 
the theories advanced. One may suggest, for 
instance, that by the curvatures, inclinations, 
and modulated distances, the symmetry of the 
temple front is made far more powerful and 
organic. Instead of being a uniform row of 
columns, capable of curtailment or of indefinite 
extension, the facade is given a beginning, a 
middle, and an end an object surely as desir- 
able as to give life to individual lines. One is 
somewhat inclined to take exception to the 
extension of the meaning of "refinements" to 
include every sort of departure from regularity, 
and of the use of "asymmetry" to designate de- 
partures which may operate actually to accentu- 
ate the correspondence of opposite halves, which 
the word symmetry most frequently denotes. 
There is some looseness, also, in the language 
used to describe psychological experiences. To 
say of a truly horizontal line, in a manner often 
paralleled throughout the book, "It is only the 
mental knowledge that the line is really straight 
and horizontal which interferes with the per- 
ception that the line is really seen as a curve," 
contradicts the essential directness of our im- 
pressions and the inseparableness of the effects 
on eye and brain. 

Mechanically the volume approaches luxury, 
and, with its rich provision of bibliography, 
indices, and glossary, is in many ways an ad-

mirable tool. One must confess, nevertheless, 
that although the division into chapters is a 
logical one, it severs a number of subjects very 
intimately related, and necessitates much repeti- 
tion and turning back and forth. Certain defects 
of style to be found in Mr. Goodyear's other 
writings recur here also. But it is ungrateful 
to cavil at defects in a work which is a welcome 
contribution to the somewhat meagre literature 
of American architectural research. 

Members of the professional circle, as they 
become convinced of the validity of Mr. Good- 
year's ideas, are inclined to believe that it is his 
attitude and not theirs which has changed. A re- 
examination of his earlier publications, however, 
leaves little warrant for this belief, and it seems 
more probable that long cultivation has now pre- 
pared the ground for the seed which formerly 
fell among stones. It would not be surprising 
if the more recently discovered refinements, 
once acknowledged, should ultimately find their 
way into current design like those earlier recog- 
nized. Mr. Goodyear would then have added 
one more illustration of the effective reaction of 
archaeology on a living art.

ROMANTICISM ix THE HJGHT OF 
DUALISM.* 



"... He only who knoweth whither he saileth, 
knoweth also what wind is good and a fair wind for 
him." 

Mr. Paul Elmer More's latest volume of 
" Shelburne Essays " is not akin to the collec- 
tions of genial and mildly edifying essays on 
up-to-date literature that are pouring from the 
presses. To turn from the usual book of the 
day to this volume is to turn from triviality and 
impetuosity to reflection and poise and spiritual 
solemnity, three qualities as rare as they are 
desirable. Here one will find the " still fh ten- 
sity " that has almost always characterized the 
best literary criticism. 

In the preface the author indicates briefly 
his conception of criticism : 

" There is a kind of criticism that limits itself to 
looking at the thing in itself, or at the parts of a thing 
as they successively strike the mind. This is properly 
the way of sympathy, and those who choose this way 
are right in saying that it is absurd or merely ill- 
tempered to dwell on what is ugly in a work of art, or 
false, or incomplete. But there is a place also for 
another kind of criticism, which is not so much directed 

*THE DRIFT OF ROMANTICISM. Shelburne Essays, 
Eighth Series. By Paul Elmer More. Boston : Houghton 
Mifflin Co. 



to the individual thing as to its relation with other 
things, and to its place as cause or effect in a whole 
group of tendencies. . . . The highest criticism would 
contrive to balance these methods in such manner that 
neither the occasional merits of a work nor its general 
influence would be unduly subordinated." 

Ordinarily, as in the essays on Fiona Macleod 
and Cardinal Newman, Mr. More maintains this 
balance admirably; elsewhere, as in the essay 
on Pater, the emphasis is on the relation of the 
man and his work with a widespread and, in 
the author's view, deplorable tendency, "the 
romantic movement, beneath all its show of 
expansion and vitality, seems to me at its heart 
... a drift toward disintegration and disease." 
Through a study of " the morbid egotism of a 
Beckford," " the religious defalcation of a New- 
man," "the sestheticism of a Pater," "the dregs 
of naturalistic pantheism in a Fiona Macleod," 
and " the impotent revolt from humanitarian 
sympathy of a Nietzsche," the drift of roman- 
ticism is gradually defined and related with 
diverse aspects of life. Sensible as he is to 
the beauty that not infrequently shines on the 
troubled countenance of romanticism, Mr. More 
hints that this beauty is not necessarily the 
expression of essential romanticism, but rather 
of traits of humanity that are ever resurgent. 

The discussion of the nature of romanticism 
is mostly implicit, but partly explicit, by means 
of long excursions away from the immediate 
subject. In sum Mr. More's view is as follows : 
The human spirit, instead of living in conscious- 
ness of its dual constitution, of the one and the 
many, has set aside the higher term and allowed 
itself to be merged in the flux. Instead of 
responding to the 

" central peace subsisting at the heart 
Of endless agitation," 

it has revelled in the delights and tortures of 
the flux itself. In the classical conception, the 
highest intuition is above the reason, and is 
therefore above the flux ; the intuition of the 
romanticist, on the other hand, is below the 
reason, and is of the flux is, indeed, merely 
an aggravation of the natural expansiveness of 
our thronging desires. Whereas classical phil- 
osophy looked to the infinite, the absolute, for 
the restraint of the desires, romantic philosophy, 
rejecting all restraint, puts its faith in the limit- 
less, in the unhindered activity of desire. Ro- 
manticism, then, has no inherent stability, and 
is given over to empty revery, to purposeless- 
ness, to a nostalgia of the soul. It leads to in- 
ternal conflict, disillusion, despair, exhaustion. 

A second child of naturalism, growing up 
with romanticism, is science. Mr. More distin-

THE DIAL

guishes three types : first, positive science, "that 
trained observation which brings the vision of 
order out of chaos"; second, hypothetical sci- 
ence, which deals with hypotheses that are in 
the realm of positive science; and third, philo- 
sophical science, dealing with hypotheses outside 
the realm of positive science, and endeavoring 
"to formulate a philosophy of life out of scien- 
tific law and hypothesis." Of the three, the first 
two are legitimate and valuable ; but the third, 
philosophical science, is illegitimate and perni- 
cious. The union of romanticism and science is 
effected by the philosophy of the elan vital, 
which leads to a disintegrating optimism of 
which there are many signs in this country 
to-day. 

We have done the book an unintentional dis- 
service if our rather facile summary gives the 
impression that the application of dualism to 
romanticism is mechanically performed. Nor 
are the fundamental ideas new in Mr. More's 
work. The romantic substitution of the limit- 
less for the infinite was discussed at some length 
in the essay on "Thoreau's Journals," in the 
fifth series of the "Shelburne Essays"; the 
philosophy of change in "The Quest" (third 
series) and in "Victorian Literature" (seventh 
series) ; and the dualistic point of view under- 
lies all of the essays, particularly the group of 
"Studies in Religious Dualism" (sixth series). 
Indeed, the concluding part of the present vol- 
ume, some fifty pages of aphoristic statements 
entitled "Definitions of Dualism," is a concen- 
trated expression of the definite view of life that 
pervades all of Mr. More's writings. As a re- 
sult, the essays have the ring of entire assurance, 
an assurance modified by the author's modest 
manner and his desire to acknowledge excel- 
lence wherever it may exist. 

With Professor Babbitt, whose Johnsonian 
"good-humored growl" has attracted a larger 
number of desirable readers than it has re- 
pelled, Mr. More is one of the three or four 
critics who are to-day influencing the thought 
of the more reflective part of our unreflective 
democracy. His latest book, concerned as it 
is with the spiritual and intellectual discords of 
the century from which we have just emerged, 
should be read by everyone who has the 
problems of the age at heart and do we not 
assume, to-day, that we are each of us respon- 
sible for the universe? One of the encourag- 
ing signs of the times is the eager hearing, not 
always faddish, given to such men as M. Maeter- 
linck, M. Bergson, and Professor Eucken, who 
seem to us authentic because they are modern. 



Quite as modern as these men is the renewed 
interest in the classics manifested in Paris and 
Berlin, and less distinctly in this country. 
The classic spirit, the dualistic philosophy, have 
a perennial vitality, and it is hardly safe to 
assume that we have assimilated them in the 
evolution of civilization and will turn to them 
no more, for in large degree man is master of 
his evolution and may turn to the past when 
the need and the desire possess him. Ancient 
Greece and Rome have much to tell Europe 
and America; specifically, what Plato would 
think of the romantic movement is pretty well 
indicated in these essays by Mr. More.

GERMANY AND THE GERMAN EMPEROR.* 

The development of modern Germany is a subject 
of perennial attractiveness for both German and 
non-German writers. The most recent of the many 
attempts which have been made by men of foreign 
antecedents to interpret the spirit and the results of 
German evolution is that of M. Henri Lichtenberger, 
mattre de conferences at the Sorbonne and a critic 
of well-established reputation. The portion of Ger- 
man history covered by M. Lichtenberger's book 
(published originally in French and now brought 
out in English translation) is that which falls between 
the era of Napoleon and our own day ; and the sub- 
jects to which attention is given comprise princi- 
pally the rise of capitalism, the transformation of 
agriculture and industry, the struggle for liberty and 
unity, the growth of foreign and home policy, the 
conflicts of religion, and the development and 
achievements of art. The drier and more familiar 
facts of economic and political growth are subordi- 
nated to the unfolding of the ideals which underlie 
religion, philosophy, and art, and fortunately the 
writer is distinctly at his best in the presentation of 
this more intensively treated portion of his subject. 
The well-read student of German affairs will find 
here little that is really new. Indeed the author 
modestly enough disclaims originality, and avows 
that he has had no object other than that of placing 
before French readers in systematic order the results 
attained by the researches of Lamprecht, Sombart, 
Treitschke, and a score of other investigators, both 
German and French, within the broad domain of 
German social phenomena. But the volume repre-

sents a marshalling of well-mastered fact, played 
upon by a faculty for facile and candid interpreta- 
tion which not even the specialist in the field can 
hope invariably to attain. The objective attitude 
which is assumed at the outset is well sustained 
throughout, and the quality of fairness pervades the 
discussion of not only international policies in which 
France and Germany are alike concerned, but the 
clash of political principles, of social ideals, and of 
religious opinions. 

The dominating force of the Germany of modern 
times is discovered in Nietzsche's free and boundless 
"will to power," representing the completest pos- 
sible severance from the medieval attitude of obedi- 
ence to tradition and authority. At the same time, 
there is declared to be to-day, in the domains of 
religion and {esthetics at least, a reaction from ration- 
alism and materialism toward mysticism and ideal- 
ism. This interlacing of rationalism and idealism 
remains, indeed, the supreme paradox of the German 
world to-day. " Of all the nations of Europe," it is 
affirmed, " the German people is one of those among 
whom scientific reason and organizing will have dis- 
played the most extraordinary prowess and modern 
subjectivism has blossomed most luxuriantly. But 
it is also one among whom the ' religious ' spirit, 
respect for tradition and authority, has retained the 
greatest strength." 

In the preparation of the book for English read- 
ers the translator might well have employed a few 
foot-notes to bring the text up to date. The repeated 
assertion that socialism suffered a decided set-back 
" in the last election " should then have been accom- 
panied by some mention of the remarkable socialist 
triumph at the elections of 1912; and the reader 
would not be left to reconcile for himself the glori- 
fication of the Von der Golz reform of the Turkish 
army with the events of the past year in the south- 
east of Europe, or the seeming triumphant sway of 
Herr Dernburg in the German Colonial Office with 
the recent enforced retirement of that official and 
the repudiation of his policies. 

A writer of somewhat cynical disposition some 
time ago defined European politics as " the science 
of misunderstanding." The characterization may 
be fantastic, but that it is not wholly lacking in 
aptness is evidenced by the succession of crises, dis- 
avowals, and " explanations " with which the history 
of international affairs is to-day, perhaps more than 
ever, filled. Diplomats and parliamentary leaders 
fail habitually to interpret aright the motives and 
purposes of States other than their own; and mis- 
understanding, savoring as it may of deliberate mis- 
construction, not infrequently leads to the very verge 
of war. Misunderstanding may hardly have been 
reduced to a science. But that there is a great deal 
of it, and that it is responsible for many unpleasant 
things that happen, among nations as well as among 
individuals, no one will undertake to dispute. 

In the gigantic enigma of international politics 
to-day the supreme factor of uncertainty is Ger- 



many, and, in Germany, the Kaiser. At every 
recurring period of unusual tension, as at the time 
of the South African war, at that of the Moroccan 
episode of 1905, or during the present Balkan con- 
flict, the most instant query of the European world 
relates to the intentions of the Berlin Government; 
and even the intervals of comparative quiet are pro- 
lific in discussion of the subject, more particularly, 
of course, in England, France, and Russia. Within 
the past twelvemonth there have appeared, in En- 
glish alone, and in addition to magazine articles 
and brochures by the score, no fewer than three 
books whose purpose is to define the position of the 
German Empire in the world of to-day, and, more 
specifically, to explain the influence, present and 
prospective, of the Emperor William II. 

Of the three the volume by Mr. Ferris is most 
ambitious in scope, though perhaps not so in aim ; 
for Mr. Fried endeavors to prove that the Kaiser is 
at all times and of necessity attached to the cause of 
peace, while Mr. Willis essays the no less consider- 
able task of demonstrating that the Emperor and his 
counsellors not only expect war shortly but are con- 
cerned only to avert its approach until all shall be 
in readiness. Beginning with an illuminating sur- 
vey of the historical geography of the portions of 
Europe comprised within the present Empire, Mr. 
Ferris devotes three chapters to a sketch of German 
social and political development to the nineteenth 
century, with an excellent review of the triumphs 
of German genius in philosophy, literature, and 
music, after which are surveyed at much greater 
length the history of the country since the Congress 
of Vienna and the conditions, political, social, and 
economic, which lend it distinction at the present 
time. Assuming that the new German Empire is 
" the most perplexing quantity in the modern world," 
the author sets out to give "an interpretation of the 
German life of to-day by the aid of the Germanic 
past." He must be credited not only with the cour- 
age to undertake a task of unusual difficulty, but 
with the skill to accomplish it in a manner worthy 
of commendation. Of historical facts he gives few, 
if any, that are new. But the interpretation of the 
physical, personal, and social forces which inter- 
played in the earlier stages of German development 
is usually sound, and the description of German 
polity and achievement within our own generation is 
exceptionally clear, well-informed, and convincing. 
A detailed characterization of the personality of the 
Kaiser is summed up in the following lucid manner : 

"The Emperor is a true Teuton in his idealism, his senti- 
mentality, his strenuous devotion to duty as he sees it, and 
his kindly anxiety to model the nation on the old-time 
patriarchal household. But he is only too evidently out 
of harmony with much of his surroundings; and in himself 
there is plainly visible a conflict between old and new ele- 
ments, between an obstinate blood-inheritance and a quick 
sensitiveness to certain aspects of modern life. The main 
body of the people does not wish to be patriarchical ; it wants 
more liberty, not less. He himself wishes to provide schools 
and universities, factories, farms, and fleets with the latest 
scientific equipment ; but whoever looks with scientific eye 
upon absentee landlords, the Prussian electoral system, or 



1913.] 



THE DIAL,

divine-right monarchy, is in his eyes a dangerous enemy of 
an inspired order. He makes friends of the Krupps and 
Ballins, the captains of competitive industrialism, and yet 
imagines that the pre-industrial organization of society can 
be maintained. . . . He wishes his people and every other 
people to enjoy the blessings of peace ; but it is the precarious 
and expensive peace of the feudal retainer whose armour 
became heavier year by year until at length the whole medi- 
aeval structure broke down. He is desperately in earnest 
in his religion ; but if the Kaiser's singular combination of 
Protestant and Catholic orthodoxies be right, how can the 
opposition of the two churches be maintained, and why should 
one of them be by law established? " 

From the disaster lurking in these inconsistencies 
the Emperor has been saved, in Mr. Perris's judg- 
ment, not by the intellectual power required to 
reconcile the divergent impulses whence they spring, 
but rather by a certain pliancy which enables him to 
give way ere the rising democratic temper breaks 
bounds. Of the divine mission of the House of 
Hohenzollern never a doubt is entertained by the 
Emperor himself, but the average German does not 
view the claim very seriously. Says Mr. Perris : 

" Except in the early years of the reign, and in a few 
short intervals since, the Kaiser has enjoyed a measure of 
popularity remarkable in the political circumstances. Had 
he been made of harder stuff, or been regarded, in his own 
words, as ' the instrument of God,' there might have been 
more obedience, but there would have been less affection. 
In his heart, if not openly, the educated German contem- 
plates the pretension to divine right as a Londoner contem- 
plates the Lord Mayor's coach. It is a harmless vanity of 
the Prussian royal family. If Bavarians or Saxons recognize 
any divine right, it is that of their own royal families. . . . 
The question, however, is felt to be of small importance in 
everyday life. Sometimes the Kaiser speaks wisely, some- 
times otherwisely. But always he is a very human being, 
and, at least, the ablest, most energetic and the most inter- 
esting sovereign of the time. Much can be pardoned for his 
virtues and his patriotism.'' 

In Mr. Fried's little volume an attempt is made 
to demonstrate from the Emperor's words and acts 
that the concept of a European rapprochement is 
much less foreign to the Wilhelmsstrasse than is 
frequently supposed, that the spirit of the age has 
produced in the Kaiser a distinct change of heart 
with respect to the desirability of peace, and, 
finally, that the proposed "peace alliance" among 
the nations does not involve, as is so widely sus- 
pected, any sort of confederation in a political sense. 
Mr. Fried is a German, the editor of one of the 
more influential periodicals of the Empire, and an 
ardent exponent of the present-day peace move- 
ment. The book under review won for him last year 
a Nobel prize. In it there is little argument for 
peace, or, directly, for the disarmament of nations. 
The desirability of these things is assumed, and 
the major portion of the volume is devoted to an 
exposition of the process by which the Emperor 
William II. has been brought, step by step, to the 
position of a real pacivist, restrained from meas- 
uring up to the full possibilities of his pivotal 
position only by the aristocratic and reactionary 
forces by which he is surrounded. When, in 1888, 
the youthful Potsdam officer mounted the throne of 
the Hohenzollerns and, turning first of all to the 
army, cried " I and the army belong to one another, 



are born for one another, and will steadfastly hold 
together, come peace or storm, as God wills it," 
the world understood that Germany had fallen 
under the dominion of a war lord whose ambition 
was likely to spell carnage and conquest. In June 
of the present year, however, the Emperor William 
will have completed a quarter of a century on the 
German throne without having ever witnessed a 
battle ; and within this prolonged period his country 
has been engaged in no war worthy of the name. 
The Emperor has, indeed, in the words of Mr. Fried, 
" composed music, delivered speeches, written poetry, 
painted pictures, done a little yachting, and studied 
sculpture and theology ; he has, in short, done every- 
thing except wage war." 

On the contrary, he has declared" I only wish 
that Europe's peace lay in my hands. I should cer- 
tainly take care it should never be disturbed." He 
has discoursed frequently and forcefully upon the 
possibilities of a peaceful federation of the European 
states. And within the past three or four years he 
has accorded frank endorsement to views regarding 
the growing impracticability of war almost identical 
with those so masterfully expounded more than a 
decade ago by the Russian state councillor Johann 
von Bloch. The Emperor clings still to the theory 
si vis pacem para bellum. He believes that war 
may be avoided only, in the last analysis, by exert- 
ing to the utmost the defensive forces of the State. 
He certainly does not want war. No one understands 
better than he the ruinous effects upon industry and 
trade which war must entail. He is beginning to 
sympathize with the idea that armaments should be 
maintained for the defense of the community of 
States, rather than for use against these States. All 
that remains, as Mr. Fried views the situation, is for 
the Emperor, whose every move in such matters is 
watched by the Powers generally, to shake off the 
restraining influences of the militarists and court 
reactionaries, and to give expression to his own im- 
pulses by coming out squarely for international con- 
federation in the interest of perpetual peace and of 
armament retrenchment. The opportunity, in Mr. 
Fried's opinion, is one which comes but seldom, even 
to monarchs. 

From the optimism of Mr. Fried to the pessimism 
of Mr. Willis is a far cry. Mr. Willis was during 
sixteen years a member of the Australian parlia- 
ment, and he has written somewhat extensively upon 
political and social topics. He displays, however, a 
cocksureness of opinion, a propensity to look upon 
the darker side of things, not to mention an occa- 
sional slovenliness of expression, by which his work 
is rendered of but second-rate importance. In the 
present volume he contends that while Germany 
wants many things, the acquisition of which would 
seriously embarrass her rivals, the chief of her de- 
sires is colonial dominion in portions of the world 
(South America is especially emphasized) where 
German-speaking people may settle in large num- 
bers and yet retain their German nationality. It is 



420 



THE DIAL 



[May 16 



assumed that Germany is working relentlessly and 
stealthily toward this end, and that if the German 
Government desires peace, it is only to gain time 
and to make surer the eventual defeat of England, 
France, and perhaps the United States. "Every 
day, and every hour of the day," it is alleged, " the 
black German clouds of war are growing darker, 
gathering more force, and obscuring, little by little 
almost imperceptibly, it may be, to some the rays 
of the sun of peace from this country [England] and 
France and perhaps from the civilized world." 
The " terrible tension " concerning what Germany 
wants, we are assured, cannot go on interminably. 
If the strain be not relieved it will reach the breaking- 
point ; that is to say, war will ensue. And the relief 
cannot long be delayed. The possibility that an 
adjustment may be attained through diplomacy is 
admitted, but the impression which one gathers from 
Mr. Willis's chapters is that war is very much more 
probable. The " German menace " is portrayed as 
a blight not merely upon outside nations but upon 
Germany herself. For the German people there is 
high praise ; the fault of the existing situation is 
attached exclusively, or almost so, to the "Great 
Sphinx," i.e., the Emperor, and the "peace-destroying 
military cliques " who are declared to rule the Em- 
pire and to determine its destiny. The book is by 
no means as intemperate as some other attacks upon 
German public polity which have emanated from 
English sources. But it certainly will not contribute 
to that spirit of international comity which it would 
seem to be the most solemn obligation of writers of 
both England arid Germany to promote. 

FREDERIC AUSTIN OGG. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



There is something paradoxical in 

von aZ life. th f . U8e of the essa y to ex P r . ess the 
spirit of youth. The energies and 

enthusiasms of that spirit are too turbulent to be 
contained in so reflective a form of literary art. But 
in his sober and thoughtful book of essays, " Youth 
and Life" (Houghton), Mr. Randolph S. Bourne, 
a Columbia graduate student, has attempted some- 
thing of a philosophic interpretation of youth. His 
temperament and training have led him to dwell 
upon the higher and more permanent aspects of 
youthfulness, those which ought to be preserved 
throughout life. Chief of these is the na'ivetS of 
intellectual outlook which means absolute truthful- 
ness, a spiritualized scientific conscience. The mo- 
ment we substitute policy for this clearness of vision 
we violate our intellectual integrity. Youthfulness 
means, therefore, a continual warring of reason 
against tradition, a conflict of two generations. " Old 
men cherish a fond delusion that there is something 
mystically valuable in mere quantity of experience. 
Now the fact is, of course, that it is the young people 
who have all the really valuable experience. It is 



they who have constantly to face new situations, to 
react constantly to new aspects of life, who are 
getting the whole beauty and terror and cruelty of 
the world in its fresh and undiluted purity." To 
sustain it, this wisdom of youth needs an enthusiastic 
idealism and a tremendous capacity for resistance 
and sacrifice. The pressures of society are all in 
favor of tradition. And so, " few men remain quite 
true to themselves. As their youthful ideals come 
into contact with the harshnesses of life, the brightest 
succumb and go to the wall. . . . Youth rules the 
world, but only when it is no longer young. It is a 
tarnished, travestied youth that is in the saddle in 
the person of middle age. Old age lives in the 
delusion that it has improved and rationalized its 
youthful ideas by experience and stored-up wisdom, 
when all it has done is to damage them more or 
less usually more. And the tragedy of life is that 
the world is run by these damaged ideals. ... It 
is the young only who are actually contemporaneous ; 
they interpret what they see freshly and without pre- 
judice ; their vision is always the truest, and their 
interpretation always the justest." As an essayist, 
Mr. Bourne has dared erase "Whim" from his 
lintel. But his style, although restrained, abounds in 
illuminating epigram and characteristic touches of 
charm. It is a book of much promise, which marks 
the arrival of an essayist who can deal with the 
larger themes with something like finality. 

The collected The lif e of Jonn Q uinc y Adams, sixth 
writings of John President of the United States, was 
Quincv Adams. one o f tne f u ii e8 t lived by any Amer- 
ican. Yet to write a biography of Adams is a 
task that has been attempted by few American his- 
torians. The reasons for this apparent inattention 
are doubtless many. The subject may have been 
deemed unattractive. Hardly any man was more 
unpopular. In Adams's case there seems to have 
developed no later growth of interest, such as in 
recent years has brought more justice to James K. 
Polk. But a deeper explanation, we suspect, lies in 
the fact that Adams was the prince of American 
autobiographers. The voluminous "Memoirs " which, 
under the editorship of Charles Francis Adams, the 
President's son, was published in 1874-7 (though 
the work is relatively rare and known to few besides 
special students of American history), constitutes 
one of the most absorbing documents in the sources 
of American political history ; and it would seem 
that the autobiography has awed the biographer. 
Another reason is that but little of the correspond- 
ence of John Quincy Adams has heretofore been 
available. A few letters have been printed, some, 
for example, in a bulletin of the New York Public 
Library, and some in the "American Historical 
Review." It is with expectancy and interest, 
therefore, that one welcomes the first volume of a 
definitive edition of Adams's complete " Writings " 
(Macmillan). This initial volume begins with a 
letter written by Adams in his twelfth year, as he 
was about to return with his father from the latter's 



1913]

mission to France, and closes with letters written 
in the first part of 1786, when the writer, though 
commissioned minister to Portugal, was still at The 
Hague. In the period included between these dates, 
Adams writes of his boyhood travels on the conti- 
nent and in England, of his life at Harvard, of his 
law studies in Newburyport, and of the early days 
of his practice in Boston. We follow him in his 
entrance into politics, and into the beginnings of 
that diplomatic service which filled so much of his 
youth. Indeed, by far the larger number of the 
letters are those which in his official capacity and 
as a dutiful son he wrote during his extended stay 
in Holland. The precocity of the writer is abun- 
dantly manifested throughout the letters and the 
early political essays here reprinted. One senses a 
touch of priggishness, perhaps, in some of the boy- 
ish letters ; but such an impression is forgotten in 
admiration of the capacity and the poise of the 
writer. Occasionally there is a glint of humor, a 
quality not often revealed in the "Memoirs." The 
historical value of the collection is great, both for 
the keen observations on European politics and 
for the penetrating comments on American affairs. 
That the collection is edited by Mr. Worthington C. 
Ford is a sufficient assurance of the adequacy of 
the editorial comment. The notes, always succinct, 
are rich in explanatory enlightenment where this is 
needed. One additional help to the student, which 
we should have been glad to see in the first volume, 
is perhaps only deferred to the last : this is a general 
note on the Adams papers. A bibliography of the 
published writings of Adams is promised by Mr. 
Ford; and surely this will be the proper occasion 
for a similar contribution with regard to the manu- 
scripts on which the present publication is based. 
This would supplant the notes in Winsor, and would 
round out the information which the individual 
student may occasionally have picked up. A list 
of the letters by Adams already in print, and some 
hint as to the extent and character of the letters to 
Adams, would be a boon highly appreciated by many 
laborers in this period of American history. 

Stories of With the exception of the introduc- 

the English tory chapter, Miss Kate F. Kimball's 
cathedrals. u An English Cathedral Journey" 

(Crowell) appeared originally in "The Chautauquan" 
magazine ; and now appeals to the wider audience 
known as the general public. It is a compact little 
volume, not too big for the pocket; and contains the 
story of Westminster Abbey and eight cathedrals 
Canterbury, Rochester, Lincoln, Durham, Ely, Salis- 
bury, Lichfield, and York. This is a fair represen- 
tation of the thirty-seven cathedrals of England 
and Wales; but the intrinsic interest would have 
been heightened by substituting for Rochester, say, 
Gloucester, where the Perpendicular style origin- 
ated. This would have recognized the western 
group of cathedrals, and would have preserved the 
geographical balance. If neighborhood was to be 
considered, Winchester might have been added to 



Salisbury, and Peterborough to Ely, without unduly 
thickening the book. As it is, the traveller will 
often be forced to dive into another pocket for 
his Baedeker or other stand-by. Still, our "vish 
there vos more," on the principle announced by Mr. 
Samuel Weller, is based on our enjoyment of what 
there is. Miss Kimball writes with honest and well- 
informed enthusiasm, is posted on periods and 
styles, does not forget historic associations, and 
tempers technicalities to the capacity of the aver- 
age intelligent traveller. The practical value of 
the book is increased by some useful addenda in the 
shape of measurements of the nine churches, a sur- 
vey of the architectural periods, a bibliography, a 
glossary of architectural and ecclesiastical terms, 
and the indispensable index. The illustrations are 
abundant, and some of them especially interesting, 
as being taken from unusual points of view; e. g., 
the triforium of Durham, the cloister garth of 
Canterbury from the northwest, and York's chapter- 
house. On page 286, "Rochester" should read 
" Salisbury "; on page 289, " chapel-of-ease " would 
seem to belong to the ecclesiastical, rather than to 
the architectural part of the glossary; and the 
definition of "tympanum," on page 293, speaks 
rather confusingly of the "space between the hori- 
zontal opening of a doorway and the arch above." 

A near view To Mr - Stanley Washburn, one of 
of the hero of the few newspaper correspondents 
Port Arthur. attached to General Nogi's staff at 
Port Arthur and later at Moukden, it was given to 
gain some acquaintance with the great commander 
as he was in moments of relaxation and in the circle 
of his friends. " Nogi : A Man against the Back- 
ground of a Great War " (Holt) presents in a few 
brief pen-strokes the picture of that heroic figure as 
seen from day to day during the harrowing suspense 
of the long siege and in the succeeding months of 
the war, notably at the moment when the bitterly 
disappointing terms of the Portsmouth treaty became 
known to the Japanese soldiers at the front. The 
quietness, simplicity, and modesty of the hero of 
Port Arthur are shown to have been all that one 
would have expected and desired in so truly great 
a man ; but the inherited instinct of command and 
the power to enforce obedience were ever present. 
" To his men and to his officers he was always kind 
and conciliatory, but never under any circumstances 
familiar. When he spoke to them, he spoke curtly 
and they acted instantly. A moment's delay on their 
part and one sharp look, like the flash of a smould- 
ering flame, would bring them to their feet in an 
instant with blood surging up beneath their skins." 
His heroic endurance of the loss of his two sons and 
of countless dear friends in that fearfully costly war, 
his kindheartedness so seemingly in contrast with the 
orders he issued that sent thousands and tens of thou- 
sands to certain death in the assaults on Port Arthur, 
his complete indifference to the honors showered 
upon him by a grateful and admiring nation when 
victory had perched on his banners all this and

more will be found duly set forth in Mr. Washburn's 
pages, with a final chapter devoted to the tragically 
impressive circumstances of the hero's death. Por- 
traits of Nogi and other appropriate illustrations 
abound. Though the oriental mind is held to be a 
closed book to the Westerner, the author has suc- 
ceeded in presenting a very real and human and 
attractive character, as well as a noble one, in this 
brief sketch of a great Japanese military com- 
mander. . 

A handbook He is . a bold Pphet who would ven- 
of Mexico and ture, in the midst of the disturbed 
Central America, conditions which have prevailed in 
Mexico since the enforced retirement of Porfirio 
Diaz, to predict what the future has in store for 
that distressed country. And judging from its title, 
Mr. Joseph King Goodrich's "The Coming Mexico" 
(McClurg) would seem to be thus prophetic. In the 
first sentence of his preface, however, the author 
disclaims any such intention ; and it is well that he 
does, for within a few days after his book appeared 
the "unexpected happened." The government, 
upon which the more hopeful observers of recent 
conditions relied, was overthrown; the President 
and Vice-President were assassinated, and Mexico 
became as reactionary as in the days of Santa Ana 
or of Miramon. Mr. Goodrich's book is, on the other 
hand, an interesting survey of the country (includ- 
ing the Central American States), and is fuller and 
more thorough than any other book on that fascinat- 
ing subject that has recently appeared. In its chap- 
ters on mountaineering, the seaports, and attractions 
for the tourist, sportsman, and health seekers, it 
presents information not to be found elsewhere, 
accompanied by illustrations especially attractive 
because of their freshness. The author's first ac- 
quaintance with Mexico was made in 1866, but the 
book is based upon recent visits. In his historical 
references Mr. Goodrich is committed to views of 
the civilization and form of government prevailing 
among the primitive races which have been aban- 
doned by students since the time of Lewis H. Mor- 
gan and Bandelier; and his two references to the 
so-called " Pastry War" are hopelessly irreconcilable, 
and neither of them is accurate. But in other and 
more important respects, the book is exceedingly 
helpful to a thorough knowledge of Mexico and 
Central America. 

Early English To the six splendidly-illustrated folio 
domestic volumes of " Gardens Old and New " 

architecture. and <; In English Homes," published 
by "Country Life" of London, is now added a 
supplementary and uniform volume dealing with 
"English Homes of the Early Renaissance" (imported 
by Scribner). Mr. H. Avray Tipping is the editor 
of this, as of the other volumes in the series; and 
the numerous fine photographs are from Mr. Charles 
Latham's negatives. The work deals with the ex- 
terior characteristics of the country homes planned 
and erected in England during the century between 
the close of the reign of Henry VIII. and the out- 



break of the Civil War in 1642. Tracing the gradual 
evolution of the Elizabethan home from the time 
that the early Renaissance style, "a classic veneer 
upon a Gothic framework," was in vogue, it reveals 
insistently the fact that features of medisevalism 
were slow in disappearing, despite the best efforts 
at innovation on the part of John Shute in the six- 
teenth century or of Inigo Jones a hundred years 
later. The most radical changes were effected in 
diminishing the size of the hall (which to the me- 
diaeval Englishman was practically his house), the 
elimination of the winding form of staircase, an 
increased attention to adequate and serviceable 
fenestration, an over-emphasis of furniture and 
decorative objects which led to considering the walls 
and ceiling as mere backgrounds instead of works 
of art in themselves, as well as minor details. Many 
of the homes described have been chosen for their 
historic interest; others, because of their present 
ownership. "Batemans," a Jacobean house in East 
Sussex and now in the possession of Mr. Rudyard 
Kipling, is only one instance of an unspoiled survival 
from a romantic past, thanks to the artistic percep- 
tion of the owner, who has not adopted the modern 
"improving" spirit, where reparations have been 
necessary. Wooton Lodge, Shaw House in Berk- 
shire, Borwick Hall, and Shipton Hall in Shropshire 
are typical examples of magnificent centres around 
which much that is of significant historic interest 
has been grouped. However, to gain a clear insight 
into the style known as Early Renaissance, a study 
of all of the forty-three places dealt with in this vol- 
ume is essential. And the reader will be well repaid ; 
for, added to the wealth of architectural lore here 
offered, are interesting bits from the life-stories of 
the notable men and women who lived within these 
walls and an abundance of those curious village tradi- 
tions with which all history is intimately connected. 

From the pen of one who has the 
" travel-fever in his blood, and whose 

style shows something of the art of 
the born word-painter, there comes a rambling tale 
of world-wide wandering, under the fanciful title of 
"The Shadow Show" (Doran). Mr. J. H. Curie, 
the author of the book, says of himself on an early 
page, " To-day, at forty, I have seen the world from 
end to end," and indeed his travel-record includes 
every continent and some of the islands. One 
of eleven children, he enjoyed the advantages of 
being, in a manner, crowded out of the home nest 
at fourteen years of age, and has been intermittently 
"on the go" ever since. South African mining 
seems to have been his chief business interest, the 
study of mankind, from China to Peru, his favorite 
amusement. Taking part in the Jameson fiasco 
and coming in contact with Cecil Rhodes, he be- 
came so impressed with the latter's commanding 
qualities as to find no one worthy of naming in the 
same breath with him except General Porfirio Diaz. 
Knowing the world well, Mr. Curie has also become 
well acquainted with himself; he knows his own

strength, and presumably also his weakness. "I 
feel I was born to manage a great mine," he tells 
us. "The qualities were there financial, execu- 
tive, administrative though I did not use them. 
With natives, too, I could do anything. ... I knew 
just how mines were developing all over the world 
how this one was improving, this declining, and that 
other being forced for stock- jobbing. My knowl- 
edge of the personnel of the mining world was 
unique." But the demon of restlessness made a 
globe-trotter of the potential mining magnate; and 
so we have from his hand these entertaining chap- 
ters of travel and of passing comment on the foibles 
of his fellow-beings, instead of certain unneeded 
additions to the world's stock of precious metals. 
There is an assurance and dash in his manner that 
reconcile us even to the philosophizing and the 
moralizing that naturally spring from so wide and 
varied a knowledge of the world. "I have led a 
glorious life," is his opening sentence, and it gives 
the keynote to the book. 

A philosophy Philosophy of history, in these days 
of reiigous of grubbing that we call research 

history. an( j stupidity of expression that we 

call scientific accuracy, is a lost art. It requires 
imagination, and those endowed with imagination 
have tended to become stock-brokers or journalists 
rather than historians. In the case of Dr. E. Noel 
Reichardt's " The Significance of Ancient Religions 
in Relation to Human Evolution and Brain Develop- 
ment" (Dodd), the writer is a physician. What he 
offers is a very pretty imaginative treatment of the 
history of religions from a point of view that brings 
into focus "a very solid and extensive array of 
historical facts. From that point of view, the evolu- 
tionary movement in humanity is seen to be a suc- 
cession of rhythmical Racial movements. In each 
movement a single wave of energy operates simul- 
taneously on large numbers of human beings through- 
out a long series of generations, and endows the 
whole mass with the specific unity of a Race. The 
vital impetus rises to a certain point of intensity, 
and then ebbs away and becomes extinct; as if it 
were itself the expression of the life of a living 
organism." History so conceived becomes a drama 
of which the protagonist is a "germ-plasm" or a 
"generic wave," whose behavior constitutes the 
successive acts that we call Egyptian, Babylonian, 
Persian, Hindoo, Jewish, and so on down to Protes- 
tant religion. The crest of the wave is the Jewish 
religion, its trough contemporary protestantism. 
With the changes in its own phases there go con- 
comitant changes in the structure of the brain, and 
each religion represents the deposit of an additional 
and higher layer of cells in the brain. Confutation 
would be easy, but thankless. One does not confute 
a picture or a sonata ; one likes or dislikes. No 
more does one confute a philosophy of history. It 
may be fantastic, mythological, unverifiable ; but 
it does, at least, see religious life steadily and see it 
whole. It combines learning with articulate vision ; 



and if the vision is somewhat Post-Impressionistic, it 
is none the less a higher and better thing than the 
inarticulate messes that are turned out of our labor- 
atories of historical research as historical "truth." 



Science 
and the 
human mind. 



The ability to survey in brief com- 
pass and yet maintain a significant 
perspective of a vast and complex 
domain is sufficiently unusual to direct attention to 
a successful example in the works of Mr. and Mrs. 
William C. D. Whetham and to their latest contribu- 
tion, "Science and the Human Mind" (Longmans). 
These readable pages give a vital sense of the 
reality of scientific thought in the ancient world; 
its subsequent suppression and reconstruction in 
mediaeval and renaissance times, and its growth 
and final dominance in modern eras. Much of the 
story is distinctly philosophical, but philosophical in 
the truer sense of an interpretation not apart from, 
but intimately related to, the advances of knowledge 
within the natural sciences. The largest service of 
this volume lies in its adaptability to the needs of 
such public library readers as retain the spontaneous 
interest of the student. A text is apt to suffer from 
too didactic methods, and from lack of connection 
with interpretation of real problems and situations. 
The present volume not only sustains this important 
interest, but gives it a new meaning under the racial 
concept. It sets forth the larger contributions of 
Civilization in terms of the racial spirit and its 
dominance. It thus occupies the ground between 
philosophy and science, and unites their problems in 
a common view-point. Mr. and Mrs. Whetham are 
favorably known as the authors of a considerable 
series of popularizations of the best type, concerned 
with the modern problems of heredity, eugenics, 
and the applications of scientific ideas to practical 
problems. Their larger venture reflects the same 
admirable qualities as characterize the more special- 
ized volumes. 

How one man A book to Send *?" city-dweller 
found his way countryward after his long winter of 
back to nature, confinement and impure air, electric 
lights by day and night, and artificiality of countless 
sorts at all times, is Mr. Truman A. De Weese's 
prose pastoral, "The Bend in the Road, and How a 
Man of the City Found It" (Harper). Like Mrs. 
Henry Wade Rogers's "Journal of a Country 
Woman," which made its welcome appearance a 
little while ago, the book points the way to vacation 
rest and reinvigoration of the most wholesome kind. 
As a change of occupation and interests, the care of 
a small farm not too remote from the city certainly 
possesses almost ideal advantages. The finding and 
reclaiming of a ten-acre abandoned farm on a pictur- 
esque hilltop, rich in the potential delights of rosy- 
cheeked apples and purple grapes, was Mr. De 
Weese's way of discovering "the bend in the road." 
But a much smaller patch of ground, " an acre with 
nothing on it except soil that will grow things," is 
enough to furnish healthful recreation to the jaded 
city man. " If he can get three acres, or five acres,

with a nice old house and barn on it, so much the 
better. He will be surprised to find how easy it is 
to get a little haven of joy like this where his soul 
can expand and his lungs wash themselves out with 
the pure ozone of the country, when once he starts 
out to find it. Like the author of that noteworthy 
book, "New Lives for Old," Mr. De Weese enjoys 
the advantage of having a wife who is heart and 
soul with him in his bucolic enterprise, also a boy to 
work and play at his side; and the hired man is 
another important member of the household. The 
book savors of reality and wholesomeness, and is 
well illustrated with drawings and photo-engravings. 
In its optimistic tone it goes so far as to assert that 
"there are signs that the human tide that has been 
surging toward the cities has reached its ebb" 
which would be almost too good to be true. 

M , Mark Twain, as known and admired 
Twain at and loved at Bermuda, and later 

Bermuda. an( j more briefly at Stormfield, is 

the unfailingly interesting subject of Miss Elizabeth 
Wallace's gracefully and tenderly written and beau- 
tifully illustrated volume, "Mark Twain and the 
Happy Island" (McClurg). Mr. Albert Bigelow 
Paine's memorable picture of the humorist in this 
quiet retreat is filled in with sundry significant and 
characteristic details by Miss Wallace's deft hand, 
showing especially the white-haired, white-clad man 
in his relations with children, the "Angel-fish" of 
that choice little society he founded and fostered in 
the last years of his life. Both with pen and with 
camera Miss Wallace has presented to view the 
most winning side of her kind-hearted friend. His 
friend and benefactor, the late Henry H. Rogers, 
is also effectively included in the picture. A few 
letters from Mark Twain to the writer, proving the 
closeness of their intimacy, are added, and a short 
introduction by his trusted biographer and literary 
executor opens the book. In Mr. Paine's words, 
"the world will be the better and Mark Twain's 
memory the sweeter for these gentle chapters." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

It gives one something like a thrill to open "The 
China Year Book " for 1912, as edited by Messrs. H. T. 
Montague Bell and H. G. W. Woodhead, and read " The 
Republic of China" as the title of the first chapter. 
For the rest, the work is an invaluable compendium of 
statistics and other facts relating to what was so re- 
cently known as the Middle Kingdom. There is a 
large folding map. The volume is published by Messrs. 
E. P. Dutton & Co. 

"The Chronology of Modern India" (Edinburgh: 
John Grant), by Mr. James Burgess, enumerates briefly 
the important events connected with the history of 
India for four hundred years from the close of the 
fifteenth century, 1494 A.D., to 1894. With its material 
collected from the most trustworthy historical sources 
accessible, it forms a useful supplement to the manual 
of India's earlier history prepared by Miss C. Mabel 
Duff, and published in 1899. Where irregularities in 



the spelling of proper names occur, the form here repre- 
sented corresponds with that in use in the most recent 
gazetteers and maps prepared by the Indian government. 
A fairly complete index helps to make the volume a 
practical reference work for the general reader or for 
the student of Indian affairs. 

A second edition of Professor T. R. Glover's admir- 
able book on Virgil (Macmillan) will be warmly wel- 
comed by all lovers of the humanities. For his revision 
the author has profited by the bitter reviews of the orig- 
inal work, and the net result is a thoroughly creditable 
and readable treatise as a detail of interest to readers 
for whom a reasonable price does not detract from the 
value of a good book. We would mention that the 350 
generous pages can now be purchased for two dollars. 

Miss Margaret E. Tabor's little handbook, "The 
Saints in Art " (E. P. Dutton & Co.), now in a second 
and corrected edition, is a convenient guide for the 
visitor to picture galleries and churches who finds the 
descriptions in the ordinary tourist's handbook insuffi- 
cient. There are accounts of the important saints, 
explanations of their attributes or symbols, and legend* 
connected with them. The alphabetical arrangement 
and the conciseness of treatment make the volume valu- 
able for easy reference. 

A useful digest of business information, " What to 
Read on Business," containing classified and annotated 
reading lists for the use of the business man, has been 
published by the Business Book Bureau of New York. 
The books and magazine articles listed are principally 
such as have been published within the last five years, 
and the concise descriptions of their contents, prices, 
etc., make the little volume a convenient handbook for 
the active business man who desires easy access to 
summaries of the best that has been published in his 
field. 

The Dramatic Index for 1912," published by the 
Boston Book Co., and edited by Mr. Frederick W. 
Faxon, is an index of articles, books, and illustrations 
having for their subjects the drama. "It is a guide to 
texts of plays, excerpts or synopses of stories, criticisms 
of plot and production, notices of premiere performances; 
to portraits of actors, actresses, and playwrights, scenes 
and groups from plays, plans and views of theatres." 
It constitutes a reference work of indispensable value 
to the thousands of people who are now awakened to 
the significance of dramatic art as a means of culture. 

Mr. H. G. Wells's discourse on " The Discovery of 
the Future," deli vered recently at the Royal Institution, 
is published in tasteful book-form by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. 
The discourse, thoroughly characteristic of its author, 
opens wide visions of coming development in the universe 
of life and mind, and predicts an increasing capability 
on man's part to penetrate the veil that hides the future, 
just as he has trained and augmented his power to pierce 
the gloom that shrouds the past. But " the knowledge 
of the future we hope to gain will be general and not 
individual; it will be no sort of knowledge that will 
either hamper us in the exercise of our individual free 
will or relieve us of our personal responsibility." From 
the startling possibility, or even probability, that man 
is not the highest product of evolution, but only repre- 
sents one step in an ascending series, Mr. Wells does 
not shrink. The thought fascinates him, and the un- 
biased and speculative reader will be fascinated by his 
manner of presenting this and other suggestions to our 
candid consideration.

NOTES. 



" Joyous Gard " is the title of a new book by Mr. 
Arthur C. Benson which Messrs. Putnam are about to 
publish. 

Mr. Algernon Blackwood has a new novel almost 
ready for publication. It is entitled " A Prisoner in 
Fairyland." 

A translation of " The Education of Karl Witte," 
edited by Mr. H. Addington Bruce, is announced for 
early publication by Thomas Y. Crowell Co. 

The popular low-priced reissue of " Bohn's Libra- 
ries," which we mentioned in a recent number, will be 
published in this country by the Macmillan Co. 

Miss Mary Caroline Crawford is engaged upon a 
volume dealing with " The Romance of the American 
Theatre," which Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. will pub- 
lish in the autumn. 

The substance of Sir William Osier's Silliman lec- 
tures on "The Evolution of Modern Medicine," which 
he is now giving at Yale University, will be published 
later in book form by the Yale University Press. 

" What Can Literature Do For Me ?" is the title of 
a book just announced by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & 
Co. for publication this month. The author is Professor 
C. Alphonso Smith of the University of Virginia. 

" Out of the North " is the title of a collection of 
Arctic poems by Mr. Howard V. Sutherland which will 
be published shortly by Desmond FitzGerald, Inc. The 
late Joaquin Miller contributes a " foreword " to the 
volume. 

An elaborate folio volume on " Animal Portraiture, ' 
consisting of fifty reproductions in color of paintings of 
animal life by Wilhelm Kuhnert, with descriptive text 
by R. Lydekker, is announced by Messrs. Frederick 
Warne & Co. 

Mr. Thomas Hardy, according to recent reports from 
England, has given permission for the dramatization of 
" The Woodlanders." The stage version of this novel 
will be presented in the autumn by the Dorchester 
Dramatic Society. 

Two important books on religious subjects announced 
for early publication by the Macmillan Co. are " Religion 
and Life " by Dr. Henry Churchill King, and " The 
Country Church " by Messrs. Gifford Pinchot and 
Charles Otis Gill. 

Dr. Lewis Gaston Leary is leaving this week for the 
Mediterranean, the principal object of his trip being to 
procure the latest available data on Syria for his forth- 
coming volume, "Syria, the Land of Lebanon," which is 
to be published this fall by Messrs. McBride, Nast & Co. 

Of unusual interest in connection with the fiftieth 
anniversary of the battle of Gettysburg is Mrs. La Salle 
Corbell Pickett's volume, " The Bugles of Gettysburg," 
which Messrs. F. G. Browne & Co. publish this month. 
The author is the widow of General George E. Pickett, 
whose division formed the centre of the Confederate 
assault on Cemetery Ridge, on the fateful third day of 
the battle. 

The first volume of the remarkable series of auto- 
biographical novels by August Strindberg will be pub- 
lished this month by Messrs. Putnam in an English 
version entitled " The Son of a Servant." The allusion 
in this title, as Mr. Edwin Bjorkman has pointed out, 
was twofold " to the author's birth, and to the position 
which fate, in his own eyes, seemed to have assigned 
him, both as man and as artist." 



A collection of the Hon. James Bryce's " University 
and Historical Addresses " is announced for early pub- 
lication by the Macmillan Co. Three other forthcoming 
issues of this house, not previously announced, are : " The 
Life of Edward A. Moseley," by Mr. James Morgan; 
" The Church and the Labor Conflict," by Mr. Parley 
Paul Womer ; and " The Influence of Monarchs," by 
Mr Frederick Adams Woods. 

Three new volumes, all by American authors, will 
appear at once in Messrs. Holt's " Home University 
Library." They are: " Writing English Prose," by 
Professor W. T. Brewster of Columbia University, the 
American editor of the Series ; " The Literature of the 
Old Testament," by Professor George F. Moore of 
Harvard; and "From Jefferson to Lincoln" by Pro- 
fessor William MacDonald of Brown University. 

Mr. Robert W. Neeser's noteworthy account of his 
cruise with the Atlantic Fleet "A Landsman's Log," 
recently reviewed by us is already about to pass into 
a second edition, with its appended statistics brought 
up as nearly to date as possible. In our query as to 
the cost of a modern battleship's maintenance, we had 
in mind the larger type of battleship, not the one of 
average size, and thus may have conveyed an errone- 
ous impression concerning the trustworthiness of Mr. 
Neeser's figures, which were drawn from the latest 
official sources. 

The Trustees of the American-Scandinavian Founda- 
tion have decided upon a plan of work which promises 
to be of great importance in the cultural relations of 
America and Scandinavia. The steadily increasing 
interest in Northern life has created a demand for 
standard translations of Scandinavian literature, suitable 
for colleges and universities and for public and private 
libraries. Beginning in 1914, the Foundation will issue 
a series of Scandinavian Classics in uniform size and 
binding. The volumes will be chosen by a committee of 
scholars with special knowledge of the field, and will be 
rendered into English by competent translators. The 
committee plan to make the series broadly representative 
of Scandinavian literature and to include some of the 
best books of popular interest along with works that may 
meet the requirements of students. The list at present 
contains the Eddas, Holberg's comedies, Bjiirnson's 
plays, lyrics, and letters, the works of Tegne"r, Rune- 
berg, Drachmann, and Herman Bang, as well as of 
several living writers, still quite unknown to American 
readers. It is possible that the first book of the series 
will be three of Holberg's comedies. The Foundation 
has also under consideration the publication of a series 
of learned monographs on Scandinavian subjects. An 
English version of " Danmarks Heltedigtning," by Dr. 
Axel Olrik, will possibly begin this series. 

A volume of " Essays on Chaucer," by Professor 
George Lyman Kittredge is announced by the Harvard 
University Press. The Press has also in preparation 
the following books: " Essays on English Agrarian His- 
tory in the Sixteenth Century," by Dr. Edwin Francis 
Gay; " Studies in Anglo-Norman Institutions," by Dr. 
Charles Homer Haskins ; " Hyperbolic Functions of 
Complex Variables," by Professor Arthur Edwin Ken- 
nelly ; " The Scientific Work of Morris Loeb," edited 
by Dr. Theodore William Richards; " Architectural 
Acoustics," by Professor Wallace Clement Sabine; 
" The Way of Salvation," translated from the original 
Pali into English by Dr. Charles Rockwell Lamnan; 
" The Search for Salvation in the Greek and Roman 
World," by Dr. Clifford Herschel Moore; "Judaism at

A New Volume in 

A NEW VARIORUM EDITION 

of the Works of 
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 

JULIUS CAESAR 

Edited by 
HORACE HOWARD FURNESS, Jr. 

Being the Seventeenth Volume. 

Royal 8vo. Cloth. Gilt top. Uncut edges .... $4.00 net 
Half Morocco. Gilt top. Uncut edge* 5.00 net 

Carriage extra. 

The publication of a new volume of the Variorum Edition is 
always an event in the literary world and it is therefore with 
pleasure that we announce the completion of the Seventeenth 
Volume. 

The preparation of the new Variorum Edition of the Works 
of Shakespeare was the life work of Dr. Horace Howard 
Furness, who is acknowledged to have been the world's greatest 
authority on Shakespeare. 

For many years he was assisted by his son, Horace Howard 
Furness, Jr., who has contributed two volumes to the set 
Richard the Third, and a revised edition of Macbeth. The 
publication of these volumes demonstrated the wisdom of Dr. 
Furness in associating his son with this invaluable work, so 
stupendous as to be beyond the ability of a lifetime to complete. 

To Horace Howard Furness, Jr., now falls the task of editing 
the remaining plays. This important work will, therefore, be 
continued along the same lines laid down by Dr. Horace Howard 
Furness. Descriptive booklet sent on request.

A DELIGHTFUL OUT-OF-DOOR ANTHOLOGY 



THE 

ROLLING 
EARTH 

OUTDOOR SCENES 
AND THOUGHTS 

FROM THE 

WRITINGS OF 

WALT WHITMAN 

COMPILED BY 
WALDO R. BROWNE 

WITH INTRODUCTION BY 
JOHN BURROUGHS 

Photogravure Portrait, $1.00 net 



WHITMAN'S writing of nature, whether in 
poetry or prose, is always marked by vividness and 
actuality : in verse by a lyrical passion and in prose by a 
luxuriance of observation that are unique. This collection 
of out-of-door passages from his writings will appeal strongly, 
not only to all admirers of his poetry, but to all lovers of the 
open. It is an ideal book for the pocket on a country walk, 
and an equally ideal gift for the nature-lover. 



"The unconventional character of Whitman's writing is seen at its 
best in these rapturous and sometimes almost riotous outpourings of 
satisfaction in the joy of living out of doors." The Living Age. 

" An altogether discriminating anthology Whitman poet and 

Whitman diarist are both most happily represented. ' ' The Independent. 

" A welcome little outdoor book, fit for the pocket. . . . The selec- 
tions are from the journals and poems, and show Whitman keenly 
observant of and exultant in his surroundings." The Nation. 

" For him who loves Whitman and frequent reference to him at his 
best, yet wishes a pocketable volume, ' The Rolling Earth ' is ideal." 

Chicago Tribune.

A Noteworthy 
New Novel 



" ' V. V.'s Eyes ' is far better than 
' Queed.' Its plot is far more firmly 
interwoven with life and destiny ; its 
characters move at the same time far 
more freely in this scheme of things 
which he has borrowed from exist- 
ence." New York Tribune. 




By the Author of 
' Queed ' 

" ' V. V.'s Eyes ' is a novel to be read 
and remembered. It must take rank

FRANCIS FISHER BROWNE. 

1843-1913. 

" The dedication of a man's life and whole mind to 
a cause, there's heroism." Meredith. 

" Strongest minds 

Are often those of whom the noisy world 
Hears least; else surely this Man had not left 
His graces unrevealed and unproclaimed. 
But, as the mind was filled with inward light, 
So not without distinction had he lived, 
Beloved and honoured far as he was known." 

Wordsworth. 

Something less than three weeks ago there 
died in California the man who conceived, 
projected, and for nearly a third of a century 
conducted this journal. His death has occa- 
sioned little comment outside the circle of those 
who in one way or another came in direct con- 
tact with his personality. Like all sensitive and 
finely-grained natures, he made no claims for 
himself, preferring rather to work obscurely for 
high ends than to gain popularity at the slightest 
cost of lowered standards. He belonged distinc- 
tively to the older editorial school, the genial 
and scholarly and urbane type which, as long as 
Mr. Howells and Mr. Alden are with us, cannot 
yet be termed extinct. Such men make little 
noise in the world, and are seldom widely known 
in their own day ; but posterity has a habit of 
finding them out. It cannot be doubted that in 
the rolls of the future the name of him who has 
just left us will be found with that small but 
shining company of whom Curtis and Norton 
and Stedman are perhaps the chief recent exem- 
plars, the men whose lives were given with 
quiet steadfastness to advancing the interests 
and enhancing the honor of culture in America. 

Francis Fisher Browne was born at South 
Halifax, Vermont, on December 1, 1843. His 
parentage, on both sides, was of the purest New 
England stock. His line ran back to Puritan 
days, and his forebears followed the fortunes of 
Washington in the Revolution. The blood of 
"John Brown of Osawatomie" flowed in his 
veins, and on both his paternal and maternal 
sides he inherited a love of personal freedom 
and a literary tendency which dominated his 
life. His father, William Goldsmith Brown, 



438 



THE DIAL 



[June 1 



was a poet of unusual gifts, the author of two 
poems which are very widely known "A 
Hundred Years to Come " and " Mother, Home, 
and Heaven"; and his uncle, the Rev. Nathan 
Brown, was a linguist of world-wide reputation 
and one of that intrepid band of New England 
missionaries who carried the word in a practical 
way to the farthest corners of the earth. It was 
Nathan Brown who first (in 1874) gave the 
Japanese their versions of the New Testament 
and our grand old English hymns, the transla- 
tions being his own, set up and printed by his 
own hand at his little press in Yokohama. 

Early in Mr. Browne's childhood, the family 
moved to Western Massachusetts, where the boy 
went to school and learned the printing trade 
in his father's newspaper office at Chicopee. 
As a lad of eighteen, he left the high school in 
answer to the government's call for volunteers, 
serving for a year with the 46th Massachusetts 
Regiment in North Carolina and with the Army 
of the Potomac. When the regiment was 
discharged, in 1863, he decided to take up the 
study of law. Removing to Rochester, N. Y., 
he entered a law office in that city ; and a year 
or two later began a brief course in the law 
department of the University of Michigan. He 
was unable to continue in college, however, and 
returned to Rochester to follow his trade. 
Here, in 1867, he was married to Susan Seaman 
Brooks, who, with nine children (six sons and 
three daughters), survives him. 

A strong hereditary tendency toward litera- 
ture had already asserted itself, and immediately 
after his marriage he came to Chicago with the 
definite intention of engaging in literary work. 
It was assuredly arid and stony soil that he 
chose as a field for his labors. The gigantic 
young city even now after immeasurable cul- 
tural advances a byword for materialism in the 
mouths of many was at that time a veritable 
hotbed of philistinism. Zeal in commercial 
activity was its only rule of action, pride in 
commercial success its only ideal. The hope of 
establishing in such an environment any suc- 
cessful appeal in behalf of culture and the spirit 
must have seemed forlorn indeed ; yet he was 
not deterred. Casting about for an opening he 
soon discovered that the only journalistic pre- 
tender in the field of his ambitions was " The 
Western Monthly," a newly-established peri- 
odical which, though crude and floundering, yet 
held some elements of promise. Becoming asso- 
ciated with this venture, he at once began to 
impart a new and dignified character to its 
pages, as well as new energy to its business 



management. . With the fuller establishment of 
his control he rechristened the magazine, the 
word " Lakeside," now so familiar and widely- 
used in Chicago, being first employed in the 
new title, " The Lakeside Monthly." The best 
writers throughout the West were gradually 
enlisted as contributors ; and it was not long 
before the magazine was receiving from nearly 
every quarter outside of Chicago itself the most 
flattering recognition. But along with this in- 
creasing prestige came a series of extraneous set- 
backs and calamities. In 1870 afire destroyed 
the magazine's printing-office, with its subscrip- 
tion list and entire current edition. Publication 
was at once resumed, however, after the lapse 
of a single issue only. Then a year later came 
the historic fire of 1871, in which the whole of 
Chicago's business section was consumed, and 
with it every visible asset of the magazine. But 
the intellectual force behind it was unsubdued ; 
and after a brief delay the magazine once more 
arose from the ashes. The financial panic of 
two years later, which swept out of existence so 
many enterprises far more firmly based, was 
weathered by the indomitable resolution of a 
man determined upon success. But these defi- 
nite catastrophes were of less significance, as 
affecting the periodical's destiny, than were cer- 
tain constant and more subtle discouragements 
that now began to gather strength. Without 
means himself, even for a comfortable liveli- 
hood, its proprietor had continually to appeal 
for support from men to whom his own ideal- 
istic aims and purposes meant little or nothing. 
The financial backing of the enterprise was in 
consequence always upon a slender and precari- 
ous basis. Worst of all, ill-health a heritage 
of army days aggravated by the constant toil 
and anxiety of ten years began to gain the 
upper hand. At a time when the magazine was 
practically self-sustaining and its prospects 
brighter than they ever had been in the past, a 
complete physical break-down made its suspen- 
sion imperative. Thus came to an end " The 
Lakeside Monthly," from that day to this the 
most creditable and distinguished magazine ever 
published west of the Atlantic seaboard. 

The six years immediately following, from 
1874 to 1880, were largely spent in a search 
for health. During part of this time, however, 
Mr. Browne acted as literary editor of "The 
Alliance" (then a prominent and influential 
weekly journal), and as special editorial writer 
for some of the leading Chicago newspapers. 
But his mind was preoccupied with plans for a 
new periodical this time a journal of literary 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



439 



criticism, modelled somewhat after such English 
publications as " The Athenaeum " and " The 
Academy." In the furtherance of this bold 
conception he was able to interest the publishing 
firm of Jansen, McClurg & Co.; and under 
their imprint, in May, 1880, appeared the first 
issue of THE DIAL, "a monthly review and 
index of current literature." At about the 
same time he became literary adviser to the 
publishing department of the house, and for 
twelve years thereafter toiled unremittingly at 
his double task- work, conducting not only the 
editorial but also in large measure the business 
affairs of THE DIAL (to every number of which 
for several years his pen was the chief con- 
tributor), besides reading and revising book 
manuscripts, consulting with authors, and com- 
ing intimately in contact with those myriad 
details that go to make up the publishing 
business. But THE DIAL was then, as always, 
his chief concern ; and it was his constant wish 
to devote his entire time to its interests. He 
realized, too, with increasing force, the disad- 
vantages to an independent literary journal of 
association with a book publishing house. Thus 
it was that, in 1892, negotiations were completed 
whereby he acquired Messrs. McClurg & Co.'s 
interest in the periodical. It was enlarged in 
scope, and made a semi-monthly ; and from 
that time to the present has appeared uninter- 
ruptedly under his guidance and his control. 

Besides his writings in THE DIAL and other 
organs of publicity, Mr. Browne is the author 
of a small volume of poems, "Volunteer Grain" 
(1895), and of "The Everyday Life of Abraham 
Lincoln " (1886). He also compiled and edited 
several anthologies, "Bugle Echoes," a col- 
lection of Civil War poems (1886) ; "Golden 
Poems by British and American Authors" 
(1881); "The Golden Treasury of Poetry and 
Prose " (1883) ; and seven volumes of "Laurel- 
Crowned Verse " (1891-2). The preparation of 
the "Lincoln" and the compilation of "Bugle 
Echoes " involved the carrying on of a personal 
correspondence that would appall the stoutest 
heart even in these days of the typewriter and 
other mechanical aids ; but it was all done with 
his single pen, without the aid even of an 
amanuensis. His anthologies and compilations, 
though undertaken almost of necessity to eke 
out the scantiest of incomes, were carried 
through with a minute care and painstaking 
fidelity such as seldom go into work of this 
sort. His revamping of the publications of his 
firm amounted in many instances to practical 
authorship; and a noteworthy instance of this 



was the tremendous task, carried on in the 
midst of his daily literary and business labors, 
of rewriting from a crude word-for-word English 
rendering the six volumes of Topelius's "The 
Surgeon's Stories." He rewrote, in similar fash- 
ion, a translation of Holger Drachmann's " Poul 
og Virginie under Nordlig Bredde," published 
as "Paul and Virginia of a Northern Zone." 
He had just completed a thorough revision of 
his "Everyday Life of Lincoln" at the time of 
his death which occurred in Santa Barbara, 
California, on May 11. 

He was one of the small group of men who, in 
1874, founded the Chicago Literary Club; and 
for a number of years past he has been an honor- 
ary member of that organization, as well as of the 
Caxton Club (Chicago) and the Twilight Club 
(Pasadena, Calif.). During the summer of 1893 
he served as Chairman of the Committee on the 
Congress of Authors of the World's Congress 
Auxiliary of the Columbian Exposition. 

Such are the principal facts in the life of 
Francis F. Browne. They reveal even to the 
most casual interpreter a career of strenuous 
and unwavering endeavor in the interests of 
culture. But their full significance can only be 
grasped by those who realize the conditions and 
environment in which that life-work has been 
carried forward. Ill-health and poverty and 
sudden catastrophes were the least formidable 
of the forces against which he contended for 
little less than half a century. More powerfully 
deterrent than all these combined was the spirit 
of the time and the place of his labors the 
all-pervading materialism to which intellectual 
concerns were chiefly clap-trap and high 
purposes moonshine. In Boston or Philadelphia 
or New York, he could scarcely have failed to 
achieve the highest journalistic honors in a 
decade or so ; in Chicago his name is even now 
known only to comparatively few. But the 
harshness of the conditions only enhances the 
glory of the achievement. In Chicago he 
established and conducted for several years the 
one literary magazine comparable to the best 
that the East has produced ; in Chicago he 
established and conducted for a third of a 
century the foremost American journal of 
literary criticism the only journal of its class 
that has survived in any section of the country. 
We would not imply that he has accomplished 
these things single-handed ; his immediate help- 
ers have been able and devoted, and in later 
years he has not lacked practical support from 
some of those who have the cultural interests of 



440 



THE DIAL 



[June 1 



Chicago most at heart. But he has been always 
the captain and standard-bearer of his own 
forlorn hopes ; upon him has fallen the brunt of 
the battle, and with him must rest chief honors 
for whatever of victory has been attained. 

Of the man's personality, it would be futile to 
attempt any complete delineation here. Happily 
the task is made in large part superfluous by the 
portrait which is contained in this issue as a sup- 
plement. One need not be a student of human 
nature to read in this face the essential character- 
istics of the man, the kindliness and sincerity 
and fearlessness, the mingled strains of gentle- 
ness and strength, of idealism and practicality, 
of frankness and reserve, of tolerance and pride. 
Dowered with that best of all inheritances, the 
New England conscience and ideals, he held 
faithful to these through fifty years of struggle 
and discouragement, of ill-health and poverty. 
The "gradual furnace of the world" tempered 
and refined but never crumbled his spirit. It 
is amazing how even those with whom he came 
most casually in contact felt and retained the 
impress of his powerful personality. Those 
who knew him intimately invariably loved him. 
Poor as he always was in material things, he 
was rich beyond most in all that ministers to 
the spirit in friendships, the love of nature, 
the appreciation of literature, kinship with little 
children and with the humble of earth. His 
feeling for poetry was of a sort that now seems 
almost extinct in the world. Few have ever 
possessed such stores of it in memory ; few could 
recite it so well. With all the best of English 
and American verse he was thoroughly famil- 
iar; but his favorites Wordsworth, Matthew 
Arnold, Burns, Byron, and Tennyson he knew 
literally "by heart." For Arnold the one 
poet, as he used to say, who never told untruths 
he had probably the strongest affection. In- 
deed, his character and habits of thought were 
in many ways closely akin to Arnold's. He 
had the same love of the normal, the sane, the 
democratic; the same abhorrence for the fan- 
tastic, the far-fetched, the esoteric. " The won- 
der and bloom of the world" moved him as 
powerfully as they did Arnold; crudity and 
rawness and ugliness, whether spiritual or mate- 
rial, revolted him no less strongly. His was the 
same "sad lucidity of soul," and no less deter- 
minedly than Arnold he 

" Wrought to erase from its depth 
Mist, and illusion, and fear." 

But along with this underlying seriousness went 
a vein of the purest humor. There were not 
many things that he loved better than a hearty 



laugh with a friend ; there were not many situa- 
tions so tense that he could not relieve them by 
an apt anecdote or a witty analogy. Herein he 
resembled Lincoln as strongly mentally as he 
did in physical appearance. 

Simplicity, sincerity, courage, persistency, 
these were the predominant notes in his char- 
acter. Almost equally marked, however, was 
a certain faculty of analytical insight which 
enabled him to realize at a glance, as it were, 
the true bearings and relationships of things, 
to arrive almost intuitively at the essential truth 
of a situation or a problem. This, in the 
ordinary concerns of life, seemed only a sort of 
inspired commonsense. But in the larger field 
of public affairs it amounted to an instinctive 
passion for justice which placed him constantly 
with the minority, but seldom led him astray. 
When four innocent men were legally sacrificed 
in Chicago to a public stampede of fear and 
revenge, he did all that one man could do to 
prevent the wrong. When the American press 
was hounding Governor Altgeld to death, he pre- 
pared for one of the English reviews a detailed 
vindication of the man and his official acts, 
which, flouted as it was at the time of its ap- 
pearance, now squares in nearly every statement 
with the generally accepted estimates. The 
sophistries by which our newspapers sought to 
justify the needless war with Spain did not blind 
him for a moment ; our misguided policy in the 
Philippines moved him to ceaseless protests 
from the first. These are but a few of many 
instances. Scarcely one of his judgments on 
the political events of his time has not since 
been verified ; scarcely one of his prophecies 
has failed of fulfilment. He was not one of 
those who could be silent when injustice was at 
work ; nor did he ever wait for his own thought 
to be echoed back to him by the crowd before 
speaking his mind. 

If the professional career of this man is to be 
fairly understood and appreciated, something 
must be said here of his chosen work with direct 
reference to its processes rather than its results. 
These processes are in the main occult to the 
general public. There are many popular con- 
ceptions of an editor's duties, ranging from 
that of a numerous class who take him to be 
the person who addresses the wrappers in which 
they receive their paper, to that of a still more 
numerous class who picture him as one immersed 
in the tranquil absorption of literature varied 
by occasional intervals of composition. The 
reality is as far removed from the one as from 
the other of these innocent conceits. The edi-

torial life is in actuality an endless round of 
correspondence and consultation, of proof-sheets 
and manuscript, of revision and recasting and 
recreating, of eternal vigilance for the present 
and ceaseless thought for the future, of tact and 
foresight and intuition in many vary ing relations. 
But it is a life by no means devoid of satisfac- 
tions and compensations. There is the joy of 
discovering latent talent, of encouraging and 
directing the efforts of young writers; there 
are the enduring friendships that grow up out 
of the associations formed. Of the wearing, 
thankless drudgery of this life no one ever had 
more full or bitter experience than the editor 
of "The Lakeside" and THE DIAL; but of its 
compensations, such as those we have named, 
he had also as full a share as any. 

A lover of the countryside, loathing turmoil 
and discord, caring beyond all else for peace and 
the cultured amenities of life, his lot was cast 
in the noisiest and least spiritual of all great 
cities. With the temperament of a poet and re- 
cluse, he was called upon to grapple incessantly 
with the sternest practicalities. Ill-health 
dogged him remorselessly, from the time he 
left the army to the day of his death. Poverty 
walked always at his elbow. Yet none of these 
circumstances ever gained the upper hand of 
his will, or ever turned him from his purposes. 
Through a long and troubled life, he never 
struck sail to a fear, either from without or 
from within. 

We have come to the end. Much that should 
be said has been omitted, and all that is said 
should have been set down more forcefully and 
eloquently. But with the sense of irreparable 
loss still fresh upon us, it is difficult to write as 
we would. Perhaps the portrait, and the tributes 
of his friends which follow, will fill the gaps 
and repair the weaknesses of this sketch. The 
simple essence of it all, for us, is that we have 
lost our leader, and know not how to go on 
with the fight. But it is impossible to feel that 
his spirit has been wholly withdrawn, that 
his far-seeing judgment and dauntless will are 
no longer to direct our efforts. The inspiration 
of that life will surely continue to support us in 
carrying forward the work which he began, 
though he himself be no longer a visible presence. 

" O strong soul, by what shore 
Tarriest thou now? For that force, 
Surely, has not been left vain! 
Somewhere, surely, afar, 
In the sounding labour-house vast 
Of being, is practised that strength, 
Zealous, beneficent, firm ! " 



FROM THOSE WHO KNEW HIM. 



We are glad to share with our readers a 
few of the many tributes to the memory of 
FRANCIS FISHER BROWNE that have reached 
us during the past two weeks. The short 
unsigned paragraphs are in nearly every case 
extracts from letters received from contributors 
to THE DIAL. 

Great causes moved him early, as the child 
And sire of poets moves. Seeking not fame, 
But liberty for others, bright the flame 

He lit, a lad, at War's fierce torch and wild. 

This fadeless faith was his, kept undefiled 
Unto the end, its loveliness his aim 
Through all discouragement. Whatever came, 

His soul was his to spend, though fools reviled. 

And nobly was it spent! The stripling boy 
A soldier battling for the eternal right, 
Detesting war, yet glad in such a fight: 

The fearless man, in all good finding joy : 
He leaves an undimmed memory of light, 

Friendship, and justice, Time shall not destroy. 

WALLACE RICE. 

"His memory is a precious possession to us all. 
Such men belong to the 'saving remnant ' of which 
Arnold wrote so eloquently ; they help save us from 
the vulgar and the unworthy. Francis Browne 
never went with the great crowd either in politics 
or literature or religion. His keen sense of the real 
values in life kept him apart from the loud and 
scrambling multitude, and made him an inspiration 
to all persons of fine and heroic ideals. THE DIAL, 
which he founded and conducted so long, has been 
a distinct force in our higher civilization. He had 
one gift which I have never known equalled, and 
which probably was not possessed in the same 
manner by any other person of his time, I mean 
his prodigious capacity to absorb and repeat the best 
lyric poetry. His mind was a veritable anthology of 
all the best short poems in English and American 
literature. He did not have to memorize a poem 
as most of us do in order to retain it: he got it by 
a kind of spontaneous absorption, and it apparently 
required no effort of memory for him to recall it, 
it had become a part of the vital current of his life. 
I verily believe that without any apparent effort he 
could recite the greater part of the poetry contained 
in his selection called 'Golden Poems.' 

" And this wonderful capacity to retain the poetry 
of other people did not stand in the way of his pro- 
ducing many fine poems of his own. His father before 
him was a poet, and the sacred fire gained rather 
than lost in the keeping of the son. But I cannot do 
justice to his many rare gifts in this hasty letter. I 
have lost a dear friend, and every person who 
cherishes a high and worthy ideal has lost a friend 
also." JOHN BURROUGHS.

"None of his friends was more truly and proudly 
his friend than I, or could have valued him more 
for those spiritual, intellectual, and moral qualities 
which in their peculiar concord rendered him unique 
in his time and place." W. D. HOWELLS. 

"As one who enjoyed his intimate friendship 
for thirty years, and was during that period in 
almost daily association with him, it seemed to 
me that the most striking characteristic of Mr. 
Browne was his independence of judgment. This 
was displayed in matters of personal and public, no 
less than in those of literary, concern. I remember 
that once in the early days of our friendship we were 
speaking of a man conspicuous in public and social 
affairs the sort of man who sees that his name is 
kept well in the public eye, and who is regarded as 
a pillar of society when Mr. Browne, a twinkle 
in his eye, asked me : ' Do you know that old seed ? ' 
It sounded irreverent, and I was almost shocked 
for the moment, but I soon realized that it was 
precisely the estimate that had long been lurking 
in my own consciousness, and that I had never had 
the courage to express. From that time on, I 
acquired the habit of judging men, not by their 
repute, but by what was disclosed to my own 
discernment. It was his life-long habit thus to 
appraise character with his own eyes, and to reduce 
the artificially magnified personality to the scale of 
normal humanity. The popular author, the rhetorical 
clergyman, and the noisy politician, all underwent 
this searching scrutiny, and were considerably 
deflated in consequence. Concerning one of the 
latter class, who has since become much noisier than 
was even then to be anticipated, he said just twenty 
years ago, when asked for an opinion : ' I have long 
considered him a pest.' It was said with such 
deliberate finality that there could be nothing to add, 
but it left his hearers rather aghast, because it ran 
so utterly counter to the popular estimate. In his 
views upon public affairs in which a moral issue 
was involved, he was intransigeant, knowing that 
'one with God is a majority,' and holding, with 
Ibsen, that majorities of the numerical kind are 
nearly always wrong when they pronounce upon the 
heated themes of current politics. Among the sub- 
jects which roused him to the hottest indignation 
were the outrage of the protective tariff, the shameful 
refusal of the Federal government to grant copyright 
to English authors, the selection of Blaine to be the 
standard-bearer of 'the party of moral ideas,' the 
truculent Venezuelan message of President Cleve- 
land, the wicked war with Spain, the subversion of 
our most cherished national principles in the sub- 
jugation of the Filipinos, and the brutal disregard 
of our national honor shown by the exemption clause 
of the Panama Canal act. Thus he was ranged 
among the free traders, was active in the work of 
the Copyright League, became a despised mugwump 
in 1884, and an anti-imperialistic ' traitor ' in 1898. 
When the national protest against our Philippine 
policy was crystallized in the Central Music Hall 



mass meeting in Chicago, Mr. Browne was one of 
the leading spirits in the demonstration, and he was 
one of the most forceful members of the Indianapolis 
Convention held in 1900 to urge the cause of 
Filipino independence. I was working side by side 
with him in all these matters, and know how firmly 
they held possession of his mind and conscience, 
and how unswervingly he kept his moral rudder 
true through all these stormy years." 

" I have never known another man who so inspired 
me to great thoughts and true living in combination. 
It seemed of him as of Chaucer's good parson 
'first he wrought and afterward he taught.' My 
visits to the office of THE DIAL through many years, 
and the many letters not long but to the point 
that he wrote me, concerning books or on abstract 
topics, have led me to know 'a Brahmin of the 
Brahmins' a man made in the mould of Abraham 
Lincoln, whom for so long he so much resembled, 
yet having some of the finer and more delicate lines 
of personality more fully carved. I feel that a great 
light has gone from my own personal pathway, but 
even more that Chicago and the Mississippi Valley, 
and in truth the whole nation, have lost one of the 
truest and noblest preachers of truth and righteous- 
ness." 

"He was the noblest man I have ever known, the 
bravest and most humanely human. . . . Ever back 
of his relentless eye for injustice and charlatanry, 
there was a Jovian knowledge of the impermanence 
of all evil, and the assured, though sorrowfully de- 
layed, triumph of the only eternal things. Love and 
Truth and Beauty. . . . He was, though his modesty 
and lack of assumption kept it from most, Chicago's 
leading citizen the man who, when the real history 
of the time is written, will be known for what he 
was, a Pharos in a sea of gloom through a long 
formative generation." 

" He seemed to me the ideal of a type of American 
scholar that we most need. His genial and yet re- 
served urbanity, his quiet forcefulness, above all, 
the pure, strong character that seemed to shine 
through him and illuminate his work, have had 
their influence upon the group of men whom he 
gathered about him, and upon American letters in 
the larger sense. Locally, he has done more, I 
believe, than any other man in Chicago to take 
away the reproach of our city's rampant commer- 
cialism, and to bring about an appreciation of the 
better things of life. THE DIAL has been a veri- 
table beacon light." 

"It is hard to realize how much we shall find 
lacking in life now that he is gone. ... It was he 
that advised the collection of my scattered sheets 
and to publish my first book, and it was he that gave 
me courage to go on when I was doubtful about doing 
so. ... There must be a great many who feel as 
I do that the world is richer and fuller for having 
known him and for having had the wonderful ad- 
vantage of his wise and calm judgment." 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



443 



"Among all the men I have ever known I can 
recall no one more open-minded or having clearer 
vision, no one more inflexible in adherence to all that 
is good, more truly appreciative of everything fine 
and uplifting. But beyond all these qualities was the 
charm of his personality. He was a man one could 
not know well without loving. There is no one whose 
friendship I valued more highly, and for me the world 
will be a less desirable place without him." 

" Such a passing means much even to those who 
never saw his face or heard his voice, but who had 
come to rest upon his sound scholarship and critical 
judgment, and who loved the strong and beautiful 
use he made of the English language, whose purity 
he so zealously guarded." 

"It was never my privilege to meet him, but his 
kindly and helpful letters, his encouragement at a 
time when encouragement was precious to me : these 
I shall never forget." 

" I never met him but once, and then only for 
a half hour ; but from my twenty years' association 
with him in THE DIAL, I had come to have a feel- 
ing of personal affection as well as high respect for 
him. Strength and gentleness must have been 
blended in him as they are in few men. And I 
believe that few men in America in recent times 
have done a more important work a work, indeed, 
considering the circumstances, almost incredible. 
How many in this country have tried to establish 
a journal of pure criticism and he alone suc- 
ceeded ! " 

"My acquaintance with him was virtually re- 
stricted to a fifteen-minute chat in his office two 
years ago ; but even in those brief minutes I was 
greatly impressed with his large sympathy and a 
mellow wisdom that did not seem quite of the 
twentieth century." 

"He was a man of a sort the world has too few 
of. What he did for sound literature in founding 
THE DIAL is incalculable in this Philistine Age. It 
is his monument." 

" Though the fates seem to have decreed that we 
should not see each other face to face, I have a deep 
sense of the loss of a personal friend. I have a 
number of letters from him, each having its per- 
sonal touch, as though written to someone to whom 
he was related by something far more than a mere 
professional tie. And THE DIAL, as it has come to 
me, has always made me feel that it bore a personal 
message." 

" To anyone who had the privilege of knowing 
him, even as slightly as I did, his death means a 
very real loss. He will always be remembered not 
only as the father of THE DIAL, but as a man of 
rare scholarship and charm." 

" I feel glad and honored to have known him, 
even if only by correspondence. From the first 
(which is now seventeen years ago or more) I was 
impressed with his high ideals in his chosen vocation, 
his delightful and always kindly humor, his unfailing 



patience and courtesy with the shortcomings of young 
contributors, and his mastery of terse and aptly ex- 
pressive English. More than once I have noted with 
admiration the deft editorial correction in my own 
manuscript. . . . His loss will be felt as a personal 
bereavement by more than can be counted." 

"I esteem it a great privilege to have been 
permitted to cooperate with him even in a slight 
manner. The brief notes which he has sent me 
from time to time I shall cherish. He served a 
noble and beautiful ideal. Such a life is a sugges- 
tion to take courage." 

" I am impressed by the value to a hurried age of 
his steadfast and true adherence to a purpose. In 
an environment in which slowness is a ban, and 
time reduced to a monetary standard, a Dial point- 
ing to the permanent values in which true progress 
is recorded and reflected is the most serviceable of 
public regulations." 

"He has, through THE DIAL, done more than 
anyone else to keep me alive and out of a rut." 

"Ever since I have known him, he has seemed 
to me to be Sidney's pattern of a gentleman one 
of 'high-erected thoughts seated in the heart of 
courtesy.' His loyalty to reason and conscience, 
unabated valiancy, and gentle humor have made his 
friends and the world richer during many years." 

" While my acquaintance with him was compara- 
tively slight, he inspired me as he did everyone with 
the greatest respect for his wide sympathies, his high 
tone, and unfailing poise. It was a great achieve- 
ment to establish the purest literary journal in this 
country, and to do it in the camp of the Philistines." 

"I have long thought of him as standing with 
Mr. Alden, the last representatives of a long line 
of scholars and gentlemen of that elder, perhaps 
finer, day." 

"More truly than Oliver Wendell Holmes, he was 
the 'last leaf of that magnificent cluster." 

" He did so much necessary and important work 
that no one else seemed able to do, that we can hardly 
hope to find another like him. All men are unique 
in some measure ; but he, standing out in the history 
of the intellectual life of our time, will I think 
appear especially and peculiarly so." 

"This is rather a moment in which to rejoice 
that for so long we had that fine spirit with us and 
that he was spared to fulfil his unique function in 
the upbuilding of our culture. A history of Amer- 
ican literature that does not accord him recognition 
will be incomplete." 

" An honored friend, a great force for good life 
and literature, a true and noble man, has entered 
into the higher life. He won a high place in Amer- 
ican life by his exquisite taste, his sound judgment, 
his gracious spirit, and his untiring devotion to the 
best that is written."

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE INTELLECTUAL APPEAL IN LITERATURE 

meets, of course, with far less ready response, the 
world over, than the sensational, or the sentimental, 
or the erotic, or many another of a considerable 
remove from the appeal of the highest order; hut 
it is far from being a negligible factor among the 
qualities that yearly cause so many thousands of 
books to find purchasers and readers. Mr. R. A. 
Scott-James, in a scholarly dissertation on "Popu- 
larity in Literature," published in the May "North 
American Review," divides the reading public into 
five classes, but without claiming that these classes 
are exhaustive or mutually exclusive. They con- 
sist, "firstly, of those, whose love of sensation is 
satisfied by violent incident; and secondly, of those 
who are especially susceptible to the sentimental 
appeal. To a third class belong those who take 
pleasure in the agitations of sex feeling ; and to a 
fourth, those whose sense of humor is tickled by 
the sallies of the literary clown. The fifth class 
a very large one consists of those who are of a 
habit of mind to be excited by sensations which can 
be associated with religion and morality." Then he 
adds : " It is useless to name as a sixth class those 
who are moved by intellectual ideas, for so small a 
class is not the objective of the popular author." 
This is too pessimistic a view of the reading public's 
literary tastes. Unquestionably Eugene Sue and 
Mrs. Southworth and Josh Billings have had more 
readers than Friedrich Hegel and John Addington 
Symonds and Walter Pater ; but if Mr. Scott- 
James's sixth class is as inconsiderable as he avers, 
how account for the large circulation attained by 
such authors as, for instance, Oliver Wendell Holmes 
and, in his historical writings, John Fiske, not to 
mention Ruskin in a somewhat earlier time, and 
Macaulay in one. still more remote? This cultured 
sixth class is far enough from being of vast dimen- 
sions, but signs are not wanting that its size is 
respectable and is increasing. 


A BOOK-TESTING LABORATORY, properly organized 
and equipped and operated, would be of as great use 
in its way as is the laboratory for testing the strength 
or purity of materials used in the industries and arts. 
Such an institution, to be known as a Bureau of Re- 
view, will some day be established in the interests of 
book-buyers, and especially of those buyers for the 
people, the public libraries, if Mr. George Iles's recent 
address before the New York State Library School 
evokes the response it deserves. The details of his 
plan are to be found in full in the pamphlet report of 
his discourse now obtainable from Albany, and only 
one or two important points can here be touched upon. 
Means are considered by which prompt and authori- 
tative verdicts on current publications could be ob- 
tained by the proposed bureau for the guidance of 
librarians and others interested. " In promoting the 
buying as well as the borrowing of books," Mr. lies 



remarks, " public libraries are cultivating a field 
which will steadily broaden year by year." Ad- 
mission is frankly made of the significant fact that 
even expert critics not infrequently differ diamet- 
rically in their estimates of a book's value ; and the 
question is considered whether the most trustworthy 
guide to the would-be purchaser might not take the 
form of a colorless statement of the book's plan and 
method and contents, with neither laudatory nor 
condemnatory addition. The value of this projected 
Bureau of Review in discouraging the publication of 
worthless books and in encouraging that of useful 
books is of course apparent. Already, as Mr. lies 
observes, the cornerstone to such an edifice as he 
proposes has been laid in the American Library 
Association's annual annotated booklist of about 
fifteen hundred titles. How soon the structure will 
be completed remains to be seen. 

READINGS FROM THE BOOK OF NATURE are not 
every day so attractively presented as in Mr. 
Truman A. De Weese's book for the summer, 
"The Bend in the Road," recently noticed in more 
formal manner by us. Mr. De Weese, we are told, 
learned the printer's trade in earlier life and then 
interested himself in journalism, and it may have 
been confinement to the close quarters and exacting 
duties of the printing office and the editorial chair 
that has made him in later years so ardent a lover 
of the spacious joys of out-door life in the country. 
In the following passage there speaks the delight of 
the city man escaping from the city's din and the 
city's newspapers. "He learns to love the silences 
of Nature. After listening to the hum of bees and 
the sweet music of the waving corn he begins to 
realize the emptiness and dullness of much of the 
human chatter that fills city homes and city clubs 
with noise. In the country he has time to read and 
think and plan. He has the time and the mood for 
introspection. He gets a chance to sound the depths 
of his own being. He doesn't read a newspaper 
while he tosses a breakfast of coffee and rolls into 
his tired stomach. He has a quickening sense of 
the uselessness of the piffle with which newspapers 
are filled, and he acquires a genuine pity for the poor 
devils who have nothing else to read. After reading 
in the book of Nature all week he can go out under 
the quiet, restful shade of an apple tree on Sunday 
and read a printed book that is really worth while." 
The author's chapters entitled "A Sermon in Apple 
Trees," "Why I Love an Apple Tree," and "Pastoral 
Pictures" are especially good. 



THE EXPECTED COMPLETION OF THE OXFORD 

DICTIONARY, and with it the rest from his labors of 
the veteran lexicographer who has already devoted 
more than thirty years to his task, is now set with 
some confidence by Sir James Murray himself at 
four years hence. "I have got to the stage," he is 
reported as saying, "when I can estimate the end. 
In all probability the dictionary will be finished on 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



445 



my eightieth birthday, four years from now. My 
colleagues, Dr. Bradley and Dr. Craigie, are busy 
with 'S,' and I have penetrated into the second half 
of 'T,' which I expect to complete in two years. 
By that time the three of us will be at liberty for 
the last six letters of the alphabet." Expected at 
first to fill eight large volumes, the work has, espe- 
cially in its latter portions, developed an unforeseen 
bulkiness which even ten volumes can scarcely be 
found capable of compassing. The error of calcu- 
lation is attributed largely to the fact that existing 
dictionaries, used as a basis for the estimate, reveal 
a tendency to hurry and scamp their work toward 
the end, probably from a natural weariness in the 
workers and an equally natural impatience in the 
publishers. But in the Oxford undertaking no such 
childish haste will be tolerated. The lexicographer- 
in-chief pays deserved tribute to his American collab- 
orators, and among them he mentions especially the 
librarians of the Library of Congress at Washington 
and of the Boston Athenaeum, who have been zealous 
and diligent in looking up and copying desired pas- 
sages in American books not accessible in England. 


THE PROBLEM OF THE UNSOLD BOOK, the book 
that cumbers the shelves of the retail dealer until 
at last it goes to the "remainder" counter or the 
"second-hand" stall, where it begs for purchase at 
an inglorious reduction of price, and is perhaps finally 
disposed of at a tenth part of its original reputed 
value, is one that Mr. William H. Arnold, speaking 
at the recent conference of the American Booksellers' 
Association in New York, suggests might be solved 
by allowing the retailer to return to the publisher or 
jobber any copies of a work left on his hands after 
one year from the time of purchase, a credit check 
for ninety per cent of the purchase price to be given 
him in exchange. No goods are more uncertain as 
to selling qualities than books, and the most unex- 
pected surpluses and shortages are a part of the daily 
experience of a bookseller in the handling of his 
stock. It is argued that this proposed plan would 
tend to discourage the now too-abundant issue of 
works of questionable excellence, and losses from 
over-production would be diminished. To make up 
for any loss to the publisher occasioned by this re- 
demption of unsold copies, Mr. Arnold suggests an 
increased wholesale price, with a consequent slight 
increase in the retail price ; and he feels assured that 
the innovation, by removing the dread of unsold 
stock, would infuse fresh life into the bookselling 
business. No formal action on the proposal was 
taken, but it seems not unlikely that this seedcorn 
of suggestion may yield fruit in the near future. 

LITERATURE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LIFE is of 
little worth, as Miss Corinne Bacon, efficient head 
of the Drexel Institute Library School, Philadel- 
phia, wittily and convincingly pointed out in her 
recent address delivered before the Pennsylvania 
Library Club and now published in "The Library 
Journal." After citing the late lively tilt between 



Mr. Dana and THE DIAL over the "great-books 
superstition," she declares her willingness to go even 
further than the Newark librarian on the highway 
of heresy and ask why it is necessarily a good 
thing for one to read at all. " Is there anything 
sacrosanct about print? Why is it a virtue to read? 
It takes more intelligence to make a dress, to cook 
and serve a dinner which is both nourishing and 
appetizing, or to make a piece of arts and crafts fur- 
niture, than it does to read many a book. Would not 
some of us be more genuine, more original, if we 
dealt more with first-hand things than with second- 
hand thoughts ? At the best, books are but a substi- 
tute for life." Unquestionably ; and Miss Bacon 
does well to warn us, both in apt phrase of her own 
and in pertinent quotation from Mr. Harold Gorst, 
of the danger of thinking with other people's brains. 
But though literature without life would be chosen 
by no sensible person in preference to life without 
literature, the necessity of choice between these 
awful alternatives is forced upon very few of us, and 
we shall therefore continue to enjoy both life and 
literature in company with Miss Bacon and others 
of the elect for whom existence is so immeasurably 
enriched by the best things that have been thought 
and said by men and women in the past. 



RECENT PRISON POETRY is enriched with a con- 
tribution from the son of the author of "The Scarlet 
Letter," who is at present an involuntary guest of 
the government at Atlanta. As editor, pro tern., of 
the prison paper, he has accepted from himself and 
published the following touching lines : 

" In the cell over mine at night 
A step goes to and fro ; 
From barred door to iron wall, 
From wall to door I hear it go, 
Four paces heavy and slow, 
In the heart of the sleeping jail ; 
And the goad that drives I know. 

" I never saw his face nor heard him speak ; 
He may be Dutchman, Dago, Yankee, Greek; 
But tl:e language of that prison'd step 
Too well I know ; 

Unknown brother of remorseless bars, 
Pent IE your cage from earth and sky and stars, 
The hunger for lost life that goads you so 
I also know." 

Is this an intentional or an accidental echo of Mr. 
Arturo Giovannitti's prison verses entitled "The 
Walker," penned in the seclusion of the jail at 
Lawrence, Mass., and already quoted in part by us ? 
Two significant lines of the Italo-American poet's 
"jerked English" (to borrow Mr. Wallace Rice's 
expressive term) run thus: 

" I hear footsteps over my head all night. 
They come one eternity in four paces and they go one 
eternity in four paces, and between the coming and the 
going there is Silence and Night and the Infinite." 

Like causes have been known to produce like effects, 
and the Atlanta poem may be wholly original ; but 
if not, it is none the less rather, all the more 
interesting.

THE SPACIOUS DOMAIN OF LIBRARY SCIENCE has 
seldom had the fact of its amplitude more strikingly 
illustrated than in the programme of the late joint 
meeting of the Massachusetts Library Clab, the 
Berkshire Library Club, and the Western Massa- 
chusetts Library Club. Assembling at Williamstown 
under the auspices of the college which there has its 
seat, the librarians of the Bay State were for three 
days (May 22-24) stimulated and refreshed by such 
speakers as President Harry A. Garfield, who made 
the address of welcome; Mr. John A. Lowe, the 
college librarian, who appropriately considered the 
relation of public libraries to college libraries ; Pro- 
fessor Carroll Lewis Maxcy, who spoke on Artemus 
Ward ; Mr. John Foster Carr (author of the useful 
"Guide to the United States for Immigrants"), 
who treated the subject, "What the Library Can Do 
for Our Foreign-born"; Miss J. Maud Campbell, 
who told " What the Foreigner has Done for One 
Library"; Mr. William B. Clarke, the Boston pub- 
lisher, whose topic was "The Business of Book- 
selling"; Mr. Harlan H. Ballard, who discussed 
" Cooperation in Library Work "; Miss Mafred N. 
Rice, who gave an illustrated talk on story-telling; 
and Miss Zaidee Brown, agent of the State Library 
Commission, whose remarks concerned themselves 
with " Librarians, Trustees, and the Field Agent," 
and who also conducted a round-table session for 
questions and answers. Miss Ruby Tillinghast's 
book-mending demonstration should not pass un- 
mentioned, nor Mr. Charles R. Green's roll-call of 
libraries, evoking two-minute responses on " The 
Most Interesting Thing Done in our Library the 
Past Year." Mountain excursions, to the top of 
Greylock and over Hoosac Mountain, were among 
the less strictly intellectual exercises planned for the 
occasion.

THE LITERARY REMAINS OF HENRY REED, pro- 

fessor of rhetoric and English literature at the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania from 1834 to 1854, have 
just been given to the library of that institution, and 
are considered a valuable gift by reason of Professor 
Reed's eminence in his department of learning and 
the interesting nature of the manuscripts that he 
left behind him, which include many unpublished 
lectures and other autograph matter of importance. 
Reed's activity in introducing Wordsworth to Amer- 
ican readers in an American edition for which he 
wrote a preface gives significance to the poet's letter 
included among the papers now made accessible to 
the scholarly public. Other interesting letters and 
an unpublished lecture on Walter Scott are named 
as of peculiar value. English literature students are 
familiar with Reed's published "Lectures on English 
Literature from Chaucer to Tennyson," his "Lectures 
on English History and Tragic Poetry as Illustrated 
by Shakespeare," and his "Lectures on the British 
Poets." As editor he was responsible for many use- 
ful works, including especially the American reprint 
of Lord Mahon's "History of England," Thomas 
Arnold's "Lectures on Modern History," and Gra- 



ham's "English Synonyms." But his literary in- 
dustry, both as author and editor, was too great to 
receive due tribute here. Some still living will re- 
call the tragic circumstances of his untimely death 
how he sailed for England on the ill-fated "Arctic," 
which was lost at sea September 27, 1854. 



MlSAPPRECIATION OF HUMOROUS LITERATURE 

has been carried to great lengths on the part of 
long-faced and literal-minded critics, as illustrated 
by some of the solemnly adverse judgments pro- 
nounced on Mark Twain's " Innocents Abroad " at 
the first appearance of that jocund work. But prob- 
ably few have attained to that degree of immunity 
from the attacks of humor that was reached by the 
scholarly and dignified Charles Sumner. When 
Longfellow, as Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge tells us in 
the June instalment of his early reminiscences now 
appearing in " Scribner's Magazine," presented 
Sumner with a copy of "The Biglow Papers," 
fresh from the press, that eminent statesman seems 
to have applied himself to Lowell's rollicking verse 
in much the same state of mind as one would bring 
to bear on Milton's " Paradise Lost " or Klopstock's 
" Messiah." As Mr. Lodge tells the story, " it was 
a rainy afternoon and Mr. Longfellow was obliged 
to go out, leaving Sumner stretched on the sofa read- 
ing Lowell's volume. When he returned he asked 
Sumner how he liked the poems, and Sumner re- 
plied : ' They are admirable, very good indeed, but 
why does he spell his words so badly ? ' Longfellow 
said that he attempted to explain that the poems 
were purposely written in the New England dialect, 
but Sumner could not understand." And yet Sum- 
ner was as much a New Englander as Lowell or 
Longfellow. 

BOOKS, BOILERS, AND BUNKERS, as we read in the 
current annual report of the Boston Public Library, 
are getting mixed together in a distressing promis- 
cuity in the stately building that for eighteen years 
has been the pride of Copley Square. Erected a 
comparatively short time ago at a cost of more than 
two million dollars, and expected to meet the demands 
made upon its space for at least one generation, the 
structure is already so pressed for stack-room that 
even the cellar, where no sane librarian would by 
choice store any of the books committed to his keep- 
ing, has been used to catch a part of the overflow 
from the stacks, and branches have been forced to 
give storage to some of the less actively circulating 
volumes. All this makes for confusion and vexation 
and several other sorts of harm. Will our library 
building committees ever learn the supreme necessity 
of providing ample space for book-stacks? The 
homely New England rule about sweetening rhubarb 
pies (put in sugar till you're scared, and then add 
as much more) would apply, mutatis mutandis, in 
designing the stack-room of a public library. " Build 
ye more stately mansions," is the lesson taught not 
only by the chambered nautilus, but by the congested 
public library.

A LITTLE INSTANCE OF TIME'S REVENGES has been 

recalled in connection with the recent marriage of 
a daughter of the late John Fiske. In the days of 
his own courtship, and while he was still an under- 
graduate at Harvard, Fiske became known too 
well known for the harmony of his own relations 
with the college faculty as an enthusiastic Darwin- 
ian; and at the very time when he was writing his 
early article on Buckle for magazine publication, 
with the young lady of his choice much in his mind 
to lighten his labor (as he afterward assured her 
when he sent her a copy of the lucubration), he had 
the misfortune to be caught reading in church instead 
of listening to the sermon, and was summoned before 
the faculty to face not only this charge, but also the 
accumulated evidences of his conversion to Darwin- 
ism. He was let off, however, with an admonition 
and a threat of summary expulsion if he did not in 
future refrain from airing his too-advanced views. 
The humor of the situation appears when it is borne 
in mind that those very views, which afterward con- 
tributed so large a part to his reputation as a writer, 
were the ones he was called back to Harvard to 
expound under its auspices less than ten years after 
he had almost suffered expulsion for holding them. 


A LITEKAKY WORKER LITTLE KNOWN TO FAME, 

but possessed of accomplishments and abilities far 
above the ordinary, died May 13 at Plainfield, N. J. 
William Henry Larrabee, author of " How the World 
Was Made," " Earthquakes and Volcanoes," " Edu- 
cation through the Agency of Religious Organiza- 
tion," and other books, was born at Alfred, Maine, 
in 1829, and was graduated in 1845 from De Pauw 
University, before it had ceased to be called Asbury 
University. Like so many other men of letters, he 
was a lawyer by profession but never practiced, 
choosing the more congenial field of literature and 
scholarship and editorship. School-teaching, farm- 
management, and newspaper work preceded his 
editorial connection with " The Popular Science 
Monthly," which he served as translator and assist- 
ant editor up to 1900. Many encyclopaedia articles 
came from his busy pen, and his useful activities 
included also a term of service as trustee of the 
Plainfield Public Library. He is said to have had 
a mastery of seventeen languages, and he was a 
great traveller. ... 

THE INCREASING VOGUE OF BROWNING seems to 
receive striking proof in the extraordinary price paid 
in London recently for an early and rare edition of 
the poet's youthful production, "Pauline," a poem 
filling but eight pages in the Cambridge Edition of 
Browning, and probably read about as seldom as 
any piece of his that could be named. A sum equiv- 
alent to twenty-four hundred dollars in our money 
is said to have changed hands when this early speci- 
men of Browning's art was offered for sale. At 
about the same time a packet of five hundred or more 
of the Browning love-letters, of which so much has 
of late been written and said, passed under the auc- 
tioneer's hammer in London, and elicited bids that 



started at six hundred pounds and then rose by suc- 
cessive steps of fifty to six thousand five hundred 
and fifty pounds, or nearly thirty-three thousand 
dollars. The outcry of outraged sentiment over the 
public sale of these letters, even though the letters 
themselves virtually became public property when 
they were published years ago, is not unnatural. 
Pounds sterling in exchange for the heartbeats of 
two poet-lovers! "To what base uses we may re- 
turn, Horatio!" . . . 

THE AUTHORS' LEAGUE OF AMERICA now takes 
its place beside the Authors' Society of England 
and La Soctite des Gens de Lettres of France. It 
has issued its first " Bulletin," held its first meeting, 
elected its first officers, and is now ready for busi- 
ness at 30 Broad Street, New York. It has a legal 
department, a department concerned with the gen- 
eral relations of author and publisher, one for the 
conduct of an official periodical, the exact nature of 
which is not yet decided upon, a department which 
acts as agent for the author's books in England, a 
bureau for the expert examination of manuscripts, 
a bureau of information, and one for foreign affairs 
and international copyright. The list of officers in- 
cludes Mr. Winston Churchill, President, Mr. Theo- 
dore Roosevelt, Vice-President, Mr. Ellis Parker 
Butler, Secretary and Treasurer, Mr. John Bur- 
roughs and others, as Honorary Vice-Presidents, 
and a Council of ten that begins with the name of 
Mr. Gelett Burgess and ends with that of Miss 
Carolyn Wells. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



HAUPTMANN'S "ATLANTIS' 
NOBEL PRIZE. 



AND THE 



(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The extraordinary distinction given Gerhart Haupt- 
mann's novel " Atlantis " by the conference upon the 
author of the Nobel prize for the greatest idealistic work 
of literature of the year 1912 warrants more searching 
examination than the shrinking or perfunctory comment 
it has in most cases received on this side of the Atlantic. 

" Atlantis " is the story of the foundering of a 
Hamburg-American liner in mid-ocean, as chief back- 
ground for three months out of the life of a German 
doctor, aged thirty-one, who leaves his wife in an insane 
asylum and his three young children in the guardianship 
of his parents, in order to pursue across the sea a danseuse 
of sixteen. They are rescued from the waves and reach 
New York, where he yields a few days to his passion 
and compels her to yield. Later he meets a woman 
art student, who gives him good advice and nurses him 
through a spell of typhoid. His insane wife having 
meanwhile opportunely died, he marries the art student 
in mid-ocean on the return voyage to Germany. 

Off-hand one is inclined to say that one would not 
care to make the closer acquaintance of such a person 
as this hero, even when introduced by the author of 
" Die Weber " and " Die versunkene Glocke," the fore- 
most contemporary German dramatist ^But since the 
Stockholm Academy has given Frederick von Kamma- 
cher such a good letter of introduction and we are

THE DIAL 



[June 1 



likely to meet him iu society, it is important to know 
more about him and to be able to take one's position 
regarding him and his friends. 

He was aware that he had reached a crisis in his life. 
" He was not one of those who enter upon this crisis 
unconsciously. ... It seemed to him that he had 
worked hitherto with other people's bands, according to 
other people's wills, guided rather than guiding. . . . 
' Now I will walk with my own feet, look with my own 
eyes, think my own thoughts, and act from the plenary 
power of my own will.' . . . Frederick had been dis- 
illusioned in his deep-seated altruism, which until now 
had completely dominated him." 

It would be better for our judgment of Frederick if 
his friend the author had not made these declarations 
regarding him. If we could believe that he were the 
helpless bee ensnared by the irresistible fascination of 
the gallows-spider, the dancer Ingigerd, we might have 
some pity for him, though we must needs regard him 
as very weak. But having been assured that he was 
determined to take every step of his own will and he 
is thirty-one there is no excuse for him. As to his 
deep-seated altruism, the only act cited in evidence is 
the remission to an old friend dying of consumption of 
a debt of $750, while the running away from his insane 
wife and his three children does not comport with a 
Philistine idea of altruism. 

Again, the author describes the traits of his hero: 
"Though Frederick had never been ill, there were times 
when he showed symptoms of a peculiar passionateness. 
His friends knew that when all went well he was a dor- 
mant volcano; that when things did not go well he was 
a volcano spitting fire and smoke. To all appearances 
equally removed from effeminacy and brutality, he was 
subject nevertheless to attacks of both. Now and then 
a dithyrambic rapture came over him, especially when 
there was wine in his blood; he would pace about, and 
if it were daytime, might address a pathetic, sonorous 
invocation to the sun, or at night, to the constellations, 
particularly to the chaste Cassiopeia." 

Frederick had first seen Ingigerd in Berlin in a sym- 
bolic dance called " Mara, or the Spider's Web." He 
had attended this performance nineteen times, enough, 
one would say, to indicate his lack of judgment and 
self-control, and enough to make him a monomaniac, if 
it does not prove him to have been one already. The 
dance is plainly intended to symbolize the relation of 
Frederick to Ingigerd, she being the spider and he the 
bee. In fact, however, the relation is more like that of 
hawk to hare, with Frederick in the former role. 

Although she is surrounded by a coterie of admirers, 
Ingigerd promptly suspects Frederick's purpose in com- 
ing aboard. Before the ship is three days out he has 
made himself a subject for ribald jest in the smoking- 
room. In Mara's presence he is alternately burning 
with lust and frothing with wrath at himself for being 
attached to so slight a thing. She, in turn, has felt 
" that his propinquity was by no means lacking in dan- 
ger for herself." Nevertheless, at their first personal 
conference she tells him of her past "in a series of con- 
fidences of such shocking content as to be worthy of a 
Lais or a Phryne," and Frederick " found himself con- 
fronting the knowledge of a childhood so outrageous as 
to be worse than anything he had met with in his experi- 
ences as a physician." This disturbed him so that he 
could not sleep, but did not prevent his exchanging fiery 
glances with a Russian Jewess the next morning, as he 
accompanied the ship's doctor on a tour of the steerage. 



That evening, the Jewess, having applied to the doctor 
for professional treatment, is turned over to Frederick, 
who honors his love for Ingigerd and dishonors his pro- 
fession by committing fornication with the helpless and 
ignorant girl. Whereupon, " Frederick went on deck, 
where the exalted impression of the starry heavens shin- 
ing over the infinite expanse of the ocean, purified him, 
as it were." " He was neither by Nature nor by habit 
a Don Juan and it astonished him that the unusual and 
surprising adventure seemed to him the most natural 
thing in the world." Probably this is one of the pas- 
sages which gave the Stockholm Academy the impres- 
sion of towering idealism. 

The descriptions of Frederick's fellow-passengers 
are in many cases clever, though they give a sombre 
impression of humanity, if this shipload were to pass 
for an average. Practically all the men who interest 
the author, save the captain and a few of the officers, 
are erotomaniacs their relations with the other sex 
dominated by physical appetite which seems to know 
nothing of the restraints of civilization but is con- 
strained only by the limits of opportunity. There is 
Achleitner, the Vienna architect, who has come on 
board for the same reason as Frederick; Stoss, the 
armless marksman, who admits having " fallen under 
suspicion with Ingigerd"; Fuellenberg, a Berlin ac- 
quaintance of Frederick, who the first day out acts as 
masseur to an English woman who "has a husband 
in London and probably another in New York"; 
Hahlstroem, Ingigerd's father, who is exploiting her 
grace and willing to exploit her virtue, if she has any; 
Ingigerd herself, who says she " would rather be dis- 
reputable ten times over and live as she please"; 
Frau Liebling, leaving her husband behind so that 
they may be divorced; Toussaint the sculptor, and 
Fleischmann the painter, both mediocre, conceited, and 
mercenary; Wilke a steerage passenger, an old friend 
of Frederick's, represented as a wild beast, but really 
much more of a man than Frederick; a languishing 
Creole Canadian, with an attendant Yankee jackanapes 
who builds bonfires of matches on the saloon table 
until the captain interferes. Verily an aggregation of 
idealists ! When the ship is in danger Frederick cannot 
believe that God will cut off the lives of so many peo- 
ple; but so far as Hauptmann's report of them goes, 
the Lord had the same reason for action as in the case 
of Sodom and Gomorrah. 

The most successful and most nearly plausible and 
truthful parts of the book are the descriptions of the 
storm and of the foundering of the "Roland." A 
German reviewer has said that a correct title for 
"Atlantis " would be : " Experiences on a Transatlantic 
Steamer, with a Description of a Shipwreck." Haupt- 
mann's power as a reporter is undeniable, and examples 
are unnecessary. It is not the realist Hauptmann we 
are taking note of, but the representative of supreme 
idealism. Two-thirds of the book are devoted to the 
sea trip, while the remaining one hundred pages are 
occupied with Frederick's adventures in New York 
City and in Meriden, where he has the typhoid attack. 

On landing, Frederick and Ingigerd with him, for 
her father was among the lost and Frederick has 
assumed a sort of protectorate over her, are con- 
ducted by a former student of Frederick's to a Bohemian 
club-house, where late the following morning he finds 
himself alone with Ingigerd. " In that moment Fred- 
erick comprehended the passionate speech of his body 
and sanctioned its demands. ... In the seductive 



1913] 



THE DIAL

silence of the morning in this unfamiliar house it sud- 
denly assumed an elemental, indomitable force. . . . 
At last the time had come to extinguish the fires tor- 
menting him, in one wild, greedy draught. With the 
hoarse cry of a wild beast he threw himself deep into 
the slowly, slowly cooling and liberating waves of love." 

Within thirty-six hours from this idealistic episode 
Frederick has experienced " a storm of desire for self- 
purification," has assured Ingigerd that " the sight of 
her had given renewed value to life," has bathed in the 
waves again, has met Eva Burns, to whom at their 
second meeting he confides his unhappy domestic his- 
tory, including disagreements which he and his wife 
had had over the question of having children, and also 
his relations with Ingigerd, and has determined to 
enter the art studio where Eva is working. After a 
week of what he calls struggles, seeing Ingigerd every 
day and talking of idealistic art life with Eva, Fred- 
erick decides to complete the weaning from Ingigerd 
which Eva has begun by running away, just as Gabriel 
Schilling did in Hauptmann's drama. At Meriden, 
Eva Burns visits him, on her own initiative, it seems, 
arriving just in time to take care of him in the typhoid 
attack. On his recovery she goes back to New York 
without having done more than laugh at Frederick's 
shy question whether " we five he, she, and his three 
children could end their lives in peace in a little 
studio near Florence." But before sailing for England, 
where she is called by business affairs, she goes out to 
Meriden again, takes a long walk with Frederick and 
brings him back happy, " to their own surprise these 
two human beings had been penetrated by a new ele- 
ment and a new life." 

When, after Frederick's recovery from typhoid, his 
friend Dr. Schmidt remarked, " A forced cure, a violent 
eruption and revolution has purged your body of all 
poisons and putrid matter," it was doubtless intended to 
symbolize a similar purification of soul through the in- 
fluence of Eva Burns. Believe it who can. I do not 
like to betray doubts of the ultimate redemption of any 
human soul; but I must say that the cure seems to 
me sudden. I should say that it would take a century 
or two. 

The powerful and truthful portrayal of a bad char- 
acter may justly be undertaken by a great artist, although 
it is unfortunate to make a weak or bad person the centre 
of interest in a novel that is to appeal to the general 
reading public. But the portrayal of Frederick von 
Kammacher cannot be called either powerful or truthful. 
He is weak at the beginning and weak he remains. His 
religious reflections, as, for instance, that God will 
surely not think of destroying so large a number of 
talented people as are on the " Roland," are childish. 
His conception of art is anything but idealistic. His 
shifts from lust to lofty sentiment are impossible in their 
suddenness. His supposed conversion to nobler aims is 
absolutely unconvincing. No sane judge of human na- 
ture would trust the welfare of a woman in his hands. 
Neurotic, erotic, with a mind full of foul memories and 
an evil habitude established, he can promise nothing but 
hell for poor Eva Burns. But she goeth to her death 
as the fool goeth. 

Gerhart Hauptmann in " Atlantis " has entered into 
the shady realm of the worst of French naturalism, as 
did Sudermann in "Das hohe Lied," but with much less 
art and much less justification. Sudermann 's book por- 
trays the downfall of a poor middle-class girl and the 
almost insuperable difficulty of recovery ; a portrayal 



that reveals the lure of sin and the constraint of poverty 
for the girl but not with any lure for the reader. Haupt- 
mann portrays the selfishness, the weakness, the lust of 
a vacillating character, and would fain have us believe 
that this character is revolutionized by admiration for 
a new face and a self-reliant bearing. The author of 
" Die versunkene Glocke " might have won the Nobel 
prize. It is an affront to clean art and clean morals to 
award it to the author of " Atlantis."

EX LIBRA ET LIBRIS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It is pleasant, after undertaking the disagreeable duty 
of adverse criticism, to have the need for it attested by 
numerous expressions of approval, such as I have re- 
ceived, but even more to find the person criticized in 
substantial agreement with my strictures; not only is 
the justice of the attack thereby bespoken, but in an 
even greater degree the open-mindedness and mag- 
nanimity of the one censured. I have little but praise, 
therefore, for the answer of the editor of " Poetry " to 
my observations on her conduct of that magazine. 

Granting, as my fellow-compiler suggests, that Miss 
Monroe is not interested in the topics of our " Little 
Book of Brides " and " Little Book of Kisses," I can 
still heartily agree with her that these, and the sixty 
other books of verse which I have edited or compiled, 
covering as they do the entire field of English verse 
from Chaucer to Mr. Yeats, unfit me for the enjoyment 
of Mr. Pound's " form " and " technic," as recently 
exhibited. 

Though I do not see why, if the rhythms of English 
poetry so obvious to me are still subtle and difficult of 
discernment to her, I am thereby rendered ineligible to 
the office of critic of Mr. Pound's Jerked English, I 
feel certain that the difficulty is rather one of definitions 
than of actual diversity of opinion. Perhaps it is as 
well to remember that Milton said of poetry, in com- 
paring it with logic, that it is " less subtile and fine, but 
more simple, sensuous, and passionate." 

Miss Monroe lets her subtlety carry her back to Egypt 
rather than the fall of Troy when thirty centuries is 
mentioned as the duration of metrical tradition, and in 
my statement that this tradition has remained unchal- 
lenged I am glad to submit to correction. There have 
been challengers of the need for formal rhythm in 
poetry in recent years, just as there are still those who 
challenge the old Greek conception that the world is a 
sphere; I should have written "has not been success- 
fully challenged." 

I heartily concur with Miss Monroe's statement, made 
for the second time in reply to an attack, to the effect 
that the existence of Mr. Pound's erratic lines is their 
only justification; and thank her for the proof she ad- 
duces of this in the information that they are the result 
of his study of metrical forms and variations in eleven 
languages " metrical " having, of course, only one 
meaning, that of formal rhythm. 

And I must thank her, too, for confirming my impres- 
sion that " Poetry " had done little or nothing to advance 
the cause for which it was supposedly founded. She 
brings forward seven poems to that end which it has 
published in as many months. Eliminating from these 
the metrical rubbish of Mr. Lindsay, the prose of Mr. 
Tagore and Mr. Pound, and the lines of Mr. Yeats, 
which are much the least poetic of his yet printed, it 



450 



THE DIAL 



[June 1 



leaves three poems to which she may point with pride as 
the result of more than half a year of earnest endeavor. 

My other observations upon the conduct of the maga- 
zine, she, like my approving friends and correspondents, 
appears to take as self-evidently true. Such admissions 
as these, tacit and expressed, give us all the greatest 
hope for the future. 

In conclusion may I say that, if hereafter Miss Monroe 
will write the poetry for Mr. Pound, and Mr. Pound the 
prose for Miss Monroe, I believe the last possibility of 
disagreement will be removed. WALLACE RICE.

"POETRY BY THE POUND." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Mr. Rice opened the discussion of poetry by the pound 
in the May-day edition of THE DIAL with rather heavy 
artillery. Miss Monroe responds with the strangely 
limited argument that Mr. Rice is not an eligible critic 
of poetry because he once edited such dainty trifles as 
"The Little Book of Kisses." Mr. Rice seems to me to 
have rather the better of the argument with his quotation 
from Oscar Wilde. Merely on the score of dainty trifles, 
the pretty little magazine about which all this contro- 
versy rages satisfies the preciosity of its slight public 
quite as completely as any little books of kisses might 
satisfy the blushes of the boudoir. 

After all, each of us can challenge the other's critical 
faculty until the herd returns to the milking-shed, and 
each will probably remain " of the same opinion still." 
The knowledge of what is good and what is bad in poetry 
is simply a matter of a critic's being born with or with- 
out taste. He must also believe in his own taste, for 
certainly no one else in this chaotic century is going to 
believe in it. By which token I unshakenly affirm that 
Lindsay's "General Booth" is the only poem of distinc- 
tion (and it is of very great distinction) among all those 
to which Miss Monroe refers Mr. Rice. I contend that 
this poem is as excellent as the recent "Contemporania" 
of Mr. Pound are poor. Mr. Pound's final jape has been 
too much for most of the admirers of the three really 
good poems which he once wrote. He now seems to 
delight in placing himself in the cheapest of categories. 
For it is the easiest thing in the world to be what the 
world calls "sensational," and to impose upon the world's 
lack of artistic perception. The world will be only too 
ready to swallow you whole, Mr. Pound. But you really 
cannot expect any serious artist to swallow you whole. 
You really cannot expect any really serious artist to 
keep a straight face, or to laugh with you. A man who 
has made an exhaustive study of metrical forms and 
variations on the poetry of eleven languages but we 
recall Swinburne's admitting his ignorance of prosody, 
and we wonder whether there may not be a difference 
between one's knowledge of what prosody is (even the 
new prosody) and of what constitutes real poetry. Of 
course Mr. Swinburne unfortunately wrote with a mis- 
taken adherence to formal rhythms and with the idea 
that the technic of poetry meant more than a mere 
pedantry or an idle formlessness; yet Mr. Swinburne 
achieved some very pretty effects, perhaps as pretty as 
any that come from our modern steam calliopes. Of 
course it is all a matter of taste. Some prefer the cal- 
liope. And others are prejudiced in favor of the violin. 

Mr. Pound should not be so ashamed of his earlier 
work. In his first frenzy he struck out "The Ballad 
of the Goodly Fere," the Ballad for Gloom," and the 
poem about the white stag, Fame ; also he sang Villon 



and the Gibbet rather well, and wrote some lines to his 
old fencing master which showed promise. But 
"Since that time unto this season 

I have had nor rhyme nor reason " 

for thinking the same of any other poetry by Mr. Pound. 
Is there no way of preventing youth from banging itself 
in its own ego ? " How may a man be a popular poet 
and yet save his soul and his art? " reads a very recent 
editorial in the little magazine " Poetry." We might 
add " How may a man be a Modern poet and yet save 
his sense of taste and his sense of humor ? "

POPULARITY OF THE GERMAN CLASSICS IN 

THE GERMAN THEATRES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

One of the interesting questions in the minds of the 
German literary public is that of the relative popular- 
ity of the classics and the popular drama on the stage 
of the present day. This question is answered in 
the Deutscher Buhnenspielplan-Register, just published 
(1913) in Berlin by Oesterheld & Co., for the theatrical 
season of 1911-12. As compared with the preceding 
year, the vogue of Anzengruber and Hebbel (as yet 
almost unknown in America) rose, on the whole. The 
latter's " Maria Magdalena " dropped from 76 to 64 
performances throughout Germany, while " Gyges und 
sein Ring " rose from 42 to 70 and " Judith " from 78 
to 96. Only one section of Grillparzer's Argonautic 
trilogy, "Medea," is frequently played; it rose from 
50 to 61. Kleist owes his huge increase to the one 
hundredth anniversary of his suicide : every play shows 
a rise; "Amphitryon" from 19 to 25, "Die Her- 
mannsschlacht " from 26 to 44, " Robert Guiscard " 
from 4 to 59, " Penthesilea " from 1 to 140 (!), 
"Kathchen von Heilbronn" from 105 to 174, "Der 
Prinz von Homburg " from 106 to 215, and " Der 
zerbrochene Krug " (the most popular) from 61 to 302. 

In Goethe's case we meet with the following pecu- 
liar phenomenon : the greater works (" Faust " and 
" Iphigenie ") show a decline, whereas lesser and almost 
unknown works are gaining ground. "Die Mitschul- 
digen " rose from 10 to 32, "Die Laune des Verliebten " 
from 7 to 64 performances. Goethe's " Jery und 
Bately " and the " Urfaust " had never been played 
before this season. Lessing's less prominent plays are 
also being dug out again; "Der junge Gelehrte" 
and " Miss Sara Sampson " are again finding favor. 
His " Emilia Galotti " held its own at 60 perform- 
ances for the season, while " Nathan der Weise " rose 
from 127 to 165. Shakespeare held his ground; he 
had 1044 performances as against 1042 the year be- 
fore. "Henry VI.," "The Tempest," and "Timon 
of Athens " had not .a single performance. His most 
popular plays were " The Merchant of Venice " (147) 
and "Othello" (142). Schiller remains the king of 
the German theatre, although he shows a decrease in 
the total number of performances, dropping from 1584 
to 1420. " Fiesco " is still the least popular, and 
" Wilhelm Tell " the most popular, of the longer plays 
(the latter had 329 performances). There is competi- 
tion among the classics, but on the whole they are not 
losing. In total number of performances, the classic 
side of the German repertory is still gaining.

A LIVELY VIEW OF Vic TORI AK 

LITERATURE.* 



In THE DIAL recently we had occasion to 
deplore a certain deadness which seems inherent 
in Histories of English Literature. But we 
are now offered a study of a special epoch of 
that literature which is certainly lively enough. 
The difference between Mr. Lang's book and 
Mr. Chesterton's is marked. It is the differ- 
ence between an Eden Musee and the Moving 
Pictures. In one there is a collection of fig- 
ures, lifelike indeed, but motionless and made 
of wax; in the other, an image of the hurly 
burly of life, of life indeed accentuated and 
accelerated, rushing here and there, upset and 
upsetting and marching straight forward out of 
the picture. 

The difference is in part a matter of style. 
Mr. Lang's prose, at its best, has an old-world 
charm of leisured and ordered composition. 
His lights are not spread all over his canvas, 
but gleam out amid shadows or are tangled in 
quiet retirements. Quietness is the last thing 
one would associate with Mr. Chesterton. His 
world is a-crackle with fireworks, with a pin- 
wheel profusion of sparks. 

But what chiefly separates the two writers 
is their attitude towards literature itself. Mr. 
Lang has a vision though we confess he did 
not succeed in getting it into his History of 
that verbal shell of things which age by age de- 
taches itself from material existence and hangs 
over or rolls on by the side of the changing real 
world, eternal and unchanged. Mr. Chesterton 
views literature as one of the activities of life, 
like law-making or the manufacture of hard- 
ware or the boiling of soaps. At the bottom 
his method is that of Taine, though perhaps the 
milieu is more and the men less with him than 
even with the French critic. 

There can be little doubt which of these two 
kinds of criticism affords the best opportunity 
for striking and pungent comment. Mr. 
Chesterton attaches his literary machines to the 
great belt which runs all the other work of the 
age. If in the consequent whir and din we miss 
the ultimate perfections, the permanent results 
of literature, we are at least reassured that 
literature is a real factor in everyday life. 

Taking it for what it professes to be, a 

*THK VICTORIAN AGE IN LITERATURE. By G. K. 
Chesterton. "Home University Library." New York: 
Henry Holt & Co. 



study of the interrelation of literature, thought, 
and action in the Victorian Age, the book is 
good and sound ; which perhaps may only mean 
that it agrees in the main with our own precon- 
ceptions. We do not, indeed, think its views 
are especially original. It has been pointed out 
before that the Victorian literature was essen- 
tially a middle-class one. The descent from the 
great individualities, the tremendous tumult, of 
the Georgian epoch to the domesticities and the 
mild doubts of the Victorian time has always 
been evident. The Titanomachia of Burns, 
Byron, Scott, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Cole- 
ridge subsided into entire rest or into a 
somewhat insignificant and sordid scramble. 
However, Mr. Chesterton brings out this part 
of his theme with telling effect, one of his 
shrewdest remarks being that whereas France 
worked out its revolution with gunpowder, 
England more economically went through its 
ebullition with words. 

Mr. Chesterton is at his best in dealing with 
the Victorian prophets, the Voices from whose 
confused clamor arose the plain song of the age. 
On the one side were the apostles of rationalism 
and common sense, Bentham, Mill, Macaulay, 
and a little later the scientists who wrought out 
the theories of evolution ; while on the other 
side were the professors of unselfishness and 
soul-life, Newman, Carlyle, E,uskin,and Arnold. 
In this regard he shows that Dickens was the 
greatest force of them all, really the very heart 
of the age. Mr. Chesterton has, we believe, 
devoted a separate book to Dickens, so he may 
be pardoned for considering him here mainly as 
a reformer, a teacher of justice and happiness. 

In his chapter on the novelists, Mr. Chester- 
ton does give a slight excursus on Dickens as 
a creative artist. Rather protesting against the 
stock comparison of Dickens with Thackeray, 
he does compare them with the result that the 
latter becomes a little ghost-like. The difference 
between them of course is this, that the world 
created by Dickens is imaginatively true, while 
the world seen by Thackeray is only actually 
true. Mr. Percy Fitzgerald once gave a long 
list of the characters and situations imitated and 
borrowed by Thackeray from his rival. It was 
as though the exuberance and buoyancy of the 
other distressed him, and he went over the lat- 
ter's copy like a careful schoolmaster to reduce 
the swelling and irresponsible imaginations and 
make everything square with fact. This recen- 
sion is good and valuable in itself, but there is 
more vitality in the original. 

Mr. Chesterton brings out the fact that the 



452 



THE DIAL 



[June 1 



novel is peculiarly woman's sphere in art. It is 
only when men are something more than novel- 
ists, like Scott and Dickens, that they can beat 
the sisterhood in this field. After Mr. Henley's 
somewhat Mohock dealings with George Eliot, 
Mr. Chesterton's treatment of her is a model of 
discretion and consideration. He is kindly and 
just and accurate, too, in his delineations of 
Mrs. Gaskell, Mrs. Oliphant, and Charlotte 
Bronte; but when he comes to the greatest of 
them all, Emily Bronte, he falls flat and shames 
his worshippers, if he has any. He thinks that 
Emily was a great figure but not a great artist, 
and that it is only Charlotte who enters Victo- 
rian literature. Now an artist is never a great 
figure unless reputation is justified by work. A 
hollow sham rarely lasts long enough to pay for 
the trouble of building it up. The lofty praise 
of Dobell, James Smetham, Arnold, Swinburne, 
and Miss Sinclair is ample warrant against there 
being any hollowness in Emily Bronte's fame. 
There is. we believe, a somewhat similar mis- 
calculation in Mr. Chesterton's dealings with 
Meredith and Hardy. We should not care 
ourselves to hold a brief before the forty-two 
assessors of the dead for either of these novel- 
ists, but we think their comparative merits are 
just the reverse of what Mr. Chesterton decides. 
It seems to us that Meredith's crabbed and 
eccentric style is a sign of an inward creative 
confusion, while Mr. Hardy's luminous and 
sufficiently sensuous prose is an assurance of a 
certain profundity and perfection in the beings 
he projects. But Meredith is a comedian, Hardy 
a tragedian ; and Mr. Chesterton's gay and lively 
spirit leans to the former. 

Our author does not shine in his treatment 
of the Victorian poets, the reason probably 
being that archangels or butterflies (you may 
take your choice of either appellation) do not 
go well attached to machinery. Gray said that 
the language of poetry was never the language 
of the age. We may go further and assert that 
the most poetical part of the spirit of poetry has 
nothing to do with temporary aims or move- 
ments. Poets may put themselves in the van 
of movement, they may lead forlorn hopes, but 
the best they can do is to express the univer- 
sally human. Dates soon wear out in works 
destined for immortality. There is very little 
difference in a good love-song whether it is 
signed by Kalidasa, Hafiz, or Burns. A great 
tragedy is at home in any age or any part of 
the world. 

Mr. Chesterton's last chapter is entitled "The 
Break-up of the Compromise," and shows the 



end of the era and reveals its commonplace 
conventions shattered by the emergence of new 
forces. Chief of these forces were the aesthetic 
movement led by Oscar Wilde, the socialistic 
movement captained by Mr. Shaw and Mr. 
Wells, the adventure propaganda promulgated 
by Stevenson, and the impressionistic pro- 
gramme with which Mr. Kipling is best asso- 
ciated. All these factors in modern life and 
figures in modern art are discussed by Mr. 
Chesterton in a fair and lucid way. But we 
venture to suggest that he has missed out some 
of the most potent ideas that are working in the 
modern mind and getting expression in liter- 
ature. There is first the woman question, which 
he ignores. We do not mean the feminist struggle 
for votes, but the more important fact of a total 
reversal of man's traditional feeling towards 
woman, the chivalric attitude, in short. From 
the time of Dante and Petrarch there had grown 
up, outside of France which was always skep- 
tical on the subject, an idea of womanhood as 
something high and holy, spiritual and pure, as 
something calculated to lift the race to the 
heights. Schopenhauer it was who knocked the 
angel theory of woman on the head and set 
loose the modern idea of her as more animal 
than man. This conception is certainly deeply 
inwoven in recent English literature, yet Mr. 
Chesterton makes no account of it. 

Another large conception which has had a 
great influence on late writers is Nietzscheism, 
the cult of the superman. This dogma or doc- 
trine or delusion or devastation, however you 
may choose to accept it, is the antithesis of 
socialism, and as Mr. Chesterton evidently has 
leanings towards this latter evangel it probably 
did not suit his book to discuss a philosophy 
which is dark and mysterious, which draws war 
and destruction in its train, and which is ram- 
pant on the continent. The third thought factor 
which Mr. Chesterton may be accused of for- 
getting is the new vitalistic movement in meta- 
physics and religion heralded by Bergson and 
Eucken. This, however, practically had no 
effect on even the latest Victorian literature. 

Taken as a whole, Mr. Chesterton has given 
us an entertaining and, within its limits, a 
convincing book.

RECORDS OF A GREAT MUSICIAN.* 



There has not appeared for a long time a work 
of such commanding interest and importance to 
the music-lover as Grace E. Hadow's rendering 
into English of Berthold Litzmann's exhaustive 
and authoritative biography of Clara Schumann. 
The biographer was an intimate friend of the 
Schumann family ; he was a neighbor of and grew 
up with the Schumann children; he had access to 
the large accumulation of family documentary 
material ; he was fitted by native endowment, by 
genuine devotion, and by his life's occupation, 
to perform adequately and successfully the labor 
of love which he accepted only after considerable 
conscientious hesitation. The translation also 
could not have been placed in more satisfactory 
hands than in those of Grace and William H. 
Hadow, who have done so much for music in 
their various excellent publications. 

The story has in it all the elements of a ro- 
mance, the struggles of the youthful prodigy 
and rising artist, the early successes of a great 
talent, the jealous care of a father filled with 
the ardor of a lofty if somewhat rigid idealism, 
the young lover bearing within him the promise 
of a reconstitution of the great art to which both 
were devoted, the years of a married life which 
opened to man and wife new fields of achieve- 
ment of which they had no preconception, the 
tragedy of death and separation, the consum- 
mation finally of a career in music to which few 
parallels can be found. The whole is minutely 
and characteristically told in these volumes, 
which never waver in their interest and enthu- 
siasm. 

Clara Wieck was born, as she herself says, 
at Leipsic, September 13, 1819, in the house 
" Zur hohen Lilie" in the new Neurnarkt. In 
1824, when she was five years old, her mother 
obtained a divorce, and the child was left in the 
sole charge of her father, a stern and relentless 
taskmaster, who yet had the deepest regard for 
his daughter's highest interests, who recognized 
at once her precocious abilities, and made her 
a pianist of the first importance. Friedrich 
Wieck was a great teacher, and while not a 
creative musician or a proficient executant, he 
nevertheless had the real artist's insight and 
inspiration, and was gifted with the superb 
capacity of transferring his knowledge and

enthusiasm to his pupils, and of arousing in 
them a spirit of achievement far greater than his 



own 



From her earliest years Clara Wieck kept a 
diary. This, with a constant interchange of 
letters between herself and the great and im- 
portant everywhere, made a wealth of material 
rarely accessible to the biographer. Father 
Wieck himself began the diary when the child 
was yet too young to make entries. Some of the 
father's interpolations were by no means flatter- 
ing to the diarist, and were doubtless intended as 
wholesome injunctions to the young girl. Her 
success as a player both in private and public 
soon became marked, and her reputation began 
to spread. When she was nine years old she 
made a successful appearance at the Leipsic 
Gewandhaus. In her tenth year she met 
Paganini, who praised her playing and gave her 
great encouragement. As she herself says : 

" I had to play to him on a wretched old piano with 
black keys which had been left behind by a student; I 
played my Polonaise in E b, which he liked very much, 
and he told my father that I had a vocation for art, 
because I had feeling. He at once gave us permission 
to attend all his rehearsals, which we did." 

We may also insert here an account from the 
diary of a visit made to Goethe in Weimar. 

" On October 1, 1831, at 12 o'clock we had an audi- 
ence with the 83 year-old minister, His Excellency von 
Goethe. We found him reading and the servant took 
us in without further announcement, as he made an 
appointment with us the day before for this hour. He 
received us very kindly ; Clara had to sit by him on the 
sofa. Soon after his daughter-in-law came in with her 
two very clever looking children of 10 and 12. Clara 
was asked to play and as the piano stool was too low 
Goethe himself fetched a cushion from the anteroom 
and arranged it for her. She played Herz's La Violetta. 
While she was playing more visitors arrived and she 
then played Herz's Bravura Variations, Op. 20. Goethe 
estimated these compositions and Clara's playing very 
justly, spoke of the pieces as bright, French and piquant, 
and admired Clara's intelligent rendering." 

Goethe also said of the young girl : " Clara's 
interpretation makes one forget the composer," 
and he sent her a bronze medal of himself with 
a paper containing the inscription : " In kindly 
remembrance of Oct. 9, 1831, Weimar. J.W. 
Goethe." 

In this manner the development of the great 
player proceeded ; but the event was now to 
occur which introduced into her life its chief in- 
fluence, and which gave character to her whole 
subsequent career. Every stage of her progress 
is illustrated in the biography by constant cita- 
tions from the diary or letters, and the connect- 
ing links of narrative shine with a full under- 
standing of the musical history of the time. With

[June 1 



the coming of Robert Schumann, the curtain rose 
on a new advance of German music, indeed of 
all music ; and the romantic phase came in due 
succession to the classicism out of whose loins 
it sprang. Robert Schumann, some nine years 
older than Clara, lived in the same house with 
the Wiecks. He had been a law student, but 
it soon became clear to him that law was not 
to be his avocation, and that music claimed him 
as a devotee. His mother was by no means 
ready to permit the change, and wrote to Fried- 
rich Wieck for advice. The latter gave this 
in a long letter which is even to-day wholesome 
and convincing reading. When this letter was 
put into Robert Schumann's hands, he arrived 
at a decision without delay, and at once enrolled 
himself as a pupil of the distinguished teacher. 
The subsequent attachment of the young people, 
the unexpected but vehement objections of 
Clara's father, the years of trial and waiting, 
the marriage at last in spite of every obstacle, 
all this may be read here as part of the romance 
which constituted the life of the great romanti- 
cists. The sixteen years of Clara Schumann's 
married life were the most important part of 
her earthly pilgrimage. The intimate associa- 
tion with one of the great musicians of all time 
stimulated her intelligence and invigorated her 
power of expression. She was introduced into 
regions of thought and aspiration whither her 
father with all his skill and assiduity could not. 
lead her. If for a time she found herself thrown 
somewhat into the shade by the great achieve- 
ments of the husband, and if the care of an 
increasing family withdrew her from the public 
exercise of her art, yet the results appeared later 
in deepened insight, greater command of the 
executant's resources, subtler appreciation of 
the noblest in music, and enlarged skill in orig- 
inal composition. It was a union like that of 
the Brownings, and the heights which the 
Schumanns ascended were not less filled with 
echoes from the heavens. Clara Schumann 
needed, above all, intellectual awakening and 
guidance, and these arrived now in no stinted 
measure. Throughout the letters and diaries 
are expressions of the debt which she owed to 
Robert Schumann. In one of the letters she 
speaks as follows : "I am extremely glad that 
you are composing so much, and a symphony 
too ? Ah ! Robert, that is too good ! So you 
were offended with me for calling you a second 
Jean Paul and Beethoven ? You shall not hear 
it again. You are quite right, it is not nice to 
make such comparisons." It is quite evident, 
however, what she really thought. 



The Schumanns were leaders in the trans- 
formation which took place in music after the 
era of Beethoven. They were important pro- 
moters of the Romantic School, however this 
may be defined and delimited, but nevertheless 
thfey were distinctly of the conservatives. They 
stood with Schubert, Chopin, Mendelssohn, 
and Brahms; with the Revolutionists, the new 
Enthusiasts, Berlioz, and Liszt and Wagner, 
they had little sympathy. They welcomed the 
advances made by Brahms, and after Robert 
Schumann's death, Clara found in the works 
of Brahms the inspiration which her husband's 
writings had given her during his lifetime. 
Indeed, the remarkable friendship between the 
younger musician and the pianist gives a chief 
interest to the latter pages of the biography. 
During these years Brahms the composer, 
Joachim the violinist, and Clara Schumann 
the pianist, upheld the great musical traditions 
throughout Europe, and constantly directed the 
rising innovators back to the illuminations of 
Bach and Beethoven and Mozart. 

Robert Schumann died in 1856. Then fol- 
lowed in some sense the great years of this 
woman's career. There was a large family to 
support and there were musical battles to be 
won. The widowed artist set herself to the 
task. She now went on her great concert tours, 
and every country in Europe listened to the 
message which her mature art brought. It was 
a message of finished performance, it was a mes- 
sage of sincerity and nobility, it was a message 
which emphasized the highest aspects of music. 
She was assisted in this effort by Joachim, an 
idealist like herself, and they both hailed 
Johannes Brahms as the master whose creations 
were in the direct line of succession with the 
music that meant most to mankind. The ex- 
periences of Clara Schumann were as wide as 
the world of music : kings and queens paid her 
homage; all the great of her time poets, 
novelists, painters gave her recognition and 
fellowship. Notable are the friendships with 
Jenny Lind, Grillparzer, and Wilhelmine 
Schroder-Devrient, to the latter of whom Clara 
Schumann wrote a candid letter of advice when 
she proposed to return to the stage after her 
voice had failed. The diary is full of vivid and 
striking reminiscences. Probably no pianist ever 
had a more significant destiny. Allgeyer, who 
began the biography which Litzmann completed 
after the death of his predecessor, says of her : 

" In whatever character, in whatever relationship to 
the world at large Clara Schumann shows herself in her 
correspondence, whether as daughter, sister, friend,

betrothed, wife, mother, artist, colleague, or teacher, 
everywhere and always it is the absolute humanity com- 
bined with the fathomless depths of a pure woman's soul 
which attracts and touches us. . . . After what has been 
said, the'prominent position held by Clara Schumann in 
the musical life of our day needs no explanation." 

The translation is well done; it shows com- 
plete understanding of the original and reads 
like an English book. There are, however, 
some sad misprints. The work contains a num- 
ber of portraits, and each volume is furnished 
with a copious and valuable index.

VIXCENT VAN GOGH : POST- 

IMPRESSKXNIST.* 



The air is so full at present of utterances con- 
cerning Futurists, Cubists, Neo-Impressionists, 
and Post-Impressionists, that it seems wrong to 
add anything to the dust. Still we believe that 
it will not add to the confusion, and may even 
have a clarifying effect, to introduce into the 
public mind, if possible, a few facts and ideas 
concerning Vincent Van Gogh, some of whose 
correspondence has been recently edited by Mr. 
Anthony M. Ludovici. It may perhaps be 
something like putting a piece of fish skin into 
boiling coffee, or a raw egg ; or indeed it may 
be more like the dash of cold water which some 
people think as good as anything else. A read- 
ing of these letters will certainly do something 
to clear away the extravagances which now 
cloud the public mind. They were written long 
since, and so are free from present aberrations. 
Nowadays you will rarely have a conversation 
with anybody concerning Post-Impressionist 
Art without some mention of DuChamps's 
"Nude Descending the Stair"; you will rarely 
see pictures representing the latest ideas in 
painting, or in this case sculpture, which do 
not have among them that long-legged lady by 
Lembruch. You will rarely, in other words, 
hear any direct discussion of the real principles 
of these matters, any discussion which is not 
confused by all sorts of current facts and ideas 
on art which have happened to get themselves 
connected with the subject. But really it is 
better to think simply in regard to these things, 
if possible; and one has opportunity to think 
simply in reading these letters of Van Gogh, for 
he does not seem to have been of a very compli-

understand the principles that guided his life. 

*THE LETTERS OF A POST-IMPRESSIONIST. Being the 
Familiar Correspondence of Vincent Van Gogh. Translated 
byA.M. Ludovici. Illustrated. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. 



People will open this book with all sorts of 
ideas in mind. Some who are pretty well in- 
formed will be glad to see in this convenient 
form letters which they may have already read 
in the original, or may have heard of. Others 
will think it a good opportunity to get at some- 
thing more or less definite concerning latest 
eccentricities in painting. Many, I imagine, will 
open the book with some little wonder as to who 
Van Gogh was. On this matter, I shall offer 
a remark which I find in a current periodical: 
"The trinity of modern painting is composed of 
Cezanne, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. It is they 
who have initiated the great and far-reaching 
movement which bids fair to change the com- 
plexion of latter-day pictorial expression. They 
are the real pathfinders, the veritable heralds of 
all that has come after, and in their footsteps, 
walk, with every show of humility, the men of 
the present." That certainly is definite enough. 
If there is anybody who after reading that does 
not wish to know more about Van Gogh, he must 
certainly have very little interest in the art of 
the future, or very little confidence in the au- 
thority which I cite. Vincent Van Gogh, "to 
whom the present generation of ultra modern 
progressives has turned for inspiration and aes- 
thetic renewal," was a painter of the last century, 
who worked for a few years in Holland and 
France and died in the year 1890. He had by 
that time painted a considerable number of pic- 
tures, over five hundred, I believe, although 
he had worked but eight or ten years. For a 
considerable time he remained practically un- 
known, or known only to a very few. It was 
not until fifteen or twenty years after his death 
that even his name began to be at all familiar, 
and even now it is not easy to get much accurate 
information concerning him or his works. There 
are several of his pictures in the International 
Exhibition of Modern Art, notably one entitled 
' ' Bal Aries , ' ' which people may remember . This 
picture is not an especially characteristic one, 
but it seems to be that which has made the 
most impression on the public. 

It is best to turn to a reading of these "Let- 
ters of a Post-Impressionist" with the simple 
desire of finding out something of Van Gogh 
himself, and without much notion of all the 
things which have been lately said about him 
and about modern movements in painting. 
Whatever may be said now concerning Van 
Gogh, he undoubtedly was a man who lived 
rather a simple, direct, straightforward kind of 
life, unconfused by the ideas of other people or 
by movements which included other artists. He

was evidently an original person, not one of a 
school. He seems to have known little of the 
great Impressionists, except what he picked up 
from their pictures. There is in these letters 
very little mention of any of the men who in the 
eighties were gradually coming to prominence 
and recognition. Undoubtedly Van Gogh found 
much with which to sympathize in the paintings 
of Manet, Monet, Rafaelli, and Degas, as well 
as others, but he does not seem to have had any 
more to do with them personally than he did 
with the great painters of the past. Neither 
did he apparently have as much interest in their 
paintings as he did in those of Delacroix, for 
example, or Rembrandt and the other Dutch- 
men, particularly, let us say, in Vermeer of 
Delft, ''that incomparable sphinx whose extraor- 
dinary sound technic which people so ardently 
long to find to-day, was never to be surpassed." 
Neither was he particularly acquainted with 
those who have been called Neo-Impressionists, 
except Seurat. He did not even live in close 
connection with those whose names are commonly 
associated with him. He had seen few of the 
pictures of Cezanne, and his letters have very 
little mention of him. He was more closely 
thrown with Gauguin, for whom he felt a close 
and fundamental sympathy and who undoubtedly 
was a powerful influence in his later life. He 
does in one case speak to Bernard about " work- 
ing away with me and Gauguin." He is now 
called a Post-Impressionist, but it does not 
appear that he ever called himself so, or that 
anybody ever used the name in his life-time. It 
is a name that has been applied since his death, 
to designate a number of those who came after 
the great Impressionists, who had something of 
their spirit, or who struck out for themselves in 
paths which since their time have been followed 
by many who have gone much farther than the 
forerunners went themselves. 

There are several reasons why people inter- 
ested in art should read these letters. They are, 
for one thing, quite an unusual production, 
the intimate personal talk of one who whether 
he were a great painter or not was certainly 
a great critic of art. They are, further, a fairly 
representative expression of a definite theory of 
art. But they are also (and it is in this respect, 
I take it, that they are most important) a real 
means of learning about something in the world 
of art at present which otherwise we should have 
small chance of knowing. The art world, says 
Mr. Ludovici mildly, is not without its arch 
humbugs. That is certainly so. There have 
always been humbugs and arch humbugs in the 



world of art. To-day there is a more favorable 
atmosphere for them than ever before. This is 
the hey-dey of advertising, which means the 
day of opportunity for the sophist in every walk 
of life, the man who believes that the great thing 
in the world is talk and not fact. This is the 
great day of popular art, in which there are 
hundreds and thousands of people earnestly 
desirous of knowing about the beautiful things 
of the world and so offering an opportunity to 
all sorts of pretentious and pretended virtuosi, 
cognoscenti, dilettanti, critics, and connoisseurs. 
It is a day of great wealth and luxury, in which 
there are many who desire beauty of surround- 
ings without regard to cost. Under these con- 
ditions there is great probability of people 
coming to the front in the world of art by 
means of impudence, calculation, obtrusive stu- 
piosity, foolishness, or (as has been suggested) 
insanity; and whatever has the possibility of 
being made to pay will undoubtedly be presented 
as being the greatest thing in the world. 

In other words it is hard for us to get the 
truth in regard to modern art. The day of the 
great painters is for the moment over. The 
day of the advertisers, the popular magazines, 
the journalists, the promoters, the puffers, the 
art dealers, has come in. It requires the clearest 
mind, the finest taste, the widest opportunities 
to remain unperturbed in the whirl ; no one 
need be ashamed of losing his head now and 
then. But in these letters of Van Gogh we 
have the natural and uncolored utterance of one 
of these men who is now at the centre of the 
cyclonic duststorm. We may regret the bard- 
ships and the obscurity of Van Gogh's life. But 
now that it is all over, it has its advantage, for 
it gives his work the stamp of sincerity. These 
letters were written for his brother and his most 
intimate friend. He could have had no idea 
that they would ever come before the public ; 
he could have had no thought of advertising 
charlatanry or puffery. He simply expressed 
himself in these letters that no one but his 
brother would read as he had expressed himself 
in his pictures that no one would buy. But 
whereas it is difficult for the average man to 
understand what he had to say through the 
medium of painting, it is not hard to under- 
stand what he said in the universal medium of 
words. So if we really desire to know, if not 
what Van Gogh was, at least what he wanted 
to be, we may find out here. 

I shall not anticipate the pleasure of the 
reader in turning to this volume. I will merely 
note one or two things that seem to me signi- 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



457 



ficant. The first is that Van Gogh considered 
himself as the painter of Humanity, not the 
painter of an ultra-refined, super-sensitive de- 
cadent civilization, but an almost primitive 
painter of Man, Life Vitality. 

But over against this fine ideal and breadth 
of view we must put the unfortunate fact that 
Van Gogh could not paint the figure very well. 
Although he certainly had astonishing facility 
for one who had never toiled and labored at the 
technique of his art, he does not seem to have 
been able to paint anything very well, and the 
figure is not the easiest thing to paint. In land- 
scape or still life one may vary more or less from 
the facts to humor one's inabilities or vague- 
nesses, but with the figure it is much harder ; 
one has to make it pretty nearly the way it is 
or ought to be, if one is painting out of one's 
head, as Van Gogh sometimes had to. Other- 
wise it will look funny. Van Gogh himself did 
not feel that he painted very well ; he knew 
that he could draw, for he had practiced for 
many years, but he was rather surprised to find 
that he could paint. 

As to his method of painting, something 
might be said, although he himself remarked 
that he really did not know how he painted, that 
he was glad he had never learned to paint, that 
he observed no system. Yet he had, of course, 
something of a theory of painting, gained partly 
from practice, but more it would seem from a 
study of the masters whom he recognized later. 
His study of pictures gave him certain funda- 
mental ideas, but he added to it much technical 
practice. He never studied in any art school, 
nor indeed, save for a few months with Mauve, 
with any older artist. Yet he practiced much. 
"Before I began to paint I made such a long 
and careful study of drawing and perspective 
that I can now sketch a thing as I see it." He 
certainly believed that art required long and 
untiring industry, observation, work. So he 
worked from nature that in time he might do 
something from imagination. Yet this working 
"from imagination" never seduced him from 
actual work from nature, "an enchanted 
land," he says; "for the present I shall not 
crack my brains over it." In general he needed 
models. "I do not mean that I never turn my 
back boldly upon nature . . . but I am fright- 
ened to death of losing accuracy of form. 
Perhaps later on, after ten years of study, I 
shall try." 

This need of models led him to paint land- 
scape more than anything else, for nature 
always offers one something beautiful free of 



fee, while people as a rule charge when they 
pose. " I have painted seven studies of corn ; 
unfortunately quite against my will, they are 
only landscapes." Like most innovators in art 
he was strong for nature. " What am I but a 
friend of nature," says he ; "I have learned my 
trade in Nature's workshop." And it was that 
he might paint Man. "Who is going to paint 
Man as Claude Monet painted landscape?" he 
asks ; and as was most natural, at first he 
thought much of the peasant life all around 
him, the life that Israels had painted, and in 
France especially Millet and Lhermitte. He 
wanted to paint Humanity. He wanted to get 
at life. Like many other men not wholly nor- 
mal, he admired and delighted in health. Like 
Nietzsche, he admired the physical strength and 
power and poise which was lacking in himself. 
He was no whiner, but one can readily see his 
lack of the normal health that he would have 
delighted in. He did not live a normal life, 
perhaps he could not; once toward the end of 
the month when he was very anxious to buy 
five picture frames he had to live on bread and 
coffee for a week, and doubtless there were 
many more such things. 

Yet, if one can judge from this book, Van 
Gogh was really more inspired by art than by 
nature : he lived an artistic life and said him- 
self that in the midst of such a life " there arises 
again and again the yearning for real life, which 
remains an unrealizable ideal." And it seems 
to me pretty clear that Van Gogh's painting was 
more the product of the painting of the past 
than of the life about him. That is a judgment 
which it would be absurd to pronounce abso- 
lutely before one had the chance to study his 
pictures (as I have not) ; but from reading his 
letters one gets the idea that the influence of 
other painters upon Van Gogh was strong. He 
was perhaps not particularly influenced by con- 
temporaries ; as has been said, he had little to 
do with Impressionists or Neo-Impressiomsts 
except to accept a good many of their results 
as anyone accepts the commonplace truths of 
life. But he owed much to the old Dutch 
masters, if not so much in technique (save with 
Vander Meer of Delft) at least in conception 
of the aim and purpose of art. Rembrandt 
and Franz Hals and their broad painting of 
humanity fascinated him. The latter, it will be 
remembered, was particularly the favorite of the 
eighties, not only for his general temper, but for 
various technical reasons. Van Gogh had the 
sense to see that the " square touch " cult of 
Franz Hals amounted to little compared with 



458 



THE DIAL 



[June 1 



his big view of life. He runs over his subjects 
"soldier pictures, officers, banquets, portraits of 
magistrates ... a drunken toper, a beautiful 
Bohemian courtesan . . . tramps, musicians, 
and a fat cook." " We cannot do anything 
else," says he ; " but all this is worthy of 
Dante's Paradise." It is perhaps not worth 
questioning whether life in general led Van 
Gogh to appreciate Franz Hals, or Franz Hals 
led him to appreciate life in general. 

So much for the question of subject matter. 
I am led to think much the same thing in re- 
gard to questions of technique. Van Gogh was 
in the main a colorist. "Color on color means 
something," was his view. "I know that we 
are now engaged in the problem of color"; 
" things present themselves to me in colors which 
formerly I never used to see," and other such 
utterances show his preoccupation. And it was 
for such reason it would appear that he was so 
interested in the pictures of Delacroix. It would 
seem at first view as though there could be very 
little connection between this great Romanticist 
and a painter of the time of Van Gogh. But 
there is no one but Rembrandt of whom he 
speaks more and with more interest. "Armed 
with an almost complete mastery of Rembrandt," 
he says, " I discovered that Delacroix obtained 
his effects by means of his color, and Rembrandt 
by means of his values ; but they are worthy of 
each other." And in the same spirit he says 
that his work (so far as color is concerned) " is 
certainly much more under the suggestion of 
Delacroix' painting " than of the Impressionists. 
If now we ask what is the influence of Delacroix 
in this cardinal point of color, I cannot say what 
would be the answer from a study of Van Gogh's 
works. But if his letters give us a good idea 
of his practice, the answer would be that it is 
expressed largely in combinations of lemon yellow 
and prussian blue. He notes Delacroix's pas- 
sion for this combination, saying that he created 
really magnificent things thereby. And it is 
to be noted, then, that no combination is more 
commonly in his own mind. In telling how he 
would paint a portrait which should reveal in 
the painting all the love he had for the man, he 
makes a combination of yellow and blue (so that 
the portrait looks like a star suspended in ether 
upon a rich blue background) , he plans to deco- 
rate his studio with sunflowers (it was in '88) 
against a blue background, his view of Aries is 
of meadows full of dandelions with a ditch full of 
irises, he notes a picture by Puvis de Chavannes, 
a man in a blue room reading a yellow book. 
At the same time he makes a still life composi- 



tion blue enamelled coffee-pot, etc., with oranges 
and lemons, "a symphony in blue tones, ani- 
mated by a scale of yellow ranging to orange," 
he sees pale sunsets (with glorious golden suns) 
which make the ground appear quite blue ; in 
fact, he theorizes, "there is no blue without 
yellow and orange, and when you paint blue, 
paint yellow and orange as well." So without 
the benefit of a comparison of the works of 
Delacroix and the five hundred pictures of Van 
Gogh, one gathers from his letters that the 
influence of the elder painter suggested to him 
certain moods of seeing nature which more and 
more dominated his work. 

He was a sincere worker, doing what he did 
for its own sake, without hope of other reward 
than comes from work well done. He believed 
himself an innovator. He believed in an art of 
the future which ought to be so beautiful that it 
was worth making sacrifices for. He believed 
that the art of the future would have a new 
theory of color as of drawing. He believed that 
he and his friends would triumph in the end, 
even though he doubted if they would live to 
see their triumph. If what has been said about 
him appears to have little connection with what 
is now called "futurist," I cannot help it. I 
have thought it better to show what were the 
actual ideas of one said to be a beginner of the 
modern movement, than to try to view his work 
in the light of what has come to pass.

DlSCUSSIOXS OF THE TRUST PROBLEM.* 

Considering the prominence of the trust 
problem in this country the scarcity of satisfac- 
tory books on the subject is surprising. Until 
within about a year, scarcely any serious and 
scholarly attempt at a general discussion of the 
problem in book form had appeared for nearly 
a decade. Fortunately, however, this does not 
mean that the decade has brought no appreciable 
progress in arriving at a clearer understanding 
of the question and a more general consensus of 
opinion as to the best method of procedure in 
dealing with the problem. 

In the first place, considerable advance has 
been made in disentangling the trust problem, 
which deals with the question of monopoly price 
and trust methods of competition, from the cor- 
poration problem, which is concerned with the

question how we can devise a form of corpo- 
rate organization which will meet the needs of 
modern large scale industry, and at the same 
time maintain proper relations between, and 
safeguard the respective interests of, creditors, 
company officials, and the various groups of 
investors. There is still much to be done in 
making this distinction clear to those engaged 
in formulating our laws. Secondly, there has 
come to be a fairly general recognition of the 
fact that there is no one cause which can be 
held responsible for the growth of our industrial 
combinations, but that they are due to a great 
variety of factors, certain of which lead to un- 
desirable forms of growth ; the obvious conclu- 
sion being that the proper method of procedure 
is to strike at the root of the evil by doing away 
with the causes leading to these undesirable 
results. A third point, upon which, however, 
there is much less general agreement, is that 
the trusts have many economic characteristics 
common to the public service companies, where 
monopoly is admitted to be desirable ; the corol- 
lary being that they ought to be regulated in 
much the same way. While the aiithors of the 
two books considered in this review would not 
accept all of these conclusions, yet the influence 
of the general trend of current discussion thus 
outlined is clearly evident in their volumes. 

The first edition of Clark's "The Control of 
Trusts" appeared in 1901 ; but the present re- 
vision is substantially a new book, being more 
than twice the size of the former and now writ- 
ten in collaboration with the author's son. In 
it the authors have made no attempt to describe 
trust methods or to give an historical account 
of the trust movement, but have limited them- 
selves to discussing the solution of the problem. 
The general position taken on this point is well 
summarized as follows: 

" Most of the measures proposed for the regulation 
of trusts fall into one or the other of two classes, of 
which the first consists of those which would merely 
destroy monopoly and make competition free, while 
the other includes measures that would relinquish such 
attempts, surrender to the principle of monopoly and 
protect the public by regulating prices through official 
bodies. This plan means trying to do in industry what 
we have partially succeeded in doing in transportation." 

" This book advocates a third course ; namely, regu- 
lating competition. It would cut off entirely an abnor- 
mal type of it by forbidding and repressing the cut-throat 
operations by which the trusts often crush their rivals. 
Further, it would remove the special inducement to such 
measures and thus create a condition in which competi- 
tion of a tolerant kind would rule business life." 

This policy is advocated in the belief that the 
checks on progress, which the authors claim 



come with monopoly, are much more serious 
than the high prices resulting therefrom ; that 
it is possible to destroy the trusts, and that so 
doing will most accelerate technical progress, the 
welfare of the laborer, and the growth of the 
world's wealth. The underlying assumption of 
the volume is thus a belief in the efficacy of 
competition. 

The authors are careful to explain, however, 
that this does not mean absolutely unrestrained 
competition laissezfaire but a form of reg- 
ulated competition which will prohibit certain 
undesirable methods of rivalry. It is in this 
connection that we find the most important 
modification of the views expressed in the first 
edition ; and the reason is a very suggestive one. 
Originally it was stated that potential competi- 
tion, if given free play, was sufficient to control 
the trusts ; but now it is explained that the 
experience of the last decade has compelled an 
abandonment of this view, since it has shown 
that " the potentiality of unfair attacks by the 
trusts tended to destroy the potentiality of 
competition." Hence the conclusion that the 
methods of competition used by the trusts must 
be regulated. 

The specific legislation required to carry out 
this plan of reform naturally involves a variety 
of measures calculated both to stimulate and 
to regulate competition. The protective tariff 
should not be abolished, but kept at a level such 
as will enable the independent domestic producer 
of fair efficiency to compete on reasonable terms 
with the foreign producer and yet not be 
crushed out by the domestic trust. Certain 
reforms must be made in our corporation laws, 
such as the abolition of the holding company 
and the securing of greater publicity. Railroad 
discriminations and favors must be abolished, 
and waterways kept free from railroad domi- 
nance. Our patent laws must be revised, and 
such unfair methods of competition as local 
price-cutting and factor agreements must be 
prevented. All these measures involve diffi- 
culties which the authors frankly recognize and 
freely discuss, while concluding that they will 
permit that degree of consolidation which is 
required to give efficiency and at the same time 
avoid the deadening effects of monopoly and the 
consequent necessity for price regulation. 

The general method of procedure here out- 
lined would undoubtedly meet the approval of 
the majority of economists, and is in line with 
the general trend of recent writings on the 
subject, as suggested above. Even among those 
who doubt the adequacy of the reforms, most 



460 



THE DIAL 



[June 1 



will agree that some such measures at least 
should be the first step in our plans to control 
the trusts. To the mind of the reviewer, the 
question whether these measures will prove 
sufficient is the most serious one to be raised. 
For example, they afford no means whatever 
for regulating a trust based on control of a 
natural resource. Moreover, it is assumed that 
there is no industry outside of public utilities 
where regulated monopoly can be more desir- 
able than competition. Doubtless there are not 
many such in any case, but can we fairly assume 
that there are none when we see that, so far as 
economic characteristics are concerned, it is im- 
possible to draw any hard and fast line between 
public utilities and industrial combinations? To 
some the wisdom of the tariff policy advocated 
by the authors will also appear open to ques- 
tion. If the purpose of competition be to secure 
progress and low prices, why resort to a tariff 
for the sake of protecting the independent 
domestic producer against the domestic trust, 
when to do so necessitates maintaining a higher 
level of prices and hindering the importation 
of the cheaper foreign product? Minor points 
of criticism aside, however, the general plan of 
regulated competition is certainly to be com- 
mended to the thoughtful consideration of the 
public. Whether in the long run it will prove 
adequate to cope with the problem is open to 
doubt. Perhaps another decade's experience 
will give us the answer. At any rate, this will 
be a step in the right direction. 

The volume edited by Dr. William S. Stevens 
is a collection of selected readings or "case 
material " on the question of trusts, though the 
title gives no indication of this fact. The selec- 
tions have been chosen almost entirely from 
court proceedings or from legislative and con- 
gressional investigations, the testimony in the 
recent hearings having been heavily drawn upon. 
Brief introductory notes head each chapter. 

The value of such a volume depends chiefly 
on the character of the selections chosen, and 
it may at once be said that in general this task 
has been well performed. The selections in- 
clude many things not easily obtainable else- 
where; they are up-to-date, fairly broad in 
scope, and avoid the common mistake of con- 
fusing the trust problem and the corporation 
problem. A considerable amount of unimport- 
ant material scattered through the selections 
could have been excluded without loss, and the 
omission of anything bearing on the connection 
between the tariff or the railroads and the trusts 



is to be regretted. The introductory notes, also, 
could have been expanded to great advantage. 

The editor expresses the hope that the book 
will be of service to both the college student 
and the general reader. Its value to the former 
will at once be evident, for it is distinctly su- 
perior to anything now available in its field, and 
will undoubtedly find widespread use among 
our colleges. Its value for the general reader 
is not so clear. The claim that a group of selec- 
tions will give an unbiassed view rests on the 
assumption that there is no bias in making the 
selections, and in this case the claim seems justi- 
fied by the results. Yet one is compelled to 
doubt whether a reader not already fairly famil- 
iar with the subject would appreciate the signifi- 
cance of the testimony and legal documents here 
set forth, or could obtain from them the least 
conception of the fundamental forces in the 
evolution of industrial society which are respon- 
sible for the whole movement towards industrial 
combinations. If read along with, or after, 
some general account of the trust problem, this 
volume would prove instructive, but by itself it 
is not adapted to the wants of the general reader.

INCOHERENT STUDIES ix PLAY- 
STRUCTURE.* 



A series of talks on the drama should not be 
thrown together and called a critical work ; nor 
should so badly written a book as Miss Hunt's 
be given the endorsement of the Drama League 
of America, if the League wishes to inspire 
confidence in its judgment. We might indeed 
pass over split infinitives, as well as relative and 
demonstrative pronouns ruthlessly deprived of 
antecedents ; we might even tolerate paragraph- 
ing that knows no law but the caprice of the 
writer, or connive at mixed metaphors as exhi- 
biting a cheerful idiosyncrasy on the part of 
the author of their being. But when we come 
across such flagrant violation of good English 
as "passed a very sensible remark," "keep off 
of," "romantistic," "comedic," " novelistic," 
"ideaed," "chiefest," "soliloquial," "zestful," 
"relucts," "a la Robinson Crusoe," when 
we encounter such a sentence as "As for what 
Shakespeare's tragedies would be without their 
soliloquies the imagination refuses to take so 
laborious a flight," or " It is generally conceded

that the theory of the realist, which bases his 
art on the taking of notes, etc.," then we regret 
that the critic did not first learn to write English 
before undertaking to write about plays. 

Nor is the arrangement of the material more 
satisfactory than the expression of the ideas. The 
first six chapters, comprising an introductory 
one on drama study and five on the structure of 
the play, are followed by three on separate types 
of play, the catastrophic play, the play of the 
day, and the comedy of manners. So far so 
good. But this continuity is broken by four 
chapters dealing successively with the unities, 
the soliloquy, realism, and dramatic literature, 
which have no organic relation to one another 
or to what precedes or follows. The interrupted 
discussion of the kinds of plays is now, however, 
resumed with a treatment of the purpose play, 
the pieced-out play, and the static play, only to 
be again broken in upon by two chapters on 
acting scenery and British and American En- 
glish, and to be finally taken up in a chapter 
on the play for children. 

Nevertheless the book should be in many ways 
useful to the layman who would know more of 
the drama than he can learn from newspaper 
notices of current theatrical productions. Espe- 
cially useful are the chapters dealing with the 
structure of the play and the several types of 
drama presented on the modern stage. Less 
satisfactory is the discussion of dramatic conven- 
tions and principles. The unities are dismissed 
after a perfunctory consideration of the unity 
of action in "The Servant in the House." In 
the treatment of the soliloquy we are told that 
we learn about a character by "indirect vision," 
that is, "as he is reflected in the minds [sic] 
of every other person on the stage"; as if that 
were sufficient, or as if the soliloquy were an en- 
tirely discarded convention. How much should 
we learn of Hamlet or lago by indirect vision 
or what takes the place in the modern drama 
of this self-revelation given in the soliloquy of 
the Shakespearean play? Must the inscrutable 
character, whom indirect vision fails to reveal, 
disappear from the stage, or must the audience 
remain in the dark along with the other char- 
acters in the play? This chapter does not say. 

A chapter on realism would necessarily attract 
the attention of anyone distracted by the jarring 
cries of realist and romanticist; here he might 
hope for a solution he could understand, or at 
least a presentation of the problem which would 
help to determine his own judgment. But what 
does he learn? As a sort of topic sentence he 
sees the properly italicized legend, like an 



advertisement of a prosperous tailoring estab- 
lishment, "The realist knows how." For, 
first, "he respects human beings and real life 
with a profound feeling of the creative artist for 
his material" and "he is content to study his 
material with the sole aim of understanding it." 
Again, "his deeply artistic regard for human 
nature forces him to base his art on observation 
on the more or less literal taking of notes 
and on that alone." "The realist's art, then, 
begins by exteriorizing and ends with a revela- 
tion of the innermost nature." All of which 
sounds very familiar, and is true of all high art 
whether modern or ancient, realistic or romantic. 
When Miss Hunt comes to the romanticist 
and she does so with a manifest bias against 
him she is not so clear. His philosophy of 
art, she says, " seems to be based on a curious 
combination of experience and imagination," 
according to which the artist gets inside his char- 
acters and feels with them ; in other words, the 
romanticist is purely subjective and his char- 
acters move only as he directs. On the other 
hand, the characters of the realist "get out of 
his control so that they fairly make things hap- 
pen." It is unfortunate that Miss Hunt did not 
see fit to illustrate her point here by citing ro- 
mantic writers and their works to the bar, though 
she did summon several realists. Who are these 
romantic writers whose creatures are mere pup- 
pets, the products of imagination and sympathy ? 
Are they Browning and Byron and all who have 
failed in the drama ? Is Shakespeare a realist, 
along with Ibsen and Mr. Galsworthy? For 
surely he is not a romanticist according to the 
definition. The seeker for knowledge would 
like to know. 

We defy anyone to gather what is meant by 
dramatic literature from the chapter headed 
" What Is Dramatic Literature?" Mr. Barrie's 
two plays, "The Admirable Crichton" and 
" What Every Woman Knows," are chosen as 
types, and one of the features especially com- 
mended as literature? is the pantomimic 
scenes ! At the end of a chapter we still ask the 
question. One of the plays discussed under the 
head of "The Play for Children" is Rostand's 
" Chantecler " ! Such critical acumen leads one 
back to the words quoted, on the wrapper of the 
volume, from the remarks of "a Professor in 
the University of Chicago" that "what is most 
needed is a book on play building that is safe 
and sound." These words still hold true, Miss 
Hunt and her publishers to the contrary not- 
withstanding.

THE DIAL 



[June 1 



RECENT FICTION.* 

The author of "A Man's World" has given us, 
in "Comrade Yetta," a second realistic and deeply 
sympathetic study of the stratum of human life which 
is best known to the social settlements and the police 
courts the life of the proletariat struggling for the 
means of a decent human existence. Comrade Yetta 
is a Jewish girl, who has imbibed idealism from her 
father's teachings, and who, when thrown on the 
world by his death, finds the sweat-shop the only 
means of livelihood open to her. How she escapes 
from the hell of this existence, how she is tempted 
and just escapes from falling, and how she becomes 
an important factor in the trade-union activities of 
the East Side and a helpful worker in the socialist 
cause, are told with vivid truth in the pages of this 
transcript of actual life which we hesitate to call a 
novel. Fully to appreciate this work of Mr. Edwards, 
one must share its bias, for it presents only one aspect 
of the terrible problem of poverty. It takes for 
granted, as beyond any possible argument, the justi- 
fiability of strikes, and picketing, and the organi- 
zation of underpaid labor. It is frankly committed 
to the socialist theory of society, and makes an elo- 
quent plea for the socialist remedies. Conceding this 
bias, it is a deeply moving human story, incisive in its 
characterizations, and comparatively free from the 
maudlin sentiment with which many writers who have 
the author's viewpoint beslobber their work. Implicit 
in every line is a caustic criticism of the social order 
such as only one who has seen it eye to eye could 
have written. Mr. Edwards achieves his effects by 
sympathetic portrayal rather than by pumped-up 
rhetoric, and therein is the secret of his power. 

The " Running Sands " of Mr. Reginald Wright 
Kauff man's novel are the sands of life the life of 
a bachelor of fifty who, possessed of a fortune won 
by hard labor in the West, goes to New York to

eighteen. The moral seems to be that a man should 
not let his love be so much younger than himself, 
and that such an ill-assorted union is sure to bring 
disaster. It certainly does prove disastrous in the 
present case, but mainly because the girl is capricious 
beyond the average of her sex, and also because she 
shrinks from the normal obligations of wifehood. If 
it were merely that a young lover appears upon the 
scene, awakening her undeveloped nature, we should 
have a replica of the situation that has formed the 
theme of a thousand novels, and should find our sym- 
pathies enlisted on behalf of the paramount claims 
of triumphant and arrogant youth, with perhaps a 
tear of pity for the sorrow of the lover of advanced 
age. But in this case, the girl takes time to know 
her own mind before committing herself to marriage, 
and then acts in a way that completely alienates 
our sympathies. She avoids maternity by criminal 
means, and Mr. Kauffman, as we know, does not 
mince matters when he deals with subjects that 
demand a decent reticence. It is a tragedy, no doubt, 
but a tragedy not resulting, as the author would have 
us think, from the situation, but rather from the 
undisciplined character of the young woman. So it 
seems to us well, on the whole, that in the end she 
fails to accomplish her selfish purpose, and is forced 
to continue in what is at least the semblance of the 
relation which society has sanctioned. 

Mr. Booth Tarkington should have found for his 
latest novel some title having a less innocent conno- 
tation than " The Flirt." This word suggests the 
playfulness of comedy, whereas the woman whom 
it here designates is a person of such hardened 
selfishness and instinctive depravity that her conduct 
takes toll of human lives, having its outcome not in 
sentimental sorrows but in tragedy. We are not 
prepared for this in the beginning, for Cora Madison 
first attracts us by her exhibition of the amusing 
wiles of the coquette, and it is only later that her 
meanness and wickedness are disclosed. The thirteen- 
year-old brother whom she calls the Pest is an 
affliction that she fully deserves, and if his ingenuity 
for malicious mischief had taken her for its sole 
victim, we should feel almost kindly toward him. 
The Madisons live in a small inland town, and Cora 
is adored by all the men of her acquaintance. They 
feed out of her hand, and, being a poor-spirited lot, 
meekly endure whatever insults and affronts she 
pleases to bestow upon them. When a fascinating 
stranger (the returned native) appears upon the 
scene, she makes a dead set at him, and it is some 
satisfaction to realize that he is an adventurer noto- 
rious in Europe as a gambler and confidence man. 
He has a scheme for promoting an oil field in the 
Basilicata, and gets Cora to persuade her friends to 
invest their money in the enterprise. When his 
rascality is eventually disclosed, Cora first learns 
the meaning of defeat, but even then she suffers not 
so much from remorse as from wounded vanity. 
Hastening to one of the poor-spirited lovers whom 
she has rejected, she offers herself to him on condi- 
tion that he marry her at once and take her away

for a long wedding journey. Since he accepts the 
offer with enthusiasm, he probably gets about what 
he deserves. Another of the suitors shoots the ex- 
posed adventurer, and then himself, thus partly 
clearing the stage. A more unconvincing piece of 
fiction we have not often read; or one in which the 
characters have been more puppet-like and the 
action more mechanical. 

In "The Road of Living Men," Mr. Will Lev- 
ington Comfort's fourth novel, the author returns to 
the manner of " Routledge Rides Alone," having 
jettisoned a large part of the cargo of turgid rhet- 
oric and amorphous philosophizing with which his 
later books have been overfreighted. He still speaks 
at times with the voice of the mystic, and the robes 
of the prophet still trail about him, but on the whole 
he has written another straightforward story of ad- 
venture, and made it a transcript of external rather 
than of internal experience. It all begins at Oporto, 
where the boy Thomas Ryerson first meets the girl 
Mary Romany. Both are children, but both have 
the sense of being linked together by destiny. After 
this prelude, the story is told in three sections, the 
scenes being China, Long Island, and Ecuador, 
respectively. Mary is the daughter of a mining 
prospector whose operations take him to China just 
before the rising of the Boxers. Here we have a 
vivid account of the beginning of that rebellion, and 
of the heroine's rescue by Ryerson. The Long 
Island section is an idyllic episode of love-making 
between the two. The South American section 
again gives us a story of wild adventure, for the pro- 
spector is working a concession in Ecuador, and has 
to get the better of the warring factions of the repub- 
lic as well as of his own mutinous followers. Here 
Ryerson joins him, and they succeed, contending 
against almost insuperable obstacles, in running 
out the accumulated gold. This gives the narrative 
that whirlwind finish which is one of Mr. Comfort's 
specialties. Like its predecessors, this novel is largely 
a paean in praise of woman, and of her potency 
as a factor in the spiritual development of man. 
Mr. Comfort makes himself the prophet of woman- 
kind as an Egerian influence, and all the unlovely 
current manifestations of the feminist movement 
seem not to have shaken one whit his faith in her 
divine mission. It is a joy to encounter such whole- 
hearted romantic idealism as he sets before us in 
an age when the chief literary currents are setting 
toward a sordid realism or a grotesque distortion of 
the truth of life. He gives us to understand that 
the book was written in response to the plea of a 
friend who wrote : " Do us just a story a story so 
sheer and calling, that one by one we shall steal 
away from the world's company, as if we heard our 
lover's whistle out among the trees ; steal away and 
follow on and on, entranced, expectant, fresh-eyed 
as children; just for once put away reforms and im- 
pressiveness ; do not remind us this once that we 
are going full tilt in directions damnable." And so 
on. It is a little gushing, but it helps us to under- 
stand the spirit in which the story is told. 



Mr. How ells would, we imagine, be the last person 
in the world to suppose that, in " New Leaf Mills," 
he had produced a work in any way comparable with 
his own masterpieces. But, slight as the new story 
is, it has all the charm of his inimitable style, and 
exhales all the sweetness of the personality which 
has made him the most beloved of our men of let- 
ters. He has simply gone back to the time of his 
Ohio boyhood sixty years ago, and fished out of his 
recollections the materials for a picture of the way 
in which simple people then lived on what was then 
the western fringe of our civilization. He tells the 
story of Owen Powell and his family, who finds it 
hard to make a living in town, buys an old mill in 
the country, with the aim of establishing a coop- 
erative community of the type which then hovered 
before men's minds as likely to furnish the solution 
of the social problem. He wishes to turn over a 
new leaf, and this suggests a name for the enterprise. 
The plan is given up in the end, and not very much 
happens in between there is a house-raising, and 
a surly miller who resents the intrusion of the new 
owner, and a hired girl who mysteriously disap- 
pears, and that is about all, except a great deal of 
talk, tinctured with Swedenborgianism, which is 
Owen Powell's spiritual stay in all his reverses. It 
is a book which helps us to understand our forbears 
of a generation or two ago, and is an undeniably 
veracious transcript of their life. 

Mr. Stephen French Whitman gave us a year or 
so ago, in " Predestined," an unusually human and 
appealing first novel. His second novel, " The Isle 
of Dreams," is less convincing, partly because he has 
made it of less familiar material, and partly because 
he has attempted to indulge in fine writing. The 
story opens in Rome, and the first half of it consists 
of the sort of sophisticated conversation which Mr. 
R. W. Chambers reels off by the mile, and which 
bears no relation to the intercourse of men and 
women in real life. Then, all at once, something 
happens. A novelist, who has the reputation of being 
a godless scoffer and a man of unclean life, meets 
an American beauty, whom he wooes tempestuously, 
being repulsed for his pains. Finding himself in 
her company on a steamship, he lures her to the 
ship's side, clasps her in his arms, and jumps over- 
board with her. They are rescued, and landed on 
a small island somewhere near Naples, whereupon 
he instals the disdainful maiden in a deserted villa. 
Presently the cholera breaks out on the island, and 
the simple fisher- folk who inhabit it seek to mob the 
visitor as the magician who has brought this evil 
upon them. Whereupon he develops heroic quali- 
ties. Holding the mob at bay, he persuades them 
to disperse, and then applies himself heart and soul 
to the eradication of the plague. The hatred and 
suspicion of the islanders become changed to devo- 
tion as they witness his unstinted labors in their be- 
half, and he even wins the blessing of the Camorrist 
chief who comes from Naples expressly to kill him. 
As for the woman, she clearly would be no heroine 
of romance if she could resist such a hero, and her 



464 



THE 



surrender is inevitable. When her scandalized 
friends at last come to her aid, they find her curi- 
ously indifferent about being rescued. It must be 
said that the story, as a story, turns out to be much 
better than the opening chapters have led us to 
anticipate. 

A delightfully whimsical story of the " Button, 
button, who 's got the button ? " type is offered in 
" The Bishop's Purse," by Mr. Oliver Herford and 
Mr. Cleveland Moffett. A charming young woman, 
who is also a skilled pickpocket, steals a purse con- 
taining five thousand pounds, and afterwards, grown 
remorseful, seeks to restore it to its owner. But the 
purse does not stay in the same place, and the pur- 
suit grows complicated. We follow with breathless 
interest the search for it in its successive hiding- 
places, and all the while we are rather hoping that 
the engaging young woman will " get away with the 
goods " for such is the immoral effect to which 
a story of this type stirs our sympathies. The 
book is by turns detective story, melodrama, and 
love romance, and in each aspect is particularly 
entertaining. It even provides studies of character 
that are artistically worth while, which is more than 
one expects from a light-hearted invention of this 
sort. 

"The Heart of the Hills" is just the sort of 
novel Mr. John Fox has taught us to expect. There 
is a Kentucky mountain boy with a thirst for 
knowledge who makes considerable of a man of him- 
self. There is also a mountain girl whose language 
is not what it might be, but who gropes her way to 
refinement and the cultivation of gentle instincts. 
These two are predestined for each other, although 
for a time it seems as if their fates lay in another 
direction. For, contrasted with them, yet very 
closely linked by circumstance, are two patrician 
children, a boy and a girl. It is only when the 
final mating comes that elective affinity achieves its 
deep purpose, and caste has the deciding vote. All 
the way through the novel runs the feud between 
the Hawns and the Honeycutts, and their relation- 
ships are so confused that we are often perplexed to 
know which is which. Two matters of historical 
interest are ingeniously worked into the narrative 
the terrorism of the night riders in the tobacco 
war, and the political struggle that had its dramatic 
climax in the assassination of Goebel. Mr. Fox 
seems to be only at his second best in this book, 
which means, no doubt, that he has worked out his 
richest veins, and has to fall back upon tailings. 
The story would be striking enough if we were not 
all the time forced to contrast it with its prede- 
cessors. 

"The Fifth Trumpet" is a second novel by Mr. 
Paul Bertram, the author of that sterling historical 
romance, "The Shadow of Power." The scene is 
Constance, the year 1418, when the Council is in 
session, and the friends of the Church are earnestly 
working for its reform from within. The novel gives 
a strong and vivid description of the ecclesiastical 
corruption then prevalent, when avarice and licen- 



tiousness ruled in the seats of the mighty, and when 
timorous souls guarded their speech lest the strong 
arm of authority should deal with them as heretics. 
The leading character is the town clerk, an austere 
and indignant puritan, who endangers himself by his 
rash utterances, and who finally comes under the ban 
for his murder of a sensual beast whose frock does 
not save him from this righteous retribution. In 
the end he is saved, through the efforts of an adven- 
turess of light morals whom he has scorned, but 
whose life has a nobler side which is revealed to 
him in his time of trial. "Magnus Stein had at last 
found a human being worthy of the name one who 
had sinned and erred, but had never done anything 
mean or small, one who had suffered the deadliest 
offence and given all for the offender, who had 
triumphed over all the lesser instincts of our nature 
and risen to true greatness through her love, and 
who, if she had erred up to the last, had with that 
sin purchased her pardon." And so, at last, these 
two take their leave of Constance, the woman's soul 
softened and purified by love, the man's sympathies 
deepened by the revelation of her essential character. 
It makes a fine historical study and a beautiful ro- 
mance, reminding us in many ways of "The Cloister 
and the Hearth," which is the supreme masterpiece 
in this kind. 

It is, on the whole, rather more of a compli- 
ment than the reverse to say of Mr. Farnol's "An 
Amateur Gentleman" that it is "The Broad High- 
way " over again. For who else among our purvey- 
ors of romantic entertainment could have matched 
that delightful performance? Surely we do not 
often find ourselves in better company than that 
of Barnabas Barty, whose father John, sometime 
Champion of England, is landlord of a country inn. 
When Barnabas, learning that he is heir to the for- 
tune of a half-forgotten uncle, announces his inten- 
tion of going to London and becoming a gentleman, 
he encounters his father's objections, and straight- 
way proves his quality by knocking him down in a 
friendly passage of fists. Thus do his adventures 
begin, and they are continued on the road and in 
the streets of the great city. They are numerous 
and surprising surprisingly numerous, we ought 
to say and they are such as befits a hero of 
Barnabas's brawn and disposition. It would be a 
serious task even to count the occasions upon which 
he finds himself in dangerous straits, and clears 
himself by pluck, not unaided, however, by the 
extraordinary luck which attends his footsteps. It 
is the London of the Regency to which his path is 
directed, and he swaggers with the best in that 
society of sporting bucks and beaus. Everything 
comes his way, including the fair and aristocratic 
Cleone, whom he wins from many rivals by his 
prowess and gentleness, and whose love is so strongly 
cemented that it is proof against the revelation 
(which is made in due time) of his plebeian birth. 
There are characters in these pages that might 
have stepped out of Dickens and Thackeray, and 
a wholly satisfying romantic complication that is

lacking in no essential element of interest, and that 
is worked out in the highest of spirits. 

The hand of Mrs. Ward seems to have lost none 
of its cunning, and, in "The Mating of Lydia," 
she has again made a surprisingly good story out of 
comparatively simple materials. It is good not 
only as to texture and finish of detail, but also as to 
the elaboration of its plot, which rises steadily to a 
climax of absorbing interest. The scene is some- 
where in the Lake 'District, where is situated the 
gloomy castle to which Edmund Melrose, at the 
opening of the story, brings home his young Italian 
wife and their child. Melrose, who is a man of 
immense wealth, is a collector of antiques and objets 
d'art, and the castle is filled with the packing cases 
that have preceded his arrival. His passion as a 
collector is such that he is unwilling to provide his 
wife with the simplest comforts, for which reason 
she one day takes secret flight, with her going the 
child and a valuable bronze Hermes much treasured 
by her husband. To him, it is a good riddance 
(save for the Hermes), and he takes no steps in the 
matter, beyond providing a miserable pittance for 
the woman's support in Italy. Being excessively 
penurious in all matters wherein art is not concerned, 
Melrose neglects his tenants until the condition of 
their cottages becomes a scandal to the whole 
countryside. One day, a young man named Faver- 
sliam is bicycling in the neighborhood, and has a 
bad accident, making it necessary to instal him 
in the castle, which is the nearest human abode. 
Melrose fumes about the intrusion, but becomes 
reconciled to it when he discovers that Faversham 
is the owner of certain rare gems. The young man 
remains under Melrose's roof, is given every atten- 
tion until he recovers, and is then surprised by an 
offer from Melrose to make him his secretary and 
agent at a very large salary. He accepts, and is 
presently informed that he has been made his em- 
ployer's sole heir. He hopes, as agent for the estate, 
to be able to secure decent conditions for the tenants, 
but in this he is thwarted by Melrose's obstinacy. 
Here arises the moral issue which the author needs 
to keep her conscience clear. Shall Faversham re- 
main, accomplishing what limited good he can, and 
all the time looking forward to the opportunities to 
be given him later, by full possession, or shall he 
renounce his prospects, and refuse to act as the 
agent of so unnatural a landlord. When Melrose's 
wife and child turn up, after the desertion of twenty 
years previous, the problem becomes still more 
complicated, for in accepting the heirship, Faver- 
sham will be dispossessing those to whom the estate 
would otherwise go. He is lured, and wavers, and 
then, when Melrose has died and left him the law- 
ful owner, makes the great renunciation, thereby 
winning instead the love of the young woman who 
has made his action in this matter the final search- 
ing test of his character. In her view, the money 
in his possession would be doubly tainted, because 
of the neglected villages, and because of claims of 
wife and child to the inheritance. Mrs. Ward makes 



too much of this latter point, for surely no man is 
morally or otherwise bound to leave all his wealth 
to wife and children, while as for the other point, 
there is much to be said for Faversham's temporiz- 
ing position in consideration of his generous inten- 
tions for the future. At any rate, there is the problem, 
and Mrs. Ward clearly thinks that both arguments 
against his heirship are morally valid. As for Lydia, 
a nice girl who paints amateurish pictures, the 
problem of her "mating" is the choice between 
Faversham and young Lord Tatham, and we should 
have been quite as well satisfied had it fallen upon 
the latter. He, however, gets the Melrose heiress 
as a consolation prize, and his heart does not seem 
to be damaged by this substitution of a new object 
of his affections for the old one. 

" The Combined Maze," by Miss May Sinclair, 
is a novel similar in general theme to Mr. Alfred 
Ollivant's " The Royal Road." In other words, it 
tells the harrowing story of a London clerk, who 
saddles himself with wife, children, and a house on 
the instalment plan, with no better excuse than is 
offered by wages of about a hundred pounds a year. 
It is made more harrowing by the fact that the clerk 
marries the wrong girl, a wanton creature who de- 
velops slatternly habits and finally runs away with 
another man. All the while, the girl he should have 
married is near at hand, but even when he might be 
free to make a home for her, he is prevented by the 
cost of getting a divorce from his faithless wife. 
When at last he has scraped together the needed 
amount, the wife reappears, herself deserted, and his 
hopes of happiness are again blighted. Miss Sin- 
clair's portraiture is vivid and convincing, at least 
as to her principal characters. The title of the book 
is taken from a figure in the hero's polytechnic gym- 
nasium a marching figure in which boys and girls 
make complicated designs in the course of their evo- 
lutions. It is not a happy title, because it has to be 
unduly stretched to become a symbol of the maze 
of life- WILLIAM MOBTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The great dearth of English books 
descriptive of Austria is quite re- 
markable. Mr. Briliant, in his bib- 
liographical list on Austria in the "Encyclopaedia 
Britannica," does not refer to a single book in En- 
glish. Some will perhaps regard this dearth as a 
sad reflection on the English-speaking world in so 
far as it shows our extreme indifference to one of 
the most important countries of Europe. Mr. James 
Baker, novelist and traveller, now essays to supply 
a presumably increasing demand with his work on 
"Austria: Her People and Their Homelands" 
(Lane). To begin with the worst that can be said 
of it, the book is wretchedly written, and the pub- 
lishers are not to be congratulated on putting out in 
this form a work which needed to be touched up 
in grammar, spelling, and style in countless spots.

THE DIAL, 



[June 1 



There are errors which would make a bright school- 
boy shudder. Some slips are obviously due to care- 
lessness, as when the author speaks of Riva as " the 
south-eastern outpost of Austria." The writer has 
made apparently no attempt to render uniformly 
and correctly the Slavic names, and serenely writes 
"Cech," "Palacky," "Sevcik," "Dvorak" (though 
the last is correctly given on p. 6) . Even the Ger- 
man names are inconsistently printed ; thus on p. 47 
we find both Olmiitz and Olmutz, but generally the 
umlaut marks are ignored. In spite of these very 
serious blemishes, however, there is in the book much 
that is good. The author has a pleasant chatty style 
which makes easy reading. He knows his subject 
thoroughly, having travelled in Austria much for 
a period of forty years, and makes a very sensible 
choice of material. He has a good eye for the pic- 
turesque, and in general is scrupulously careful about 
color-words. We wish he had had more space for 
some of the legends to which he rather tantalizingly 
refers; for we doubt if many of these legends are 
easily accessible elsewhere. Considered absolutely, 
too, the book gives far too little space to Vienna; 
possibly, however, the author deliberately chose thus 
to save some space for the less known parts of this 
wonderful country. The great Oesterreich indeed 
is deserving of being more widely known. It is 
full of magnificent scenery; it possesses interesting 
relics of a most interesting and significant past, both 
in its picturesque castles and in its superb museums ; 
it is a hive of industry of every kind, from the simple, 
primitive labor of the peasants to the large manu- 
factories of the centres of trade. Moreover, it should 
be of special interest to Americans because of the 
racial rivalries so noticeable in many parts of the 
country. Concerning these, by the way, Mr. Baker 
is decidedly optimistic ; he regards it as " really an 
immense power, for the keen emulation and the 
struggle for supremacy has enforced advancement 
on all lines." Finally, we have much to learn from 
Austria about education. Fancy in any American 
school a well organized course for hotel-keepers and 
waiters; yet this is precisely what we find at the 
Innsbruck Handelsakademie. On other matters, 
too, e.g., the relations between labor and culture, 
Austria has much for us to learn. Mr. Baker's 
book may well serve to arouse interest in this won- 
derful old-new country. We must, finally, grumble 
a little about the illustrations in water color, by Mr. 
Donald Maxwell. Some of them are beautiful ; yet 
for the special purpose of the book, we are phil- 
istine enough to think that well-selected photographs 
would have served far better. 



President l n the brief and modest preface to 

S^i "The New Freedom " (Doubleday), 

credo. President Wilson informs us that the 

book was put together by Mr. William Bayard Hale, 
who grouped "in their right sequences the more 
suggestive portions of my campaign speeches. . . . 
I have left the sentences in the form in which they 



were stenographically reported. I have not tried 
to alter the easy-going and often colloquial phrase- 
ology in which they were uttered from the platform, 
in the hope that they would seem the more fresh and 
spontaneous because of their very lack of pruning 
and recasting." The reader may feel some mis- 
giving as to the wisdom of this plan while reading 
the first address, " The Old Order Changeth," which 
is somewhat general and abstract and shows no 
marked clearness or vigor; but as one reads on 
through succeeding chapters "What is Progress?" 
"Freemen Need No Guardians," "Life Comes 
from the Soil," and the whole series of twelve 
addresses, concluding with "The Liberation of a 
People's Vital Energies," one becomes more and 
more convinced that President Wilson judged 
wisely in retaining the colloquial tone and oral 
ring of his original style. The tense conviction on 
fundamental problems of our national life, the 
broad and deep sympathy with all the people, the 
splendid enthusiasm for liberty and the free play 
of human forces these characteristics of Presi- 
dent Wilson are fittingly perpetuated in the lan- 
guage of a leader addressing great audiences of 
American people. One's satisfaction with the style 
of the book is confirmed by the reiteration of favorite 
principles from time to time in the various speeches 
in a manner scarcely suited to formal written prose, 
but entirely in keeping with the requirements of oral 
expression, and serving to impress deeply upon the 
mind of the reader the chief tenets of the Presi- 
dent's political creed and to suggest vividly the liv- 
ing voice addressing great audiences of men and 
women. Moreover, the enthusiasm of the public 
leader, so fittingly preserved in this oral style, 
grows to an ever deeper note and more vibrant 
ring from the beginning to the end of the volume, 
so that the effect of the whole series of addresses is 
assimilated to that of one long and noble oration, 
rising from sober initial statements through forceful 
and convincing argument to a climax of rhetorical 
and even poetic beauty and power. The style, 
however, is not the main thing in these addresses. 
The main things are, first, the man rational, 
self-restrained, yet fired with indignation against 
abuses in the government of the great Republic in 
which he ardently believes; and, secondly, the 
simple and ancient principles, few and plain, to 
which he recalls his people. With all his scholar- 
ship and restraint, both of which stamp these 
speeches, President Wilson as he appears in the 
addresses blends a portion of the spirit of the 
Hebrew prophets with that of Abraham Lincoln. 
He has something of Isaiah's confidence in Jehovah 
and loyalty to Him with much of Lincoln's trust in 
the plain people. No shallow optimism and no 
barren pessimism appear in these speeches, but a 
profoundly serious tone of warning and a jubilant 
appeal. They constitute for the people a sort of 
proclamation of emancipation from the rule of 
special interests.

Mr. Clarence M. Weed, whose sum- 
rT m ? r farm at Ellsworth, New Hamp- 

shire, affords him excellent oppor- 
tunity for the study of New England plant and insect 
life, and who has travelled observantly in other parts 
of our broad land, contributes an unusually attractive 
and well-written as well as soundly-instructive vol- 
ume to the literature of the woods and fields and of 
the abundant objects of interest there to be found. 
"Seeing Nature First" (Lippincott) begins with a 
preface in which it is contended that an acquaint- 
ance with the flora and fauna of one's own country 
" not only opens up new fields of thought and effort 
at home, but also gives the best sort of preparation 
for travel abroad." The nature- studies presented 
in the succeeding chapters are grouped chronolog- 
ically under the four seasons of the year, beginning 
with spring, and are about equally divided between 
plant-life and insect-life. As an instance of the 
author's carefulness of observation, the following 
passage on the closed gentian may be quoted: 
"The flowers are completely closed, a fact which 
led John Burroughs in one of his delightful essays 
to suggest that it does not receive insect visitors. 
But the worker bumblebees could tell you better, 
for they have learned how to pry open the mouth 
of the blossom and enter for the nectar at its base, 
where they circle around the flower in a way to 
come in contact with both stamens and pistil. And 
they also can tell from the color of the blossom 
whether it is young and nectar-bearing." But how 
can one be sure that it is the color and not some 
other sign, perceptible perhaps only to insect sense, 
that guides the bee to the nectar-bearing blos- 
soms? Useful to New Englanders are the pages 
devoted to the gypsy and the brown-tail moths, 
those pests that have lately cost the tax- payer so 
many thousands of dollars. The story of Leopold 
Trouvelet and his unfortunate attempt to produce 
silk from gypsy-moth culture at Medford, Massa- 
chusetts whence sprang an Iliad of woes might 
appropriately have found a place in Mr. Weed's 
account of the pest as a recent importation from 
Europe. Numerous and excellent illustrations 
(two in color), from photographs and from drawings 
by Mr. W. I. Beecroft, enrich the volume, which 
could be made still more useful, in any subsequent 
issue, by the addition of an index. 

The " Tenth ^ * 8 nai> dly possible to say anything

island home. lyricg; but it was a happy tnought 

of Dr. Mary Mills Patrick, President of Constanti- 
nople College, "to reproduce the famous poetess in 
the picturesque island of Lesbos." The chapter on 
Mitylene is wholly delightful; and the author is 
to be envied for her charming experiences among 
scenes where " one hears the name of Sappho spoken 
on every hand, both in reference to the poet, of 
whom all the island is still proud, and to her name- 
sakes, of whom there are so many that it is perhaps 
not too much to say that there is one in every 



family." Other chapters treat of the age, life, and 
work of Sappho; and the eighth contains a good 
translation of the fragments, including those re- 
cently discovered in Egypt. Throughout the book 
Dr. Patrick's treatment is colored by a roseate 
optimism that excites admiration and envy, even 
when one is compelled to question or deny. This 
virtue, or defect, is seen particularly in her insistence 
that Sappho's poetry is to be interpreted as the work 
of an absolutely impeccable model of propriety, 
the irreproachable headmistress of an Academy of 
Music and Poetry, where the gentlest and sweetest 
of Greek maidens were trained to tread the shining 
paths of serene culture and pious purity. This view 
represents an idealising development of Welcker's 
belief, announced about a century ago, and is 
supported by the weighty name of Von Ulrich 
von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, assuredly one of the 
greatest authorities of the century. But the re- 
viewer is unchivalrously skeptical. It is dangerous 
to read a fine Lutheran sense of chastity, or a lofty 
New England Puritanism, into the erotic poetry of 
Greece written during the seventh and sixth cen- 
turies before our era; and the judgment of classical 
antiquity about the Lesbian nightingale was strik- 
ingly unanimous on the other side. However, the 
lyrics themselves are the important thing ; and as 
to their merits the world of letters is absolutely at 
one. Among the twenty-six illustrations that form 
a valuable feature of the book are included many 
antique representations of Sappho; but even from 
this excellent collection the reader will turn away 
with the feeling that he has gained no clearer pic- 
ture of her features than he might make for himself 
from her own verses and the olden tales of her 
charm and beauty. The volume is legibly printed, 
simply and pleasingly bound, and tastefully pre- 
sented in general. (Houghton Mifflin Co.) 

Anglo-Saxon Ever since the prophetic utterance 
control of of William H. Seward, in the middle 

the Pacific. O f tne i ast century, thoughtful pub- 

licists have pondered over the future of the Pacific. 
One of the latest of these is Mr. Frank Fox, news 
editor of the London " Morning Post," whose 
" Problems of the Pacific" (Small, Maynard & Co.) 
indicates the great questions which are soon to arise 
in this region and also endeavors to point out their 
solution. It is his belief that " on the bosom of the 
Pacific will be decided, in peace or in war, the next 
great struggle of civilization, which will give as its 
pi-ize the supremacy of the world. Shall it go to 
the White Race or the Yellow Race? If to the 
White Race, will it be under the British flag or the 
flag of the United States, or of some other nation? 
That is the problem of the Pacific." In the effort 
to solve this problem he studies in turn, in sketchy 
fashion, all the countries which lie about this great 
ocean. And in other chapters he compares their 
armies and navies, and comments on their industrial 
position. His final conclusion is " that friendly 
cooperation between the United States and Great

Britain would give to the Anglo-Saxon race the 
mastery of the world's greatest ocean, laying for 
ever the fear of the Yellow Peril, securing for the 
world that its greatest readjustment of the balance 
of power shall be effected in peace : but that rivalry 
between these two kindred nations may cause the 
greatest evils, and possibly irreparable disasters." 
This conclusion is very gratifying to Anglo-Saxons, 
yet it cannot be said that Mr. Fox has argued his 
case as convincingly as might be demanded. Per- 
haps the limits of the volume precluded this. Nor 
is the necessity for the " mastery " of the Pacific 
made clear. To-day no nation seems to be "master," 
and yet commerce thrives and peace prevails. Only 
the other day an American professor demonstrated, 
to his own satisfaction at least, that the cooperation 
of the United States and Japan would " prevent any 
intruders from disturbing the balance of power in 
the Pacific." And a fairly good brief might be held 
for China, provided the hour of achievement were 
set sufficiently in the future. It is a great pity that 
Mr. Fox's volume, which is so readable throughout, 
suffers from an unusual number of errors in the 
statement of facts, some thirty-five having been 
noticed by the present reviewer. 

A Yankee in London of a century ago, as seen by 
England in the a young Bostonian of alert observa- 
summer of 1815. ^j on an( j no inconsiderable powers of 
vivid description, is presented in the travel-journal 
of Joseph Ballard, now first published, in a limited 
edition, by the Houghton Mifflin Company. Other 
parts of England were also visited by Ballard, as is 
noted on the title-page, as follows : " England in 
1815, as Seen by a Young Boston Merchant : Being 
the Reflections and Comments of Joseph Ballard 
on a Trip through Great Britain in the Year of 
Waterloo." Liverpool, where he landed, Manchester, 
Leeds, Birmingham, Stratford-on-Avon, Woodstock, 
Chester, and a few places in Wales, were included 
in his itinerary. Ingenuous and amusing are many of 
the comments of the diarist, who was but twenty-six 
years old on this his first visit to Europe. He speaks 
of the "most magnificent and sublime sight" of hun- 
dreds of " black fish " sporting in the waves and 
resembling a drove of hogs evidently porpoises. 
A steam engine at Leeds, drawing a train of loaded 
coal-cars, naturally interested him. A stage-coach 
journey from London to Leeds, at the rate of eight 
and one-third . miles an hour, is described as per- 
formed "with almost incredible swiftness" "a 
velocity with which I desire never to travel again." 
The report of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo made 
London " one continual scene of uproar and joy." 
A call upon the American Minister, John Quincy 
Adams, "meanly lodged" in Harley Street, affords 
matter for description and comment. Manners and 
customs are everywhere noted with an observant eye 
for the novel and the characteristic. Theatres, public 
buildings, glimpses of royalty, ceremonial functions 
all ihete and other topics likely to find a place in 
wide-awake young Yankee's journal in such cir- 



cumstances contribute to the varied interest of his 
pages. A descendant of Ballard, Mr. Joseph Ballard 
Crocker, supplies useful footnotes and a biographical 
introduction to the book. 



A hittorv With the appearance of the fourth 

of Oreek and final volume of Theodor Gom- 

phiiosophv. perz ' s "Greek Thinkers: A History 
of Ancient Philosophy " ( Scribner) comes the news 
of the death of the author, which occurred just after 
he had corrected the final proofs of the English 
translation of this volume made by Mr. G. G. Berry 
of Oxford. The original design of the work was to 
provide a history of Greek thought, from its begin- 
nings in the work of the nature-philosophers of Ionia, 
down to the beginning of the Christian era. But as 
the work progressed the author saw that this plan 
was impossible, and so restricted his design to the 
end of the first quarter of the third century before 
Christ, the epoch, that is to say, when the develop- 
ment of the sciences reached a point where they could 
no longer be laid tributary by a single thinker to a 
systematic philosophy. The matter thus crowded 
out of the present work, dealing with Stoicism, Epi- 
cureanism, and Skepticism, the author had hoped 
to cover in another book to be entitled " The Phil- 
osophy of the Hellenistic Age," but on which he had 
made no progress at the time of his death. The loss 
of such a work is most regrettable, for Gomperz's 
history will be especially prized by the reader who 
wants a more detailed treatment of ancient philos- 
ophy than can be given in any of the single-volume 
histories such as Windelband's, and yet at the same 
time wishes to have a treatment less technical in 
design and more literary in finish and from a later 
viewpoint than some of the German classic treat- 
ments. The present volume of Gomperz's work 
is given over for the most part to the thought of 
Aristotle, only the final five out of forty-three chap- 
ters being devoted to his successors, Theophrastus 
of Eresus and Straton of Lampsacus. Of Aristotle, 
the author writes with sympathy tempered by criti- 
cism ; his attitude toward the Aristotelian logic is 
appreciative, although he follows Mill in delimiting 
its functions; while his discussion of Aristotle's 
" katharsis " is both clear and suggestive. 

Marie- The title, "Marie-Antoinette: Her 

Antoinette's -rn i -\r ii i i T i -*r 

first years Ear ty Youth, which Lady Young- 

in France. husband has chosen for her very 

thorough study of one period in the life of the un- 
fortunate French queen, is accurate enough, per- 
haps, but likely to give a wrong impression. Marie- 
Antoinette's " youth," as here dealt with, is not her 
childhood, but the years immediately following. 
The book deals entirely with the four years between 
the marriage of the vivacious Austrian princess to 
the excellent but clumsy French Dauphin, and the 
death of the Dauphin's execrable grandfather. 
"The main object," of the work, in the words of 
the author, "was to unravel a nebulous, if highly 
attractive, personality, and to replace by a human

being the kind of lay figure which over-much indis- 
criminate reading had tended to produce." The 
effort has been crowned with a measure of success. 
In the centre of this foolish, feverish, and depraved 
society we catch now and then the regular beating 
of this one warm, pure, and honest heart ; and this 
one child-matron's wholesomeness and sanity are all 
the more pleasing for the contrast with the condi- 
tions that surround them. Marie-Antoinette had 
faults, but they seem to have been pretty well 
summed up in the estimate of the brave and severe 
old Empress, her mother, " raillerie and untidi- 
ness." Lady Younghusband marshalls her details 
with a catholic enthusiasm that reminds one of that 
delightful French historical " restorer " M. Len6~tre, 
although it is only now and then that she commands 
such a vivifying magic touch as his. The very uni- 
versality of her interest is in her way, for it destroys 
all perspective and allows the reader's attention no 
rest. She cares quite as much for the watchful 
Austrian ambassador Mercy, even for the faithful 
but tiresome tutor-priest Vermond, as she does for 
the heroine herself, and tells us almost if not quite 
as much about them ; and she -finds it so difficult 
to let one charming character go until she has ex- 
hausted all her information concerning him, from 
his antecedents to his ultimate fate, that it is very 
difficult to keep a clear idea of the chronology. The 
book would be much more confusing still if it were 
not for the excellent index, which adds after the 
name of each person mentioned a sort of description 
enabling one to place him more easily, thus : " Bour- 
bon, Duchesse de (daughter of Due d'Orleans)," and 
"Bouret, Monsieur (Cabinet Secretary to Louis 
XV.)." The volume is published in handsome form 
by the Macmillan Co. 

Some notable Mrs ' Alice Ke . m P- Wel ch, the author 
women of the of " Six Mediaeval Women " (Mac- 
middie ages. millan), a collection of essays some 
of which have already appeared in " The Nineteenth 
Century and After," is a keen and capable student 
of the past, bringing certain long-dead members of 
her sex back to life with remarkable skill, consider- 
ing the very meagre data at her command. After 
a long introduction crammed with curious informa- 
tion, she takes up in chronological order six gifted 
women who lived between the tenth and the fifteenth 
centuries. The first one dealt with, the nun Ros- 
witha of Gandersheim, in the Harz Mountains, has 
been treated by no other modern writer, and her 
biographer depends for information concerning her 
principally upon her own writings, of which the 
most important are six religious dramas. Almost or 
quite as unfamiliar to most of us is the Magdeburg 
Beguine Mechthild, whom this investigator shows 
writing passionate love-lyrics addressed to her God 
as another might write poems to an earthly lover. 
Mahaut, Countess of Artois, a relative of St. Louis, 
and herself a philanthropist and a disinterested 
patron of various artistic and industrial endeavors, 
is portrayed as a remarkable example of virtue and 



culture in a corrupt and materialistic age. The other 
three names are better known : Marie de France, 
the Anglo-French love-poet whose influence over 
Chaucer, Scott, Goethe, and a host of lesser names 
is easily traceable; Christine de Pisan, the brave 
fifteenth-century blue-stocking and advocate of equal 
rights for women; and Agnes Sorel, the amiable 
mistress of Charles VII. The author's desire to 
make a heroine and a world-power of the lady last 
named has prompted some inferences to which the 
facts have not led other historians, and in general 
this chapter seems the least satisfactory of all. A 
concluding chapter on " Mediaeval Gardens " is a 
prettily-flavored reminder that our forefathers loved 
trees and flowers quite as much as we do, even if in a 

different way. 

Mr. Archibald G. B. Russell's criti- 
l ^udy and catalogue raisonne" of 
"The Engravings of William Blake " 
(Houghton Mifflin Co.) is the fruit of many years of 
study and research by the foremost living authority 
on the work of that eccentric artist. To collectors 
of Blake's engravings it furnishes a much-needed 
guide. The catalogue is not only an exhaustive one, 
including a number of hitherto unknown engravings 
by Blake, some of them after his own designs, which 
have been discovered by Mr. Russell, but is made 
of exceptional value by the very full notes that are 
appended to each item described. The information 
given in these notes is of the most varied character ; 
apparently nothing has been overlooked that can be 
of help to the student or the collector. The usual 
information about " states " is given ; when neces- 
sary the subjects are described and the conditions 
under which the works were produced ; the present 
ownership of drawings and the rarer prints is indi- 
cated, together with a multitude of other interesting 
details. In the critical study the story of Blake's 
life is told in compact form, his work as an engraver 
is reviewed, and his peculiar technical processes are 
described. Incidentally attention is called to the 
fact that " the great majority of the coloured draw- 
ings purporting to be Blake's original designs for his 
books are copies done from the books by other 
hands," and one of the well-known drawings in the 
Print Room at the British Museum is placed in this 
category by Mr. Russell. The illustrations to this 
book include a number of Blake's engravings which 
have not heretofore been reproduced, and also many 
of his most important works.

The arrangement of entries is chronological by year of 
publication, and the classification is into books, plays, 
articles and periodicals, congressional reports, etc. In- 
tended primarily for college women, its usefulness should 
extend among all who are interested in equal suffrage. 

The series of " English Readings for Schools " 
(Holt) has just been increased by three volumes: 
"Franklin's Autobiography," edited by Mr. Frank 
Woodworth Pine ; " Selections from Tennyson's Idyls 
of the King," edited by Professor John Erskine; and 
" Old Testament Narratives," edited by Professor 
George Henry Nettleton. 

The amazingly erudite Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler, who 
was in charge of Sinai Temple in Chicago sometime in 
the seventies, afterwards officiated in New York, and 
has now for many years been president of the Hebrew 
Union College in Cincinnati, attained his seventieth 
birthday on May the tenth last, and in honor of the 
occasion, his colleagues have dedicated to him a volume 
of " Studies in Jewish Literature," which is published 
by Herr Georg Reimer, Berlin. Some of the papers are 
in German, but the majority are in English. Not the 
least striking feature of the work is the Kohler bibliog- 
raphy, which runs to eight hundred items. 

One of the first volumes to appear under the imprint 
of Messrs. Sully & Kleinteich, a publishing-house 
recently established in New York City, is the manual, 
"How to Obtain Citizenship," prepared by Mr. Nathaniel 
C. Fowler, Jr. Brief and simply-worded directions are 
given in English, Italian, Yiddish, German, and French ; 
and while no attempt has been made to include strictly 
technical terms or to unravel such complications as 
occasionally arise from faulty interpretation of the law, 
the book contains the essential directions for aliens or 
foreigners desiring citizenship of the United States. 
Two other useful manuals published at the same time 
are " The Art of Letter- writing," by the same author 
as the above, and " The Etiquette of To-day," by Miss 
Edith B. Ordway. 

Mr. Orison Swett Marden's abounding optimism finds 
characteristic expression in another addition to the 
" Marden Efficiency Books," its subject this time being 
" The Joys of Living " (Crowell). The world-old prin- 
ciple that life holds for us just as much as we bring to 
it, that whether life is worth living depends on the liver, 
that the music of the song is in the ear of the hearer, is 
elaborated and illustrated with all Mr. Marden's well- 
known felicity of manner and richness of thought. 
"The whole world is full of unworked joy-mines," is his 
inspiriting assertion on an early page, and prospectors 
for the precious metal will find many a useful hint in 
his book. Without offering anything really new on his 
somewhat hackneyed theme, the author does well to call 
attention afresh to the supreme importance of the sub- 
jective element in the attainment of happiness. 

Under the title, "The Making of To-Morrow" (Eaton 
& Mains), a handy volume packed with little nuggets 
of wisdom and advice has been made out of selections 
from Professor Shailer Mathews's editorial paragraphs 
contributed to " The World To-Day " during the eight 
years and more that he conducted that wide-awake and 
never uninteresting monthly. Under the general head- 
ings, " The Common Lot," " The Church and Society," 
" The Stirrings of a Nation's Conscience," and " The 
Extension of Democracy," are grouped two-score brief 
and pithy disquisitions on present-day tendencies, good 
and evil, in society, business, politics, international rela- 
tions, the church and the school, and wherever else the 



discerning eye of this observant writer turned its gaze 
in quest of signs of the times. Even the game of base- 
ball is turned to account by Dean Mathews in pointing 
his moral and adorning his tale. The book is timely 
and thoughtful and readable. 

Two new volumes are just added to the "Country 
Home Library," a series of architectural books for the 
layman published by Messrs. McBride, Nast & Co. 
One is " The Dutch Colonial House " prepared by Mr. 
Aymar Embury, II., with the purpose of illustrating the 
applicability of old Dutch methods of architecture to 
modern construction, especially in designing the small 
country-home known as the "long, low house," now 
much in vogue. The other, Mr. Charles E. Hooper's 
" Reclaiming the Old House," gives detailed directions 
for properly incorporating present-day conveniences in 
the architecture of the old-time house without essen- 
tially disturbing its traditions or charm. A third 
volume, similar in size and appearance, is Mr. Alfred 
Hopkins's " Modern Farm Buildings," in which an 
experienced architect offers suggestions for the most 
approved ways of constructing stables, barns, and other 
farm buildings on practical, sanitary, and artistic lines. 

Collected chiefly from periodicals in which they ap- 
peared some years ago, the pleasant sketches and studies 
of Mrs. Katharine Dboris Sharp's " Summer in a Bog " 
(Stewart & Kidd Co.) furnish agreeable and seasonable 
reading to amateur botanists and to nature-lovers in gen- 
eral. Miscellaneous local lore and neighborhood gossip, 
the latter in dialogue form with touches of dialect, two 
original poems, and frequent quotations in both prose 
and verse, with brief notes on botanists of greater or 
less distinction, make up the substance of the book. The 
bog referred to is, or was, in Madison County, Ohio, and 
its flora appears to have been rich and interesting. The 
attracti veness of Mrs. Sharp's volume would have been 
increased by a division of its contents into chapters with 
chapter-headings instead of the rather breathless arrange- 
ment (diversified, however, by page-headings and other 
devices) actually adopted. The writer's fellow-naturalists 
of her own State will especially enjoy the book. 

A critical but appreciative summary of Eucken's 
religious teachings is contained in Professor Henry C. 
Sheldon's small volume entitled " Rudolf Eucken's 
Message to Our Age" (Eaton & Mains). The author 
has a very high appreciation of Eucken's philosophy in 
general, and especially is impressed with those features 
of it which emphasize the transcendental as well as the 
immanental nature of the spiritual realm. This spiritual 
realm, to Eucken, is equivalent with the reality which 
has always lain behind the term God; but Eucken uses 
the idea impersonally, and does not believe in the kind 
of God imagined by believers in what is known as a 
theodicy that is, a governing of the world by God. 
Professor Sheldon softens down the refusal of Eucken 
to postulate a personal God by quotations from his writ- 
ings in which. Eucken does seem hospitable to the idea 
that some of the attributes of personality inhere in the 
divine. The author's main criticism of Eucken, which 
whole-souled followers of Eueken and other modernists 
will consider perhaps the most disappointing part of his 
little book, deals with the German philosopher's teach- 
ings about Christ. Eucken is " Unitarian " in his posi- 
tion, and Professor Sheldon prefers the authority of the 
New Testament to the use of secular reason here. He 
also seems to deprecate Eucken's attitude toward the 
miraculous, which is probably even more agnostic than 
his present interpreter sees fit to admit.

NOTES. 



A translation, by Mr. Joseph McCabe, of Francisco 
Ferrer's " Origin and Ideals of the Modern School " 
will be published at once by Messrs. Putnam. 

Rev. Cyrus Townsend Brady has in the press with 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. a new book entitled "The 
Fetters of Freedom." It discusses the trials of the 
early Christian church. 

" The Magic Formula " is the title of a new volume 
of essays and studies by Professor L P. Jacks, editor 
of " The Hibbert Journal." Messrs. Holt will publish 
the book early next autumn. 

A new novel by Willa S. Gather, entitled " O Pion- 
eers ! " and dealing with the Scandinavian and Bohemian 
pioneers of the Middle West, will be issued early this 
month by Houghton Mifflin Co. 

Two new novels announced for immediate issue by 
Messrs. Putnam are " The Thunderhead Lady," by 
Brian Read and Anna Fuller, and " An Unknown 
Lover," by Jessie de Home Vaizey. 

Three immediately forthcoming Dutton books are 
" The Big Game of Central and Western China," by 
Mr. H. F. Wallace; a biography of Arbella Stuart by 
Mr. B. C. Hardy; and " Industrial Warfare," by Messrs. 
Charles Watney and James A. Little. 

The first issues of a new English weekly, " The New 
Statesman," have recently made their appearance. It 
is of the same form and general type as " The Nation " 
and " The Spectator," but its particular purpose is to 
deal with public affairs from the standpoint of a sane 
and practical collectivism. Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb 
and Mr. Bernard Shaw are actively interested in its 
conduct. 

Dr. David Starr Jordan has resigned the presidency 
of Stanford University, which he has held since 1891, 
in order to devote more of his time to the furtherance 
of world peace. He will hold the office of Chancellor 
of the University, this position being created by the Uni- 
versity for his especial benefit. John Casper Branner, 
professor of geology at Stanford since 1892, and Vice- 
President since 1899, will become President. 

" Harper's Weekly," one of the oldest and most 
influential of the American weeklies, has been sold by 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers to " Norman Hapgood and 
associates." The announcement of sale was made on 
the 16th by Mr. George Harvey, president of the 
Harper Company, and editor of the Weekly. Mr. 
Hapgood, for many years editor of "Collier's," is 
sure to make of the old "Harper's Weekly" a force 
far more potent than it has ever been in the past. 

The Thompson Brown Company, educational pub- 
lishers, has conveyed to Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. title 
to all of its good will, contracts, copyrights, and other 
assets. It announces that the business established in 
1844 and conducted uninterruptedly since then, will 
continue as a distinct department of Messrs. Dutton & 
Co. under the direction of Messrs. Burges Johnson aud 
Edward S. Blagden. With this as a nucleus, it is 
planned to develop an educational publishing business 
of the highest character. 

The first public library building planned especially 
for children's use is about to be erected as an addition 
to the library system of Brooklyn. It will stand in a 
section of the city where the house-builder and the 
stork are unusually active, and where consequently the 
juvenile patronage of the library is large. The Brooklyn 



librarian, it is also to be noted, has had the courage to 
condemn as "dead wood" 4,500 of the 730,000 volumes in 
his charge, and they will be disposed of either by gift 
or sale. These and other items of interest are to be 
found in the current yearly report of the Brooklyn 
Public Library. 

Some three years ago the famous explorer, Dr. Sven 
Hedin, wrote an account in two volumes of his latest 
journeying under the title " Trans-Himalaya: Discov- 
eries and Adventures in Tibet." It formed by general 
consent one of the most valuable and fascinating books 
of travel that had been issued for many years. Much 
interest will therefore be felt in the announcement 
that Dr. Hedin has completed a third volume of the 
work. As in the case of the earlier instalments, there 
will be a large number of illustrations from the author's 
own photographs and drawings. The book will be 
published shortly by Messrs. Macmillan. 

Among the volumes soon to be published by the 
Columbia University Press in its series of " Studies 
in English and Comparative Literature " are: " Gnomic 
Poetry in Anglo-Saxon," by Blanche Colton Williams; 
" Aaron Hill," by Alice D. Brewster; " Learned So- 
cieties and Literary Scholarship," by Harrison Ross 
Steeves; and "Chaucer and the Roman de la Rose," by 
Dean S. Fansler. In the " Studies in Romance Phil- 
ology and Literature " two new volumes are soon to 
appear, " Uncle and Nephew in the Old French Chan- 
sons de Geste," by W. O. Farnsworth, and " Diderot as 
a Disciple of English Thought," by R. Loyalty Cru. 

A valuable gift consisting of three thousand volumes 
of statistical literature, collected by Mr. John Hyde, 
formerly Chief of the Bureau of Statistics of the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture, has been presented by him 
to the Statistical Society of Japan, at Tokio, to serve 
as the substantial nucleus of a new collection that shall 
in time take the place of the one recently destroyed by 
fire after thirty-three years of diligent effort in getting 
it together. Mr. Hyde's collection contains official 
publications of fifty-two countries, printed in twelve 
different languages, and the transactions of most of the 
important statistical societies of the world for a long 
series of years ; also many miscellaneous reference 
books. Baron Sakatani, former finance minister, has 
announced that the donor's name would be given to the 
library so generously presented by him.

No work on the Constitution approaching this in 
scope and treatment has ever been published. It 
is considered the most philosophical and comprehen- 
sive treatise extant on the Constitution. In all 
sections of the country, legal critics agree that 
nothing more exhaustive or more profound has 
appeared on the Constitutional Law of the United 
States. It is the work of a lawyer as well as of a 
close student, and has the merit of combining both 
points of view which renders it valuable alike to all 
classes of readers.

A DELIGHTFUL OUT-OF-DOOR ANTHOLOGY

OUTDOOR SCENES 
AND THOUGHTS 

FROM THE 

WRITINGS OF 

WALT WHITMAN 

COMPILED BY 
WALDO R. BROWNE 

WITH INTRODUCTION BY 
JOHN BURROUGHS 

Photogravure Portrait, $1.00 net 



WHITMAN'S writing of nature, whether in 
poetry or prose, is always marked by vividness and 
actuality : in verse by a lyrical passion and in prose by a 
luxuriance of observation that are unique. This collection 
of out-of-door passages from his writings will appeal strongly, 
not only to all admirers of his poetry, but to all lovers of the 
open. It is an ideal book for the pocket on a country walk, 
and an equally ideal gift for the nature-lover. 



"The unconventional character of Whitman's writing is seen at its 
best in these rapturous and sometimes almost riotous outpourings of 
satisfaction in the joy of living out of doors." The Living Age. 

" An altogether discriminating anthology Whitman poet and 

Whitman diarist are both most happily represented." The Independent. 

"A welcome little outdoor book, fit for the pocket. . . . The selec- 
tions are from the journals and poems, and show Whitman keenly 
observant of and exultant in his surroundings." The Nation. 

" For him who loves Whitman and frequent reference to him at his 
best, yet wishes a pocketable volume, ' The Rolling Earth ' is ideal." 

Chicago Tribune.

Leading Fiction that has Quality 

READY ABOUT JUNE i: A New Novel by ELIZABETH DE JEANS 

" A writer to be reckoned with." CHICAGO RECORD-HERALD. 

" She has advanced into the foremost rank of novelists." HARTFORD COURANT. 

THE HOUSE OF THANE 

A vital portrayal of the modern pirate, a subtle study of the emotions, an even more absorbing story than 
< The Far Triumph." 

By ELIZABETH DEJEANS, Author of " The Winning Chance,'' " The Heart of Desire," " The Far Triitmph," etc. 
Illustrated in color by fi\ C. Yohn. Hmo. Cloth. $1.15 net. Postpaid, $1.37. 

Freshness of viewpoint and a power of revealing the true inner emotional life of men and women have won for Elizabeth 
Dejeans an important place in American Letters. Her last novel, " The Far Triumph," published in 1911, definitely placed 
her in the forefront of American writers whose works show a deep study of human character. 

In the new story the character of John Thane is remarkably well drawn and readers will be impressed by the truthfulness 
with which his passions and emotions are described and their effect upon his life brought out. From the moment when 
Thane realizes the shallowness of his wife until the climax, the story is a succession of dramatic and thought-stirring scenes. 
The gradual awakening of this strong, dominating man to the true values in life through the devotion of Mary Kelly, a 
lovely young girl, child of the streets, is exquisitely done. 

"LO MICHAEL!" 

By GRACE L. H. LUTZ, Author of "The Mystery of Mar]/," " Mar da Schuyler," "Dawn of the MorniiifJ," etc. 
Illustrated in color by Gayle Hoskins. l%mo. Cloth. $1.25 net. Postpaid, $1.37. 

Novels dealing with the clash of social classes and the problem of the poor are very often unpleasant reading, but this 
strong sociological love story is one of exquisite charm and sentiment. 

" Mikky," the little newsboy, saves the life of Starr, the baby daughter of a rich banker, from an angry mob. Through 
the banker's help aud his own indomitable energy, " Mikky " rises to power, and not the least of that which makes him so 
appealing is his remembrance of the poorer class from which he arose. The story of how he and Starr eventually struggle 
through class prejudice to happiness is developed through a series of absorbing incidents. Mrs. Lutz handles all her 
characters sympathetically, and as the story grows in intensity, the social differences which separate Michael and Starr are 
brilliantly contrasted. The story is free from any suggestion of socialistic motives and is a most absorbing human chronicle. 

New Novels of Power and Distinction 

THE UNFORGIVING OFFENDER second 

By JOHN REED SCOTT, Author of" The Colonel of the Red Huzzars," " The Last Try," etc. Illustrated in color by 
Clarence F. Underwood. 12mo. Cloth. $1.25 net. Postpaid, $1.37. 

"John Reed Scott has shaken off the ghastly cloth of tradition and comes forth into the open to hazard a novel in which 
a woman who errs recovers her lost place among women who are good .women, merely not annointed saints. That a woman 
should be given her chance to moral rehabilitation only thin-lipped, skirted puritans will deny. Such books as this do 
more good for the cause of woman than the most sulphurous preachments." Minna Thomas Antrim, in the Philadelphia 
Record.

Bracker. limo. Cloth. $1.26 net. Postpaid, $1.37- 

"Mr. Comfort writes stories that are unlike any others." San Francisco Argonaut. "A fascinating love story." 
Boston Globe. " A very vivid story which one reads with no halting interest." A 7 ". Y. World. " The book fairly breathes 
optimism and joy."Jfnoxville Journal-Tribune. " One has no hesitation in classing this with the best romantic fiction 
of the day on either side of the Atlantic." Chicago Record-Herald. 

A Timely Book of Great Value and Interest 

PICKETT AND HIS MEN 

By Mr*. LA SALLE CORBELL PICKETT, Author of " Literary Hearthstones of Dixie." Illustrated with portraits 
and battle scenes. 8vo. Cloth. $2.50 net. Postpaid, $2.70. 

The year 1913 marks the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, which makes this remarkable work of timely 
interest. It is an intimate recital of the events preceding, during, and following the giant battle, and as a piece of literary 
work it contains the most noble description of a charge ever penned. The soldiers of both North and South will long turn 
to this epic of Gettysburg, not only as the standard work upon this subject, but also as a remarkably thrilling: piece of writing.

VOLUME I NEALE'S MONTHLY 



1913 JANUARY JUNE 1913 



TO mention all the literature that makes the 
first volume of NEALE'S MONTHLY note- 
worthy among magazines would require a great 
deal of space. Science, art, invention, public 
affairs, industries, poetry, religion and ethics, edu- 
cation, travel and exploration, literature and its 
makers and its failures, short fiction, serial fiction, 
historical and biographical articles, brief essays on 
all sorts of topics, all are treated. And the treat- 
ment makes NEALE'S MONTHLY great literature. 

EIGHT GREAT SERIALS 

Were begun in this volume, four of which were 
completed, "Mrs. Kinney's Italian Reminis- 
cences," edited by Laura Stedman and George 
M. Gould (the late Mrs. Kinney was the mother 
of the late Edmund Clarence Stedman and the 
wife of the American Minister at the Court of 
Victor Emanuel); "The Monk and the Hang- 
man's Daughter," by Ambrose Bierce, whose 
"Collected Works" in twelve volumes were 
recently published; "Wall Street as our Ameri- 
can Monte Carlo," an intimate account of the 
world's greatest gambling structure, by Franklin 
C. Keyes, a distinguished member of the New 
York Bar; "Forerunners of the Republic," by 
Archibald Henderson, professor in the Univer- 
sity of North Carolina, who writes on Richard 
Henderson, Daniel Boone, Isaac Shelby, James 
Robertson, John Sevier, and George Rogers 
Clark, and four other serials, begun in the first 
volume, will be completed in the second: "The 
Devil's Discharge," a novel by Willard French; 
"The Strategy of Robert E. Lee," a critical 
military study by J. J. Bowen; "The Persian 
Tassel," a detective story by Olivia Smith 
Cornelius, and "The Scuttlers," a sea story by 
Clyde C. Westover. 

REGULAR DEPARTMENTS 

"The Fraternity of the Fields," which is in- 
tended to be the eyes and ears of him who may 
not be with Nature in her many moods, and 
which is conducted by an eminent writer; "The 
Stage," a department of brilliant, trenchant, fear- 
less criticism of plays, actors, and dramatists, con- 



ducted by a distinguished critic; "Letters to the 
Editors," in which correspondents discuss among 
themselves topics of interest; "In Motley," a 
department of wit and humor, not mere jokes, 
but pointedness directed chiefly at persons in the 
limelight. 

ARTICLES 

Gamaliel Bradford, Jr., contributes one of his 
fine Confederate Portraits on "Gen. G. P. T. 
Beauregard"; William Estabrook Chancellor, 
formerly lecturer in Johns Hopkins University, 
contributes a notable series of political papers on 
"The Proposed Presidential Reforms," "Our 
Gerrymandered Nation," "J. Pierpont Morgan 
and His Time," " Woodrow Wilson In Retro- 
spect and in Prospect," "The Reconstruction of 
the United States Executive Board," and "Pres- 
ent Economic Opportunity in America"; Frank- 
lin Kent Gifford, author of "The Belle Islers," 
contributes "The New Laocoon," a critique of 
pure fiction; James Mark Baldwin, formerly pro- 
fessor of psychology at Princeton, and now pro- 
fessor of psychology at the University of Mexico, 
writes of "French and American Ideals"; Wilbur 
Marshall Urban, professor of philosophy, Trinity 
College, attacks the wit and humor of Mark 
Twain in an article entitled "Mark Twain: Pure 
Fooling"; in "Concerning Plagiarism," J. F. J. 
Caldwell shows many great writers to have been 
plagiarists; William A. Murrill, assistant director 
of the New York Botanical Gardens, contributes 
an entertaining article on "Jalapa, the Flower- 
Garden of Mexico." 

SHORT FICTION 

Among the authors who contribute short stones, 
sketches, or other short fiction to this volume 
are: Robert Louis Sanderson, a Yale professor 
and the author of various books; Lee C. Harby, 
author of "In the Days When We Were 
Young"; Virginia Baker, author of many fine 
stories of the homely sea-faring folk of New 
England; Josephine Clifford McCrackin, one of 
California's pioneers, who with Ambrose Bierce 
and Bret Harte has made a distinctively Ameri- 
can literature.

Carriage extra. 

The preparation of the new Variorum Edition of the Works 
of Shakespeare was the life work of Dr. Horace Howard 
Furness. 

For many years he was assisted by his son, Horace Howard 
Furness. Jr., to whom now falls the task of editing the remain- 
ing plays. This important work will, therefore, be continued 
along the same lines. 

The plan of this volume is the same as in the preceding vol- 
umes, and the reader will find evidence of all the learning, care, 
and critical judgment that have made this edition preeminent. 
The text is that of the First Folio of 1623. The textual notes 
give all the various readings from the Second Folio down to the 
present time. In the commentary and appendix will also be 
found further notes, criticisms, and discussions, stage history 
and dramatic versions. In short, within one volume is to be 
found an epitome of a Shakespeare library that would cost a 
large expenditure of time and money to collect.

THE LAUREATESHIP. 

The death of Alfred Austin, at the age of 
nearly eighty, is a considerable loss to English 
literature. He was a man of admirable talents, 
although they amounted to something less than 
genius, a poet of highly creditable accomplish- 
ment, and a writer of exquisite prose. His life 
offers an example of continuous devotion to let- 
ters, increasingly rare in our bustling modern 
age, yet it was by no means a cloistered life, and 
did not seek to live in a palace of art aloof from 
the political and social concerns of the world of 
men. Austin was a publicist as well as a poet, 
and a steadfast ally of the forces that sustain the 
social order. Born in 1835, a Roman Catholic 
by family and education, he was called to the 
Bar of the Inner Temple in 1857. But before 
this he had published a poem and a novel, and 
after four years in the practice of his profession, 
gave it up, and devoted the rest of his life to 
writing. The list of his books is a very large 
one, and of varied interest. The collected edi- 
tion of his poems, published twenty years ago, 
fills six large volumes, and he has produced 
much verse since that time. Among his poetical 
works are "The Season" and "The Golden 
Age," satires in verse, "The Human Tragedy" 
and "Savonarola," tragedies, and the miscella- 
neous volumes, " Interludes," " Soliloquies in 
Song," and " English Lyrics." His prose writ- 
ings include several novels, a group of political 
writings, and "The Garden That I Love," a 
work dear to all lovers of nature. He was 
a powerful journalist and an effective public 
speaker, and in all his activities deserved well 
of his country. 

When, in 1896, Austin was appointed Poet 
Laureate, after the post had remained vacant 
for four years, there arose a chorus of protest 
which took the form of personal abuse, and which 
continued until his death. It was based upon 
the striking contrast between Austin and his 
predecessor, and upon the popular notion that 
the Laureate should be the greatest of living 
poets. This notion had been realized in the 
cases of Wordsworth and Tennyson, and had 
come to be a sort of prepossession of the public 
mind, although the earlier history of the laureate- 
ship had hardly given it countenance. "Austin 
is not a Tennyson, therefore let us hold him up 
to ridicule," was the almost unanimous cry of

the journalists, and their treatment of him ever 
since has afforded a conspicuous example of jour- 
nalistic bad manners. Newspaper writers, and 
even critics of repute who should have known 
better, went out of their way to belittle his every 
new effort and his total achievement, and he 
became the butt of every cheap wit and random 
paragrapher. It was an unpleasant exhibition, 
and not to be justified by the occasional bald- 
ness of an official lyric, or such an exquisite 
absurdity as may here and there be picked out 
of his work. The man who wrote these lines 
upon Beaconsfield's grave was something more 
than an object of ridicule : 

" Leave me a little while alone, 
Here at his grave that still is strown 

With crumbling flower and wreath ; 
The laughing rivulet leaps and falls, 
The thrush exults, the cuckoo calls, 

And he lies hush'd beneath. 

" With myrtle cross and crown of rose 
And every lowlier flower that blows, 

His new-made couch is dress'd; 
Primrose and cowslip, hyacinth wild, 
Gather'd by monarch, peasant, child, 

A nation's grief attest." 

And the man who could pen the exquisite verses 
to "Agatha" could not be held, at his best, an 
unworthy occupant of the post that Wordsworth 
once had filled. 

" She wanders in the April woods, 

That glisten with the fallen shower; 
She leans her face against the buds, 

She stops, she stoops, she plucks a flower. 
She feels the ferment of the hour; 
She broodeth when the ringdove broods; 
The sun and flying clouds have power 
Upon her cheek and changing moods. 
She cannot think she is alone 

As o er her senses warmly steal 
Floods of unrest she fears to own, 
And almost dreads to feel." 

When Austin became Poet Laureate in 1896, 
England had lost nearly all of the poets that 
had made the Victorian age glorious. Swinburne 
was the only poet of the first rank left alive, 
and this fierce denouncer of kings and priests 
could not seriously have been considered as 
fitted for the function of official champion in 
verse of throne and altar. But if not Swinburne, 
the one chosen must come from the ranks of 
the minor poets, and among these Austin had 
many of the elements of fitness, and his nomi- 
nation was by no means as absurd as it was 
held to be by the organs of popular opinion. 
While he has not displayed the quality of a 
Wordsworth or a Tennyson, he has been a fair 
match for Southey, and a great improvement 



upon Pye. On the whole, he has probably not 
lowered the average of the laureates, taking the 
entire list into account. 

The now vacant post comes opportunely with 
"the silly season " now upon us, and will doubt- 
less help many a distracted journalist to fill his 
summer space with inept and jejune comment, 
and bring our old friends Vox Populi and Pro 
Bono Publico well into public view in the 
contributor's column. We shall be told once 
more or rather a thousand times more that 
the laureateship is an anachronism, which we 
cheerfully admit, wishing only that there were 
many more of them. There are still a few 
anachronisms left such as peppercorn rents, 
and beef -eaters, and king's champions to give 
picturesqueness to English life, and redeem it 
in part from a Lloyd Georgian drabness, and 
we prize the laureateship, not only because it 
gives official recognition to the finest of the arts, 
but also because it is a survival from an age 
whose interests were not wholly material, and 
which had invented neither sociology, nor 
eugenics, nor "temperance," nor the fetich of 
efficiency. The post of Laureate is a pleasant 
one to occupy, even although the traditional 
vinous emolument has been commuted into a 
payment of prosaic cash, and a poet may make 
as much of it as his faculties permit. It inspired 
the Wellington Ode, and may conceivably in 
the future inspire other poems as great. Nor 
is it the ticklish business that it was in Southey's 
time to be the Laureate. The monarchy has 
become chastened in these latter days, and it is 
not likely again to become incumbent upon its 
official poet 

" To toss the litter of Westphalian swine 
From under human to above divine." 

If we may offer a suggestion as to a proper 
selection for the vacant post, it seems to us that 
all the signs indicate Mr. Alfred Noyes. A 
foolish sign is found in the fact that parental 
foresight named him Alfred thirty-two years 
ago ; a serious sign is found in the fact that he 
has this year published a volume of poems so 
rich in imaginative power and so glowing with 
pride in the past glories of English history that 
no one else seems to us to have as clear a title 
to the honor, or to be so plainly marked out for 
the exercise of its peculiar function. We can 
far better imagine Mr. Noyes as the recipient 
of the laurel (this time not greener, but more 
sere) from the brows of his predecessor, than we 
can Mr. Dobson, in whom we fear the divine 
fire is nearly quenched, or Mr. Bridges, who 
lives in a world of his own creation, or Mr.

family to ragtime melodies, or Mr. Watson, who 
might blurt things out in a disconcerting way, 
or Mr. Yeats, who finds the truest reality in 
dreams, or Mr. Phillips, whose thoughts dwell

is at least the equal in achievement of any of 
these, and seems likely to go much farther be- 
fore he is done. His appointment would be 
one that all lovers of poetry would acclaim, 
and one that would shed new lustre upon the 
laureateship. 



THE LIFE-STORY OF A MAGAZINE. 

[EXPLANATORY NOTE. Shortly after the suspension of 
"The Lakeside Monthly" in 1874 (then believed to be but 
temporary) the proprietors of " Scribner's Monthly " (after- 
wards "The Century Magazine"), Dr. J. G. Holland and 
Mr. Roswell Smith, made overtures, which were by some 
thought quite favorable, for a consolidation of " The Lake- 
side ' ' which would be virtually an absorption of it by their 
magazine. In pursuance of this plan, an article was prepared, 
at their expense and by their direction, for publication in 
"Scribner's " and distribution also in proof-sheets for wide- 
spread republication in the newspapers of the country. After 
the article had been written, however, and before its appear- 
ance in print, the owner of ' ' The Lakeside ' ' rather against 
the advice of friends asked to withdraw from the arrange- 
ment ; and hence the article was never printed. In view of 
the recent death of the man who was the magazine's moving 
spirit, we have thought that the article would now be of in- 
terest to many readers, and it is therefore presented herewith 
for the first time. EDR. THE DIAL.] 

The just interest awakened by the event of the 
absorption of " The Lakeside Monthly " by " Scrib- 
ner's Magazine " calls for some particulars of the 
Chicago periodical's history, and explanation of 'the 
unselfish and enlightened policy which, on both sides, 
dictated the arrangement. The sequel will show that 
the occasion is indeed fruitful ; but the present task, 
devolved upon an unconcerned though not insen- 
sible inquirer by the public cariosity, will be limited 
by its demands. 

It had long been in contemplation to develop 
"The Lakeside" into an illustrated magazine of 
highest grade as soon as the requisite outlay could 
be prudently risked. To this end, a series of papers 
on exclusively Western topics, to be elegantly illus- 
trated, had been planned. Meantime, the broaden- 
ing field of "Scribner's" preoccupied the prospect, 
and, too, in a manner it could not be hoped to excel. 
The public will quickly recall the illustrated papers 
on the wonders of the Yellowstone, first revealed 
in "Scribner's"; those on the Yo Semite, Mount 
Shasta, Gray's Peak, the California Geysers, etc., 
all superbly presented ; likewise those on Salt Lake, 
the Mormons, St. Louis, the St. Louis Bridge, the 
Mississippi, the Southwest, etc. This eminently 
popular and successful feature of "Scribner's" was a 
conquest in the territory of " The Lakeside," belated 
as the latter was by insufficient capital: a blameless 
but heavy blow to its hopes long before other causes 



destroyed them. Yet intrinsically "The Lakeside" 
had a brilliant success. Remote from the great cen- 
tres of culture, conducted without the adjunct of an 
artful business policy, without adequate capital, and 
almost without assistance, it is a fact that one young 
man had been able to secure for his magazine a con- 
ceded fellowship in the highest class of periodicals. 
From the "Revue des Deux Mondes," from "The 
London Graphic," from the London " Saturday Re- 
view," from the "Canadian Illustrated News," and 
from numerous less important exponents of foreign 
opinion, " The Lakeside Monthly " at the time of 
its suspension had begun to enjoy that recognition 
which extends to no half-dozen American magazines. 
In this country, such literary connoisseurs as Mr. 
James T. Fields in private, and such hypercritical 
journalists as those of the "Springfield Republican," 
deliberately adjudged its merits and awarded it 
praise which no known publication would slight. 
Journals like the New York " Evening Post," the 
Boston "Journal," and the Philadelphia "Press," 
habitually silent upon it, would occasionally admon- 
ish their favorites of an aspiring Western competitor, 
or surprise the Eastern public by commending it as 
one of the four or five excellent American monthlies. 
Indeed, for that healthful conservatism which spurns 
the taint of sensationalism, and for typographical 
taste, it probably deserved the palm amongst all ; 
while in all other respects suffering by comparison 
less in average quality than in the celebrity of some 
of the writers. It is bare candor to add, after the 
fullest inquiry, what will strangely contradict uni- 
versal prepossession, for "The Lakeside " was a 
Chicago concern, that in self -exaggeration, or even 
self-assertion, it was exceptionally artless. The clever 
and justifiable expedients of all manner of publish- 
ers for conciliating the favor of the press at least 
next door; systematic arrangements for extending 
circulation, by canvassing, by premium gifts, etc., 
even mere advertising, were all sparingly used, and 
the attempt to succeed on merit alone was made in 
good faith in a city where such an achievement 
would be only less likely than such an effort. Yet, 
within limits so narrowed by principle, the business 
policy was surprisingly provident, practical, and 
successful. The presumption of the mercenary 
that they alone are "practical" has seldom been 
more signally rebuked, for seldom have lower aims 
effected so much upon so little. 

Late in the year 1868 was projected and with the 
New Year 1869 appeared "The Western Monthly." 
The first number is before us; judging from which, 
no conception had been formed of the elements or 
mission of an exponent of Letters. Its proprietors, 
men probably ignorant of the possibilities of intel- 
lectual enthusiasm, and without mental qualifications 
for the literary calling, appealed to the Western 
public on behalf of " Literature," yet flagrantly dedi- 
cated their periodical, by a biography, portrait, etc., 
in each issue, to such individuals as had a disbursing 
ambition. The original matter was meagre, incon- 
gruous, and frequently mean ; the rest was selected

in the manner of a country newspaper. Out of this 
insignificant publication grew ultimately the chaste 
and polished "Lakeside." 

When " The Western Monthly " was a few months 
old, a young man who had laid down the knapsack 
of a Massachusetts soldier in the Civil War, a few 
years before, with an intense literary zeal gathered 
in the brooding intervals of the march and the camp, 
came to Chicago, and gravitated into the sanctum 
of the only pretender in the line of his aims. This 
was Mr. Francis F. Browne, afterward editor and 
latterly sole proprietor of "The Lakeside Monthly." 
His modest but earnest fertility and industry rapidly 
improved the magazine, attracting superior contrib- 
utors, and affording countenance to the pretensions 
of his business associates. From the beginning, 
however, there was a radical discrepancy of motive 
involved in the cooperation. The prevalent incredu- 
lity of persons imbued with the commercial spirit 
toward any but material agencies of success, on the 
one hand, and on the other the tacit but irrepressible 
faith in principle as a power by which all durable 
triumphs are gained, must have divided Mr. Browne's 
partners from himself in a sense more vital than a 
mere division of labor. But the former could not 
spare the respectability and character imparted by 
Mr. Browne's untiring and scholarly exertions, nor 
could he at once assume all the burdens. Thus, 
though partners and stockholders succeeded each 
other frequently, there remained in the person of 
somebody the antitype of Mr. Browne. Progress 
and discouragements alternated with each other. In 
September, 1870, a fire in the magazine's printing- 
office destroyed its subscription-list and the entire 
current edition just from the press. But the publi- 
cation continued, with the interruption of a single 
number. Mr. Browne invented the name "Lake- 
side," which was substituted for "Western," and 
the magazine rapidly grew in credit and recognition. 
Then came the more disastrous fire of 1871, in which 
the whole business part of Chicago was destroyed, 
and with it everything tangible and visible of the 
magazine, everything but the invisible and imperish- 
able idea that had made and sustained it. This 
remained; and after a short delay, and a readjust- 
ment of its affairs, its publication was resumed, and 
continued steadily for nearly three years more. 

During its short career of scarce more than five 
years, the vicissitudes of this publication would he 
ludicrous, almost, if after its triumph the sequel had 
been less melancholy. On its ideal side, it was as 
moveless as the pole ; on its commercial side it was 
simply protean. From the colleges and churches 
would come spectacles and white cravats, to meet 
pork-packers, bankers, theatre-owners, etc., in assem- 
blage at the instance of some friendly but enthu- 
siastic "promoter" of some strange scheme that 
comprehended both real estate and literature. But 
the subtlety of the plan would be too much for the 
expected patrons of it ; the lot speculators would fall 
back upon lots, the packer to his pork, the preacher 
to his flock, and all would go home wondering what 



had brought them together. Again, when the East 
began to claim Bret Harte as a desirable adjunct to 
its literary possessions, Chicago, in the spirit of the 
commander who ordered seventy-five men detailed 
to be baptized in order to surpass the fifty conver- 
sions reported of a rival regiment, resolved to have 
him. A fund of $30,000 was pledged, a liberal 
salary offered Harte, and " The Lakeside " was to 
be aggrandized. But the matter got a hitch in some 
personal way, Harte fled to Boston, and nothing 
remained but a joke on Chicago. The magazine 
was left, as usual, to work out its own salvation ; and 
it continued to do it, undismayed. Though often 
in extremis, and seemingly the forlornest of forlorn 
hopes, there was no thought of desisting, or of any 
course whatever but to go ahead. At times fortune 
seemed to smile upon it, and the triumph long striven 
for seemed really to have come. Midway in its 
career a large company, with ample capital, was 
organized with it for a nucleus, and a fine business 
block was erected in the heart of the city, which, 
with the large printing-plant owned and operated 
by the same company, still bears its name. .But 
along with this accession of capital and resources 
came certain spiritual influences that were soon to 
be inimical to the true success of the magazine, 
and this alliance fell apart, Mr. Browne being still 
the conductor of the magazine, and becoming 
through successive degrees its sole proprietor. 

From beginning to end, perhaps as much as fifty 
thousand dollars was sunk in this publication, 
coupled with which is this extraordinary fact, that 
the only year in which it approximately paid its 
expenses was the last, which was the only one in 
which Mr. Browne was exclusive manager. It was 
also conspicuously the year of highest literary tone 
and total disallowance of the low mercenary spirit. 
Hitherto, it had pieced out the foot of its blanket 
by character cut from the top. Mr. Browne un- 
covered its head, and found the blanket without an 
inch to spare, but long enough, with youth and 
strength. Without doubt, the money that had been 
spent was mostly wasted. From the accession of Mr. 
Browne, the magazine uninterruptedly deepened its 
own channel as a literary current; a process which 
might have been hastened by capital, but was only 
retarded by investments that imparted their own 
claim to bind the policy toward early remuneration. 
In this sense, it cannot be idle to reflect on the 
interesting paradox, viz., the enterprise was never 
doing so well as when most straitened for means; 
for the influence on its development of the only man 
who had his vocation in it was greatest when the 
hope of diverting it to mere money-getting was 
least. Such are really the facts ; yet, is it credible 
that out of opportunities actually consisting of 
disaster an energy and a persistency could be found 
adequate to evolve, nourish, and ripen a first-class 
magazine? But it is so, and more: for that 
sympathy and appreciation which are confessedly 
the greatest incentives to zeal and devotion appear in 
this case to have been almost entirely lacking. Any-

body can understand a merely mercantile scheme 
and give it a cheer, even if hopelessly bold ; but 
how few can, with facility, enter into that refined 
and lofty enthusiasm which needs not to be gross in 
order to be practical? Unhappy is that man of 
feeling who has not acquired a second-nature of 
utterance, but habitually turns from the dim mirror 
of a casual listener to the vivid presences in his own 
mind. Willing to be transparent to the meanest 
apprehension, he becomes inscrutable to the acutest 
attention. This gifted and indomitable man suffered 
much from this involuntary reserve. Contempt of a 
mere idea on every hand might well have awakened 
misgivings; but against these Mr. Browne was 
supported by perhaps the first mind in Chicago, the 
late Col. J. W. Foster, who, having presided over 
the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science, might have given greater authority but not 
a more ardent sympathy to a scientific publication. 
The gratitude with which Mr. Browne has been 
heard to mention others serves rather to show the 
paucity and rarity of active support from local men 
of letters and scholars. But Colonel Foster was 
habitual and industrious in his assistance while he 
lived, by valuable articles and editorial labors, but 
above all by vouchsafing to others the assurance 
that Mr. Browne's ends though high were real, and 
though remote were practicable ; that his means 
thereto were well chosen, and that in legitimate 
business management, as in editorial judgment, he 
was emphatically qualified for his task. 

But we must forbear cumulative particulars. As 
Mr. Browne's influence in the concern prevailed, his 
labors multiplied. The lamented death of his friend 
Colonel Foster needs only to be mentioned. In at 
length finding himself sole proprietor, he found an 
appalling labor before him. But it did not daunt 
him. His personal obscurity became the greater by 
the isolation of unremitting toil, while his city began 
to hear from abroad of its most creditable institution, 
ignorant still of the builder of it. Its name at least 
was, however, beginning to be known at home, and 
to be borrowed for all manner of establishments.* 
The local journals occasionally reproduced some dis- 
tant compliment to Chicago for having in its midst 
a real credential for literary cognizance. A citizen 
of distinguished sagacity, after reading its celebrated 
"Chicago Number," declared that its circulation in 
Europe, by accrediting the civilization of the city, 
would lower the rate of interest on its loans. If it 

* Beginning with "The Lakeside Monthly" and its 
affiliated "Lakeside Printing and Publishing Co." and 
"Lakeside Building," there soon followed the "Lakeside 
Directory" of Chicago, a "Lakeside Almanac," various 
'' Lakeside " literary and social clubs, a suburban village 
named "Lakeside," with a seminary called "Lakeside Hall," 
a "Lakeside" course of lectures, a "Lakeside" weekly 
newspaper, a "Lakeside" clothing house, a "Lakeside" 
brand of writing-paper and of flour, a " Lakeside " lodge of 
Masons, and even a " Lakeside " laundry ; while Chicago 
itself began to be called the "Lakeside City." The list 
could be extended almost indefinitely. 



be considered that these amount to hundreds of 
millions, the practical power of Mr. Browne's enter- 
prise is in ridiculous contrast to the expenses of any 
magazine. The time had come, on the soberest 
principles, for "The Lakeside " to be endowed. But 
Chicago had not built her own railroads, nor dredged 
her own river; and why should she lend her bor- 
rowed money for her own literature? There was, 
however, another side to this question, which it was 
the natural function of the local literati to frame 
and present to men whose judgment of beef on the 
hoof had led them to the statelier office of judging 
more comprehensive interests. Booksellers and 
publishers, too, might have looked up from the 
muck-rake, for it was not long after this that 
some of them began to inquire if there might not 
really be something in a "Lakeside" article, pub- 
lished long before, showing the possibilities and 
prospects of Chicago as a publishing point for books. 
But prevailing dulness in a community on a given 
subject makes it irksome to an individual of clearer 
perceptions to affirm the simplest and most obvious 
truths of it. Men of intellectual callings, like other 
people, count the outlay of strength in getting a 
Chicago millionaire to believe his own eyes off their 
habitual objects. But of all men, Mr. Browne was 
least qualified for the task, without sufficient personal 
acquaintance, without the tact of shrewd unreserve 
which forms so large a part of the " magnetism " 
we hear of, and without time from his work. More- 
over, his most cherished plans never contemplated, 
as far as we could learn, a division either of the 
burdens or the glory of the thing. The magazine, 
virtually conducted solely by himself, upon a scheme 
of rigid economy, was sustaining itself, with a steadily 
increasing prospect of early reaching the stage of 
emolument. But the toil was enormous, for, night 
or day, Mr. Browne would not suffer the minutest 
slight or blemish to befall his magazine. In this 
condition the fateful financial panic of 1873 found 
him.* Very reasonably it might be thought that it 
would be fatal to so inelastic a way of business. A 
competent judge, however, of his business and his 
credit believes he would have surmounted this shock, 
as he had so many before, but for a sterner and sad- 
der cause. Be that as it may, it is as certain as the 
laws of physiology, that no pecuniary blessing could 
have averted the calamity of the following Spring. 
Mr. Browne was exhausted. In every such abuse 
of strength there is a turning-point, generally im- 
putable to some casualty. In this case, it was not 
the financial panic that overcame him. The discern- 
ing reader will look no farther, when told that these 
unnatural labors were suddenly arrested to nurse 
and bury a child. 

The work of several is done by one man only by 
the aid of intuitions that really save most of the 
labor. Unmindful that these intuitions are but

sparks which inevitably fail under a subsidence of 
energy, the overworker finds his burden too heavy 
at the very time when the transference of it to 
another's shoulders demands an impossible strength ; 
for it has grown fast to his own. In vain physicians 
advised Mr. Browne to remit his business to a pro- 
visional management. His soul was in it, and 
could he hire a man to work his soul for him while 
he was resting his body ? The magazine lagged in 
time, but suffered not the least deterioration of 
quality. Alarming symptoms compelled Mr. Browne 
to be imperatively warned. Rejecting with disdain 
certain mercenary overtures, he adopted the plan of 
issuing a circular deliberately suspending the publi- 
cation of the magazine until the restoration of his 
health should again enable him to go on with it. 

Such is the story of " The Lakeside Monthly." 
No other literary attempt at the mart of grain and 
swine ever had a story : for only this one had a 
hero. Devotion, in all the fulness of the word, alone 
made the magazine possible. Hence, so inextricably 
personal is its history that mere salient public facts 
would virtually suppress it. On the other hand, the 
thrilling particulars which would be coarsened by 
dramatic portrayal, of struggles so burningly in- 
tense yet so subtle, with their passages of unwit- 
nessed joy, their crises of wordless anguish, these 
it would be stupid not to imagine, yet a trespass to 
name. But when it is seen how this shy, pure, 
proud man, once so indefatigable, now wasted and 
worn by his labors and his sacrifice, himself procured 
for Chicago her credit in the world of letters, a 
higher honor than she owes to any other citizen, 
it would seem monstrous to a distant spectator that 
he should walk her streets unhonored. 



BROWNE THE BELOVED* 



Francis Fisher Browne, or Browne the Beloved 
as I like to call him, was one of the finest and rarest 
men I ever knew. During the last five or six years 
of his life, when I came to know him intimately, my 
love and admiration have been constantly growing 
as the noble strength and beauty of his character 
came more and more clearly to view. 

I have never ceased to wonder how he was able 
to do so vast an amount of downright hard work of 
lasting influence on our literature and at the same 
time lend a helping hand to hundreds of young 
aspiring writers, sympathizing with them in their 
struggles, and cheering them on with heartening 
advice while himself fighting an almost everyday 
battle against bad health, heavy enough utterly to 
disable most men. He was one of the literary 
pioneers of the old West who have made roaring 
commercial Chicago a centre of literature. His

paper, THE DIAL, is regarded by far better judges 
than I am as the most influential of all the American 
periodicals devoted to literary affairs. This paper 
he founded some thirty-three years ago, and edited 
almost to the time of his death. 

He never regained anything like sound health 
after it was broken by camp fevers in the Civil War. 
But nothing could crush him or in any appreciable 
degree abate his wonderful industry. Head and 
heart triumphed over everything. 

He had a wonderful memory, knew almost every 
poet, and could quote their finest pieces as if 
reading from their books. The beauty and manly 
strength of his character and his capacity for life- 
long sacrifice and devotion are displayed in his 
writings, but they showed still more tellingly in his 
conversation when his fine face was glowing with 
soul radium. Like every great-hearted poet, he was 
a nature lover and a charming companion on wave- 
embroidered shores and sunny hills and mountains. 
And it is with peculiar delight that I recall my 
walks with him on the Pasadena hills in the spring, 
and in sublime Yosemite. 

When I took John Burroughs into the Valley two 
years ago we had the grand good fortune to find 
our beloved Browne there. He was suffering from 
one of his dreadful sick-headaches, and was unable 
to go to the hotel dinner table ; so I managed to get 
something he wanted from the kitchen, and we all 
retired early to our rooms in the Big Tree Cottage 
and went to bed. Burroughs had a room to himself, 
while Browne and I occupied a larger one separated 
from John's only by a thin dry board partition, reso- 
nant as a fiddle, and which faithfully transmitted 
every word we spoke or sang. After the headache 
clouds had thinned and lifted a little, all bedroom 
rules, and even the great cliffs and waterfalls of the 
valley, were forgotten; and we began a glorious 
revel in Burns's poems, all of which we had by heart, 
reciting and singing for hours, and sadly interfer- 
ing with John's regular habits, as repeated rappings 
and calls for sleep-silence testified. With lowered 
voices we then continued our grand revel, keeping 
down our merry humor fits as low as possible until 
far on toward the "wee sma' hours ayont the twal," 
making a most memorable night of it. Beloved 
Browne was the only American I ever knew or 
heard of who had all of Burns by heart, and who 
understood him so thoroughly that he was able to 
enjoy the immortal poet almost as well as a veritable 
Scot. 

As we grow old we cling all the more fondly to 
old friends; but Death takes them away just when 
our need of them is sorest. Within the last two 
years two of my Californian friends of the dear old 
leal sort have vanished, never to be seen again in 
this world of light. And now Beloved Browne has 
gone, and all California seems lonelier than ever. 
Surely no man was ever better loved, and his lovely 
friendship will abide with us until the end.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A LIFE CROWDED WITH NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT 

in litei-ature, science, politics, reform, commercial 
affairs, and other branches of activity, came to an 
end in the death, May 28, of Lord Avebury, better 
known to most of his thousands of readers as Sir 
John Lubbock, in the eightieth year of his age. 
Author of more than thirty books, some of them 
circulating to the extent of hundreds of thousands 
and translated into many foreign languages, Lord 
Avebury was nevertheless imperfectly educated, in 
the accepted sense of the term, being removed from 
Eton at fourteen by his father, who seems to have 
held in no high esteem the ordinary curriculum of 
Greek, Latin, and a smattering of a few other sub- 
jects. But though he entered the paternal banking 
house thus early, the boy contrived to educate him- 
self in natural history and such other studies as 
appealed to his tastes, not excluding the principles 
of banking and finance. Darwin took an interest in 
the lad and persuaded his father to give him his 
first microscope when he was eight years old ; and 
subsequent walks and talks with the great naturalist 
stimulated the boy's interest in botany and ento- 
mology, about which he was afterward to write so 
acceptably. But it was on the larger theme of human 
life, its uses and its pleasures, that his most popular 
and interesting books were written. From the long 
list of his published works a few only can here be 
selected for mertion. "The Use of Life " has passed 
its 171st thousand ; " The Pleasures of Life " has 
attained a circulation of 259,000 in its first vol- 
ume, and 213,000 in its second; "The Beauties of 
Nature " is in its 85th thousand ; " Prehistoric 
Times," "The Origin of Civilization," "British Wild 
Flowers," "Ants, Bees, and Wasps," "Flowers, 
Fruit, and Leaves," "The Senses, Instinct, and 
Intelligence of Animals," with other works of like 
sort, are widely read and enjoyed, both in his own 
country and abroad. In his thirty years in Parlia- 
ment Lubbock procured the passage of many acts 
for the good of the people, such as the bank-holiday 
enactment, the bill amending the acts relating to 
free libraries, the Open Spaces Act, the Shop Hours 
Regulation Act, the Shop Seats Act, and others. 
Honors and university degrees and honorary mem- 
berships in learned societies came to him in profu- 
sion. In short, his range of activities and interests 
and his capacity for work were all but boundless. 



THE REVIVAL OF THE ART OF ORAL STORY- 
TELLING, as that art is encouraged and practiced 
by the conductor, or oftener conductress, of the 
children's story-hour, is cause for felicitation. The 
earliest mode of imaginative creation has now come 
to be also the latest, and hundreds of library 
workers and children's teachers are zealously culti- 
vating their faculty for graphic and realistic oral 
narration. Evidence of the present increasing vogue 
of the story-teller is found not only in the story-hour 



which every up-to-date public library prides itself 
on maintaining, but also in the late noteworthy 
manuals devoted to the oral narrator's art. No 
fewer than five useful books on the subject have 
appeared in this country within the last six years, 
and four of these books date back only three years 
or less. As far as the literature of the subject may 
indicate, it would seem to be an American rather 
than a world-wide movement that we are now 
witnessing; and experience seems to show that the 
enduring favorites among the tales told to the 
young people are the age-old fairy stories and hero 
legends which have long since earned their right 
to be regarded as classic. Animal stories of later 
date, such as Mr. Kipling knows so well how to 
write, are also in demand. Naturally enough, the 
listeners show a disposition to become narrators on 
their part, too ; and story-hours under the lead of 
one of the children are growing in favor. In one 
of the Boston schools, for example, the fifth and 
sixth grade teachers are encouraging the pupils to 
tell to the class the stories they themselves have 
heard at the public library or elsewhere. "Boys must 
have changed since I went to school," says the head- 
master; but it is rather the methods than the boys 
that have changed. At any rate, he welcomes the 
innovation as tending to improve the English of the 
story-tellers, who happen to be largely of alien 
extraction. 

A NEW MASTER OF ENGLISH PROSE, one who seems 
to us to have achieved a greater degree of artistry 
and enchantment in this medium than any other 
since Pater, is to be welcomed in the author of 
" Sirenica," a little volume just from the press. Of 
this writer, Mr. W. Compton Leith, we know nothing 
other than that he is an Englishman whose name 
first appeared upon a title-page five years ago, when 
his " Apologia Diffidentis " was issued. The praise 
that we were almost the first to accord that remark- 
able book at the time of its appearance would be 
wholly inadequate to the merits of its successor, so 
greatly has the author grown in power and eloquence. 
"Sirenica" maintains as its thesis that the fabled 
song of the sirens was not one of sensual enticement, 
but rather the call of Romance, "the high music 
of sedition " that leads men away from the tried and 
known paths of every day to the perilous heights of 
spiritual adventure in quest of " the imagined better 
thing." Despite mythology, the singers have never 
died, but their fatal music still sounds across the 
roar of things to-day as potently as when Odysseus 
strove desperately against his cords in the mad 
effort to follow its lure. Such is a suggestion of 
the theme that Mr. Compton Leith develops with a 
charm of thought and expression that seems to us 
of a very high order. His rhetoric is stately and 
dignified, his diction is rich in melody and color, 
his thought glows with the reflection of that inner 
ecstasy or passion in which all genuine literature 
finds its source. We have come upon no book in 
several years (with the possible exception of Francis 



494 



THE DIAL, 



[June 16 



Thompson's essay on Shelley) which seems to us 
more akin to genius, which carries on more 
worthily the splendid tradition of English prose. 
With a fitting regard to the enduring quality of its 
contents, the publishers have given the little book 
a material form of very unusual attractiveness and 
dignity. . . . 

"SHIRTSLEEVE LITERATURE " is the name applied 
by the "Wisconsin Library Bulletin" to a depart- 
ment of printed matter that certainly does not come 
under the heading "polite literature" or "belles let- 
tres," but that is nevertheless full of interest, often 
attractive and even artistic in its material form, and 
has been known to engage the services of talented 
writers and first-rate illustrators. Just at present 
some admirable examples of this literature are being 
sent out by the great transportation companies to 
those busy with the problem of choosing the summer 
resort most conducive to their health and happiness 
during the approaching vacation. Sundry sugges- 
tions on the collection and use of shirtsleeve litera- 
ture are quoted by the " Bulletin " from Miss Mary 
J. Booth, librarian of the State Normal School at 
Charleston, Illinois. Certain sorts of government 
and municipal publications, advertising pamphlets 
and booklets, railroad and steamship folders and 
handbooks, and other industrial and geographical 
material, are often rich in practical information and 
diversified with numerous and excellent illustrations, 
even though the latter may be only photo-engravings. 
From a four-page list prepared by Miss Booth of 
publications of this kind, we take a few specimen 
titles: "Alaska Glaciers and Ice-fields," issued by 
the Alaska Steamship Co.; "Argentine Republic," 
issued by the Pan- American Union; "The New 
Arizona," by the Southern Pacific R. R.; "Arkansas 
Homes and Harvests," by the Cotton Belt Route; 
"California," by the Rock Island Lines; "Crater 
Lake National Park," by the Interior Department ; 
"Report on Hawaii," by the Bureau of Labor; 
"Occident is no Accident," by the Russell-Miller 
Milling Co. Of such sort is the abundant shirtsleeve 
literature obtainable at little or no expense by indi- 
viduals and libraries, and often useful for educational 
purposes. Library picture collections can be advan- 
tageously added to from this source. 



WHAT AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OUGHT NOT TO BE, 
according to the late John Bigelow, is exemplified 
in John Stuart Mill's justly famous account of his 
own life. Writing to his friend, George von Bun- 
sen, soon after the publication of this remarkable 
work, Mr. Bigelow, as may be read in the fifth vol- 
ume of his "Retrospections," just published, thus 
expressed his opinion of it : " Mill's autobiography 
was an act of suicide. But for that he would have 
left a reputation for which some might have envied 
him. But Providence has mercifully extinguished 
all interest in the man who could write his own life 
without mentioning that he had a mother, or allud- 
ing to brother or sister except once to complain of 



what he was required to do for them. He was an 
intellectual monster without being monstrously intel- 
lectual." This recalls Carlyle's opinion of the book, 
"wholly the life of a logic-chopping engine, little 
more of human interest in it than if it had been 
done by a thing of macadamized iron." But contrast 
with this Carlyle's words to Charles Eliot Norton on 
hearing of Mill's death as recorded in Norton's 
London diary and published in the current "Scrib- 
ner's Magazine." "I never knew a finer, tenderer, 
more sensitive or modest soul among the sons of 
men. There never was a more generous creature 
than he, nor a more modest. He and I were great 
friends, an' when I was beginnin' to work on my 
* French Revolution ' there was no man from whom 
I got such help." In the same conversation amus- 
ing reference is made to the charm that Mrs. Taylor, 
whom Mill ultimately married, exerted upon him 
when "that man, who, up to that time, had never 
so much as looked at a female creature, not even a 
cow, in the face, found himself opposite those great 
dark eyes, that were flashing unutterable things while 
he was discoursin' the utterable consarnin' all sorts 
o' high topics." Finally, here is a part of what 
Norton himself wrote about Mill in his diary: "No 
man has done more than he in England to keep the 
standard of thought high, and its quality pure. Every 
man of thought, however he may have differed from 
him in opinion, has had an unqualified respect for 
Mill. My feeling for him has in it a very tender 
element mingled with respect." Considered as the 
book of a man in whom " Providence has mercifully 
extinguished all interest," the "Autobiography" has 
had an astonishing number of reprintings in various 
countries and languages. 



EDITORIAL FRANKNESS is surely not wanting in 
the candid explanation given by Colonel George 
Harvey for the transfer of " Harper's Weekly " to 
other editorial management and other publishers. 
"All, we suspect," he says in the issue of May 31, 
"will agree that more causes than one have contri- 
buted to the general result. Some friendly critics 
attribute it solely to poor editing, and goodness 
knows we would be the last to deny so obvious a 
fact as that we haven't been able to edit ' Harper's 
Weekly ' well enough to make it pay. But when it 
comes to admitting, as some assert, that the 'Weekly' 
would be commercially as successful to-day as it 
was thirty years ago under Mr. Curtis and Thomas 
Nast if now directed by those men of talent, we 
have our doubts. Times have changed. The country 
was conservative and thoughtful in those days. 
Now it is radical and impetuous. The ' Weekly's ' 
general policy has never veered. It has always 
stood for progress along cautious lines." That its 
publication has continued at a loss for twenty years, 
is a rather surprising announcement. We read 
further : "Too many periodicals get in one another's 
way. ' Harper's Magazine ' and ' The North Ameri- 
can Review,' both of which are prosperous, are all 
we need and all we can publish advantageously in 



1913]

conjunction with our book business. I shall transfer 
my own editorial work from 'Harper's Weekly' to 
'The North American Review,' beginning a series 
of articles in the July number, inaugurating a 
complete editorial department, 'comment' included, 
in the autumn." Mr. Norman Hapgood and the 
McClure Publications, it is reported, have purchased 
the " Weekly," and Mr. Hapgood will act as editor. 
His resumption of the editorial pen is cause for 
satisfaction to those who have already tasted the 
fruit of that pen when its holder was engaged in the 
conduct of "Collier's Weekly." 



THE ART OF THE ILLUMINATOR, one of the oldest 
as it is also one of the most beautiful of arts, is fast 
going the way of all individual processes that demand 
the exercise of patient and long-continued labor of 
a minute and exacting sort. That it is not yet 
extinct, however, is evidenced by a work recently 
exhibited in Chicago, in which the best traditions of 
the art found skilful exemplification. This work 
consists of a collection of tributes to the memory 
of John Plankinton, a prominent pioneer in the 
Western industrial field, the entire volume being 
engrossed on vellum and elaborately decorated in 
gold and colors by Mrs. S. S. Frackelton and her 
daughter. Of especial interest is the fact that instead 
of the usual rather meaningless or only broadly 
suggestive decoration usually employed by the 
illuminator, practically every design in this work 
has a directly literal or symbolic relation to the 
subject Several years of almost continuous labor 
were necessary to carry the undertaking through to 
completion ; but the result is a beautiful memorial 
which with proper care will endure for centuries. It 
seems to us that the larger public libraries might 
appropriately do something to revive and foster the 
art of the illuminator, not only by arousing public 
interest and appreciation, but also by direct com- 
missions to such artists as are available for work to 
become a part of the library's permanent collections. 
Certainly there could be few more interesting or 
fitting memorials in any library than such a volume 
as we have mentioned here, but devoted to a score 
or two of the foremost names in local history rather 
than to a single person. 



LIBRARY DOINGS IN DISTANT DALLAS are evi- 
dently keeping pace with the rapid growth of the 
community to which the Dallas Public Library 
ministers. From the annual report of the librarian, 
printed in the Dallas "Times-Herald," we learn 
that the library's shelf-room has been doubled by 
the recent addition of a two-story metal stack with 
a capacity of thirty-five thousand volumes, that the 
reference room has been enlarged, a municipal refer- 
ence department started, new books purchased to the 
extent of the available funds, circulation increased, 
story-hour continued to the undoubted satisfaction 
of listeners and story-tellers, and that, in order to 
keep the Dallas library abreast of the times, its 
head, Miss Rosa M. Leeper, has visited the sister 



institutions in seven cities of the middle West, 
including Chicago, studying especially the methods 
of library extension there employed. That Dallas 
library-users are of an inquiring mind, wholesomely 
athirst for information, appears from Miss Leeper's 
account of the questions propounded in the reference 
department. "These questions," she says, "come 
through personal inquiry, by letter and by phone, 
and cover all imaginable subjects from the spelling 
of words and the naming of a baby to taxable values 
of corporations and chemical affinities." (Let us 
hope, parenthetically, that the taxable value of a 
chemical affinity was not among the problems to be 
wrestled with by the reference librarian.) Not least 
among the improvements planned by the Dallas 
library officials is an increase of library facilities 
for the colored people of the city.

CONCERNING AN AMERICAN RHODES SCHOLAR OF 
TALENT, William Chase Greene by name, a Harvard 
graduate and now in his eighth term at Oxford, it is 
reported that, having won the famous Newdigate 
prize last year with a poem entitled " King Richard 
the First before Jerusalem," he has now captured 
the Charles Oldham prize with an essay on "The 
Sea in the Greek Poets." This latter prize, which 
amounts to about three hundred dollars, is awarded 
yearly to the writer of the best essay on a subject 
connected with Greek or Latin literature, the com- 
petition being open to all members of the university 
whose matriculation dates back not more than twenty- 
eight terms. Mr. Greene's achievements (which 
include also the honor of being chosen class odist 
by his Harvard class, and of delivering the Latin 
salutatory at graduation) reflect credit on his New 
England ancestry. He is a grandson of Mr. William 
L. Greene of Dorchester, for many years publisher 
of "The Congregationalist." His father is Professor 
Herbert E. Greene of Johns Hopkins University. 
To win a poetry prize that in the past has been 
awarded to such men as John Raskin, Dean Stanley, 
and Matthew Arnold, is no small honor ; to be the 
first American to do this adds to the distinction. 
That this Rhodes scholar will not succumb to an 
over-burden of academic honors, but will be heard 
from later in the larger competition that awaits him 
in the big world of letters, is the hope which one 
naturally cherishes after following thus far Mr. 
Greene's course as a student. 


AN UNGAINLY PLEONASM, heard not infrequently 
in speech, and met with even oftener in writing 
and perhaps with rather greater frequency in En- 
glish books than in American, though of this one 
cannot pronounce with certainty is exemplified 
in the latest of those admirable language lessons 
contributed by Professor Lounsbury to ' Harper's 
Magazine." In the course of his essay on " Linguis- 
tic Causes of Americanisms " in the June number, 
occurs this sentence : " Hence the verb would have 
been sure to have maintained itself in the language, 
even had it been an Americanism." This over- 



496 



THE DIAL 



[Jiirie 16 



emphasis of the preterite idea, if one may so call it, 
is all the more noticeable from its being immediately 
preceded by the remark that "language is always 
economical and cuts down, wherever practicable, 
unnecessary circumlocutions." The use of such word- 
wasting forms of expression as " he would have been 
glad to have seen you," instead of the simpler and 
perfectly adequate " he would have been glad to see 
you," strikes the ear with something of the awkward- 
ness, something of the illogical quality, of the double 
negative where no affirmation is intended. Indeed, 
an analysis of the foregoing sentence reveals an 
unexpected closeness of analogy to the double 
negative, " He would have been glad to have seen 
you " must mean, strictly, " He would have been 
glad to have his interview with you over," or, in 
other words, he dreaded the interview and did not 
desire to see you ; that is, he would have been sorry 
to see you which is the exact opposite of what 
the speaker intended to say. 



THE VAST COMPANY OF WOULD-BE AUTHOKS, Or 

of near-authors, as they might prefer to be called, 
has its size brought home to us in such professional 
confessions as have recently been made by Mr. 
Reginald J. Smith, head of the firm of Smith, 
Elder & Co., and editor of the "Cornhill Maga- 
zine." Mr. Brett ? s late "Atlantic" article on book- 
publishing has called attention to the disproportion 
between the yearly number of submitted manu- 
scripts arid published books a ratio that excited 
some surprise and probably stirred an occasional 
doubt as to the accuracy of the figures given 
and now Mr. Smith presents an exhibit even more 
astonishing. For the magazine in his charge there 
are annually read between twenty- five hundred and 
three thousand manuscripts, of which on an average 
only one in two hundred, or one-half of one per cent, 
is accepted. Apparently this does not include mat- 
ter contracted for beforehand or furnished in the 
regular routine, since twelve or fifteen manuscripts 
would not go far in providing for a year's issue of 
the magazine. Of manuscripts offered to the firm 
for book publication, the number averages about six 
hundred a year, and of these somewhat less than 
two per cent are accepted. Few indeed are the 
chosen out of the many who feel themselves called 
to authorship, even if one allows for the possible 
acceptance elsewhere of works rejected by this or 
that or the other publisher. But when all other re- 
sources fail, the rejected author may always bring 
his book into being at his own expense of course 
provided he is able to pay the printer. That such 
a course is in almost ninety-nine cases out of every 
hundred a foolish waste of money seems to have no 
effect on the ever-increasing output of these publica- 
tions which have never been published. 



THE LIBRARIANS ABROAD, like the "Innocents," 
tend to flock together and go in special parties, 
though not always in especially chartered vessels, 



as did that cheerful company of sight-seers on the 
good ship " Quaker City." There comes to our 
notice the project of a European tour for the sum- 
mer of 1914, designed for librarians and offering 
many attractive features. The Bureau of University 
Travel, of Boston, appears to be conferring with the 
Massachusetts Library Club concerning the details 
of such a tour, which of course is still far from being 
definitely decided upon. A part of the Bureau's 
letter to the President of the Club is as follows : 
" The purpose of the tour is to bring such people in 
touch with the best things of greatest interest per- 
taining to their chosen profession, with appropriate 
allowance for recreation and the usual sight-seeing 
in Europe. ... I submit herewith a combination of 
three tours subject to your consideration, which may 
be revised to best suit conditions. ... It is, of 
course, understood that the name of every person 
participating in this tour shall first have the approval 
of your Committee." The proposed itinerary includes 
the Azores, Algiers, Naples, Greece, Rome, Flor- 
ence, Venice, Milan, the Italian lakes, Switzerland, 
Heidelberg, the Rhine, Cologne, Paris, London, 
Oxford, Stratford, Warwick, Kenilworth, and Liver- 
pool with the suggested omission of Greece and 
the Shakespeare country, or one of them, should a 
shorter tour be desired. Such persons as may find 
themselves interested in the foregoing, which is 
taken from the " Massachusetts Library Club Bul- 
letin," are invited to communicate with the President 
of the Club, who is now Mr. Drew B. Hall, Libi'arian 
of the Somerville Public Library. 

SINOLOGY MADE EASY, or comparatively easy, to 
the western world would seem to be among the 
possibilities of the not too distant future, now that 
an alphabet of only forty-two characters has been 
adopted, to supersede the unwieldy system of ideo- 
grams (eight thousand or more in number) hitherto 
used by the Chinese for the literary expression of 
their thought. Of the forty-two characters^ twenty- 
three are vowels and nineteen are consonants. Thei 
Greek, the Russian, and the Latin alphabets have 
been drawn upon to express some of these vowel 
sounds, but the extraordinary variety and peculiarity 
of the Chinese vowels seem to have made it impos- 
sible to find appropriate symbols in any existing 
alphabet, and hence a number of native characters 
had to be pressed into service. But even so, the 
alphabet is not so forbidding as to deter the linguist. 
Russian literature, well within the mastery of non- 
Russian students, is printed in an alphabet of thirty- 
five letters, and the Coptic alphabet (which, however, 
does not worry many of us) is nearly as rich. At 
all events, a dictionary of the Chinese language 
somewhat less bulky than an " Encyclopaedia Bri- 
tannica" ought soon to be an accomplished fact, 
and before long the western world may be reading 
Confucius in the original. The reform is a fitting 
accompaniment to the establishment of a republican 
government in place of the outworn monarchy.

THE RECONSTRUCTION OF A VENERABLE LIBRARY 

BUILDING, in such a manner as to preserve in fire- 
proof material its present characteristic features 
while also materially enlarging its dimensions, is 
now going on in the thorough rehabilitation of the 
old Boston Athenaeum in Beacon Street. Long and 
earnest has been the debate over the question of a 
new building or a reconstructed and enlarged old 
one ; and, happily for the lovers of the historic and 
the picturesque, affection for the old has carried the 
day. With the addition of a sub-basement and two 
stories, and the substitution of durable steel and 
cement for perishable wood, care being taken to 
reproduce in facsimile the present famous reading- 
room, hallowed by memories of the great New En- 
gland authors who in old times there pursued their 
studies, the building will be greatly improved for 
the uses to which it is devoted, and at the same 
time will not be very noticeably altered in plan and 
appearance. Its literary treasures will be rescued 
from the now imminent risk of destruction by fire, 
and in the process of rescue their daily use and en- 
joyment will not be interrupted. This simultaneous 
reconstruction and occupancy of a building, lately 
effected in the case of a great railroad terminal in 
New York, and some years earlier accomplished by 
another railroad in Philadelphia, is more of a novelty 
in the library world. The prosecution of this rather 
difficult work will be watched with interest. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

POETRY AND THE OTHER FINE ARTS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Of the two correspondents who criticized the policy 
of "Poetry" and the judgment of its editor in your last 
issue, one seems to get so much pleasure out of his at- 
tack on contemporary poets that it would be a pity to 
interfere with his acrobatic exercise. 

In the letter of the other correspondent I seem to dis- 
cern a different tone, and it may serve as the text for a 
few reflections on the status of poetry in the public mind 
as compared with that of certain other arts. 

Mr. Bene"t complains of " Poetry " because, in the first 
eight months of its existence, it has published only one 
poem to which he can give high praise, this one being 
" of very great distinction." Of course I might mention 
other poems which seem to me distinguished ; but assum- 
ing for the moment that Mr. Bene"t is correct, may I not 
insist that the publication of even one poem " of very 
great distinction " in two-thirds of a year should be 
counted not poverty but riches, an achievement which 
quite justifies the existence of the magazine and pays 
for all the labor and capital that have gone into it. 

I turn to the catalogue of our last autumn exhibition 
at the Art Institute, and look over the list of prize- 
winners since 1902, during which period, until last year, 
no prize was given in the United States for poetry. For 
three years the Potter Palmer gold medal and $1000 
prize, founded in 1910, have been awarded to pictures 
which no critic has ever stated to be " of very great 
distinction," upon which, indeed, no superlatives have 
been expended. Of the eleven pictures which, since 
1902, have won the Harris silver medal and $500, three 



or four might be called distinguished; but it is doubt- 
ful whether any one of these deserves the " very," as 
Sargent's portrait of Chase is not the best this painter 
can do, and Tarbell's " Girl Crochetting " is a perfect 
example of preciosity a trivial subject turned out with 
the most exacting nicety, a quality of which Mr. Bene"t 
accuses our magazine. And the four awards of the 
bronze medal and $300 continue the same story. 

Ditto in Pittsburgh, where the prizes are still larger 
and the competition is international. Has any critic of 
standing given a superlative to Mr. Philpot's picture, 
which drew $1500 this year, or to that of Mr. Sims, 
which had the same luck last year ? Indeed, can one 
find a single masterpiece in the whole list of Pittsburgh 
prize-winners since 1896, whether of the gold, silver, or 
bronze class ? 

Yet " Poetry," which aims to be an exhibition gallery 
for poets, is criticized if it does not, in the critic's 
opinion, print a masterpiece or two each month. Poems, 
paintings, statues, "of very great distinction," are not 
created often ; meantime the lesser achievements in 
these arts the vital and provocative experiments, the 
works which seem to embody some mood of beauty, the 
expressions of insight or inspiration which seem a-thrill 
and alive these are entitled to the consideration of the 
public. They must have this consideration, the poet 
the artist of any kind must have a public to speak to, 
else his art cannot grow, he can not go on. The people 
must grant a hearing to the best poets they have, else 
they will never have better. The great periods in any 
art come only when great energy of creation meets equal 
energy of sympathy, that is inexorable law. 

"Poetry" endeavors, however imperfectly, to give 
the poet a chance to be heard, to gather together his 
public, and to reward him, though inadequately, for his 
work. It would like to give as many prizes as the Art 
Institute does, viz., nearly thirty a year, ranging from 
ten dollars to a thousand. It would like to pay its 
contributors so handsomely that a good poet could earn 
as fair a living as a good painter, or at least as fair as 
many bad painters who seem to support families without 
difficulty. 

In these efforts the magazine is necessarily no wiser 
than its editors, whose judgment is far from infallible, 
and who assert merely their honesty of purpose and a 
certain training in the art. Others could doubtless do 
the work better; but no one else attempted it.

HAUPTMANN AND THE NOBEL PRIZE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Permit me, as a Scandinavian, to correct an erroneous 
impression conveyed by Mr. W. H. Carruth's letter in 
your issue of June 1. 

It is by no means true that the Nobel prize is awarded 
for a literary work of any single year, be it 1912 or 1913. 
It is awarded to authors whose lifework has gone in an 
absolute idealistic direction. Thus the Norwegian au- 
thor Bjornson won the prize "because his books revealed 
a spirit of singular purity." 

In regard to Hauptmann, I will say that it is ex- 
tremely probable that his name was decided upon before 
"Atlantis" was published. 

The prize is awarded once a year, that is the only 
way in which it is connected with the literature of the 
hour, heaven be praised ! OLAF HEDDELAND.

A MANY-SIDED PHILANTHROPIST.* 

Mrs. Barrows s choice of a title, " A Sunny 
Life," for her biography of her husband, is a 
happy one. Through his many-sided personality 
the white radiance of eternity seemed to shine 
as through Shelley's dome of many-colored glass. 
Rich and varied were his gifts of mind and 
heart, and with them all he was the embodiment 
of that joyous faith in the eternities and the 
immutabilities that gives to life its noblest 
significance and takes away from death its 
bitterest pang. 

Samuel June Barrows was born of poor 
parents on the 26th of May, 1845, in Columbia 
Street, on the lower East Side of New York 
City. His father, Richard Barrows, cousin to 
Richard Hoe of printing-press fame, and 
employed in his factory, was taken from his 
family when Samuel, one of five brothers and 
sisters, was but three years old. The widow 
supported her little ones and herself as best she 
could, chiefly by making shoe-blacking, accord- 
ing to a precious recipe brought from England, 
in small quantities for a restricted circle of 
customers ; and in this domestic industry the 
children helped her until they were old enough 
to find other and better employment. At eight 
years of age the school education of him with 
whom we are here concerned came to an end, 
partly by reason of an illness that made close 
confinement inadvisable, and soon afterward he 
obtained employment suitable to his strength 
and ability in his prosperous cousin's printing- 
press works at a weekly wage of one dollar, of 
which one cent went to him as his very own and 
was usually dropped into the contribution plate 
at church. However, despite this excess of vir- 
tue in the boy, and notwithstanding his early 
engagement in evangelistic labors along the 
wharves and among the sailors, heaven did not 
claim him in his tender years, but spared him 
for a half -century more of increasing usefulness 
on earth. The mastery of shorthand and of 
telegraphy, with the acquisition of a correct and 
forceful literary style, helped him to a succession 
of good positions as private secretary and in 
journalism ; and his early marriage to a woman 
almost as gifted and capable as himself still 
further advanced his fortunes at the same time 
that it assured him a singularly happy and

beautiful home life. Emancipation from the 
fetters of an outworn creed was followed by 
preparation for the Unitarian ministry at the 
Harvard Divinity School. The pulpit of the 
Meeting House Hill Church at Dorchester was 
then offered to him and accepted, but after four 
years of distinguished service there he felt 
reluctantly compelled to accept a call to the 
editorship of " The Christian Register," which, 
with the volunteer cooperation of Mrs. Barrows, 
he conducted for sixteen years. Next came a 
term in Congress, miscellaneous literary work, 
the secretaryship of the Prison Association of 
New York, travels abroad and at home in the 
interest of prison reform, and a zealous parti- 
cipation in countless other good works, until at 
the age of sixty-four a fatal attack of pneumonia 
ended his labors on earth. 

What impresses one most in the life so pre- 
maturely closed is the rare union of brilliant 
literary, scholarly, and artistic gifts with moral 
endowments of the highest order. In any one 
of numerous departments in literature, schol- 
arship, music, in the ministry, in social reform, 
in journalism, in public life, or in some admin- 
istrative business office he was qualified to 
achieve a more than ordinary success. There 
seemed to be nothing that he could not do, 
except that which was base, as his co-workers 
were wont to declare of him. But it is prob- 
ably as a penologist of enlightened vision and 
great practical ability that he will be longest 
remembered. Next to that might well be 
cherished in memory his entire independence 
and fearlessness as a member of Congress, and 
his splendid work there in behalf of wise legis- 
lation. Of course it was his very uprightness, 
so out of alignment with the crookedness of 
political methods, that brought about his defeat 
when he offered himself for reelection. 

As there is space here for but a few short 
extracts from this admirable biography of a 
brilliantly gifted man, and as it is one's every- 
day habits that best indicate one's quality, we 
select for quotation a passage or two that will 
both bring Mr. Barrows into nearer view and 
convey at least a suggestion of his range of 
interests and tastes and abilities. Midway in 
her narrative Mrs. Barrows says of him : 

"Whatever people about him were doing he liked to 
learn to do. Thus he learned to make nets, and many 
a hammock for baby, or doll, or friend, still remains 
to show his kindness as well as his skill. Chess and 
draughts he could play well, but found them more 
expensive in nerve power than he could afford. Cards 
he thought a waste of time. There was one homely 
game in which his nimble fingers made him facile

princeps. Many a one, old and young, I have seen him 
challenge, and he was always the winner. That was 
the old classic game of jackstones. I even saw him 
once when playing with real ' knuckle bones ' in Greece, 
where they have played it since Homer's days. Pebbles, 
beans, bones, iron 'jacks,' it was all the same to him. 
It seemed as if his fingers were India rubber and could 
be turned backward or forward as occasion demanded. 
One day, while we were waiting for a belated street- 
car, some small boys were playing jackstones on the 
pavement. He laid down his book-bag and in his happy, 
genial way, stepping over among them, began to play 
with them, teaching them some of the New York varia- 
tions of his own street childhood: ' helping the lady over 
the stile,' ' putting the horse in the stable,' ' skunks,' etc. 
Our car came along, and that was the end of the lesson. 
But a few days later, at the same corner, we heard a 
youngster say, as he recognized my husband, then a 
United States Congressman: 'That's the feller that 
interduced " skunks " inter Dorchester! ' Such is con- 
temporary fame!" 

Again, the following serves well to show us 
the man as music-lover and musician. Barred 
from a liberal education in his youth, he not only 
mastered many languages and other branches of 
learning in later life, but he took up music in 
mature manhood, learned to play the flute, ac- 
quired proficiency in singing, and then made 
himself at home with the pipe-organ. In his 
wife's words: 

" Not only with his voice, but with his fingers, did 
my husband elicit music. For several years he studied 
composition and harmony and enjoyed the science of it. 
He wrote several hymns and composed words as well as 
music, but it was not till he was fifty that he gave up 
the flute and began the piano. He used laughingly to 
say that he was tired of blowing into a hollow stick. One 
day I went with him to help him select a suit of clothes, 
a duty he always expected of me. As we walked along 
he said he wished we were going to select a parlor organ 
instead. ' Very well,' I said, ' wear your old clothes 
and have the organ.' So we passed Rogers Peet and 
brought up on Fifth Avenue at an organ store, and the 
price of the clothes down and ten dollars a month later 
soon made it his ! In a surprisingly short time he was 
playing all the tunes in our ordinary hymn-book. . . . 

"The next morning I stole round to St. George's 
chapel, where he went always from eight to nine in the 
morning. I followed the call of organ notes and slipped 
in behind him on an empty bench, and my heart ran riot 
with sympathetic joy as I saw his happiness. Slowly 
and painstakingly he was playing Handel's Largo, quite 
alone as he supposed, but his whole soul was in it. When 
he had finished he reverently closed the organ and 
turned to go. ' You here ? ' he cried with pleasure. But 
I could not see him for the mist in my eyes." 

Here is a glimpse of the penologist, orator, 
and linguist, at a dinner of the Seventh Inter- 
national Prison Congress at Budapest, in 1905 : 

" The last night there was a banquet and a chance to 
use the carefully prepared and memorized speech. He 
had the seat of honor at the raised official table, and as 
I was next to him, I could look down and over the sea 
of faces in that big banquet hall and watch their sur- 



prised expression as he slipped from his French opening 
into simple but perfectly understandable Hungarian. 
Then they began to cheer, as only Hungarians can. And 
as he told how, when he was a little boy, his mother 
lifted him to her shoulder in the streets of New York 
that he might see Kossuth pass by, I thought the roof 
would come off. They banged the dishes, jumped to 
their feet, on to the chairs, and some of the more en- 
thusiastic at the rear of the hall on to the tables, and 
shouted and pounded for some minutes, before he was 
allowed to go on. It was only a ten-minute address, but 
it won their hearts, and the next morning it appeared in 
every paper throughout Hungary." 

In closing, we cannot do better than to quote 
a few words from Rabbi Wise's tribute to Mr. 
Barrows at a largely attended memorial service 
conducted by the Prison Association of New 
York. 

" Few men have lived of whom it might more truly 
have been said than it may be said of Samuel June 
Barrows that the world was his country and all mankind 
his countrymen, ' and every man, especially every op- 
pressed man, a brother.' If this cosmic man was capable 
of partiality or preference, it was revealed in devotion 
to land or lands where liberty was not, where the high 
boon of freedom was yet to be won. In his love of 
justice and in the justness of his love, he had ' circum- 
navigated the seas of philanthropy,' literally as well as 
spiritually, resting charity upon the immutable founda- 
tions of justice, and benevolence upon the everlasting 
rock of brotherhood." 

Mr. Barrows is fortunate in his biographer 
a writer of acknowledged charm, of long experi- 
ence with the pen, and of course more intimately 
familiar with her husband's public and private 
life than any other one person could be. And 
she is fortunate in her subject a theme worthy 
of both her literary skill and her woman's in- 
sight and sympathy. Yet it is no mere eulogy 
of the deceased that she has given us. Four 
years have passed since his death, and they have 
been turned to good account in making as full 
and authoritative as possible this history of his 
life and work. Portraits and other illustrations, 
with appended matter and index, help to round 
out its completeness. p ERCY F. BICKNELL. 



ROME THE MAGNIFICENT.* 



In spite of the elaborate and learned histo- 
ries of various periods of Roman history, from 
Niebuhr down to Ferrero, there has remained 
room for a comprehensive story of the greatest 
military and political power the world has ever 
known. To accomplish this within the compass 
of a single volume of 316 pages, with no

THE DIAL,

sacrifice of color or perspective, has been the 
task set for himself by Mr. J. C. Stobart, late 
lecturer in history in Trinity College, Cam- 
bridge. The author's equipment and method 
were favorably inferred from his previous work, 
" The Glory That Was Greece," published two 
years ago. The somewhat ad captandum 
titles, taken from Edgar Allan Poe's " To 
Helen," are perhaps suitable enough to the 
scope of the books, a survey of Hellenic and 
Roman culture and civilization ; and incidentally 
reflect the high esteem which Poe has always 
enjoyed in England. 

But within this limit there has run another 
and a corrective purpose. Mr. Stobart does 
not hesitate to bring the charge of being 
Tendenzschriftsteller against the ancients, Livy 
and Tacitus, Diodorus and Polybius. 

" Diodorus of Sicily was seeking mainly to flatter 
the claims of the Romans to a heroic past. Polybius, 
the trained Greek politician of the second century B. C., 
was writing Roman history iu order to prove to his 
fellow-Greeks his theory of the basis of political success. 
Livy was seeking a solace for the miseries of his own 
day in contemplating the virtues of an idealized past. 
Tacitus, during an interval of mitigated despotism, 
strove to exhibit the crimes and follies of autocracy. 
Edward Gibbon too (I write as one who cannot change 
trains at Lausanne without emotion) saw the Empire 
from the standpoint of eighteenth century liberalism 
and materialism. Theodor Mommsen made Rome the 
setting for his Bismarckian Cjpsarism, and, finally, M. 
Boissier has enlivened her by peopling her streets with 
Parisians." 

Against these Mr. Stobart strongly urges his 
own thesis probably the compelling reason for 
his writing the book. Briefly, it is as follows : 

" The Republic was a mere preface. The Republic 
till its last century did nothing for the world, except to 
win battles whereby the road was opened for the sub- 
sequent advance of civilization. Even the stern tenacity 
of the Roman defence against Hannibal, admirable as 
it was, can only be called superior to the still more 
heroic defence of Jerusalem by the Jews, because the 
former was successful and the later failed. From the 
Republican standpoint Rome is immeasurably inferior 
to Athens." 

This is a pretty severe arraignment of the 
pioneer era, of the "hard-knocks" people who 
steadily prepared the way "for the subsequent 
advance of civilization "; and will hardly change 
the current of admiration for the fathers who 
did things, as against the Caesars who gradually 
lost their grip. 

We naturally turn with interest to what Mr. 
Stobart has to say of the first of the Caesars 
"the foremost man of all this world," the im- 
posing figure that stands between the Republic 
and the Empire. The reaction from Mommsen's 



idolatry reached its extreme in Ferrero's picture 
" of his greatest fellow-country man as an unscru- 
pulous demagogue who blundered into renown 
through treachery and bloodshed." And now 
once more we are to revise our opinion of the 
mighty Julius. Mr. Stobart, conceding Caesar's 
greatness, appraises it with epigrammatic candor: 
"Without making him a demigod, we ought to be 
able to see his greatness. ... It is probable that from 
a very early age he was ambitious, and his family con- 
nections clearly marked out his career as a democrat. 
He had the failure of Sulla before his eyes. The great- 
ness of his character lay chiefly in an instinctive hatred 
for muddle and pretence. From the first, I think, he 
was aiming at power for himself in order to put things 
straight. Whether self or country came first in his 
calculations, it is hard, perhaps impossible, to determine ; 
but the historian is not necessarily a cynic when he de- 
mands strong proof of altruism in the world of politics." 

When it comes to the question of credit for 
the creation of the Roman Empire, we are quite 
prepared to see Mr. Stobart carefully lift the 
laurel from the first Csesar and place it on that 
of his "chilly and statuesque" grand-nephew 
Octavianus, otherwise known as Augustus : 

" Julius Csesar had failed through pride. When he 
fell, the whole dreary round of proscriptions, triumvi- 
rates, and civil wars had to begin again. The inevitable 
monarchy had to be devised afresh on a different basis: 
that was the task of Augustus He devised it in such 
a manner that it lasted in the West for just five cen- 
turies, and in the East for nearly fifteen. Indeed, it can 
hardly be said to be totally extinct now in the twentieth. 
Judged by results then, the work of Augustus was clearly 
a consummate piece of statesmanship. When we con- 
sider the methods by which that result was obtained, we 
shall, I think, esteem Augustus as the greatest states- 
man in the history of the world." 

Augustus's long reign of practically forty-five 
years was one of organizing and upbuilding 
the imperial power on the decrepit framework 
of the Republic. Cool, cautious, but deter- 
mined, he gradually drew into his own hands, 
as Tacitus says, "the functions of the senate, the 
magistrates and the laws." His military achieve- 
ments, important as some of them were, could 
not but stand in penumbra, if not in eclipse, 
when compared with those of Caesar. Moreover, 
Augustus suffers from the lack of any great 
biographer or historian, ancient or modern : 
caret sacro vate. We know what Augustus 
found, and we know what he left ; but the con- 
tinuous tale of what he was doing and how he did 
it from year to year of his almost half-century 
of power, remains less than half told. To sup- 
ply in part this deficiency, as well as to establish 
his thesis of the supremacy of Augustus, Mr. 
Stobart's two chapters on Augustus and Augus- 
tan Rome occupy one quarter of the entire book, 



1913]

and are easily its best written portion. Again 
he does not hesitate to say : 

"The ancient historians prefer to record small victories 
over barbarian tribes, or the petty gossip of the Roman 
streets, while they have little to say about the tireless 
administration which in one generation transformed the 
Roman world from a horrible chaos into that scene of 
peace and prosperity shown to us in the pages of Strabo 
and Pliny. So while our eyes are fixed upon the sins and 
follies of Roman emperors and courtiers, until we get 
an impression of rotten tyranny conducted according to 
the caprice of monsters and fools, all the time the greater 
part of Europe was advancing in peace to a state of gen- 
eral culture and civilization such as it had never known 
before, and such as it never knew again until the nine- 
teenth century." 

We must not forget the sub-title "a sur- 
vey of Roman culture and civilization." Mr. 
Stobart has little good to say of the literature 
and art of the Republic; after appreciative 
sketches of Cicero, Livy, and Lucretius, and of 
such relics of Republican architecture as the 
Tabularium and the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, 
his conclusion is as follows : 

" On the whole, the verdict must go against Rome 
at any rate republican Rome as regards artistic 
originality. The Rome of Cicero's day was amazingly 
rich and dreadfully poor. It had a high culture in some 
respects, but it was too corrupt, morally and politically, 
to produce good work of its own. If there had been 
any possible rival in the field, Rome would assuredly 
have perished in the course of that distracted century 
(the first before Christ). If she had perished then, what 
would she have left to the world ? A few second-hand 
comedies, Lucretius and Cicero ; a small equivalent 
for all the blood that she had shed, and all the groans 
of her provincials." 

Without its illustrations, the book would be 
good, even fascinating, reading, as any short 
extract from it would show. But with them the 
grandeur that was Rome is adequately visu- 
alized; and so, in the words of the author, " the 
pictures are an integral part of my scheme." 
About a hundred fine plates in photogravure, 
collotype, and half-tone give some idea of the 
Roman greatness in architecture and portrait 
sculpture. Baalbek and Palmyra in the East, 
Timgad in Africa, Italy, Provence, and Spain 
all are represented by familiar, and unfamiliar, 
buildings, statues, and busts. The list of illus- 
trations, too, contains a description of each 
picture, leaving the reader in no doubt as to the 
location, date, and significance of the subjects. 

Several maps, a limited bibliography, a chro- 
nological summary, and a good index, complete 
the usefulness of this sumptuous volume, which, 
notwithstanding its tone of parti pris, may 
possibly be placed at the head of the list as 
" best general work " on ancient Rome. 

JOSIAH RENICK SMITH. 



THE DRAMAS OF GERHART HAITPTMANX.* 



Professor Lewisohn's faithful , and sympa- 
thetic English translations of Gerhart Haupt- 
mann's plays show a true appreciation of the 
fine poetic quality in the work of Germany's 
greatest present-day dramatist, as well as a rare 
knowledge of the subtleties of the German lan- 
guage and of its perplexing dialects. He helps 
us understand the large humanity which is 
Hauptmann's basic creed, and he guides us un- 
erringly through occasional mazes of symbolism. 

Hauptmann is not a standard-bearer for any 
ism or literary cult, nor the exponent of a sub- 
versive moral philosophy. He states the facts 
of life simply and profoundly, because he has a 
divinatory understanding of what the time-spirit 
demands, and of the revolutionary forces that 
are stirring beneath the surface of contemporary 
life. 

In his first sociological drama, " Before Sun- 
rise," he voices a plea for the children whose 
right to be well-born and well-reared has been 
denied them. Itspremiere in 1889 was the scene 
of wildly contesting opinions. It roused the 
public as well as the critics to indignant protest. 
How could a mere stripling dare to reveal the 
mystery and the tragedy in that threatening 
dictum, "the sins of the father shall be visited 
upon the children"? Ibsen had done this two 
decades before; and a horrified public had re- 
belled, only to be convinced later that nothing 
could silence the intrepid Norwegian's protests 
against the social order. More deeply even than 
than its purpose, the crass realism of the drama 
offended the critics. If they had been able to 
sense its dominant motif, Helene's plea for 
her right to a heritage of moral and physical 
health in her pitiful struggle against her envi- 
ronment, it would have meant more to them 
than a disclosure of conveniently concealed 
wrongdoing. 

Hauptmann found inspiration in his native 
heath, its people, its folk-lore, and most of all in 
its social needs. His early environment shaped 
his attitude toward our perplexing social prob- 
lems. Stirring tales of the Silesian weavers and 
of the injustice of the economic conditions under 
which they labored were recalled at the bidding 
of his genius. The terrible climax in 1844, when 
the hatred in the hearts of the miserable weavers 
against their oppressors incited them to lawless 
deeds, furnished the subject-matter for his 
drama, " The Weavers.'* History verifies the

facts upon which Hauptmann bases this magni- 
ficent depiction of a hopeless revolt. The sullen 
brutality of certain types is revealed with grim 
truth, and yet the drama conveys its own spirit- 
ual message in its appeal for social betterment. 

Neither "The Beaver Coat" nor "The 
Conflagration " are good stage plays. As read- 
ing dramas they are unique, principally so 
through their portrayal of the hypocritical, 
thieving, and cleverly unscrupulous Mrs. Wolff - 
Fielitz. Here Hauptmann's predilection for 
psychological analysis has ample scope. Ho- 
garth's satiric pencil might have done justice 
to the types he portrays, and the lives some of 
them are forced to lead as the dupes of a 
designing woman. 

Volume II. of the new collected edition con- 
tains three dramas of social revolt. " Drayman 
Henschel " is a sombre picture of the undoing 
of an honest, simple-minded man through the 
misdeeds of a woman. " Rose Bernd," a drama 
of compelling force, excels in the poignant note 
of its moral preachment: a well-grounded 
protest against the accepted code of condemning 
women for the same moral lapses which we 
condone in men. In Rose's case those who 
denied her right to be lovingly and justly dealt 
with are even more to blame for her crime than 
our inconsistent social laws. The girl's despair- 
ing cry, " No one has ever loved me enough ! " 
implies a terrible accusation. The invalid wife 
of the man who caused the girl's downfall is 
one of the finest characters in Hauptmann's 
marvellous gallery of women. Her heart goes 
out to the sorely-tried girl in an agony of 
sympathy ; and by conquering the revolt in her 
own soul, she tries to befriend her. Hauptmann 
is temperamentally akin to Tolstoi. Like the 
great Russian in " The Power of Darkness," he 
lights an abyss of guilt and despair with a ray 
of divine pity. He has a splendid comprehen- 
sion of the disturbing issues that are unsettling 
time-honored standards, and his understanding 
sympathy guides his pen when he pictures the 
soul agonies of men and women who lack the 
strength to battle against temptation. 

Strindberg, the arch-naturalist, tells us that 
"the true, the great naturalism seeks out those 
points of life where the greatest conflicts occur. 
It loves to see what is not to be seen every day. 
It rejoices in the battle of elemental powers, 
whether they be called love or hatred, noble or 
revolting instincts. It cares not whether they 
be beautiful or ugly, so that they be only great." 
In Hauptmann's naturalistic dramas this ele- 
ment of greatness predominates. Since " Before 



Dawn" made dramatic history, he has entered 
a new poetic realm in his best-known drama, 
"The Sunken Bell," and in "The Assumption 
of Hannele," with results that have established 
his fame as a poet. But, after all, he excels in 
the bold and subtle depiction of souls struggling 
for light. Often, as in "The Rats," his lurid 
pictures of moral degradation obscure his ideal- 
istic outlook. This Berlin "tragi-comedy" deals 
with all sorts and conditions of burrowing, sneak- 
ing humanity, who are living in moral darkness. 
The piteous, impelling motive in the drama is 
a lonely, heart-hungry woman's longing to call 
a child her own. She adopts the illegitimate 
offspring of a poor emigrant girl and passes it 
off as her child. Contrary to the bargain they 
made, the girl demands her child back, under 
threats of telling the truth about it. The woman 
then casts caution and reason to the winds, and 
begins to enmesh herself in a web of crime and 
deceit, until at last she ends her life in despair. 
The grey background of actuality, darkened by 
human derelicts and failures, is brightened by 
the poor creature's mother-love. 

We realize the autobiographical note in 
Hauptmann's great symbolic fairy drama, "The 
Sunken Bell." Written after the failure of the 
kaleidoscopic historic play, "Florian Geyer," 
it is a despairing confession of his own inability 
to reach the heights, a stage at which every 
great artist gives us of his best. The bell, 
which sounds in the valley, but not on the heights, 
where mortal man tries in vain to live, untram- 
melled by duties and conventions, can never 
ring harmoniously until man is strong enough 
to subordinate his material desires to his ideal- 
istic aims. Aside from its symbolic significance, 
this drama must be classed as the best of Ger- 
man poetic fantasies. The verse is beautiful, 
and the author opens vistas of pantheistic life 
that make his fairy world seem very real to us. 

Hauptmann's vindictive J' accuse! is the 
keynote of "Hannele," a thrilling revelation of 
cruelty, poverty, and the transfiguring faith of 
childhood. The drama ranks high as an imagi- 
native dream poem, and it reflects its author's 
humanitarian point of view as regards the chil- 
dren of the poor, their misery, their longings, 
and their comforting faith. 

Continued success often hampers the creative 
artist in his efforts to give expression to the 
problems which a struggling world presents to 
him. Under the spell of his own creations his 
ideal is likely to lead him astray, on paths 
that promise glory for little effort. Production 
becomes too easy. In Hauptmann's case the

two comedies, "The Maids of the Mount" and 
"Schluck and Jan," as well as the bewilder- 
ing glassworks fable, " And Pippa Dances," 
typify this transition stage. 

The drama, "Lonely Lives," is dedicated to 
those who have lived them, and they are 
legion, though most of them avert the tragical 
outcome by their stoic acquiescence. "The 
tragedy of life is in not knowing the tragedy in 
our lives." When the young are set at vari- 
ance with the old because they try to readjust 
their lives to their enlarged vision and to the 
demands of a changing world, conflicts are 
bound to occur. John Vockerat rebels against 
a paternalism that warps and stunts his better 
self, and against the submissiveness and utter 
self-effacement of a wife who does not under- 
stand his aims. The climax comes when the 
woman who is destined to be his true soulmate 
appears on the scene. It is this woman of 
advanced ideas who flies from the responsibility 
which a union with him would have imposed on 
her. "You have broken me ! " is his accusation 
against his parents and his wife when death 
seems his only refuge. Of such is the kingdom 
of tragic failures ! 

Only the Superman, " the symbol of humanity 
raised to its highest power," can feel the right 
pity for his fellow-man, according to Friedrich 
Nietzsche. Pity for the weak he considers 
harmful, inasmuch as it aids in spreading a cult 
of misery. Nietzscheism is a powerful factor in 
shaping the trend of thought in Germany to-day, 
since its principles are no longer questions of 
casuistry, but part of the ethics of our common 
life. Hauptmann exemplifies this conception 
of pity most significantly in " Michael Kraemer," 
the soul tragedy of an erratic old artist, magni- 
ficently strong in his allegiance to the highest 
ideals of his art, but pitiably weak in his human 
relations. His daughter Michaline is a Super- 
woman in her understanding of his aims, and 
in her pity for the mediocre talent which can 
never achieve the ideal he strives for. In this 
splendid girl Hauptmann lays bare the very 
soul-fibres of the modern woman, with her 
longing for freedom from all fetters and for the 
unhampered development of her individuality. 

" Our Colleague Crampton " is the story of 
a dissolute genius, led back to a life of decency 
by his daughter, whose pity for his vagaries is 
a result of her unswerving devotion, after his 
wife has left him. 

Peace as the dream of the future of a warring 
family is the theme of " The Reconciliation." 
An ill-considered marriage is the basis of all the 



trouble, and an unselfish girl's pitying love re- 
deems one son, and will probably bring about a 
life of content. Hauptmann's clairvoyant vision 
makes him probe deep in revealing these con- 
ditions in modern family life. 

Few of the legends which have enriched the 
folk-lore of the world carry their human appeal 
as directly as do the epic poems of the trouba- 
dours. Hauptmann's unusual dramatic version 
of " Henry of Aue" casts this entrancing tale 
of the soul- woes of an erring man and the regen- 
erative power of unselfish love into a sympathetic 
modern form. Its portrayal of the superstitions 
and abounding faith of mediasval life and its 
true reflection of the eternally human are deter- 
mining factors in predicting immortality for 
this great epic. 

Boccaccio's Griselda legend has furnished 
the theme for many fanciful tales. Hauptmann 
modernizes Griselda in a way to bring her close 
to us. Her revolt against mediseval conditions 
of tyranny in marriage is quite like the modern 
woman's rebellion against what she considers 
hindrances to her cherished dream of self- 
fulfilment. 

Men and women of the modern subversive 
type, in a setting full of contrasts and conflicts, 
challenge Hauptmann's genius for naturalistic 
portrayal in the five-act prose drama, " Gabriel 
Schilling's Flight." The vampire of ultra- 
modern propensities is depicted as one of those 
trouble-breeding affinities who are becoming 
more and more dangerous in this day of 
unsettling moral precepts. 

If we look upon Gerhart Hauptmann as a 
world poet, one whose magic art reflects the 
changing currents of thought in his own coun- 
try, a country whose literary standards are 
helping to formulate ideals the world over, 
this new English edition of his dramas ought to 
hold a promise for closer spiritual communion in 
the future, through this interpretation of some 
of the greatest works in modern literature.

A PHILOSOPHY OF FICTION.* 

When a novelist and dramatist of such 
distinction as Mr. John Galsworthy addresses 
his audience in the first person through a volume 
of essays, his utterance has of course the interest 
that attaches to any confession of a successful 
practitioner. But Mr. Galsworthy's new volume 
is not so much a confession as an exposition, 

*THK INN OF TKANQUILLJTY. Studies and Essays by 
John Galsworthy. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



504 



THE DIAL 



[June 16 



more direct than his novels and dramas, of his 
philosophy ; for all his books are permeated by 
a philosophy deeply rooted in human nature. 
These essays, therefore, as well as giving inten- 
sity and definiteness to our appreciation of his 
fiction, are an exposition of a type of mind and 
philosophy. 

The enchanting first part of the volume, 
" Concerning Life," is a series of studies based 
on incidents of varying interest and power but 
always thought-provoking. Merest trifles are 
here brought into the centre of attention, 
examined, and found possessed of profound 
significance. Here we find Galsworthy the 
artist as well as the thinker. One reads and 
re-reads with delight such prose poems as 
"Magpie Over the Hill," a poignant tale of 
sacred and profane love; or " Riding in Mist," 
a lyric of strange exaltation in presence of 
danger; or "Romance Three Gleams." The 
thorough thoughtfulness, the delicate sensitive- 
ness, the complete expression of these sketches 
give them rare distinction. 

In the second section, " Concerning Letters," 
although the meditative essay mood prevails 
and gives charm and intimacy, the purpose of 
the author seems to be to develop in a more 
systematic way his philosophy of literature. His 
magic word is Truth. He does not mean that the 
purpose of fiction is to teach, to give facts, or 
indeed that it should have any purpose at all. To 
use his own figure, the novelist is as a lantern- 
bearer in a dark street, who directs people neither 
in one direction nor another, who is not criticizing 
the condition of the street, who has no word of 
praise or condemnation for anything, but who 
is merely bringing light into the street that 
people may see things as they are. Let the 
novelist or dramatist but sincerely attempt to 
tell the truth, and the public will all the more 
surely take to themselves, even though with 
much resistance and discomfort, the moral 
contained therein. If the story is true it has a 
moral,, for "every grouping of life and character 
has its inherent moral." Detachment is therefore 
essential to the artist. He must worship Truth 
in an impersonal way, not for any immediate 
practical purpose. 

" It is certain that to the making of good drama, as 
tp the practice of every other act, there must be 
brought an almost passionate love of discipline, a 
white-heat of self-respect, a desire to make the truest, 
fairest, best thing in one's power; and that to these 
must be added eyes that do not flinch. Such qualities 
alone will bring to a drama the selfless character which 
soaks it with inevitability." 

Such is the demand truth-telling fiction 



makes upon the writer. In what mood is the 
reader to receive it, and how is it to serve him? 
To liberate one from himself, to help him out 
of his own personality with its limitations and 
wants, into the realm of the impersonal, where 
Perfection reigns, is the pleasant function of art. 
" For, what is grievous, doubting, grim, about our 
lives is that we are shut up within ourselves, with an 
itch to get outside ourselves. And to be stolen away 
from ourselves by Art is a momentary relaxation from 
that itching, a minute's profound, and as it were secret 
enfranchisement. The active amusements and relaxa- 
tions of life can only rest certain of our faculties, by 
indulging others; the whole self is never rested save 
through that unconsciousness of self, which comes 
through rapt contemplation of Nature or Art." 

There is a compelling charm in this philoso- 
phy of the impersonal, a charm which belongs 
to every work of art that can be called perfect. 
One feels the same sense of security in the com- 
pleteness and finality of Plato's world of Ideas. 
It is this detachment, the essence of the aesthetic 
attitude, that is so much cultivated by the more 
ambitious contemporary artists in fiction. Per- 
sonal energism here gives way "to the philosophy 
that craves perfection, to the spirit that desires 
the golden mean, and hankers for the serene 
and balanced seat in the centre of the see-saw." 

But while there is no denying the attractive- 
ness of this philosophy of perfection, one hesi- 
tates to yield fully to it. It recognizes, after 
all, only the values of Truth and Beauty. There 
is no place for the " glory of the imperfect," the 
denial of which leads to a subtle pessimism 
observable in Mr. Galsworthy and others, and 
erroneously attributed by them to despair as 
regards truth. There is a form of pessimism 
due to atrophied spiritual nature, to lack of 
sympathetic activity among men. Euripides, 
Shakespeare, and Ibsen, as Mr. Galsworthy 
says, have been accused of pessimism because 
they have bravely told truth, held the mirror 
up to nature. He is almost ready to measure 
greatness by the intensity of the charge of pes- 
simism. But these are truly great men, not even 
directly in proportion to their passion for Truth, 
indispensable as that is for a great man, but in 
proportion to their creative power and depth of 
understanding. 

Mr. Galsworthy's temperament is essentially 
of the critical and disciplinary type. His severity 
of thought and taste is especially welcome in an 
age continually running rampant in religion and 
art. To discipline must be admitted a worthy 
service. And yet, one must ask, would it have 
been a greater achievement to inspire ?

RAMBLES ix ANDALUSIA.* 



Southern Spain looks to-day like a vast 
garden, and so probably it has looked for a 
thousand years, which is about the period since 
the Moors began to cultivate it. Mr. Paul 
Gwynne writes of this delightful region in his 
new volume, " Along Spain's River of Ro- 
mance," calling it the Tarshish of the Bible, 
and doubting the sanity of Jonah who chose 
this heaven-blessed land in which " to flee from 
the presence of the Lord." At any rate the 
district is to-day still primitive, romantic, and 
unspoiled for the curious traveller. 

To gather his material the author has carried 
out the novel plan of following the length of a 
great river valley, finding such a route "more 
natural than lines of latitude and longitude 
and far more sympathetic than a railway." He 
chooses the valley of the Guadalquivir, which 
stretches from the eastern heights of the penin- 
sula entirely across Andalusia to the western 
coast. Travelling mule-back with an able and 
most companionable guide, he journeys leisurely 
along this "passionate" valley a direct con- 
trast to his own "chaste" Thames and visits 
many little-known towns, such as Villacarrillo, 
Ubeda, Baeza, Torralba, Menjibar, Anduja, 
Bujalance. 

Account of the daily happenings, the thoughts 
suggested by these happenings, and occasional 
chapters on native customs make up the book. 
Many passages, written on the spot, bring the 
scenes described vividly before us. Thus the 
sweltering heat and terrific dust of an Anda- 
lusian mid-day are depicted as follows : 

" We sought every morsel of shade that was to be 
found by the way: if only a telephone pole threw its 
slim shadow along the road, Angel duly steered his mule 
along the shadow. . . . Every time his mule passed 
mine it would exchange a glance of deep sympathy with 
the animal that I rode, whilst my own beast would sigh 
profoundly and look fixedly ahead as who should say, 
' In the far future it will not always be like this. Some 
day a biped with intelligence will ride me. He will 
beat me perhaps, and twist my tail, but he will do it in 
the shade not in this furnace of flies.' . . . There 
were three square inches of shade under an acacia 
opposite, and we leapt or rather descended, from our 
mules with what alacrity was vouchsafed to us, and tied 
them to the tree. I distinctly saw Angel's beast shrug 
his shoulders. My own steed looked up and down the 
village once only, then closed its eyes. . . . There was no 
footpath, just nothing but a road so deep in dust that rats 
could have burrowed along without your seeing them." 

The delightful leisure of this unhurried part 
of the world is indicated in the following : 

* ALONG SPAIN'S RIVER OF ROMANCE. (The Guadal- 
quivir.) By Paul Gwynne. Illustrated in color, etc. New 
York : McBride, Nast & Co. 



" Whilst the barber lathers you, the man who awaits 
your seat appears to regard the respite as a gift of 
providence. He spreads himself mentally and physically, 
to enjoy the golden hour in conversation and a cigarette. 
He offers his tobacco-case to your barber, who pauses 
to avail himself of the courtesy. Each chats and makes 
himself a cigarette. Something attracts their attention 
in the square below, and they go to the window. . . . 
The barber and your eventual supplanter draw in their 
heads with a sigh. There is not sufficient matter in the 
street for comment, but at least it is good to have 
looked out upon a world so well sunned and watered, 
and to have drawn in a breath of such solid satisfaction. 

" The barber now begins to strop his razor, whilst 
the other person opens out a paper and puts up his legs 
on a vacant chair." 

The value and charm of Mr. Gwynne's 
book consist in just such fresh impressions as 
these, and also in definite information concerning 
out-of-the-way places gathered at first-hand. 
We are told that Quesada lies too high for 
oranges to flourish, but that the olive thrives 
there and that oil is made. Also that Montoro 
produces the finest quality of oil, and that nearly 
two million olive trees surround the town. 
Everything seen is recorded with great minute- 
ness. Trees and plants are named, date 
palms, oranges, lemons, loquats, pepper trees, 
pines, evergreen oaks, cork trees, walnuts, 
poplars, and many others. If Mr. Gwynne 
enters a house he gives us a description of the 
furnishings. The people met are duly questioned, 
and their conversation dutifully set down. 

" A boy had just filled two great earthen bottles with 
water and was strapping them on to a donkey's back 
when we arrived, the donkey browsing in spite of jerks 
and tugs at the straps. 

"We asked him what sort of people they were in 
Morente and El Carpio. He said that the inhabitants 
of Morente were honest enough folk, very decent in 
fact. But those of El Carpio were known in all the 
countryside for their treacherous and lying nature ; they 
had a notoriety that stank ten leagues off. I asked him 
where he came from. He said that, thank God, he was 
born in Morente, whither he set the head of his donkey 
soon afterwards, and went off singing to himself." 

Numerous legends, popular tales, and super- 
stitions are interestingly woven into the record 
of every-day happenings. A number of chapters 
describe particular Spanish types or customs. 
Thus we find detailed accounts of the character- 
istics of the senorito flamenco, the majo, and 
the ninos de la mena, as well as a full discussion 
of the capa, in love, in war, and in many more 
of its 33,944 uses. It is pleasant to note, on 
account of the rarity of the occurrence in En- 
glish books, that Spanish words are spelled and 
used correctly. 

Mr. Gwynne's account of the geological up- 
heavals which separated Spain from Africa and 
formed the existing mountains and valleys may

RHYTHM IN ENGLISH PROSE.* 



In his "History of English Prose Rhythm,'' 
Professor Saintsbury has added another imposing 
volume to the long series with which he bids fair to 
fill a "five-foot shelf" of his own books. This latest 
contribution shows the traits familiar to Professor 
Saintsbury 's readers for some forty years now, 
and all of them even more strongly marked than 
before : ultra-Toryism, delight in cudgel-play, inex- 
haustible robustness and gusto, prof useness both of 
matter and of statement, and a catholicity or 
should we say indiscriminateness ? of vocabulary 
that reminds one of Burton's translation of the 
"Arabian Nights." Only one new trait appears: 
the attacks that his last four or five volumes have 
drawn upon him have made him, as he puts it, most 
astonishingly "cautious in fending off carps." And 
I seem to find him more frequently and genuinely 
than before admitting the possible fallibility of some 
of his conclusions. His style may be irritating to 
many it is to me but it reveals the man himself, 
quite unashamed, as he recognizes humorously when 
he speaks of "almost innumerable forms of individ- 
ual eccentricity, from those of Carlyle and Meredith 
to those of Cluvienus and myself." Nevertheless, 
the book is notable, both as the first extensive and 
comprehensive study of its subject, and as funda- 
mentally sound and discriminating. 

Inasmuch as the only predecessors whom Profes- 
sor Saintsbury mentions are Bishop Hurd and John 
Mason, both about the middle of the eighteenth 
century, it is well to begin with a brief statement 
of the investigations of two more recent men, who 
approach the subject in ways sufficiently different 
to be of service in discussing the volume under 
review. In the "Proceedings of the Modern 
Language Association" for 1904, Professor F. N. 
Scott published a paper on "The Most Fundamental 
Differentia of Poetry and Prose," and in 1905 
another on "The Scansion of Prose Rhythm." In 
the first paper he searches into primitive causes of 
expression to find the difference. He concludes 
that in the beginning vocal utterance was for the 
sake of giving vent to emotion or for the sake of 
communication. Very often, indeed, it served both 
purposes, though nearly always with one intention 
dominant. In both kinds of expression he finds a 
rhythm, a tendency for the voice to rise and then 
to fall, since "for physiological and psychological 

* A HISTORY OF ENGLISH PROSE RHYTHM. By George 
Saintsbury. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



reasons all vocal utterances are rhythmical." In the 
expression of emotion the rhythms tend to repeat 
regularly, that is, metrically ; in expression for com- 
munication the rhythms vary in length. In prose 
literature, he maintains, the rhythm is always there 
unless a writer is so hampered by his notions of 
grammar and of conventional expression that his 
writing has little in common with speech. In the 
second paper Professor Scott plots the curves of 
these prose rhythms, and finds two main classes. 
In the first the climax is at the apex of the curve, 
in the second it is somewhere on the down-stroke 
of the curve, usually near the apex. Both of these 
classes vary infinitely in their length, in the length 
of the two phases of the curve, and in the presence 
of minor apexes in the course of both phases; also, 
the two kinds are not infrequently combined. Pro- 
fessor Scott does not attempt to judge the excellence 
of any particular rhy thmed prose ; he merely insists 
that rhythm is almost inevitably present. If I 
report him correctly, however, he intimates that the 
rhythm grows more marked as the prose grows 
more oratorical. 

In 1910, Mr. P. Fijn van Draat of Utrecht pub- 
lished in Anglistische Forschungen a treatise of 
145 pages on "Rhythm in English Prose," which 
he has since supplemented by papers in Anglia- for 
April and November, 1912. In his introductory 
paragraphs he tells us how he happened upon his 
quest and what his goal is. 

"I had been reading Bernard Shaw's 'You Never Can 
Tell,' and laid down the book, inwardly thanking the author 
for the pleasant evening he had given me. . . . Presently I 
began to ponder why in this lilting title, ' Yon never can 
tell,' the adverb ' never ' in spite of all rules of grammar 
preceded the auxiliary. ' You can never tell ' it ought to 
have been. But no sooner had I changed the word-order 
than I found that the great charm of the title was gone. 
Where was the curious lilt that had given the words that 
haunting ring ? No, there could be no doubt about it : in 
the face of all grammar the title should be : ' You never 
can tell.' And none other. 

"So the ordinary word -order had been departed from for 
the sake of this pleasing lilt, this rhythmical movement. Was 
this a solitary instance, or as was more natural to suppose 
had the striving after rhythmical movement conscious 
or unconscious made itself felt in any other way? Would 
it give us a cue to a few at least of the unsolved problems 
of grammar ? The more I turned the subject over in my 
mind the more I became convinced that I had struck gold ; 
that not one or two, but a dozen, phenomena, unaccounted 
for until now, ceased to puzzle me the moment I approached 
them from this point of view. It suddenly became clear 
now why in Old English we seldom read about 'Aelfred 
cyng ' but about ' Aelfred cyniny.' I could now account for 
the use of the preposition ' to ' after the verb ' to dare ' in : 
4 He has not dared to do it ' ; while its absence became 
equally clear in : ' How dare you do it ? ' and in ' He dare 
not do it.' " 

Mr. van Draat's assumptions about the relations 
of prose and poetry are fairly indicated by the sen- 
tence (from Minor's "Neuhochdeutsche Metrik") 
which serves as a motto for his first chapter: "The 
history of poetry teaches that it is precisely in highly 
developed literature that we find uncertainty about 
the boundaries between poetry and prose; there 
arise an unrhythmed poetry and a rhythmic prose." 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



507 



I question whether the statement thus unequivocally 
made is either very useful or precisely true ; I think 
we shall find Professor Saintsbury's statement of the 
case distinctly better. Of the importance of poetry 
for this investigation, Mr. van Draat says (p. 8) : 

"Now, while an unrhythmical prose-writer is by no means 
an exception, an unrhythmical poet is a contradiction in 
terms, the essence of poetry as far as the outward form is 
concerned being rhythm. ['Metre' is the better word 
here.] Whereas in prose, therefore, the rhythmical prin- 
ciple in the use of to after to make is observed only occasion- 
ally, in poetry it is carried through systematically, and it is 
for this reason that we make poetry our guide ; here we 
shall find a systematic application of every rhythmical device 
to which the prose-language occasionally has recourse." 

Farther on he says (p. 14) : 

" When we speak of rhythmical prose we do not mean, of 
course, unbroken, uninterrupted rhythmical movement ; but 
prose that evinces a tendency to form rhythm-groups; to 
hold closer together, by means of rhythm, words that logi- 
cally belong together." 

In keeping with this dictum, he naturally concludes 
that since poetry is dominated by four measures, 
therefore, in rhythmic prose 

" We shall avoid a succession of three or more unstressed 
syllables, and that no rhythmic prose is possible when many 
unstressed words come together ; if they do, some stress is 
involuntarily laid upon one of them, unless the sense pro- 
hibits it." 

Fortunately, since all of his investigations turn 
upon the insertion or omission of one syllable, or 
upon the shifting of accent in certain dissyllables, or 
upon shifting word-order (such as the split infinitive, 
which he defends at length and successfully), his 
questionable statements of larger matters do not 
affect the validity of his conclusions about the effect 
of rhythm on English grammar. He praises very 
highly the Authorized Version, but leaves Professor 
Saintsbury to exhaust his vocabulary and his ridicule 
upon the unhappy Revisers. 

With neither of these investigations has Professor 
Saintsbury much in common: he is not primarily 
interested either in Volkpsychologie or in philology. 
His whole concern is with the artistic history of 
" the other harmony." Let me first take up his 
theory. Professor Saintsbury takes as his motto 
Quintilian's dictum that " we cannot speak except 
in short or long syllables, of which feet are made" 
a principle that, in English at least, slurs or 
ignores the immense number of syllables which 
are, strictly, neither short nor long; and indeed 
Professor Saintsbury recognizes this qualification 
constantly in his scansions, and occasionally in his 
comments. But no one, I think, will quarrel with 
him for accepting as a fundamental axiom the very 
earliest attempt to discriminate between prose and 
poetry Aristotle's description of prose as " neither 
possessing metre nor destitute of rhythm." Much of 
his book is given to illustrating and enlarging upon 
this distinction. Of verse, for instance, he says 
(p. 342): 

" In it the rhythm is always arranged correspondingly, 
though sometimes in a very intricate correspondence, with 
the answering parts at considerable distances one from an- 
other, and though large substitution of equivalent rhythmical 



units is in some cases permitted. In other words, the principle 
of sameness is that which is at the bottom of it, though this 
sameness may be, and in all the very best poetry always is, 
allied with as much variety as is consistent with its preser- 
vation. And one main, if not all but autocratic and automatic, 
means of securing this is the division into ' lines ' or ' verses,' 
which, in iheir recurrence, bring out this identity in 
diversity." 

The scansion of rhythmical prose, however, he tells 
us (p. 344), 

" Is arranged on a principle totally different, and indeed 
opposed, when compared with that of poetry. Instead of 
sameness, equivalence, and recurrence, the central idea turns, 
on difference, inequality, and variety. And though a certain 
amount of correspondence is introduced by the necessary 
presence of the identical quantity-combinations called feet, 
these are to be so arranged that they will not constitute 
metre" 

In his final classification, Professor Saintsbury 
has four forms or groups of forms : 

"I. Poetry or metre. 

" II. Unmetrical or only partially metrical poetry, which, 
however, retains the arrangement of ' verse,' or division into 
sections not identical but corresponding with one another, 
definitely separated by a considerable pause, which is not 
determined strictly by the sense. [Here belong Ossian, 
Blake, and Whitman.] 

" III. Fully but strictly rhythmical prose. 

" IV. Prose in which rhythm, though present, is subordi- 
nated to other considerations." 

The third of these divisions is the main subject 
of this book, with only such attention to the fourth 
as is necessary for discussing the prevalence, char- 
acter, and quality of the third at various periods. 
Almost inevitably, Professor Saintsbury puts Sir 
Thomas Browne at the absolute apex of accomplish- 
ment in what he calls " symphonic or polyphonic" 
rhythm. Of this " ornate style " he remarks 
(p. 203): 

"It is obvious that extremely, delicately, and compli- 
catedly rhythmed prose of this kind is by no means exten- 
sively or universally fit for what has been called ' the 
instrument of the average purpose.' . . . That style is in- 
trinsically unsuitable for direct and methodical exposition ; 
doubtfully and only occasionally suitable for plain narration ; 
critically impossible as a vehicle of conversation, scientific 
instruction, practical argument, and the whole range or 
ranges of what is succinctly called ' business.' The very 
users of it confess this in various ways. We want, as 
Beatrice says, ' another for working days.' " 

Of this plainer prose he says (p. 424) : 

"We have seen that in the seventeenth -eighteenth century 
sober style, though you can apply the system of quantitative 
scansion as you can to almost everything spoken or written 
by an educated Englishman the process has, in differing 
degrees, but more or less uniformly in kind, a certain air of 
superfluity and unnaturalness. It neither evolves nor ex- 
plains any music : it merely shows that there is little or none 
to be explained or evolved." 

It follows naturally that Professor Saintsbury 
does not assign the highest rank to any prose that 
is markedly rhetorical or oratorical, although he 
does grant considerable importance to the part 
rhetoric has played in awakening men to the possi- 
bilities of decorative prose. He points out, for 
example (p. 108), that 

" Logical arrangement of thought, though it has sometimes 
failed to be rhythmical, lends itself with remarkable ease to 
rhythmical arrangement. The barest syllogism has a cer- 



508

tain rhythm ; and when that syllogism is clothed and ex- 
tended rhetorically, it is the fault of the writer if he does 
not develop the rhythm likewise." 

And in discussing "Euphues " he remarks that 
" The everlasting see-saw of antithetic balance almost inev- 
itably spoils the rhythm which it is intended to provide. 
. . There is rhythm ; but its perpetual correspondences, 
more or less clumsily fulfilled, defeat the purpose, fail to 
pay the debt of the elusive, undulating, and continually 
various harmony of prose " (p. 131^. 

But he concludes that 

" After all, whatever be the foibles of Euphuism, it stands 
for the first deliberate and elaborate attempt at making 
prose ornamental, and bringing it into definite decorative 
order" (p. 133). 

Judged by his standards of rhythm, oratory rarely 
deserves high praise, for, as he says at the beginning 
of his discussion of Burke (p. 273) oratorical rhythm 
per se (as has been observed almost to satiety, no 
doubt) is somewhat limited. But a few pages later 
he quotes the famous passage beginning "It is now 
sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen 
of France, then the Dauphiness, at Versailles," and 
after admitting its sentimentality, he declares that 
anyone who 

"Can regard it impartially ... will be puzzled to find in 
English for more than a century before it, a more beautiful 
passage merely as harmonious phrase. The rhythm is still 
generally of the kind we have been discussing stepped 
and paralleled and. balanced. Except in these ways, the 
author's chief device of variation and harmonic contrast is 
connected (as we have seen had become usual since Addison) 
with the ends of the clauses and sentences ' years ' and 
' at Versailles.'; ' orb,' ' touch,' but then f vision '; the descents 
of the next two sentences to the contrasted syllables of ' joy ' 
and 'fall '; and so throughout. But, in its own way,. in the 
juxtaposition of long sentences and short; of rising and 
falling clauses ; even, a new thing to be thought of, or rather 
an old one revived, in the vowel-sound of the paralleled 
word-groups ' that sensibility of principle ,' ' that chastity of 
honour,' the thing is a masterpiece a little in bravura 
perhaps to those who, while doing its form justice, do not 
sympathise with its matter, but certainly something much 
above bravura to those who do " (p. 211.).. 

Many passages of De Quincey he praises highly 
(once he even says that " Browne might have written 
some"), but of the famous "Bishop of Beauvais!" 
peroration of his " Joan of Arc " he complains that 
" It is noisy, and blares, which rhythmical prose should 
never do, though verse sometimes may. The moment that 
one note in prose so overpowers the next that you cannot 
attend to it, the error of oratorical style, and the Augustan 
system, returns" (p. 309). 

And he remarks of De Quincey, Wilson, and Landor 
that 

" In fact, all these pioneers of polyphonic prose are apt, and 
naturally enough apt, to slip into the harangue, and in so 
doing to revert to the old alternation of antithesis and bal- 
ance, instead of the continuous meander of true rhythmical 
prose that is not oratory " (p. 324). 

Finally, in his Conclusion, he points out in some 
detail the defects of the qualities of oratory which 
deny to it the highest flights of true rhythmical 
prose (p. 463) : 

" In actual spoken oratory, or in very rhetorical written 
passages, epanaphora may be effective ; but it is too rough 
and boisterous an instrument for higher prose, nor can the 
looser rhythm tame and train it as does the stricter metre. 



And, once more, it and all forms of repetition, down to the 
careless recurrence of a single word except in a markedly 
different sense, without any special rhythmical stress on it, 
are dangerous, because they are in a manner rebel to the 
same great Law of Variety. Epanaphora and similar forms 
of repetition are good (when not abused) in verse, because 
they are in accordance with its Law of Recurrence. They 
are bad in prose for an exactly corresponding reason.'' 

So much for Professor Saintsbury's theory, which, 
however obvious in some respects and debatable in 
others, has nevertheless this merit: it sets forth in 
discriminating terms and from a consistent point of 
view the varieties of rhythmed prose in English. 
And the discrimination is the important thing. We 
need not, for example, agree with his ranking of 
oratory, but he has made clear that the rhythms of 
the orators are not like the rhythms of Browne and 
Taylor and Newman and Pater and Ruskin. 

His scansion the practical application of his 
theory to details of rhythm is thoroughly charac- 
teristic. At the outset he gives us a Table of Feet 
in which he marshals, with all the pomp and circum- 
stance of their classical names, the various feet which 
he finds in rhythmical prose. In this table, besides 
the four dissyllabic feet and the three trisyllabic 
ones common in our English verse, he musters five 
of three syllables, ten of four syllables (all, by the 
way, reducible to combinations of dissyllabic feet), 
and ends with the "dochmiac," which convenient 
epithet applies to any foot of five syllables in 
whatever combination of short and long. In a note 
he adds that "Monosyllabic feet, with the syllable 
necessarily long, are very frequent." 

The most interesting of these feet is the dochmiac, 
of which he says : " In English prose those contain- 
ing two long and three short are perhaps the com- 
monest, arranged in their different combinations. 
One long and four short, similarly varied, is not 
uncommon ; and three longs with two shorts inter- 
vening may be found ; but more than three longs, I 
think, never." Now, since Professor Saintsbury 
rather scorns statistics, I could not resist the tempta- 
tion to check up his deductions by an appeal to his 
own practice. Out of the first hundred dochmiacs 
which he marks in his scansions, two-thirds have 
only one long syllable, and only two have three longs 
(in both cases the first three syllables). Of the five 
possible varieties with only one long, he did not mark 
any in which the long syllable is the first of the five; 
and of the ten possible varieties with two longs, he 
marked no cases in which the two longs were the 
last two in the foot. In his hundred cases he has 
only fourteen of the possible twenty- five varieties, 
and a half dozen of the fourteen comprise eighty-two 
of the instances. 

As I read the passages which Professor Saints- 
bury has scanned for us, it seemed to me that on the 
whole he chopped the rhythms up too much, and 
used too many feet of one, two, or three syllables : 
these short feet often made my reading drag, 
whereas more feet of four or five syllables would 
have corresponded better with the rapidity of the 
passage. Upon trying, therefore, to see in how many 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



509 



instances I could have combined these short feet into 
dochmiacs, I found that in the passages in which he 
marked a hundred, I could have marked a hundred 
others. Evidently Professor Saintsbury is not unduly 
given to finding these longer feet. Scrutiny of the 
two lists, however, brought out some curious facts. 
The type which he uses most (two shorts, long, two 
shorts, marked 33 times) he never avoids; and the 
two types he avoids most (the two combinations 
of anapest and iamb) he uses only two and three 
times each. The only type as to which use and 
avoidance seemed at all equal was the short-long- 
short-long-short, which he marked nine times and 
avoided fifteen times. 

One might suppose that in the case of the long feet 
the number of polysyllables would be important, for 
Professor Saintsbury rarely ends a prose foot within 
a word, as we so commonly do in verse. As a 
matter of fact, syntactical groupings are the most 
important, for only fifteen of his dochmiacs consisted 
of single words fourteen of them nouns, and ten 
of these in Browne. (Diuturnity, annihilation, pro- 
prietaries, and perpetuation illustrate the four types 
he marks. ) Half of his dochmiacs consisted of 
three words, and about two-fifths of only two words ; 
but he makes only seven of four words, where my 
own list has thirty-four instances. 

When we turn again to less drily technical matters 
and inquire what Professor Saintsbury has to tell us 
about the history of English prose rhythm, we find 
in brief this : In Old English we find men who wrote 
prose that shows conscious, deliberate, and successful, 
though limited, artistry ; but the later loss of inflec- 
tion and the introduction of Romance elements would 
have left even notable work to be done all over 
again. The rather sudden and wonderful blossoming 
of polyphonic harmony in the prose of the seven- 
teenth century (as in the nineteenth, coming later 
than the great poetry) he recognizes and praises, 
but does not explain. It is easier to show how it 
brought just because it was obviously not "the 
instrument of the average purpose " what he calls 
the " concurrence of the plain " style, which the 
Augustans were to elaborate* somewhat into the 
" standard " style so long thought especially appro- 
priate to history. Later to pick phrases from a 
whole page we have not space to quote after so 
long a prevalence of the plainly phrased style, the 
opposite kind would have its turn. Almost all the 
particular agencies in the Romantic Revival helped : 
the taste for the picturesque, and for the exotic ; 
the reverence for Elizabethan and seventeenth cen- 
tury literature ; the great development of critical 
appreciation, as distinguished from rule-criticism ; 
and finally the movement against monotony, uni- 
formity, convention, almost necessitated the return 
to complicated values and irregular outlines. The 
taste for the picturesque, as he could hardly help 
observing, was a main factor ; but it is curious (and 
he does not, I think, note this ) that the great prose 
of the seventeenth century was not pictorial. 



Of specific analysis of the work of individuals^ 
and appraisement of their work, the book is full. 
Curiously, considering his insistence that rhythmic 
prose must avoid metre, and the number of instances 
in which he points out adroit avoidances of it, he 
does not object to the "batches of blanks" (horrible 
phrase!) in Ruskin. 

The book is largely pioneer work, but it seems to 
me just now to have more substantial merits and 
fewer weaknesses than are usual when one man at- 
tempts for the first time to cover so large a field. 
At any rate, it seems noticeably better work than the 
same author's " History of Criticism " or his " His- 
tory of English Prosody."

continent, and a cogent plea for in- 
telligent interest and effective action for its preser- 
vation, is contained in Mr. W. T. Hornaday's vol- 
ume, " Our Vanishing Wild Life : Its Extermination 
and Preservation " (Scribner). Forests, water power, 
and even fertility of the soil may perchance be re- 
stored when depleted, but no miracle of conservation 
can bring back to us a vanished species of bird or 
mammal. The present generation, assisted by rapid 
transportation, improved fire-arms, smokeless pow- 
der, the " Maxim silencer," the " pump gun," and 
like abominations, is depleting at an ever accelerating 
rate every species of game bird and mammal under 
the legal permission of laws framed all too often 
solely in the interest of sportsmen. Illegal shoot- 
ing of non-game birds and mammals, and their 
gradual depletion by the destruction or modification 
of their native feeding and breeding grounds, com- 
bine to reduce still further our wild life, and in many 
cases to bring it near or quite to the vanishing point. 
Mr. Hornaday's book bids us pause and consider 
whether or not we have the right to rob future gen- 
erations of their privileges of enjoyment of this phase 
of nature simply to gratify our desire to kill or to 
flaunt the borrowed plumes of some breeding bird 
for an ornament The call by women for aigrettes 
has all but exterminated the heron, and these plumes 
now bring over fifty dollars an ounce in the world's 
markets. The birds of paradise are doomed, and 
tens of thousands of tiny humming birds are mar- 
keted every year at the wholesale price of about two 
cents per skin. The women of civilized countries 
can stop this wholesale extermination if they will. 
The plume hunters are skilful villains, and know 
their business. They move from land to land, as 
legal restrictions and extermination of their quarry 
compel them. Nothing short of the cessation of 
the demand for the plumage of wild birds for 
millinery purposes will save any bird, protected 
or unprotected, which the trade demands, from

swift extermination. Dr. Hornaday's treatment 
is constructive as well as critical and denuncia- 
tory. The effective organization of the protective 
work of the Audubon Society of America, the bird 
reserves, the State and national protective measures 
are all described. It is the duty of men of science 
to take intelligent steps to secure effective legislation, 
of the schools to teach conservation of wild life, of 
the hunter to maintain a higher standard of sports- 
man's ethics, and of the State and nation to act 
promptly, intelligently, and effectively in order that 
all may cooperate to conserve for the future the 
vanishing remnant of our wild life. 

In recent years there has appeared 
a series of histories and biographies 
by writers of Roman Catholic per- 
suasion, the purpose of which seems to be to explain 
or justify the part played by Catholic leaders in 
England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 
Chief among these writers is the Abbot Gasquet (a 
historian of judgment and ability), Miss J. M. Stone, 
and Mr. Martin Haile. To this group we may, 
perhaps, add Miss Henrietta Haynes, whose recent 
biography of Queen Henrietta Maria is written from 
the same viewpoint, though the author's own relig- 
ious attitude can scarcely be inferred from her cau- 
tiously written narrative. Miss Haynes has not 
been fortunate in her subject: Henrietta Maria was 
not a great woman, and her career, as the biographer 
confesses, was a failure. But she occupied an im- 
portant position in a great crisis, and we are glad to 
know her more intimately than we have in the past. 
It is clear from Miss Haynes's account that for the 
King's difficulties in the earlier years of his reign 
the Queen was not much to blame: she came to 
England at the age of sixteen when the trouble was 
about to begin, and can have had but little influence 
on events. Still, she did cause trouble in the royal 
househoid, for she was an ardent Catholic, and was 
surrounded by servants of her own faith. It is the 
author's opinion that these servants were stupid and 
tactless, and that the King was justified in sending 
them back to France. As the years passed, the 
Queen's influence with the unlucky Charles in- 
creased, with the inevitable result that Puritan hos- 
tility toward the Stuarts was intensified. The chief 
value of Miss Haynes's work lies in her study of 
the Queen's relations with the Romanists, both in 
England and abroad, before and during the civil 
war. In her efforts to advance the cause of her 
faith in England, she displayed much zeal, but little 
wisdom. "It is hardly too much to say that she 
pulled down her husband's throne to help her co- 
religionists." And in the end she gained nothing 
from it. Interesting facts that bear on the perpetual 
conflict between the Catholic factions in England 
are also brought out, and some attention is devotee 
to the attitude of papacy toward the troubles of Brit- 
ain. There are also valuable chapters on the Queen'f 
activities during the war and the period of exile 
Miss Haynes has drawn her information largely from 



Uatholic sources, and has apparently discovered mate- 
rials that have escaped the search of earlier historians 
of the Stuart period. In her narrative she seems to 
)e unusually free from prejudice, and makes no effort 
to magnify the virtues and abilities of a Queen who 
possessed these in a moderate degree only. Twelve 
xcellent illustrations, chiefly portraits, help to give 
reality to the personal side of the story. (Putnam.) 

The hitherto Among all the reforms clamoring for 
neglected science consideration in these piping times 
of gastronomy. o f progression, Mr. Henry T. Finck, 
it would seem, has in many ways the most rational 
one of all, and the one least calculated to disturb 
any vested interest that has a right to live. Its 
creed and platform, constitution and by-laws are set 
forth in " Food and Flavor : A Gastronomic Guide 
to Health and Good Living" (Century Co.), a work 
as appetizing as any chapter of Dickens. It has 
two distinct aims, of which the first is the rescue 
of the sense of smell from a remarkable amount of 
ignorance and false teaching. What we know as 
the sense of taste, it seems, goes only so far as to 
permit us to discern six several things, i. e., whether 
a given subject on the tongue is sweet, sour, bitter, 
salty, alkaline, or metallic as those with a severe 
cold in the head may have had occasion to observe. 
All the other delights of food and drink depend di- 
rectly upon the sense of smell. This is Mr. Finck's 
own contribution to science, and it assuredly gives 
him title to discourse as freely as he pleases upon 
flavors, since he is the first to learn how they are 
best discerned. But he adds to this a really erudite 
knowledge of good food, at least as far as the 
United States and the countries of Europe have 
good food. He has taken a number of journeys, 
every one of them as filled with gustatory pleasure 
as Sterne's was with sentiment, and has brought 
back something worth remembering on every one 
of them. It has been pointed out that man can live 
on ten cents a day, and so everything above that 
sum is paid out for Flavor (the word is capitalized 
throughout the book) ; and Flavor cures dyspepsia, 
decreases divorce, promotes friendliness, decreases 
the possibilities of war, improves the disposition, and 
really advances any number of reforms that might be 
mentioned. Moreover, it makes for conservatism, 
as Washington Irving observed, "Who ever heard 
of a fat man heading a mob?" The book is well 
illustrated by Mr. Charles S. Chapman.

estate auctioneer. He who would find unspoiled 
any trace of New Spain in the Golden State must 
seek it to-day far from the beaten path of the tourist 
and out of sound of the honking automobile. Mr. 
J. Smeaton Chase, in his new book entitled "Cali- 
fornia Coast Trails : A Horseback Ride from Mexico 
to Oregon" (Houghton), found a surprising amount 
of this older phase of California life, and portrays 
it with exquisite sympathy. He exhibits a fine 
appreciation for nature in all her moods of sun and 
fog, and in all her aspects of desert, chaparral, and 
redwood forest, which so uniquely characterizes the 
varied coast of California. Mountain and sea meet 
along our Pacific shores mostly in precipitous 
cliffs, at whose inhospitable feet the ocean swells of 
the wide Pacific roar incessantly and break in foam. 
No camino real skirts this shore, and the traveller 
must find his way from ranch to ranch by dim and 
winding cattle-trails, and chance the quicksands at 
the fords of the almost dry beds of the streams. 
Less romantic in historical perspective, but no less 
beautiful and interesting, is the trip through the 
redwood forest belt of the State, north of the Golden 
Gate. The California here revealed by the author 
is the real one of the untarnished frontier, where 
the wide expanses of land and sea fill and satisfy 
the spirit, for the time at least, and the whirl of the 
street and the noise and the grime of the mart seem 
far away. In Mr. Chase's pages the call is sounded 
for every California rover to take to the trail. 

Nelson's life Miss E. Hallam Morehouse's account 
and associations of "Nelson's Lady Hamilton" will 
be remembered as an admirably can- 
did treatment of a difficult subject, and should secure 
attention for her newer work, " Nelson in England " 
(Dutton). This latter takes up a fascinating corner 
of a topic that has received less attention than it 
deserves, ransacks it thoroughly, and places the re- 
sults before the reader in a way that does not detract 
in the least from that fine humanity which has made 
the great admiral almost the most human of the 
major characters of history and the most lovable of 
conquerors. Not only this, but it brings out the 
positive genius of the man, from his uninteresting 
boyhood and youth, so ridiculously normal in the 
light of the fate before him, through to the wonder- 
ful end which left England as proudly tearful as 
when the immortal Sidney gave up his life for his 
fellows and his country. The means whereby this 
praiseworthy result is attained are the simplest. 
Practically all that Nelson did when away from his 
native soil is eliminated from the narrative, only so 
much as tends to throw light upon his conduct in 
England itself being retained for purposes of con- 
nection. His life as a boy in a country parsonage, 
his years in a school of little note, his boyish choice 
of the sea as a vocation, a choice reached boyishly 
and with no more apparent sense of his complete 
fitness for mastery than comes to other boys, his 
youthful hopes and almost more frequent youthful 
disappointments; and then a fame, attained quite 



as much in spite of things as because of them, that 
has lifted him into the immortal throng whom we 
know as " Plutarch's men." In this book the stress 
is on Lady Nelson, rather than on the woman whose 
beauty was fit companion for Nelson's valor, and 
there is no shirking of the problem presented and 
no solution of it, either, except on the plea of the 
genius that can command anything in this world, 
once it is established in the minds of men. There 
are numerous illustrations, all of unusual interest, 
and a general impression of a well-rounded whole, 
sympathetic and readable, such as a thoroughly 
good biography should have.

on evervdav humor, always as spicy and aro- 
American life. matic, as normal and sane, as a 
June rosarium, is at its best in "Reflections of a 
Beginning Husband" (Harper), wherefrom one 
may discern that we have a rational civilization in 
these United States, at least in spots, perhaps, 
even, that it is not as spotted as our European 
kinsfolk think. While other writers of fiction are 
interested in construction and dialogue, plot and 
"punch," thrill and sensation, problem and solution, 
Mr. Martin satisfies himself and his readers 
with an entirely normal pair of happy human 
beings. The beginning husband is a young lawyer 
in a good firm with excellent connections, the scion 
of a good stock, and with sixty dollars a week by 
way of income; the wife with whom he begins 
(and ends) the book is also the scion of a good old 
stock, the child of parents wealthier than his own, 
if anything, but entirely suited to him in social 
station, education, tastes, and habits. And they 
marry, and have a baby, and live within their 
income, and have pleasant friends, and all the de- 
lights of life, just as most of us would have them 
if we could select our surroundings with as much 
discernment as Mr. Martin has drawn his charac- 
ters. The book abounds in what is called "dry" 
humor, the narrator having energy enough left after 
his day's work to see the fun in life ; and the reader 
may be warranted a smile with him on every page.

and instructive volume, "The Passing of the Turkish 
Empire in Europe" (Lippincott), he forecasts the 
future by help of the past, arriving at the conclusion 
that " it may be taken for granted that the Ottoman 
Empire as a European Power is a thing of the past, 
that all those provinces carved out of Europe by the 
sword of Othman have been lost by the sword, and 
that of Turkey in Europe nothing remains but the

Turkish for some time yet ten years, perhaps 
fifteen but methinks the Turk is tired of his stay 
in Europe, that he will soon pack up his small posses- 
sions and return to Asia Minor, whence he came." 
In the expansion of crowded Slavic and Teutonic 
peoples toward the territory so long held by the 
Ottoman invaders, Captain Baker somehow contrives 
to persuade himself that there is menace to the se- 
curity of the British Empire. "Germany is daily 
perfecting an already formidable navy," he warns 
his fellow-countrymen, " for flank defence first, then 
for further enterprise; Austria has recently greatly 
added to the budget for naval and military purposes, 
and the road to Saloniki is no longer closed by 
Turkey ; Italy, with her considerable naval power, 
is allied to Germany and Austria. What is Great 
Britain, the vast Empire encircling the moving 
forces from west to east, doing towards her own 
safety?" Germanophobia, evidently, was not the 
least of the motives impelling the author to write his 
book ; and of course the lesson, or one of the lessons, 
it is intended to teach is the necessity of a bigger 
army and navy. Skilfully executed drawings from 
Captain Baker's own pencil, together with a map of 
Turkey in Europe, add to the interest and value of 
the book. 

No book could be more timely, in 
this the semi-centennial year of the 
pivotal battle of the Civil War, than 
Mrs. George E. Pickett's romance, "The Bugles 
of Gettysburg" (F. G. Browne & Co.), which com- 
memorates her late husband's heroism in that des- 
perate encounter, and at the same time tells the love 
story of Colonel Jasper Carrington and Catherine 
Marshall. It pictures the Virginia of fifty years ago, 
the conflict of emotions with which loyal Virginians 
took up arms against the flag of their country, the 
high hopes and fine enthusiasm of those who dreamed 
of and fought for a "free South " and a " new nation," 
and the sacrifices they cheerfully made in the gallant 
endeavor to realize their dream. Jasper Carrington, 
a young lieutenant and graduate of West Point, 
stationed at a far-western post with Captain Pickett 
when news reached him of Virginia's secession, 
resigned from the army, as did his captain also, 
and both made their way by a long and circuitous 
route to the old home. Kate Marshall was waiting 
in suspense to learn whether her lover would 
espouse the Union cause or draw his sword for the 
Old Dominion and the South. Narrow escapes 
from arrest as a deserter, dangers to his life from a 
rival suitor for the heroine's hand, with perils of the 
battlefield, where indeed he is seriously wounded, 
combine to make the hero's fortunes interesting to 
the reader, as they did to heighten and prolong the 
loving anxiety of his sweetheart. General Pickett, 
the admiration and inspiration of those under him 
and of those associated with him, plays of course 
an important part in the drama, whose climax is 
reached on the field of Gettysburg. In subordinate 
details, the presentation of the old Virginia negro, 



the faithful family servant, is especially good. 
"Uncle Zeke," who held that "a lie is a abomina- 
tion ter de Lawd (en a ve'y present help in time 
er trouble)," and ''Old Pete" and "Black Pomp," 
are all drawn to the life. The tone and atmosphere 
of the book bear evidence of long and faithful pre- 
paration for its writing. A frontispiece illustration 
shows General Pickett leading his men in the famous 
charge that has immortalized his name.

some great (Holt) has been increased by the 

conquerors. publication of a volume entitled " The 
World's Leading Conquerors," a compact, thought- 
ful, and at the same time very pleasantly written 
piece of work from the pen of Professor W. L. Bevan, 
of the University of the South. The "leading 
conquerors" whom Professor Bevan has chosen to 
discuss are Alexander, Caesar, Charles the Great, 
the Ottoman Sultans from Osman to Souliman, 
Cortez, Pizarro, and Napoleon. Sober, objective, 
cautious, convinced that Caesar's commentaries are 
too vague and untrustworthy to have great value and 
that their author " added nothing new to the art of 
war," that Charlemagne's work left no permanent 
impression, the historian is very chary of super- 
latives, although he closes his volume and his 
biography of the great Corsican with the admission 
that "In spite of all his limitations, it seems im- 
possible to point to a more marvelous career in the 
annals of humanity." Certain of the chapters, 
notably those on Charlemagne and the Spanish 
Conquistadores, are made up largely of detailed and 
valuable studies of manners and customs ; these 
are unquestionably the best part of the book, but 
they have no proportional equivalents in the other 
chapters. It is to be regretted that there are no 
maps. A modern atlas would of course be of little 
help with most of the book ; and though the author 
makes frequent efforts to keep us in touch with the 
scene of the events he is narrating, by suggesting a 
modern landmark in the neighborhood of the ancient 
one, the inclusion of a few charts and plans would 
have been of great usefulness. 

With laudable wisdom the Hon. 

Enjoyable letters R^g^ p a l me r, author of "A Little 
from India. j ._ . , 

Tour in India (Longmans), denies 
the charge of "having written a book on India," de- 
claring that "a tour of five months was too long for 
such an ambition to survive." Fortunately, however, 
he was persuaded to publish some letters mailed to 
members of his family ; and he thought it better to 
leave them with their "sundry monstrosities of syn- 
tax barbarous parentheses, unattached pronouns 
and mixed tenses," than "to disguise rough impres- 
sions with a thin varnish of literary elaboration." 
The result is an entertaining volume marked by 
refreshing informality. There is no savour of the 
guide book; nor does the author ever pretend to 
speak with authority. But Mr. Palmer is an edu- 
cated Englishman, who had read and talked much

about India before he boarded the steamer ; and he 
associated intimately with a number of people who 
knew their parts of India very intimately. (The 
Right Reverend Edwin James, Lord Bishop of 
Bombay, is "Jim " throughout these pages.) Above 
all, our traveller's eyes and ears were ever intelli- 
gently open. He went everywhere and saw every- 
thing, and wrote down his impressions while they 
were still fresh. Thus his contributions range 
through wide and varied fields, from an admirable 
description of the durbar and notes on Indian politics 
or economics to all sorts of minor details, including 
a picture of two impish young Hindus who suddenly 
went flat on their faces and crawled under a rope 
attached to the hind leg of a dismal old cow, "ex- 
plaining with grins that it was not right to show dis- 
respect to cows." In the chapter on Kashmir, most 
American readers would gladly exchange some of 
the minutiae of duck hunting for additional descrip- 
tions of life and scenery; but an Englishman must 
shoot. The letters are lively, readable, and unin- 
tentionally instructive. 

Two books with titles that are practi- 
. cally synonymous,-the Rev. Thomas 

Tait's " How to Train the Speaking 
Voice" (Doran) and Mr. Edwin Gordon Lawrence's 
"How to Master the Spoken Word" (McClurg), 
bespeak the importance of elocution and oratory for 
the English-speaking race, here and in the antipodes. 
Mr. Tait, a master of arts and bachelor of divinity, 
holds a cure in Christchurch, New Zealand, and was 
formerly lecturer on elocution in Melbourne Univer- 
sity ; Mr. Lawrence is known as a teacher in the 
same field and as the author of several valuable 
works on the subject. This latest book of the latter 
has for a sub-title the statement that it is " designed 
as a self-instructor for all who would excel in the 
art of public speaking," and it covers the ground 
both by precept and example. But it really takes 
up the art about where Mr. Tait leaves it. The latter 
is concerned with the elements, the former with the 
finished product of the schools. Mr. Tait is explicit 
in regard to the simpler and more fundamental 
things, as if his public lacked the clearness of speech 
and power to make itself heard that Mr. Lawrence 
takes for granted. In few words, and those easily 
comprehended, the Australasian shows how to speak 
simply, articulately, and audibly, how to read with 
comprehension and deliver with effect, and there he 
ends his little book. Mr. Lawrence gives the best 
orations of classical and modern times, analyzes 
them, and leaves the student who has carefully fol- 
lowed him in full knowledge of a great art. The two 
books complement one another admirably, and are 
worthy of praise. 

Reprint of a Dr ' J ? 8se Torrey, Jr., writer on 
rare early tract education, temperance advocate, anti- 
on free libraries. s i a v er y agitator, and author of a 
scheme for the establishment of free public libraries, 
was born too early to meet with a very general or 
cordial response to his various printed proposals for 



the moral and intellectual regeneration of mankind, 
and even the names of these publications of his are 
now all but forgotten. One of them, " The Intel- 
lectual Torch," is rescued from oblivion by Mr. 
Edward Harmon Virgin and republished as number 
three of "The Librarian's Series," which is under 
the general editorship of Mr. John Cotton Dana and 
Mr. Henry W. Kent. The little tract, whose full 
title describes it as " an original, economical and 
expeditious plan for the universal dissemination of 
knowledge and virtue by means of free public 
libraries," gives an account of an actual library 
started by the author at New Lebanon, N. Y., in 
1804, when he was but seventeen years of age, and, 
in addition to other matter in prose and verse, 
concludes with a number of essays on the pernicious 
effects of indulgence in alcoholic beverages. The 
author was his own publisher, and Ballston Spa, 
1817, the place and date of the issue of the tract. 
An engraved portrait and a silhouette of Torrey are 
reproduced for the reprint. Apparently this work 
is an addition to the series as originally announced, 
or a substitution for some one of the six numbers 
named in the prospectus ; but no word of explanation 
is offered by the editors. Mr. Virgin has unearthed 
all that is discoverable concerning the obscure 
author whom he edits, and his Introduction is really 
the most interesting part of the book. (Elm Tree 
Press, Woodstock, Vt.) 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Sporadically, we are getting the plays of Bjornson 
turned into English. Mr. Edwin Bjorkman now gives 
us three of them (Scribner), " En Hanske," " Over 
vEvne I.," and " Det Ny System." We wish that he had 
given us instead "En Fallit," "Over ^Evne II.," and 
" Kongen," because those are three that it is most desir- 
able to use for stage-production in English. Perhaps 
he will now turn his attention to them. 

A report on " The Climate and Weather of San 
Diego, California," has been prepared by Mr. Ford A. 
Carpenter, local forecaster, under the direction of the 
former Chief of the United States Weather Bureau, 
Mr. Willis L. Moore. The little volume, which is 
freely illustrated with photographs, maps, and charts, 
is published by the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. 
As dealing with a region which is often said to have no 
weather, in the usual sense of the term, this report is 
of much interest. 

Publication of a ninth edition, revised, of Mr. Ernest 
W. Clement's " Handbook of Modern Japan" (McClurg) 
attests the continued and well-deserved popularity of 
this compendium of condensed information concerning a 
great modern world power. So much of significance in the 
history of Japan has been crowded into the eight years 
since the volume was last revised, that numerous changes 
in statistics and statements have been required. A new 
chapter, with new illustrations, entitled " Greater 
Japan," ends the volume. 

Among other volumes published in celebration of the 
half-centenary anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, 
is a new edition of Mrs. La Salle Corbell Pickett's 



514 



THE DIAL, 



[June 16 



" Pickett and His Men," a biography commemorating 
the author's soldier-husband, one of the foremost com- 
manders on the Confederate side, and leader of the 
historic charge against Cemetery Ridge on the third day 
of the battle. The book is frankly a tribute to General 
Pickett and the men of his Division; but as an intimate 
recital of the events connected with the battle it will have 
an additional appeal. Messrs. J. B. Lippincott Co. are 
the publishers of this edition. 

In a volume comfortable in size and handsome in 
form, the Oxford University Press gives us the " Poems 
of Tennyson" as originally published between 1830 and 
1870, with reproductions of the beautiful wood-cuts 
from the famous Moxon edition as illustrations. Col- 
ored reproductions of Watts's portrait of Tennyson and 
his " Sir Galahad " are included by way of good meas- 
ure ; and Dr. T. Herbert Warren, professor of poetry at 
Oxford, supplies a pleasant and illuminating introduc- 
tion. Except for the fact that it does not include the 
poet's latest work, we should say that this was by far 
the best single-volume Tennyson to be had. 

The little volume of tales translated from the 
eighteenth-century Chinese by Mr. George Soulie", and 
published under the title of the original, " Strange 
Stories from the Lodge of Leisures" (Houghton), affords 
an insight into some of the nooks and corners of Taoist 
and Buddhist beliefs, and certain of the tales possess a 
quaint and delicate charm. The imagination and the 
art of the Chinese writer, however, do not maintain the 
high level of these few choice stories throughout even 
this small volume of selections. The perfection and 
lightness of touch of a Lafcadio Hearn, evinced in the 
best tales, is inharmoniously matched with the crudity 
and formlessness of others. 

" Reasons for Reading," by Mr. John Cotton Dana, 
comes to us in a beautifully printed folio of barely six 
pages of reading matter, with a lavish abundance of 
blank pages before and after. The type is thirty-point 
Cheltenham, and the edition is limited to twenty-five 
copies. The short tract is full of good advice, exhorting 
to read first for profit, then for pleasure, and at all times 
to practice honesty with oneself and the world in one's 
literary opinions, one's literary likes and dislikes. A 
larger public than can be reached in this restricted issue 
of Mr. Dana's essay ought to have access to it, and it is 
to be hoped that it will be made more readily available, 
if steps to that end have not already been taken. 

Court gossip and intrigue and bickering and bitter- 
ness are dished up in highly-flavored form in Countess 
Larisch's book of rankling memories, entitled " My 
Past " (Putnam), and professing to clear up the mystery 
of the tragic end of Rudolph, Crown Prince of Austria. 
The purpose of the book, written after a quarter-century 
of silence, is explained as a desire to free the writer s 
name from intolerable calumnies and slanders that have 
caused one of her sons to shoot himself and have em- 
bittered the lives of her daughters. Extraordinary 
accusations against high personages no longer living 
abound in the sensational narrative of the " Countess," 
who, by the way, is no longer Countess Larisch, a legal 
annulment of her marriage having been effected in 
1896, as she herself relates, and a subsequent union with 
an untitled person having taken place. The book is writ- 
ten in a style to ensure its being read, it is well printed, 
well illustrated, well bound, and will for a season take 
a conspicuous place in the department of literature 
(the chroniques scandaleuses) to which it belongs. 



NOTES. 



" The Collected Poems of Alice Meynell " are soon to

ident A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard University, will

is entitled " The Rise of the Saracens and the Founda- 
tion of the Western Empire." 

"Mexico: The Land of Unrest," by Mr. Henry Baer- 
lein, will be published this month by J. B. Lippincott 
Co. It is an account of recent and present-day condi- 
tions, based on long observation at first-hand. 

A timely account of the battle of Gettysburg, written 
by a participant, is announced for publication this month

Battle of Gettysburg: A Comprehensive Narrative." 

The interesting papers by Mr. Robert Sterling Yard 
which have been appearing recently in various periodi- 
cals will be published in book form in the autumn by 
Houghton Mifflin Co., under the title, "The Publisher." 

A brief biographical and critical sketch of William 
Ernest Henley, written by Mr. L. Cope Cornford, will 
be published late this month by Houghton Mifflin Co. 
This house also has in press a Life of John Bright, by 
Mr. G. M. Trevelyan. 

" Studies in Love and Terror " is the title of a new 
volume of stories by Mrs. Belloc Lowndes which Messrs. 
Scribner will publish at once. This house has also in 
press a volume on " Charles Dickens and Music," by 
Mr. James T. Lightwood. 

Frederick A. Ober, well known as an ornithologist 
and writer, died June 2 at his home in Hackensack, 
N. J., at the age of sixty-four. His published works 
comprise many titles, consisting largely of stories of 
adventure and history for young readers. 

A French estimate of Synge's work and of the present 
literary movement in Ireland is announced in " John 
Millington Synge and the Irish Theatre," by M. Maurice 
Bourgeois. The writer has made a close study of con- 
temporary Irish literature in English, and has translated 
some of Synge's plays into French. 

" The Imprint " is the title of a new English monthly 
devoted to subjects of interest to the designer, the 
illustrator, and the printer. It is beautiful in typo-

graphical make-up, interesting in subject-matter, and 
distinctively illustrated. American readers of such 
periodicals as "The Printing Art" and "The Graphic 
Arts " would do well to become acquainted with " The 
Imprint," which is published from Henrietta Street, 
Covent Garden, London. 

Three hitherto unannounced books to be published 
immediately by the Macmillan Co, are " The Influence 
of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of History," by 
Dr. Frederick Adams Woods; "The Heart of Gaspe"," 
an account of this little-known region of Eastern Canada, 
by Mr. John M. Clarke; and "A Prisoner in Fairyland," 
a novel by Mr. Algernon Blackwood. 

Admirers of " The Corner of Harley Street," pub- 
lished a year or two ago, will not be surprised to learn 
that its author is a physician. Houghton Mifflin Co., 
who publish the book, announce the real name of Peter 
Harding to be Henry Howarth Bashford, a London 
physician who is still in his early forties. He holds an 
important position with H. M. Civil Service, and is the 
author of several novels. 

The appointment of three well-known scholars is 
announced by Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. to assist, 
by advice and suggestion, in the development of their 
list of books in history for schools, colleges, and the 
general trade. The three men chosen are: Professor 
William S. Ferguson, Harvard University; Professor 
James T. Shotwell, Columbia University; and Pro- 
fessor William . Dodd, University of Chicago. 

Mr. Havelock Ellis, in his introduction to Mrs. 
Ny strom- Hamilton's volume on "Ellen Key: Her Life 
and Her Work," an English translation of which, 
prepared by Mrs. A. E. B. Fries, will be published this 
month by Messrs. Putnam, points out that what Mrs. 
Nystrom-Hamilton has to tell " may be received with 
confidence as coming out of the circle in which Ellen 
Key has spent the greater part of her active life." 

Mr. Edwin Bjbrkman is preparing a volume on 
" Scandinavian Literature " for Messrs Henry Holt & 
Co. Mr. Bjorkman contemplates separate treatments 
of Ibsen, Bjb'rnson, George Brandes, Strindberg, and 
Jacobsen. There will be collective treatment of the 
lesser men in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The 
book will not catalogue and describe the work of these 
men so much as it will show how their work illustrated 
tendencies in modern life and literature. 

The tenth volume of "The Cambridge History of 
English Literature " is to make its appearance shortly. 
It covers " The Age of Johnson," and among the con- 
tents are chapters on " Johnson and Boswell," by Mr. 
David Nichol Smith; "Oliver Goldsmfth," by Mr. 
Austin Dobson; "Richardson," by M. Louis Cazamian; 
"Sterne and the Novel of His Times," by Professor C. E. 
Vaughan ; The Literature of Dissent," by Dr. W. A. 
Shaw; "Philosophers," by Professor W. R. Sorley; 
" Gibbon," by Dr. A. W. Ward; and "Hume and Modern 
Historians," by Dr. William Hunt. 

Mr. Cobden-Sanderson, of the well-known " Doves 
Press," at Hammersmith, London, announces the aban- 
donment of his scheme for the publication of Shake- 
peare's works, which will not now be carried farther than 
the three Roman plays and the poems. One reason for this 
alteration of plan will be received with regret namely, 
the " not remote closure of the Press." The reason for 
this is the growing strain of reading, revising, and 
passing the printed sheets, work which, with the design- 
ing of the books, is peculiarly his own. " This has grown 



of late with an increasing pace in the grey twilight of 
our wintry weather." He is thns " constrained to forego 
at last the delight of projects which seemed ever to 
multiply with the work and the years "; and " to adjust 
his eyes to other scenes and his hopes to far other 
projects." There are, however, to be some final publica- 
tions of the Doves Press, which "shall serve as far as 
possible to round off the range of thought and expression 
comprised in the publications of the Press and the 
variety of the problems whose solution it has been the 
primary object of the Press to achieve." 

Coincidentally with the issue of the last two vol- 
umes of John Bigelow's "Retrospections of an Active 
Life " comes the announcement that plans are on foot 
for the erection of a memorial to that statesman, 
diplomat, and scholar. The committee having the 
matter in charge, headed by Hon. Joseph H. Choate, 
has sent out circulars calling for subscriptions, and 
saying that it is felt the most fitting memorial to Mr. 
Bigelow would be a building on the campus of Union 
College, Schenectady, N. Y , from which Bigelow was 
graduated, and also the establishment of a Bigelow 
Professorship of Political Science in that college. 
Serving on the committee with Mr. Choate are such 
men as Messrs. Oswald Garrison Villard, Charles E. 
Hughes, Andrew Carnegie, Elihu Root, and many others. 

The retirement of Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson 
from the editorship of " The Century Magazine," and 
the appointment of Mr. Robert Sterling Yard (formerly 
of Moffat, Yard & Co.) as general manager, call atten- 
tion anew to the revolution that has of late been effected 
in the conduct of monthly periodicals. It is the busi- 
ness end of such publications that is now considered 
all-important, and a J. G. Holland (the " Century's " 
first editor, before it changed its name of " Scribner's 
Monthly ") is no longer the man desired for the control 
of a great magazine a necessary result, no doubt, of 
the increased and increasing specialization in all activ- 
ities, literary and other. Mr. Johnson has been so long 
connected with " The Century," of which he has been 
editor-in-chief since Mr. Gilder's death, that his retire- 
ment cannot fail to canse widespread regret.

SEX THROUGH BIOLOGY 

Torelle's Plant and Animal 
Children: How They Grow 

Those interested in social hygiene agree that the best approach 
to the teaching of the facts of sex is through biology, and this 
book gives in acceptable form an adequate treatment of essen- 
tials. It presents in clear and simple language the life history 
of plants and animals. It makes clear the ideas of evolution, 
heredity, variation, effect of environment, and the evolution of 
sex. In connection with each type of plant and animal discussed 
is given an account of the manner in which its reproduction is 
accomplished, until the fundamental law of egg and sperm is 
seen to pervade all but the lowest forms of organic life.

Journal des Debats, Pans. 

DEALING AT AN OLD STAND 



We all like to have our dealings with people we may know and can come face to face 
with, rather than a mysterious company or corporation of limited personal responsibility and no 
individuality. 

We are a firm, established forty years, and have been in our own six-story building, where 
we have the largest plant of intaglio plates in the world, for twenty-eight of these years. All the 
work of printing and binding is done under our personal supervision. Our books are exactly as 
represented and we guarantee them. The fact that Dun and Bradstreet have given us the highest 
rating for years is evidence that this guarantee is good. 

As to the desirability of the books themselves: The Department of Commerce and Labor 
has called us "the makers of the finest books in the world." The New York Herald once called 
us the "Tiffanys of publishers," and the New York Times has stated that we make "veritable 
editions de luxe," and our books have been winning medals since 1876. 

That hundreds of thousands of persons of keen perceptions and cultivated tastes are 
purchasers is evidence that the prices are reasonable; and the fact that they buy again and again 
seems proof that the books are honestly and satisfactorily made. For example: Mr. George W. 
Vanderbilt has bought four sets of our Balzac; Mr. J. P. Morgan bought the first two sets of our 
fine edition of The Queens of England (all the sets of that edition have been sold). A man who 
has bought every one of our sets in fine bindings writes when sending final cheque on account: 
" This I believe closes up our account in full. I have to thank you for the favors and courtesy 
extended during our business relations, and should I need anything in your line 1 shall surely 
know where I can go and be treated honestly by." 

For forty years, "at the old stand," we have been quietly making books as good as experi- 
ence, conscientious work, and some taste could produce. Our principle has been, and is, to give 
fair dealing and honest value for a fair price. Our charges are commensurate with the labor and 
material expended. We do not offer cheap books, nor do we invite extravagance. We have 
aimed for, and have received, the highest awards at international expositions all over the world. 
To those who care to know something about our work we shall be glad to send an illustrated 
pamphlet that is not a mere catalogue but a thing of considerable literary and artistic interest.
