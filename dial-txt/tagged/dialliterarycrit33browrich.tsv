		The story , unfolded with all the author 's insight into a woman 's nature and with profound sympathy and unfailing force and interest , is one which will lay strong hold upon thinking readers .

		A novel so elevated , stimulating , and powerful in its character will be welcomed as a relief from much current trashy and inconse - quential story-telling .

		BRIEFER MENTION 18 NOTIS 19 TOPICS IN LE ^ VDING PERIODICALS ... 19 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 20 AS TO DRAMATIZATIONS .

		In its etymological sense , dramatization is the process of making a drama out of any grist that comes to mill , -- be it an original idea or a second-hand fiction , an actual incident , a poem , a name , or a theory .

		But recently the popular conception has reduced it from a generic to a specific term , and it is accepted to mean almost exclusively the process by which the story of a novel is recast into the form of a drama .

		In this sense it has displayed the fer - tility of alfalfa .

		Truthfully might the mer - cenary dramatic epigrammatist exclaim , '' Let me make the dramatizations for the stage , and I care not who makes its dramas . ''

		The whole movement has been episodic and abnormal ; it has been overdone , and has in - vited the inevitable reaction .

		Nevertheless , the dramatization will go on in the normal and rational manner which has always characterised the theatre .

		There was nothing essentially original behind the recent ascendancy of the dramatization idea .

		It was an accident of group movements .

		Dramas which have been based on original fundamental ideas with purely imaginary groups of characters have rarely been in the majority .

		Literature has always been the store - house of dramatic material , the reserve force of the dramatist .

		Nearly all of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays are dramatizations , in part of novels and tales , and in part of history .

		The playwrights succeeding him nearly always drew on concrete historical material for the inspiration and form of their work .

		If dramatizations of novels were fewer in the eighteenth century than sub - sequently , it is in a measure because works of fiction were rarer ; the printing-press had not developed its enormous potentiality .

		Novels and dramatizations have continually expressed their plenitude in their proportions .

		From the
earliest decade of the nineteenth century	DATE	the dramatic hack laid violent hands on the library .

		Scott was a ready victim .

		Nearly every one of his novels transmigrated to the stage , each multiplying itself into from two to six or more versions .

		Thackeray 's char - acters were less readily appropriated ; bnt
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, the
Warrington	LOCATION	boys ,
Henry	PERSON	and
Beatrice	PERSON	, were early paraded before the foot - lights , -- seldom successfully , because the sub - tleties and literalism of Thackeray offered no purchase for the attack of the opportunist .

		Dickens has , from the appearance of ''
Oliver Twist	PERSON	, '' been almost as familiar in the play - house as in the library .

		The appearance of each of his works , and of
Scott	PERSON	's , precipitated a scramble for dramatization beside which the phenomenon of the past eight years has not been comparable .

		Many of the stories appeared on the stage in dramatic form within two days after the books were published .

		In one in -

THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, stance ,
Dickens	PERSON	found his story dramatized and acted before it had run its serial course in a periodical .

		The dramatist had invented an ending regardless of the novelist 's intention .

		The theatres of
New York	LOCATION	played five different versions of ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' the year of its appearance .

		Not so large a proportion of
Bulwer Lytton	ORGANIZATION	's works as of
Scott	PERSON	's and
Dickens	PERSON	's have reached the stage ; but such as have found their way thither have established an almost equal popularity and permanency .

		Dramatizations were made of a number of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's tales , of two of
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	's , one of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's , two of Wash - ington Irving 's , and of several of
Wilkie Col	ORGANIZATION	- lins 's and
Charles Keade	PERSON	's , all long before the present renaissance .

		How are we to account for the inundation of dramatized novels which has recently swept the stage ?

		There are several reasons which may have and no doubt did contribute to the fact , but none so much as that to be found in the literary movement of the period .

		With the recent flood of romance came the wake of dramatizations .

		At no other time have story writers appeared , saving
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	, who displayed material so inviting and con - genial to the playwright .

		They are writing stories of intrigue , of incident , and of action .

		Commercialism has played its part .

		When the publishers herald the declaration that five hundred thousand copies of a certain book have been sold , it requires no originalist to foresee a ready-made trade-mark , a fertilized interest for a dramatization of that story .

		This much of the sin is on the soul of the perpetrator of that soul-less schedule of '' best selling books . ''

		Though many sins have been committed in the name of this worthy process , it is a little - appreciated fact that many of the most popular and enduring of modern plays -- not the best , mark you -- are dramatizations .

		When it is recalled that the perennial '' East
Lynne	PERSON	, '' ``
Kip Van Winkle	PERSON	, '' `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin , '' ''
Camille	PERSON	, '' and ''
Monte Cristo	PERSON	, '' to name only five , are in each instance the reconstruction of a novel , the group suggests that only dramati - zations have perpetuity .

		Dramatizations have revealed terrible and wonderful possibilities .

		The amateur unskilled in the technique of playmaking often displays a naive surprise at the achievements thereof .

		Before Mr.
Booth Tarkington	PERSON	demonstrated the practicability of the experiment , many people expressed wonderment that Mr.
Kichard Mansfield	PERSON	was to secure a long play from the brief ''
Monsieur Beaucaire	PERSON	. ''

		The experienced and successful workman uses only the theme of a story , and thereon he embroiders . ''

		Rip Van Winkle '' is the dramatization of a short story ; so is '' The Cricket on the Hearth . ''

		Most of the tangent Shakespearian inspiration was the mere pulse of the resultant plays .

		As a record of curiosity , it may be recalled that '' The Heart of
Maryland	LOCATION	'' was a dramatiza - tion of '' Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night '' ; and '' Shenandoah '' bore the same relation to ''
Sheridan	PERSON	's Ride . ''

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's Autobiography , *
Walter Besant	PERSON	was so accomplished a story - teller that he could not fail to relate the story of his own life in an attractive way , and his Autobiography , which has just been published under theeditorialcareofDr.S .


Squire Sprigge	PERSON	, is a volume of much value and a notable addi - tion to a branch of literature in which our own language is richer than any other .

		It would be interesting to inquire just why it is that biography -LRB- including autobiography -RRB- occupies so large a place , relatively , in English litera - ture .

		Other nations have biographies of their greater men , as a matter of course ; but other nations do not , as a rule , make so many of their lesser men the subjects of substantial volumes .

		We seem in this respect to have learned a lesson that has escaped Frenchmen and Germans , -- the lesson that a man 's life is the most interesting thing in the world , and that the interest of the life is by no means strictly proportional to the importance of his achievement .

		If he has done enough to make his name reasonably familiar to a wide circle of readers , and a competent artist in biography is at hand , no other justification is needed for recounting his career .

		Even our fiction assumes more frequently , we should fancy , than the fiction of other peoples , the form of biography ; and every reader can recall many a novel which is really nothing more than the story of a single life as imagined by the writer .

		Without at - tempting to discuss this question in any detail , it may perhaps be set down safely enough , as a • The Autobiography op

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL general formala , that the English is the most individual of modern races , and that conse - qaently the individaal English reader takes a peculiar satisfaction in learning how other in - dividuals , real or imagined , have dealt with the problems that beset every human existence .

		The life of a professional man of letters is apt to be barren of external incident or dramatic setting , leaving the man who undertakes to write it little recourse save to the inner ex - perience of the subject as revealed in books , journals , correspondence , and familiar inter - course .

		It is , on the whole , best that such a life should take the form of autobiography , for who but the man who has himself lived it could adequately portray the succession of moods and intellectual states which has made np its substance .

		So we are glad that '' Sir
Walter	PERSON	the Second '' has told us his own life - story , instead of leaving the task to some pious friend , although another hand might have made a good deal out of it , in view of the varied ac - tivities that engrossed Sir
Walter	PERSON	's busy and useful years .

		His
Mauritius	LOCATION	experiences , his work for the Palestine Exploration Fund , his militant efforts in behalf of the profession of authorship , his extensive labors in the field of
London	LOCATION	history , and his long career of bene - ficent pbilanthopic endeavor , would provide enough material for an interesting book , even if there were no novels to write about .

		In - deed , Sir
Walter	PERSON	was so mnch more than a novelist , so much more than a mere man of letters , that the story of his books would deal with only a single aspect of a remarkably rich and many-sided career .

		It is true that his books were what chiefly made him widely fa - mous , creating the demand which made a biog - raphy possible , but the writing of novels , al - though doubtless a delight to him , was regarded as a kind of journeyman work , to be conscien - tiously performed to the best of his abilities , but not to be compared in real importance to the work of bestowing added dignity upon the literary profession , or of founding a People 's Palace , or of projecting an
Atlantic Union	LOCATION	that should bind more closely than ever before the branches of the English-speaking people .

		These were the real objects of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's life , and to them novel-writing was ancillary or inci - dental .

		The Autobiography was left by Sir
Walter	PERSON	in an uncompleted state , or at least an unrevised one , and his editor , explaining the author 's methods of work , indicates certain respects in which he thinks the book might have been modified , had Sir
Walter	PERSON	himself seen it through the press .

		We are not qaite sure that we agree with the editor in his assumption that the writer would have been less outspoken upon certain subjects had he lived to revise his first draft .

		He would not wantonly have given offense to any soul alive , bnt his early experience in re - ligious matters was such that he thought plain speaking needful , and he did not conceal his abhorrence of the religious view that substitutes ceremonial for worship , or of the view that there is something sinful in the enjoyment of life and letting every human faculty have full play .

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	was ever a hater of shams , and he had no lack of courage when it was a question of exposing hypocrisy and pleading for a ra - tional form of religious observance .

		It is only a hopelessly bigoted soul that could take offence at such a passage as the following , which voices the honest indignation of a generous spirit at the perversion of the spirit of Christianity : '' Wben I consider the extent of the Calvinistie teaeb - ing ; its dreadful narrowDess ; the truly heaitleas tad pitiless way in which those solemn faces above the wobbling
Geneva	LOCATION	bands spoke of the small number of the Elect and the certainty of endless torment for the multitude -- the whole illustrating the ineffable Love of God -- I am amazed that people were as cheerful as they were .

		I suppose that people were accustomed to this kind of talk ; there was no question of rebellion ; nobody dared to doubt or disbelieve ; only , you see , the doctrine if realised would have made life intolerable ; the human affections only the source and
spring	DATE	of agony ; religion a selfish , individual , doubtful hope ; the closing years of old age a horrible anticipation of what was to follow .

		Therefore the thing was put away in silence ; it was brought out in two sermons every week ; it was regarded as a theological exercise in which the congregation could admire the intellectual subtle - ties by which every gracious word of Christ was , by some distortion of half a verse from
Paul	PERSON	, tamed into the exact opposite of what it meant . ''

		In spite of his manifest unfitness for the ecclesiastical life ,
Besant	PERSON	was on the point of taking orders at the close of his university period .

		He loathed the idea , but it seemed the only course open to him .

		Returning from a vacation walking tour in the
Tyrol	LOCATION	, where
Calverley	PERSON	had been one of his companions , he was met by the direct question as to when he wished to be ordained . ''

		By this time I had passed the voluntary theological examination at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and bad nothing more to do except to pass the Bi & hop 's examination .

		I put myself in communication with the Bishop 's secretary , and with great depression of spirits prepared myself for perjury , because by this time I understood that the white tie would choke me .

		Then I beard that there were rumors among the governors .

		Somebody said that he feared -- he was told -- it was rumored -- that I was not sound on the Atonement .

		And day by day the troth 8 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, was borne in upon me that I was not called and chosen for the office of deacon in the Church of
England	LOCATION	.

		Christmas came .

		I was to be ordained in the
Spring	DATE	; the Bishop had my name ; my credentials had been sent to him .

		And then -- oh !

		happiness !

		a door of release was thrown open .

		My friend
Ebden	PERSON	, then a junior in the Colonial OfBce , came to see me .

		In his hand , so to speak , he held two colonial professorships .

		It seemed not improbable that I might have either of them if I chose .

		Then I should not have to take orders ; then I should see something more of the world ; then I should travel across the ocean .

		If I chose ?

		Of course I chose .

		I jumped at the chance .

		I sent in my name .

		I was appointed .

		My choice was for the
Mauritius	LOCATION	, because the other place was in
South Africa	LOCATION	, and I do n't like snakes .

		So when I returned to
Leamington	LOCATION	it was to give in my resignation in three months , with the joy of feeling that I need not trouble the Bishop of
Worcester	LOCATION	to whom I forgot to send an excuse -- and that no one thenceforward would so much as ask whether I was sound on the Atonement . ''

		Thus did
Besant	PERSON	reacli the critical point in his career , and thus was the course of his future determined .

		He did not know -- few of us do know at such times -- how momentous was the decision thus taken .

		It was only in after years , looking back to his early manhood , that he could realize all that it meant .

		`` Though I could not suspect the fact , I was about to equip myself -- with travel , with the society of all kinds of men , with the acquisition of things practical .

		-- for the real solid work of my life , which has been the observation of men and women , and the telling of stories about them . ''

		The
Mauritius	LOCATION	appointment was as professor of mathematics ; the engagement lasted for six years , when
Besant	PERSON	returned to
England	LOCATION	, at the age of thirty-one .

		He had been making special studies in French literature , and his next piece of work was to put together the essays that made up his book on '' Early French Poetry . ''

		The publication of this book gave him literary standing , and his pen was engaged by various editors from this time on .

		The year of its publication also brought him a piece of good luck in his appointment to the post of paid secretary to the Palestine Exploration Fund .

		For eighteen years he occupied this post , which gave him a modest but sure in - come , and left him much time for literary work .

		During this time he was connected ofBcially with two matters that made much stir in the learned world .

		One was the discovery of the
Moabite Stone	ORGANIZATION	, the other was the
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	forgery of Shapira .

		His friendship with
E. H. Palmer	PERSON	naturally belongs to this part of his life , a friendship which resulted , after
Palmer	PERSON	's dramatictaking-off , in one of the most charming biographies in our language .


Besant	PERSON	's first attempt at novel-writing dates from the
Mauritius	LOCATION	years , and this is the author 's humorous account of the venture : '' I also wrote a novel .

		It was a long novel , intended for the then orthodox three volumes .

		I wrote it with great enjoyment , and I persuaded myself that it was good .

		Finally I sent it to
England	LOCATION	and had it submit - ted to a publisher .

		His verdict was in plain language -- ' Wo n't do , but has promise . '

		When I got home I re - ceived back the MS. , and I agreed with the verdict ; it was a happy thing for me that the MS. was not pub - lished .

		The papers lay in my chamber for a long time afterwards in a corner covered with dust .

		They got upon my nerves .

		I used to see a goblin sitting on the pile ; an amorphous goblin , with tearful eyes , big head , shapeless body , long arms and short legs .

		He would wag his head mournfully .

		< Do n't make another like me , ' he said . '

		Not like me .

		I could n't bear to meet another like me . '

		At last I plucked up courage and burned the whole pile .

		Then my goblin vanished and I saw him no more .

		I expected him some time after , if only to thank me for not making another like him .

		But he came not , and I have often wondered whither that goblin went for rest and consolation . ''

		Early in
Besant	LOCATION	's career as a novelist he formed his famous partnership with
James Rice	PERSON	, which lasted for ten years , and resulted in as many novels of dual authorship .

		Of these novels , '' The Chaplain of the Fleet '' is the one that he liked best .

		Of the novels which
Besant	PERSON	wrote independently , after the death of his collaborator , he singles out ''
Dorothy Foster	PERSON	'' as the best , '' The Fourth Generation '' as the most serious , and '' Children of Gibeon '' as the most truthful .

		Altogether , he produced eighteen novels in the years between
1882	DATE	and
1900	DATE	.

		They made him many friends and many enemies .

		Looking back upon the whole series , he gives us this manly and moving statement of his attitude toward life and the world of men : '' I think , my work has never yet been gloomy .

		Thank Heaven !

		I have had less during my life , so far , to make me gloomy iu the sixties than falls to the lot of many men in the thirties .

		Let me , in what remains of life , preserve cheerfulness , if only the cheerfulness of common gratitude .

		No one ought to acknowledge more profoundly than myself the happiness that has been bestowed upon me ; the domestic peace ; the free - dom from pecuniary troubles ; literary success in a measure unhoped-for ; a name known all over the English-speaking world ; and circles of friends .

		And with them a whole army of enemies -- exactly such enemies as one , at the outset , would desire above all things to make ; the spiritualistic fraud with his lying pretensions and his revelations revealing nothing from the other world ; the sickly sentimentalist blubbering over the righteous punishment of the sturdy rogue ; and the shrieking sisterhood .

		They are all my enemies , and if , at the beginning of life , I had been asked what enemies I would make -- could I have made a better choice ? ''

		In this nunc dimittis strain the whole nature

		THE DIAL 9 • of the man is revealed -- its cheerful temper , its robust optimism , its honest hatred of pre - tense , and its broad humanity .

		Those who enjoyed the honor of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's friendship know that these words are the true index of his strong and lovable character , and seem to hear the living voice once more speaking to them from these pages .

		And now that '' he hath attained this also , to be at rest , '' the mem - ory of his sincere and helpful life comes back to us as an inspiration , and makes us delight in the heritage of forthright manliness that he has left us for an example .

		The Latest and Last of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's `` Writings .

		* Feelings of the most opposite nature remain after the reading of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's volume of '' Facts and Comments '' : thankful - ness that he has been spared so long , sorrow that he is to write no more .

		The little preface sets forth the reasons for the book . ''

		During the years spent in writing various systematic works , '' he says , '' there have from time to time arisen ideas not fitted for incorporation in them . ''

		These ideas form the bulk of the book , though there is an occasional addendum to the '' Synthetic Philosophy '' also included .

		`` Possibly to a second edition I shall make some small additions , '' he concludes , '' but , be this as it may , the volume herewith issued I can say with certainty will be my last . ''

		And a fitting end it makes to a great work greatly conceived and greatly done .

		There are thirty-nine brief essays in '' Facts and Comments , '' -- much briefer , on an aver - age , than the papers included in the earlier volumes like '' Illustrations of Universal Pro- gress '' and '' Essays , Moral , Political , and Es - thetic . ''

		The widest range is given , making the work in general effect a sort of exalted scrap-book .

		The volume of '' Various Frag - ments '' is also suggested by the treatment accorded the topics here .

		The commercial world , imperialism vs. righteousness , music and literature , art in general , education , lin - guistics , psychology , meteorology , gymnastics and hygiene , the science of history , religion in the broad and undogmatic sense , personal rem - iniscence , and much more of a similar nature , will indicate the philosopher 's scope .

New York	LOCATION	:
D. AppletoQ & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		To say that everything included falls within
Huxley	LOCATION	's admirable definition of science as '' organized common-sense '' is to be expected .

		Many of the statements come home with the force of truisms , yet not one is to be passed lightly by .

		Who can deny , for example , the crying need for such thought as this ? ''

		I detest that conception of social progress which presents as its aim , increase of population , growth of wealth , spread of commerce .

		In the politico-economic ideal of human existence there is contemplated quan - tity onlv and not quality .

		Instead of an immense amount of life of low type I would far sooner see half the amount of life of high type .

		A prosperity which is exhibited in Board-of-Trade tables , year by year in - creasing their totals , is to a large extent not a pros - perity , but an adversity .

		Increase in the swarms of people whose existence is subordinated to material de - velopment is rather to be lamented than to be rejoiced over . ''

		This same thought is expanded in another direction in the article on '' State Education . ''

		As an evolutionist , Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	regards the imposition of the book learning of the com - mon schools , -- '' education artificially pressed forward , '' in his apt phrase , -- upon the lower classes of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, as revolutionary and causative of great and untoward disturbances in the social state .

		From the ability to read being fostered when the ability to think is still undeveloped , he argues the growth of imperial - ism , the rise and masterfulness of `` yellow journalism , '' and a number of other evil things .

		So far as he deals with the sort of education given commonly in state-supported schools , he seems to be at one here with Dr.
John Dewey	PERSON	and Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	, who , however , express themselves as holding that the evils complained of grow out of mistakes in the school curricula rather than in education itself .

		Mr.
Walter H. Page	PERSON	, in a lately published volume , seeks to identify training and education ; and it is here that the fault probably lies and the rem - edy is to be found .

		Too much book learning and too little training are doubtless at the bot - tom of , the trouble , and the disposition of the British as well as the American people to wan - der away from paths of common-sense in poli - tics may better be laid to lack of training -- i. e. , to improper education -- rather than to education as such .

		There are two interesting chapters on '' Style , '' extensions of the well-known essay of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's youth .

		The first of the two is given up to criticism of the phrasing of cer - tain extracts from the stylists ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and
Francis Palgrave	PERSON	among them , in disproof of '' the current belief that a good style implies 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, linguistic culture -- implies classical education and study of the best models , '' and counter - proof that '' the great mass of those who have had the discipline of a university do not write well . ''

		The second of these chapters is a sort of criticism of the author 's own essay of an
earlier day	TIME	, in which he openly confesses that he has not followed his own precepts , and finds his writings obnoxious to his own strictures .

		He says in this connection : '' From moment to moment such words and forms of expression as habit had made natural to me were used without thought of their conformity or nonconformity to the principles I had espoused .

		Occasionally , indeed , when revising a manuscript or a proof , one of these principles has been recalled and has dictated the sub - stitution of a word , or the search for a brief phrase to replace a long one .

		But the effect has been extremely small .

		The general traits of my style have remained unchanged , notwithstanding my wish to change some of them .

		There is substantial truth in the French say - ing .

		Varying it somewhat , we may say : Style is or - ganic .

		Doubtless organization may be modified , but the function , like the structure , retains its fundamental characters . ''

		Another interesting question , and one of more importance to contemporaneous literature than is at first apparent , is discussed thus : '' Up to
1860	DATE	my books and review articles were written .

		Since then they have all been dictated .

		There is a prevailing belief that dictation is apt to cause dif - fuseness , and I think the belief is well founded .

		It was once remarked to me by two good judges -- the Leweses -- that the style of Social Statics is better than the style of my later works , and , assuming this opinion to be true , the contrast may , I think , be as - cribed to the deteriorating effect of dictation .

		A recent experience strengthens me in this conclusion .

		When finally revising
First Principles	ORGANIZATION	, which was dictated , the cutting out of superfluous words , clauses , sentences , and sometimes paragraphs , had the effect of abridging the work by fifty pages -- about one-tenth . ''

		One of the most interesting papers in the book is that on '' Feeling versus Intellect . ''

		Beginning with an anecdote of Professor
Hux	PERSON	- ley concerning the unexpectedly large brain of the porpoise , Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	goes on to show that this brain capacity , '' seemingly out of all re - lation to the creature 's needs , '' is due to the unusual amount of feeling which it manifests , and then goes on to discuss a popular and egregious error . ''

		There has grown up universally an identification of mind with intelligence .

		Partly because the guidance of our actions by thought is so conspicuous , and partly because speech , which occupies so large a space in our lives , is a vehicle that makes thought predominant to ourselves and others , we are led to suppose that the thought element of mind is its chief element ; an ele - ment often excluding from recognition every other .

		Consequently , when it is said that the brain is the organ of the mind , it is assumed that the brain is chiefly if not wholly the organ of the intellect .

		`` The error is an enormous one .

		The chief compo - nent of mind is feeling .

		To see this it is necessary to get rid of the wrong connotations which the word mind has acquired , and to use instead its equivalent -- con - sciousness .

		Mind properly interpreted is coextensive with consciousness ; all parts of consciousness are parts of mind .

		Sensations and emotions are parts of con - sciousness , and so far from being its minor components they are its major components . ''

		Here , perhaps , is to be found the reason for the decay of pure poetry -- which is primarily feeling -- in popular estimation , and the sub - stitution for it of didactic verse among many persons whose intellect has been developed at the expense of their emotions .

		But this is as nothing compared to the further effects of doc - trine , as eloquently set forth by Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	in the following paragraph : '' An over - valuation of teaching is necessarily a con - comitant of this erroneous interpretation of mind .

		Everywhere the cry is -- Educate , educate , educate !

		Everywhere the belief is that by such culture as schools furnish , children , and therefore adults , can be moulded into the desired shapes .

		It is assumed that when men are taught what is right , they will do what is right -- that a proposition intellectually accepted will be morally operative .

		And yet this conviction , contradicted by every-day experience , is at variance with an every-day axiom the axiom that each faculty is strengthened by exercise of it -- intellectual power by intellectual action , and moral power by moral action .

		The current notion is that these causes and effects can be transposed -- that assent to an injunction will be followed by exercise of the correlative feeling .

		... It seems , however , that this unlimited faith in teaching is not to be changed by facts .

		Though in presence of multitudinous schools , high and low , we have the rowdies and Hooligans , the savage disturbers of meetings , the adulterators of food , the givers of bribes and receivers of corrupt commis - sions , the fraudulent solicitors , the bubble companies , yet the current belief continues unweakened ; and re - cently in
America	LOCATION	an outcry respecting the yearly in - crease of crime was joined with an avowed determina - tion not to draw any inferences adverse to their educa - tional system .

		But the refusal to recognize the futility of mere instruction as a means to moralization is most strikingly shown by ignoring the conspicuous fact that after two thousand years of Christian exhortations , uttered by a hundred thousand priests throughout
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , pagan ideas and sentiments remain rampant , from emperors down to tramps .

		Principles admitted in theory are scorned in practice .

		Forgiveness is voted dishonorable .

		An insult must be wiped out by blood : the obligation being so peremptory that an officer is expelled from the army for even daring to question it .

		And in international affairs the sacred duty of revenge , supreme with the savage , is supreme also with the so - called civilized . ''

		If space availed , it would be worth while showing the amplification of this last idea in the treatment of such cries as that attributed to
Stephen Decatur	PERSON	, Jr. , '' My country , right or wrong ! ''

		It would certainly be profitable to show the connection noted in the title of the

		THE DIAL .

		11 paper on '' Imperialism and Slavery . ''

		In other fields , the general disregard of the part played by the individual in the development of world-resources by socialists and coUectivists generally deserves consideration .

		And so does the general conclusion arrived at in respect of art , that its function as an amusement is suffi - cient justification for its existence .

		Generally speaking , the book shows the same openness and receptivity to new impres - sions that have been so marked a part of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's mental equipment throughout his career as a philosopher , and with this a devel - opment of feeling for right and a refusal to be governed bv opportunity rather than principle as welcome as they are rare .

		That intention is now realized , and the two handsome volumes of Mr.

		In his preface , the author questions whether the usual choice '' of the history of

		In the mediaeval period , he argues , the Empire and the
Papacy	LOCATION	were the great factors ; while the larger interests in modern times were the Reformation and the Thirty Years ' War , the men whose work has proved permanent were Frederick the Great and William I .

		It is therefore a fair inference that he offers his treatment of German history as furnishing this labyrinthine clue , which every student certainly needs ; and from this point of view a few words are in order .

		First , as to the general plan .

		Apparently , since the earlier work extended to the end of the great inter-regnum , the new history gives only a rapid survey of that period , devoting to it only a hundred and twenty pages , while the remainder of the first volume -- some three hundred and seventy pages -- brings the nar - rative down to the Peace of

Hen	PERSON	- derson to devote much space to ground covered more fully in his earlier volume ; but as that work is not mentioned as introductory to this , he seems to have committed , in a different way .

		the error he urges against German writers of presupposing '' more knowledge than is usu - ally to be found in American readers . ''

		Due regard for symmetry might well have dictated a fuller treatment of the formation of German institutions : otherwise the title should have shown that the book dealt chiefly with modem times .

		So , too , a better sense of proportion woald have forbidden so brief a mention of the attempts made under
Maximilian	PERSON	to reform the constitution at the
end of the fifteenth century	DATE	, while the Landsknechts are described at some length .

		So important a fact as the introduc - tion of the Roman law is simply touched upon ; its far-reaching and permanent consequences are not emphasized as they deserve .

		The first impression made by the book is , however , its readableness .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's style is generally clear , although now and then ambiguous sentences or annoying mannerisms , especially in the use of pronouns , are to be noted .

		Thus , the sentence -LRB- Vol .

		XL , p. 106 -RRB- , '' It proved ... a phantom that
Frederick William	PERSON	was chasing ; the last of the
Pfalz	LOCATION	- Neuburgers outlived himself , and his son , '' etc The author intends to say that the
King	PERSON	did not live to see the extinction of the male line in the house in question : though that is hardly made clear by his syntax .

		But snch quibbles aside , it may be said that the interest of the book is extraordinarily well sustained .

		In the portrayal of single dramatic incidents , of remarkable scenes , the author is not only at his best , but shows real power .

		An excel - lent illustration of this is the account of the corpses displayed to
Frederick William	PERSON	in his castle-vard after the barricade fights at
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	.

		But this very effort at striking description becomes at times a source of weakness , leading as it does to a collocation of facts , perfectly correct in themselves but easily suggesting an inaccurate or incorrect inference .

		Thus , the remains of the lake-dwellers and those at
Hall	PERSON	- statt are spoken of as if they were the earliest sources of knowledge regarding the Germans .

		The probability is that in the latter case the remains are Celtic ; while , as far as the former 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, are concerned , lake-dwellings have been found in so many parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, as well as in abo - riginal
America	LOCATION	, that no valid conclusions re - garding distinctively German civilization can be drawn .

		But a more important case in point is found in the pages on Luther 's disputation at
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	relates how the great Reformer once came upon a book by
Huss	PERSON	, and , slamming it to , thrust it away as a thing of evil ; he follows this at once by the statement that Luther was now `` forced to acknowledge ... that many of these teach - ings were right christian and evangelical . ''

		Now both statements are true , but the natural inference that the two acts followed close upon each other is not correct .

		Luther had come gradually to see that he must admit that
Huss	PERSON	was in many points right ; he made , however , no sudden change of base .

		Instances of a simi - lar nature might easily be multiplied ; but the one is enough to suggest what seems perhaps the greatest defect in the work -- the lack of careful analysis of causes and of characters .

		Individuals stand out in bold outline , but in a man like Luther the development of his opin - ions is a matter of the greatest importance .

		What we have is the distinctness of a '' snap - shot '' rather than the life-like reality of a portrait which suggests the struggles that ma - tured the man .

		In another respect the book is distinctly disappointing , -- in the little space devoted to the Culturgeschichte of the German people .

		The chapter on the Age of Chivalry , for ex - ample , contains an array of facts regarding the life of various classes ; but the expression of that life in the great epics of the day is quite inadequately treated .

		Excepting a page or two in
Parzival	LOCATION	, the literature of the period is hardly mentioned .

		The Nibelungenlied is not named , nor are the great court epics and the Minnesingers discussed .

		More satisfactory are the pages on the intellectual conditions at the beginning of the Reformation , particularly the paragraphs on the '' Letters of Obscure Men '' ; but the literary significance of Luther 's trans - lation of the
Bible	LOCATION	is only incidentally touched upon , and its national importance , in preserving a common idiom for north and south
Germany	LOCATION	, is entirely passed over .

		So , too , even the names of
Lessing	LOCATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Schiller	PERSON	do not occur in the index to the second volume .

		It would seem , indeed , that the title of the work ought to contain a qualifying adjective and read , '' A Short Political History of
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		It was doubtless not intended by the author , but to some , at least , of the newspaper para - graphers , the title of the book has suggested a comparision with
Green	ORGANIZATION	's '' Short History of the English People . ''

		Such a comparison is unfortunate , for it only tends to emphasize '' what might have been . ''

		The student who gets his introduction to English history from
Green	ORGANIZATION	may need to supplement his knowledge with a summary of political events , but he gets a grasp of the fundamental causes , a clear picture of the growth of a mighty nation , a broad background for understanding its na - tional life as expressed in English literature of the past and present .

		All this is lacking in Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book .

		He gives the political out - line , the facts as they are stated and accepted by the most scholarly modern authorities .

		What he does not give us is the growth of in - dividuals , the development of society with all its shifting and changing elements which give to each age its peculiar character .

		But of his - torians like Green there have been few ; nor does the training of German universities con - tribute largely to their making .

		Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son has , however , given us an excellent , read - able , and trustworthy account of the course of political events in
Germany	LOCATION	, -- the best in the English language , and one that deserves and will have a place in every library and on the shelves of every student who is interested in the story of the
Fatherland	LOCATION	.

		The Basis of Social , Relations .

		* It is pleasing to note the increasing interest in anthropological study in
America	LOCATION	, where the subject is rapidly taking its place in the uni - versities as an independent scientific branch .

		The persistent and valuable work of the

		America is the true home of the sci - ence of Ethnology , an important branch of anthropological study .

		It is naturally to be expected , therefore , that our universities and colleges should include this subject in their cur - ricula , not only as an independent culture study but also as a necessary support to more widely extended studies in Sociology .

		THE DIAL 13 recent posthumous work on '' The Basis of Social Relations . ''

		Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	's services to the science of Anthropology need no commen - dation .

		The present work , however , does not show him at his best .

		The book contains many interesting chapters more or less disconnected , as if it were the first draft of the book , or at least as if the work had not yet received the finishing touches from the author 's pen .

		While it contains much useful information , and is suggestive of many unique and striking char - acteristics of the nature of groups of individ - uals , it is somewhat wanting in unity and sci - entific poise .

		Part I. treats of the cultural history of the ethnic mind , in which the author proceeds to urge the unitv of the human mind and then to show that there is an ethnic mind to which the individnal mind bears a specific relation .

		He demonstrates quite conclusively the universal - ity of mental characteristics , and in the very interesting discussion following he seeks to show that there is a true ethnic mind , a trans - cendent ego beyond the individual and over which the individual has no control .

		In order to do this he has enlarged the conception of `` ethnic , '' making it represent any group of people closely related by social environment , -- which , from the standpoint of an anthro - pologist , is an unfair assumption .

		Race , from a scientific standpoint , certainly refers to per - manent stock , and indeed Ls something more than consanguineal relations .

		Hence it is much more limited than common social relations .

		In other words , the author has substituted sociu ^ for ethnos , and has passed from the field of Anthropology into the field of pure Sociology .

		While he assumes that there is a distinct eth - nic mind , he has not demonstrated that there is anything more than conscious thinking , feel - ing , and willing together of the so-called ethnic group .

		What he presents is interesting , but it is better presented by the sociologists through a study of the socisd mind ; for , indeed , our author is forced to leave the ethnic basis for the social basis .

		The chapter on the physiological variation in the ethnic mind is especially thoughtful and interesting , presenting as it does ideals or types , and the general conformity of the ethnic group to customs , habits , and thoughts .

		Also in the second part , which treats of the natural his - tory of the ethnic mind , the chapters on social and geographical environment show the results of close observation .

		In the former the author holds with some force '' that ethnic psychology , I the group-mind , is a product of social relations , ; a result of aggregation , and can not be fully I explained by the process of the individual j mind .

		The resemblances between them are analogies , not homologies .

		They act and re - act on one another with a force of independent psychic entities . ''

		He endeavors to show the influence of the ethnic mind on the individual , '' to bring it in rapport with itself , to make it conform to the mass , to expunge , in fact , all that is individual within it . ''

		But the argu - ment is not conclusive , for the individual mind still maintains its independent activity , the source of the psychic forces of society .

		While the book is valuable in its suggestive - ness in many directions , its main thesis , which assumes the independence of the ethnic mind , is not conclusively proved : and if it is true that ethnic psychology has a place among the exact sciences , as the author claims , he has not dem - onstrated that fact by the book .

		The History and Mystkrt of Lack .

		* One of the most sumptuous books of the year is a new edition of Mrs.
Bury Palliser	PERSON	's '' History of Lace , '' enlarged and partly re - written by
M. Jonrdain	PERSON	and
Alice Dryden	PERSON	.

		By bringing the history up to date and oor - rectinff whatever errors modem research has discovered , the present editors have retained the encyclopaedic character of the information ; while by added illustrations , many of them full-page plates , they have lent the volume something of the value of a cabinet of old lace .

		Indeed , the lover of lace will derive from these marvellously delicate photographs a joy scarcely inferior to that called forth by real
Brussels	LOCATION	and Mechlin .

		The vast mass of fact in the book is made available by a chapter-division according to countries , and a fairly orderly history in each chapter of the particular kind or kinds of lace which the country has produced from early times to the present day .

		The division ac - cording to reigns of the parts which deal with
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, cuts across this main plan rather confusingly , but perhaps could not have been avoided .

		The most interesting chapters are those at the beginning , which trace the de - • HiSTOKT OP Lace .

New York	LOCATION	: Im - ported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, velopment of lace -- as far as that development can be traced -- from embroidery and cut - work ; and those on
Italy	LOCATION	,
Flanders	LOCATION	,
Alen	PERSON	^ on , and
Argentan	LOCATION	.

		The work is largely antiqua - rian , and the fulness of reference to wardrobe rolls , inventories , bills , orders , and letters , not to mention plays and poems , shows the spirit of research in its most strenuous mood .

		To the ordinary novice in lace , the technical part of the work is the least satisfactory ; but if one comes to the end without being able always to tell bobbin-lace from point-lace , he should doubtless blame his own obtuseness , and not attribute lack of clearness to the authors .

		To the initiate , Mrs.
Palliser	PERSON	's minute technical knowledge will be as inspiring as it has been in previous editions of her book .

		For most readers , the greatest virtue of the book will be found in its incidents rather than its main purpose .

		The most un-lacified critic will wonder after reading it , why he never be - fore looked at the world from the lace point of view .

		Certainly toward individuals this point of view is most gracious .

		For example ,
Catherine de Medicis	PERSON	appears to unusual advantage teach - ing fine needlework to her daughters and to
Mary	PERSON	of
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		Admiral
Nelson	PERSON	takes on an unaccustomed charm of domesticity when we see him buying a lace shawl for his wife .

		And
Browning	PERSON	's name has an added endearment when we know that he founded a school of lace - making for the peasant girls of Asolo .

		Some day a novelist will discover the possibilities of a lace background , and give us the romance of
Barbara Uttman	PERSON	's introduction of lace-making into
Germany	LOCATION	, or of
Gustaf Erikson	PERSON	's narrow escape from being betrayed by his lace collar .

		Underneath these suggestions of romance are those of more serious import .

		An impor - tant chapter in the history of art might be writ - ten on the development of lace patterns from the geometric designs of Greek lace through the architectural period of Italian and French lace , and the incidental reign of the '' frying - pan and turkey-tail patterns '' in English Honiton , to the prevalence of designs from nature .

		Many chapters of political history are involved in the story of this most delicate of handicrafts , -- the laying and removing of protective tariffs , the failing power of kings in lace night-caps to keep their subjects from wearing lace collars , and even the Revolution which followed the time when the daughter of Louis XV .

		spent , # 25,000 for the lace-trimmed linen of her trousseau .

		The church has had a large share in the story , having fostered and in many cases inaugurated the craft , treasured its products when they were out of fashion , and also , alas !

		having often set the fashion of ex - travagant display .

		Even the Puritans have set their characteristic stamp on the industry , for it was a fair Puritan of whom
Jasper Mayne	PERSON	wrote , in the days of
King James	LOCATION	, -- '' She works religions petticoatB ; for flowers She ' U make church histories . ''

		The deepest industrial problems underlie the decay of lace-making , which took place in all countries at times varying from the middle of the eighteenth to the middle of the nine - teenth century .

		The revival in many places has also been due to industrial causes .

		We read that '' Irish point owes its genesis to the failure of the potato crop in
1846	DATE	, '' -- an association of cause and effect which the ordi - nary philosopher would not have suspected .

		In many such times of distress , some philan - thropist has searched out one or two old women who made lace in their youth , and per - suaded them to teach younger fingers the half - forgotten stitches .

		There again is a field for romance .

		At present the problem in lace - making , as in all other handicrafts , is how to prevent the cheaper machine product from dis - placing the fabric of skill and delight .

		Mrs.
Palliser	PERSON	's book , which is primarily technical , touches these questions only inci - dentally .

		But that it does touch them , and always with the accurate prick of fact , gives it wider significance than it could otherwise have , and renders it pleasureable as well as illuminating to the general reader .

Patrick	PERSON	, the Patron Saint of

		In his '' Pagan
Ireland	LOCATION	, an Areh - eological Sketch : a Handbook of Irish Pre-Chris - tian Antiquities , ''
Colonel W. G. Wood-Martin	PERSON	, M.B-I.A. , gave ns several years ago a graphic de - scription of this religion .

		It was a religion full of superstitions .

		How could it have been otherwise ?

		Colonel Wood-Martin now gives as a fuller knowl - edge of the same subject , in two sumptuous vol - omes on the '' Traces of the Elder Faiths of Ire - land '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , which he also calls `` A Folklore Sketch '' and a `` Handbook of Irish Pre-Christian Traditions . ''

		In the former work he ransacked the kitchen-middens .

		In the more recent companion volumes he investigates the lore and legends and the superstitious practices of the Irish , with a view to a more perfect knowledge of their religion .

		His contention is that though Christianity is generally sapposed to have annihilated heathenism in
Ireland	LOCATION	, `` in reality it merely smoothed over and swallowed its victim , and the contour of its prey , as in the case of the boa-constrictor , can be distinctly traced under the glistening colours of its beautiful skin .

		Paganism still exists , it is merely inside instead of outside . ''

		And in support of this contention we have two octavo volumes aggregating more than 700 pages of text , comprising a most entertaining col - lection of superstitious practices , legends , traditions , and folk-lore .

		We have no fault whatever to find with the theory Colonel Wood-Martin seeks to main - tain .

		But it is somewhat anachronistic in him to suppose that he is maintaining it in the face of what he is pleased to call - the theologians . ''

		The aver - age theologian of the present day is no stickler for
Archbishop Ussher 's Chronology	ORGANIZATION	.

		He readily ad - mits , and without fear of ecclesiastical censure , that the worship of the heathen was rendered to some object which symbolized a debased and unworthy conception of Deity , and that the same worship might laudably be rendered to the true God ; and that many usages of heathen times have been adopted by the Church and endowed with
Chris	PERSON	- tian meaning .

		The modern `` theologian '' distinctly calls attention to the fact that the earliest Christian art was largely an adaptation of such heathen sym - bols as might be converted readily to the teaching of Christian truths .

		As with matters of public fes - tivals and in the use of art .

		so with countless minor usages which had become a part of man 's mental habit toward those mysterious questions as to man 's existence which lay at the base of primitive religion .

		No country on the face of the earth is richer in legendary lore than
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Some of it is , so far as is known , peculiar to the Irish people .

		Some of it is possessed in common with all Indo-European races .

		It has been preserved , in one form or an - other , by oral tradition among the unlettered , since long before the Christian era .

		And now that the science of folk-lore has advanced beyond its merely antiquarian stage , and since its correlation to phil - ology , archeology , ethnology , and history are fully recognized , we may congratulate ourselves that all these traces of the Elder Faiths have been preserved in order that they may be studied and may tell us much more of the past than we should otherwise know .

		Christian teachers , no less than others , will acknowledge their indebtedness to the patient toil of Colonel Wood-Martin in collecting the vast material for his volumes , and presenting it with illustrations numbering more than 180 , with a bibliography cit - ing more than 900 titles , and with a helpful index to each volome .

		A
Utitry	ORGANIZATION	' * English Music in the XlXth Cen - tfrnsifr * tury '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , by Mr.
J. A. Fuller Aiyibi	PERSON	_ ``
M. Maitland	PERSON	, is the first of a series of volumes intended to give an account , as exhaust - ive as possible , of the progress of music and mu - sical knowledge during the last century in such countries as
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	and Aus - tria ,
Italy	LOCATION	, the Slavonic lands ,
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the introduction of the in - itial volume , the editor voices the optimistic view that in
England	LOCATION	musical knowledge has increased so fast , and become so comparatively widespread , that the country bids fair to reoecupy that posi - tion which she has not held since the day of Pnrcell , -- '' for music is slowly but surely be - coming again an integral part of the life of the | > eople , '' With the single exception of the inor - dinate love of foreign as compared with English music , the general artistic atmosphere of the country was by no means a low one , and the reason that no great works were produced during
the first half of the century	DATE	must be sought ebewhere than in any public indifference to the art ; however , it does not take a lengthy explanation to show the reader of the present day how complete in the ear - lier part of the century was the severance of the operatic stage from anything that could make for the interests of English art in any form .

		In a chap - ter on church composers , Mr.
Maitland	PERSON	points out that until quite late in the last century the music of the English Church was a thing by itself ; the an - them was a form distinctly and characteristically English . ''

		If the musical influence of the English Church is less than it was , the cause is to be found in the wider artistic views of the average musician , and it is probably an inevitable result of the
Renais	PERSON	- sance that the noble traditions of the past should seem to suffer . ''

		Yet , after all , is it not true that there would be a nearer approach to a reconciliation between conflicting interests if there was a closer sympathy between the standard of music within the church and that of educated society outside ?

		Church music thrives best when it retains a con - scious touch with the large musical movements of the world .

		Taking a prospective view , the author believes that the main evils of the country 's musical life are threefold : first , the diffusion of public in - terests ; second , the bane of professionalism ; and third , the fungus of commercialism .

		And , as a 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, parting admonition , he expresses the belief that music in
England	LOCATION	is the only one of the arts that has a vivid life at the present moment ; and it is for the English to set the example of appreciating native attainment , if that attainment is ever to en - joy , what English music has never yet obtained , the wide recognition of the rest of the world .

		On the whole , Mr.
Maitland	PERSON	has skilfully drawn from a somewhat abundant material only that which can lend color and form to the characterization of his subject .

		The book is not a mere conglomeration of odds and ends , having no definite purpose in view , but a finely composed mosaic , each part being carefully fitted to its neighbor , and its separate value and identity made to subserve the general e # fect , tracing the history and progress of English music during the nineteenth century .

		siudietin Sociologists have pointed out from Experimental time to time the necessity of collect - Socioiogy .

		j „ g ^ large number of data , and of demonstrating from observation the principles in - volved .

		Too much of our sociology is merely the philosophy of society expounded in the class-room ; good , wholesome culture-study it is , but not calcu - lated to give definite character to the science .

		This must come from a careful scientific investigation of society as it is , rather than from a philosophy about society in the ideal .

		The recent work by Miss
Frances Kellor	PERSON	on '' Experimental Sociology '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is one of the boldest attempts of mod - ern times to study abnormal society from an '' ex - perimental '' standpoint , or , what would seem a more appropriate expression , from the standpoint of sci - entific investigation .

		This kind of investigation is in this domain the most difficult in the whole range of science .

		The chemist has control of the elements with which he works ; the botanist can analyze the plant with little difficulty , destroying it if neces - sary ; the zoologist may make the forms of animal life entirely subservient to science ; but the sociolo - gist must be dependent upon the whims of human beings or the caprices of society for his knowledge .

		He may watch and observe what individuals do in their social capacity , but he has no power to dissect society or force it through experiments , as the an - atomist does the cat , the biologist the bacteria , the zoologist the frog , or the botanist the plant .

		Espe - cially difficult is the study of the broken parcels or remnants of humanity , such as the delinquents or criminals , which Miss Kellor has had the courage to attempt .

		Lombroso ,
Corre	ORGANIZATION	, and others in
Europe	LOCATION	, have done much to throw light upon the subject of criminals , but no one in
America	LOCATION	has before at - tempted to systematically study female offenders .

		Miss Kellor has gone about from prison to prison , opening laboratories for the study of delinquents .

		While the results are not final , -- for , indeed , the work is considered by the author as only a begin - ning , -- it points the way to a system of thorough investigation .

		While there are many discouraging features in final conclusions , it must be remembered that
Lombroso	PERSON	, with his years of study , has finally been forced to renounce his favorite assumption that there is a universal criminal type distinguished from the non-criminal .

		Nevertheless ,
Lombroso	PERSON	's work is of incalculable value to humanity , and espe - cially to the science of criminology .

		Probably , in a different way .

		Miss
Kellor	PERSON	's work will prove of in - estimable value to the study of social pathology .

		The book throws much light upon the penal system of the South , the causes of crime , and the increase of criminality among women .

		It points out the defects in penal and correctional systems , and sug - gets methods of preventing crime .

		It is a valuable contribution to sociological literature .

		The subjects handled are such as '' The Pole-star , '' ''
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Photography in
Astron	ORGANIZATION	- omy , '' `` The Heliometer , '' `` The Moon Hoax , '' '' The Sun 's Destination , '' etc. .

		Technicalities are eschewed , and matters difficult of explanation are handled in so deft a fashion that the reader is unconscious of mental strain .

		The information con - veyed is up to date , and generally accurate .

		Occa - sionally there is a slight error which will scarcely escape the notice of a critical reader .

		For example , the first sentence on page 89 is erroneous through neglect of the effect of refraction .

		Again , on page 148 we read concerning unimpeded sea-waves that '' they consist simply of particles of water moving straight up and down . ''

		On page 189 , in line 6 from below , for `` impossible '' one should read '' possible . ''

		Remembering the uncertainty of our knowledge as to the exact location of the sun 's goal , one is rather astonished to read on pages 222-3 the following statement : `` A tiny circle might be drawn on the sky , to which an astronomer might point his hand and say , ` Yonder little circle contains the goal toward which the sun and planets are hastening to-day . ' ''

		Despite these and a few other inaccuracies of the sort .

Jacoby	PERSON	's essays may be characterized as in the main trust - worthy ; they are also fresh and readable .

Maemillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a new and cheaper form , which is quite as serviceable if not as sumptuous as the first editions , published respectively in
1898	DATE	and
1900	DATE	.

		In spite of obvious deficiencies , these books may be commended as among the best elementary aids to the study of design that are available .

		In - tended primarily to trace the relationship between the various arts of design and their dependence upon the same underlying principles , the field cov - ered in ' ■ The Bases of Design '' is necessarily a wide one , and the attempt to treat it even gener - aUy within the limits of a single volume gives a discursive character to the work and results in a lack of proportion between the several branches of the subject ; of this , however , the author is fully conscious .

		Notwithstanding this limitation , the work is one of much practical value , and has the advan - tage of having been written by an artist and not by one whose knowledge is only at second-hand ; the principles inculcated are sound , and much use - ful technical information is introduced by way of illustration .

		`` Line and Form , '' which , like its companion volume , is made up from lectures de - livered to the students of the
Manchester Munici	PERSON	- pal School of Art , deals with the various elements of composition , and explains , perhaps as well as i '' possible in a book , the considerations which the designer should take chiefly into account .

		If it falls somewhat short of being a comprehensive treatise , the author tells us that 1 ^ intention is to be suggestive and helpful without attempting to be exhaustive in dealing with a subject which , as he truly says , `` it would be difficult enough to ex - haust . ''

		It would therefore be invidious to com - plain that we must look elsewhere for insight into the higher qualities , such as harmonic proportions and line and space ideas , which nevertheless are fundamental to good art .

		DrnfUaff While avowedly indebted to Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's great seventeenth-een - ^ fsimajt .

		jijyy history , and to the well-known works of Miss
Strickland	PERSON	and Mrs.
Everett-Green	PERSON	, '' Five Stuart Princesses '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , written by five Oxford men , including the general editor , Mr.
Robert S. Rait	PERSON	, is a compilation of more than ordinary merit .

		The available authorities seem to have been conscientiously consulted , and each bio - g ^ phy presents both a character sketch of its sub - ject and a view of the political and social conditions of the time .

		Elizabeth of
Bohemia	LOCATION	, daughter of
James I. ; Mary of Orange	PERSON	, daughter of
Charles I.	PERSON	and mother of
William III.	LOCATION	;
Henrietta of Orleans	LOCATION	, a younger sister of the foregoing ; and
Sophia	PERSON	of
Hanover	LOCATION	, granddaughter of
James I.	PERSON	and mother of
George I.	PERSON	, -- these four comprise a somewhat nearly related g ^ oup of royal dames of the seven - teenth century .

		To them has been added a fif - teenth-century princess ,
Margaret	PERSON	, daughter of
James I.	PERSON	of
Scotland	LOCATION	, and danphine of
France	LOCATION	.

		Her story is little known , and is well worth re - peating .

		The book will be all the more welcome because of the interest in several of its characters aroused by recent historical studies from the pens of Mr.
W. H. Wilkins	PERSON	, Mrs.
Henry Ady	PERSON	,
M. Jos	PERSON	- serand , and others .

		Eight portraits and a view of Princess
Margaret	PERSON	's tomb accompany the text .

		jr Jite J '''' iiri ^ ^ 6n
Lord Avebury	PERSON	-LRB- who has so • H SngiUt recently been elevated to the peer - ' * ™ * ^ - age that we are wont to think of him still as Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	, the banker , states - man , scientific investigator , and member of more than a score of scientific societies -RRB- writes a book , we may expect something worth reading .

		For he succeeds where most writers upon scientific subjects fail , in making natural history interesting to the average reader by writing in a style suited alike to the scientific and the unscientific mind .

		His recent book on * ' The Scenery of
England	LOCATION	and the Causes to Which It Is Due '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- does not disap - point OS .

		It is a large book , containing more than 500 pages well illustrated and helpfully indexed .

		It is furthermore supplied with a glossary of terms 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, but 80 popular is the author 's style that in most cases the glossary has but to refer to a page of his text , where the term will be found fully explained .

		The book is of the same general character as the author 's `` Scenery of
Switzerland	LOCATION	and the Causes to Which It Is Due , '' and Sir
Archibald Geikie	PERSON	's '' Scenery of
Scotland	LOCATION	Viewed in Connection with its Physical Geography . ''

		It is , in fact , a history of scenery ; and to the lovers of scenery the de - lights of a beautiful landscape will be greatly en - hanced by the knowledge which may be derived from this book of the natural causes that have been operating for ages for the production of moun - tain , river , lake , plain , forest , and coastrline .

		For the knowledge of physical geography and physical geology into which
Lord Avebury	PERSON	initiates his read - ers may be applied to scenery all over the world .

		And this book , no less than others by the same author , stimulates the reader to observe closely what has been going on in the world about him .

		He may find that even law and custom have not been without their influence upon the scenery of the land in which he lives , and that local divisions and the sites of towns are closely related to the causes that have shaped the features of a land - scape .

		It is doubtful if
Judith	PERSON	and her !

		y * ^ ** '' American garden can win the hearts Garden . ''

		= .

		, • i t - > i - i i • , of the public as did Elizabeth with her German garden .

		Both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	have furnished us with ample , with almost sur - feiting accounts of the disasters and delights of garden-making at the hands of inexperienced and sentimental young wives ; with full records of their pleasant and even flippant conversations on garden topics with their patient husbands ; with a proper touch of comedy in their altercations and collab - orations with gardeners of foreign birth , whether Irish or German .

		It amused us once or thrice ; but we fear
Judith	PERSON	must act out her little part to a scant - ily filled house , notwithstanding the fact that the book is in many ways a good one , with many pages of interest for garden-lovers and garden - workers , and some clever word-painting .

		In outward form , the volume is most attractive .

		Each page is en - closed in a decorative border of a -RSB- -RRB- propriate green , and there are a number of charming illustrations in color .

Lothrop Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- BRIEFER MENTION .

		The
Mississippi Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Mr.
Franklin L. Riley	PERSON	, secretary -RRB- sends us Volume V. of its
Publica	LOCATION	- tions , consisting of an inventory of historical material relating to the
State	ORGANIZATION	, whether held in public or private hands .

		Prepared by many hands , under the direction of the
Mississippi Historical Commission	ORGANIZATION	, this document is of great value to students of Southern history , and represents a useful form of activity that every State in the
Union	LOCATION	should undertake while there is yet time .

		Throughout the country , historical material of the ut - most importance is being recklessly or ignorantly de - stroyed , aud a systematic effort should be made every - where to arrest this vandalism .

		It is highly encouraging to note the efforts made by
Mississippi	LOCATION	with this end in view , and there are not a few States , even in the North , that might profit by this Southern example .

		The publishers of the '' Athenseum Press Series , '' Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have done wisely in commissioning a volume of '' Selections from Ue Quincey '' for that admirable collection of English masterpieces .

		De Quincey is past the stage in which his works are likely to be read -LRB- or even possessed -RRB- as a whole ; yet there are things among them that no lover of good literature would willingly let die .

		Dr.
Milton Haight Turk	PERSON	is the editor of the present volume , which is a substantial one , offering four hundred pages of text , besides fifty of introduction and another hundred of notes .

		We have here the '' Confessions , '' selections from the '' Suspiria , '' several autobiographical and reminiscent chapters , and two or three of the more popular mis - cellaneous papers .

		The
Department of Superintendence of the National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	met in
Chicago	LOCATION
last February	DATE	for a three days ' session .

		The proceedings of the con - ference are now published in separate form , pending their later appearance in the annual volume of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the papers read , we note as of special importance the following : '' Obstacles to Edu - cational Progress , '' by Professor
Paul H. Hanus	PERSON	; `` The Value of Examinations as Determining a Teacher 's Fitness for Work , '' by Superintendent
E. G. Cooley	PERSON	; '' The Ideal Normal School , '' by Professor
W. H. Payne	PERSON	; '' The Danger of Using Biological Analogies in Reason - ing on Educational Subjects , '' by Commissioner
W. T. Harris	PERSON	; '' Altruism as a Law of Education , '' by
Prin	PERSON	- cipal
Arnold Tompkins	PERSON	; and '' The High School as the People 's College , '' by President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	.

		The new
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	lectureship at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	on `` The Re - sponsibilities of Citizenship '' is well begun by a general course on '' American Citizenship , '' given by
Justice Brewer of the Federal Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, and now pub - lished in a small volume by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		As the author says in his preface , it is made up of '' a few plain , simple , commonplace truths in respect to those responsibilities , '' but these truths are so put as to appeal to college men and to earnest young men in general .

		The truths enforced are the obligations of citizenship , especially the maintenance of a good char - acter , service , obedience , and the duty of striving to better the life of the nation .

		This last lecture is very inspiring , making a strong appeal to young men to cherish high ideals of national and social life , and to do their utmost to bring the realities into harmony with them .

		A fragment -LRB- two chapters and the beginning of a third -RRB- of '' The
Moores	PERSON	, '' a projected novel by
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	, serves as the pretext for a new edition of the complete writings of this novelist .

		Mr.
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	is the editor , and Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are the American publishers .

		Other unpublished frag - ments are also promised , a very doubtful boon .

		Dr.
Nicoll	PERSON	's introductions aim to connect
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	's life with her books , and the editor has made use of all the biographical material that is now ever likely to be available . ''


Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' in a handsome volume of over five hundred pages , is the initial volume of this edition .

		Tbe Newcomes , '' in three volumes , is added to the Dent edition of
Thackeray	LOCATION	, published in this country by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	's biblio - graphical note contains matter of much interest regard - ing the inception and publication of the novel , and Mr.
Brock	PERSON	's ten odd drawings in each volume are cleverly done .

		A happy thought in school readers is illustrated by the book called `` Trees in Prose and Poetry , '' pub - lished by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The compilation is made by Misses
Gertrude L. Stone	PERSON	and
M. Grace Fiekett	PERSON	, and tlia adeetions are grouped according to tbe orders and species with which they are concerned , thus providing a felicitous combination of botany and literature .

		`` The Service , '' an essay by
Thoreau	PERSON	hitherto un - published , is issued in a finely-printed volume from the Merrymount Press by Mr.
Charles E. Goodspeed	PERSON	, Bos - ton .

		Originally submitted to '' The Dial '' in
1840	DATE	, but declined by
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	-LRB- then editing that perio - dical -RRB- for reasons not altogether obvious , the manu - script of '' The Service '' passed into
Emerson	PERSON	's hands , and later came into the possession of Mr.
F. B. San	PERSON	- bom , the editor of the present publication .

		The essay is distinctly worthy the beautiful dress now given it , and collectors should hasten to secure copies of the limited edition in which it is issued .

		* ' I was born , '' says
Alexandre Damas	PERSON	, '' at Villers-Cotterets , a little town in the depart - ment of the
Aisne	LOCATION	, on the
Paris	LOCATION	road , about two hundred paces from the
Rue de la Noue	ORGANIZATION	, where Demoustiers died , two leagues from La Ferte-Milon , where
Kacine	PERSON	was born , and seven leagues from
Chateau-Thierry	LOCATION	, where La Fontaine first saw the light .

		I was born on
July 24 , 1802	DATE	, at half-past five in the
morning	TIME	, in the
Rue de Lormet	ORGANIZATION	, in a house which now belongs to my friend
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	, who would gladly sell it to me any day , so that I may be able to die in the very room where I was born . ''

		As a matter of fact , he never did buy the house , bat died ,
December 5 , 1870	DATE	, in a little town near
Dieppe	LOCATION	, whither he had been carried from
Paris	LOCATION	by his devoted son , on the eve of the German investment of the Capital , in order that his last days might be spared the priva - tions of the siege .

		Something more than
a year later	DATE	, when his country was again at peace , his remains received final interment in his native town , in the presence of a famous following of authors , artists , and actors .

		The bit of autobiography above quoted is characteristic at onoe of the geniality and the egotism of the man who wrote it .

		It quite takes for granted the reader 's interest in every slightest personal particular that the writer may see fit to impart : it takes also for granted the reader 's acceptance of the fact that neither
Racine	LOCATION	nor La Fontaine could possibly shed any greater lustre upon the region of their com - mon birth than was shed by the author of `` Monte Cristo '' and '' Les
Trois Mousque	PERSON	- taires . ''

		Of his own greatness , indeed ,
Alex	PERSON	- andre
Dumas	PERSON	retained an unshaken conviction throughout his long career .

		At the height of that career , he could assert with perfect self - assurance that for a quarter of a century past three men ,
Hugo	LOCATION	.

		Lamartine , and himself , had remained at the head of contemporary French literature ; our only marvel is that he should not have set his own name first in that trinity of literary fame .

		We are not of those to whom such assertions are always and necessarily amusing .

		They may express the proud self - consciousness of genius , or they may merely in - dicate a remarkable capacity for self-deception .

		When
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	state what we know to be the simple truth concerning their own work , we applaud rather than rebuke , holding such frank utterance in higher esteem than any exhibition of mock modesty .

		But in the case of Dumas the effect of such self assertion is , on the whole , an entertaining illustration of the delusion of the egotist .

		That he was a great writer in the sense in which Hugo was a great writer is , of course , a preposterous notion : and that he should hon - estly have ranked himself with his most illus - trious contemporary shows only the fact that 28 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
July 16	DATE	, his critical faculty , weak in any case , was absolutely incapable of taking the measure of his own work .

		Although a writer of only the second rank ,
Dumas	PERSON	looms up astonishingly in the French literature of the
last century	DATE	, and he still holds his own surprisingly well .

		In some respects his position is better to-day than it was at any time during his life .

		His enemies did their worst to break down his reputation while he was still alive ; after his death , there was nothing more to be urged against him than had already been urged , and his fame did not suffer the re - action that commonly follows upon the death of a great writer .

		Dumas was never set upon such a pinnacle as Hugo in the esteem of his admir - ing fellow-countrymen , and hence was never in so perilous a position .

		He was immensely popular , but he was not revered as a prophet and a sage .

		He has preserved his popularity at home for a full generation after his death , while abroad he is both better known and better appreciated than he was at any time while alive .

		Long before
Dumas	PERSON	had become popular with English readers , at a time when they thought of him , so far as they thought at all , as of a writer whose stock in trade was a shal - low sensationalism and a picturesque perver - sion of historical happenings , he was known and loved by no less a man than
Thackeray	PERSON	, who found no diflBculty in rising above English prejudice and contracting a very genuine sym - pathy for the most gasconading of Frenchmen .

		But as far as the English-speaking world is concerned , the vogue , if not the fame , of Dumas seems to have been mainly posthumous .

		The last generation was inclined to regard with dark suspicion the works of all French novelists , and the romances of
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	were held , mostly by persons who had never read them , to be typically '' French '' in their wicked levity , and consequently to be shunned by all right - eous minded readers .

		When translated into English , the romances were published in such a way as to repel persons of taste , and attract only those classes of readers to whom literature proper makes no appeal whatever .

		Well do we remember the big and ugly volumes , badly printed and bound in depressing black , in which form alone the American readers of twenty or thirty years ago might make the acquaintance of '' d'Artagnan '' and ''
Monte Cristo	PERSON	. ''

		Things are very different now , when tasteful editions abound , when the old-fashioned prejudices have disappeared , and when we have all of us become more or less denizens of the joyous realm of romantic invention which is still ruled by the spirit of
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	.

		It was along in the eighties , we should say , that English and American readers of the more discriminating sort came to be attracted in con - siderable numbers to the romances of
Dumas	PERSON	.

		Before that time , his following had been large but uncritical , -- it had been a following made up for the most part of seekers for the sensa - tional in literature , of readers who were sat - isfied with highly-spiced invention , and who recked little of constructive art .

		But
Dumas	PERSON	really deserved a better fate than the applause of this class of readers , and he received his deserts in due course of time .

		It was about twenty years ago that two English critics of undeniable authority gave assurance to timid souls that their enjoyment of the French ro - mancer was quite legitimate , and that the adventures of the three musketeers really be - longed to literature .

		It is , we think , chiefly to Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	and
Robert Louis Stev	PERSON	- enson that the literary rehabilitation of
Dumas	PERSON	with the English-speaking public is to be cred - ited , for these men boldly proclaimed what many readers of taste had felt without quite daring to assert .

		They had coupled in thought the names of
Dumas	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	, but Mr.
Lang	PERSON	ventured to make the conjunction on the printed page .

		Addressing the spirit of the Frenchman , he said : '' Than yours there has been no greater nor more kindly and beneficent force in modern letters .

		To
Scott	PERSON	, indeed , you owed the first impulse of your ge - nius ; but , once set in motion , what miracles could it not accomplish ?

		Our dear Porthos was overcome , at last , by a superhuman burden ; but your imaginative strength never found a task too g ^ eat for it .

		It is good , in a day of small and laborious ingenuities , to breathe the free air of your books , and dwell in the company of
Dumas	PERSON	's men -- so gallant , so frank , so indomitable , such swordsmen , and such trenchmen . ''

		This frank and generous praise is echoed by
Stevenson	PERSON	, who , closing his '' Vicomte de Bra - gelonne '' after the fifth perusal , expresses his enthusiastic admiration in a series of queries which are in fact challenges to all disputants . ''

		What other novel has such epic variety and nobil - ity of incident ?

		Often , if you will , impossible ; often of the order of an Arabian story ; and yet all based on human nature .

		For if you come to that , what novel has more human nature ?

		Not studied with the micro - scope , but seen largely in plain daylight , with the natu - ral eye ?

		What novel has more good sense , and gaiety , and wit , and unflagging , admirable literary skill ... And , once more , to make an end of commendations , what novel is inspired with a more unstrained or a more wholesome morality ? ''

		These words take us far indeed from the stand -
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 29 point of middle-class propriety and narrow puritanical outlook .

		They mark the larger and saner critical light in which our own gen - eration has come to view the famous literature of the past .

		In the presence of such tributes as these , the unlovely aspects of the character of
Dumas	PERSON	, and the dubious aspects of his literary methods , sink into relative insignificance .

		Granted that he was a swaggerer and vainglorious , that petty jealousies and hypocrisies marked many stages of his career , that in his financial relations he held his personal honor too lightly ; granted also that his literary supercheries were of un - exampled audacity , that he pillaged ideas and situations from all sorts of sources , that he lent his name to books that others had written , -- granted all these things , with many others of like tenor , the fact remains that he possessed an astonishingly original and prolific genius , that besides much slipshod writing that has long since been forgotten he produced a series of masterpieces that the world will not willingly let die , and that his higher ideals were on the whole ideals of manliness and clean living and devotion to admirable artistic aims .

		• \ nswer not a fool according to his folly , lest thou also be like unto him , '' says the Scripture ; and then , with a fine recognition of the perplexities of the case , immedi - ataly adds : `` Answer a fool according to his folly , lest he be wiae in his own conceit . ''

		An uosel & sh regard for the good of the unwise person seems to dictate the lat - ter course .

		An anonymous contributor to the
Jane '' Macmillan	PERSON	's Magazine , '' taking for his subject '' Our Unhappy Lan - guage , '' discourses on what he calls '' the American lan - guage , '' in a manner that is marked by less wisdom than we are wont to look for in the pages of that excellent periodical .

		We are told that ours is a distinct lan - guage , not bearing the relation even of a dialect to the parent tongue , and that its variations from English can be discovered almost as readily as the differences between Italian and Spanish .

		We are rebuked for angrily denying this . ''

		I guess , '' one of us is said to hare retorted , '' that what you call
Amurracan	PERSON	is the only form of English which it English anyway . ''

		This protest is regarded by our Unhappy Ling ^ uiat -LRB- if we may so style him , for convenience -RRB- as '' too involved to be very intelligible . ''

		To be sure , it is not a fair sample of our mode of expressing ourselves , any more than the speech of the cockney is a good illustration of the Englishman 's ; but the alleged involution is not apparent to a plain man .

		Five out of any ten English - speaking Germans , says the Unhappy Linguist , will apologetically explain , in the interest of truth , that they learned the language from Americans , and there - fore can not speak it very well .

		The present writer takes pleasure in recalling , from his
Berlin	LOCATION	university daja , instanees of Germans who , seeking to perfect their English , favored him with their society because , as they explained , the American pronunciation seeaed to them more articulate than the En ^ sh .

		But this tes - timony is far from conclusive , aad is adduced only for what it is worth .

		In the PolggUM Kmtze series .

		there is said to be a manual on Die
Atmerikmmudke Spraeke	PERSON	, side by side with one on
Die Englitdke Spradie	ORGANIZATION	.

		That certainly is damaging testimony , and the defendant , on - til he has examined the volume in question , is pnzxled for an answer .

		Again , we are accused of having made the word commence -LRB- in preference to begin -RRB- so pecul - iarly our own that the Unhappy Linguist now almost shrinks from defiling his month with it .

		This is indeed alarming , if troe .

		From the page * of two American novels -- names not given -- our i aw Bant takes the text for most of his dis - course .

		We think it safe to infer that the novels are not classics ; but let as see what can be said in their defense .

		* ' His eyes were wonted to the darkness , '' is cited , with condemnation of wonted as an undesirable neologism .

		Yet , two hondred years ago , Sir
Boger	PERSON	L'Estrange wrote , '' She was wonted to the place , and would not remove . ''

		`` E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires , '' illustrates a slightly different use of the .

		word , which is probably familiar even to the Unhappy Linguist `` The merciless frame vised him fast . ''

		On this our friend has something interesting to say . ''

		The verb to rise is a revelation to us , and would seem to be derived from the noun vice by false analogy -LRB- bleaaed words ! -RRB-

		with the verb advise .

		However , the only poa - sible meaning we could read into it would be ezpreo - sive of what consuls do to passports . ''

		Charity compels na to interpret this , not as ignorance of a familiar car - penter 's tool , but as an attempt to be facetious .

		We bear in mind , too , that the more common English spell - ing of this tool is rice .

		But the making of a verb out of a noun , to serve at a pinch , is a pnetiee not confined to American writers .

		Amazement and amusement ate excited when the hero of one of the novels referred to is said to feed his horse apples , and the critic wonders if the day will come when the
Lord Mayor	ORGANIZATION	will feed his guests turtles .

		We hope not .

		Meanwhile we shall continue to feed our swine husks , and also to feed them with husks , but we prefer to let our guests help them - selves to such viands as their appetite demands .

		`` So he , '' for '' so that he , '' is cited as something new and strange .

		Without considering the matter , we shonld have said the shorter form was not uncommon , even with English writers .

		Opening at random Mr.
G. W. E. Russell	PERSON	's `` Onlooker 's Notebook , '' we read -LRB- page 149 -RRB- , ``
America	LOCATION	was strong and
Spain	LOCATION	was weak , so we backed
America	LOCATION	for all we were worth . ''

		Other usages , more or less open to censore , are quoted ; but few of them , perhaps none , are distinctively American , and not one is to be found in oar best writers .

		A list of `` American words '' is given by oar Unhappy Linguist , followed by a condemnatory exclamation point .

		The words are , defense , pretense , rvmor , dishonor , labor , counselor , traveler , imperiled , groveled , marveled , untram - mded , and maneuver .

		Six of these would have served to illustrate all the principles involved .

		Lack of spaee forbids a full discussion , and other hands have treated these matters at length .

		Yet we can never cease to wonder why the English cling so jealously to u in THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, honour , but drop it in horror , pallor , terror , actor , author , and a hundred other words having exactly the same Latin-French pedigree .

		Retaining the French u in cer - tain cases , why does the Englishman insist on discard - ing the French s in defense and offense , which are de - rived originally from Latin forms in - ensaf In Middle English we find forms in - ens and - ense ; the form in ■ ence is a comparatively late departure from the good old spelling .

		Likewise the ending - or represents , as a rule , an earlier English - our ; but whereas our cousins have reverted to the Latin form in some cases , and not in others , we in
America	LOCATION	, for the sake of both brevity and uniformity , have dropped the u almost without exception .

		The English lexicographer
Ogilvie	PERSON	, by the way , gives pretense as the better spelling of the second word on the list .

		So much for that `` American word . '' ''

		We do not in the least care , '' concludes the Un - happy Linguist , '' how the Americans spell , but in these days of simultaneous editions on either side of the At - lantic we see danger to our own spelling , about which we do care . ''

		In other words , '' we do n't care how fast you Americans go to perdition , but pray do n't take us with you . ''

		We do not yet despair of the English lan - guage .

		It has weathered a dozen centuries and more , and its decay does not seem imminent .

		But not until it is a dead language , or the English fence themselves in with a Chinese wall , will it anywhere be preserved in a state of rigid unchangeableness .

Contemporaky	ORGANIZATION	.

		* ' Applying Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	's test of litera - ture as distinguished from mere printed matter , and demanding that it shall contain `` moral truth and human passion ... touched with a certain largeness , sanity , and attraction of form , '' one would not be far wrong in pro- nouncing '' An Onlooker 's Notebook '' to be literature .

		It is written with a journalistic crispness of style that carries the reader along from page to page without sense of fatigue , and the writer 's breadth of view and range of experience distinguish him from the ordinary reporter of current events .

		These chapters on men and manners of the present and the more immediate past are reprinted from '' The Man - chester Guardian , '' where they appeared dur - ing the year
1901	DATE	.

		Their anonymous author is Mr.
George W. E. Russell	PERSON	, whose earlier volume of reminiscences and whose life of
Gladstone	PERSON	in the `` Queen 's Prime Ministers '' series have been well received .

		The first half of the book treats largely of matters political , the latter of social questions .

		ment , so far at least as the high hopes enter - tained for it thirty years ago are concerned .

		From the glorious height of a divine ideal it has sunk to the bumble level of a fairly prac - ticable system .

		But he admits that it has never received a thorough trial in
England	LOCATION	, except in local affairs , where indeed the ex - periment gives hope of future capacity on the part of the people for treating `` the higher and deeper proplems of imperial government . ''

		Significant in this connection is the author 's firm conviction that '' a hereditary legislative body is a mistake . ''

		Five short chapters on the monarchy , from
1760	DATE	to
1901	DATE	, give fleeting views of four suc - cessive sovereigns and their courts , and bring us down to the present reign , of which Mr.
Russell	PERSON	ventures to predict four chief charac - teristics .

		First , it will be popular : the
King	PERSON	, losing nothing of the tact and grace that marked his bearing as Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	, will have the support of all his people .

		Second , it will be a splendid reign , reflecting the sovereign 's nat - ural taste for pomp and his freedom from parsimony .

		Third , it will be marked by im - partiality ,
Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		keeping his politics to himself as strictly as he did before his ac - cession .

		Fourth , it will be an active reign , as the court will reside in
London	LOCATION	and will play a conspicuous part in public affairs .

		The latter half of the book is made up of brief and entertaining discussions of such topics as society journalism , the pleasures of publicity , the ways of the new woman , filthy lucre , religious observance , hedonism , decorum , superstition , card-playing and gambling , the public schools , the universities , and the church .

		The decline of chivalry and the growth of a selfish materialism are deplored . ''

		To-day chivalry seems to me extinct .

		The one idea is to shout with the largest crowd , to back the winner , to side with the majority .

		America was strong and
Spain	LOCATION	was weak , so we backed
America	LOCATION	for all we were worth .

		We believed that
France	LOCATION	was weak , and we tried to pick a quarrel with her over
Fashoda	LOCATION	.

		The Armenians were a feeble folk , and we would not move a finger to save them from massacre .


Greece	LOCATION	is a little country , and we had nothing but clumsy ridicule for her struggle against the Turkish tyranny .

		We were told that the South African republics had lost the power of fighting -- and we are learning our lesson . ''

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	has some shrewd and amusing things to say about the art of living on nothing .

		Among the devices practised by its devotees are the following : '' Time out of mind ladies have claimed all the hon - ors at whist , and , where their adversaries were shy or careless , they have not seldom derived profit from the
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 claim .

		The worthy couple whom I described as ' The Stavmakers ' used to arrange with one of their sons to meet them in hospitable country houses .

		When the whist-tables were made up , father , mother , and son used to sit down and entice some unwary youth to be the fourth .

		The points were moderate -- shillings and half-crowns -- but whicherer way the Inck went , a greater or less sum was bound to find its way into the coffers of the family ... Most people know some fashionable couples who eke out a rather narrow income by poker and bridge .

		It is calculated by the friends who hare the pleasure of losing to them that they make several hundreds a year ; but no one ever dreams of suggesting unfair play .

		Luck is pretty equally dis - tributed ; but skill , courage , and facial control are qualities which succeed at cards as elsewhere ; and a great advantage of playing in your own house is that the party can be broken up as soon as the hostess feels tired or the host has had enough of it . ''

		The foregoing , we take pleasure in thinking , would have found no place in the notebook of an American onlooker , describing American society life .

		Some of the hnmilations to which a person must submit who cultivates the gentle art of living on his wits are vividly pictured by Mr.
Russell	PERSON	.

		He borrows for his purpose
Thackeray	PERSON	's '' dear young literary friend , Tom Garbage . '' ''

		The popular girls pronounce him ' a little horror , ' and wo n't dance with him on any terms .

		The young men regard him as an outsider ; and the old gentlemen make him the butt of their peculiarly unpleasing humor .

		Lord Cramlington meets Tom Garbage in
Piccadilly	LOCATION	, and accosts him with a friendly and hospitable air : ' Are yon going to dine anywhere to-night .

		Garbage ? '

		Tom , scenting an invitation , promptly says ' No . ' '

		By
Gad	PERSON	, what an appetite yon '11 have to-morrow ! '

		replies
Lord Cramlington	PERSON	, and walks away with a cheerful smile ... Or , again , poor
Tom	PERSON	is the guest of Sir
Thomas Portmore	PERSON	, famous for his cellar , and inadver - tently puts his hand round his claret-glass . '

		I see that claret is n't warm enough for you , ' says the host ; and then , ringing the bell with great violence , roars to the butler : ■ Take that wine away and boil it , and put plenty of sugar and spice in it ; and then perhaps it will suit your palate , Mr. Garbage . ' ''

		The thirst for notoriety receives a sharp re - buke from our author , who regrets the depar - ture of old-fashioned modesty and reserve . ''

		We live in and on publicity .

		Where our fathers repelled the society journalist from their doors and horsewhipped him if they caught him at his tricks , we encourage him to the top of his bent .

		Only twenty years ago I have known a man blackballed at a club because he was suspected of having written for a society jonmal , and a guest who published the names of his fellow-guests at a dinner-party was never again per - mitted to cross the violated threshold .

		But now the smartest people take the society jonmalist to their bosoms .

		He dines with them in
London	LOCATION	and stays with them in the country .

		He is invited to iitapect the bed - rooms and examine the plate and scrutinize the family jewels ... The interviewer is abroad in the land , and to him people of the highest cultivation disclose their private beliefs in religion and politics and literature .

		They supply lists of ' Hymns that have Helped Me ' and ' Prayers that have Pushed Me ' ; they enumerate their ` Hundred Favorite Books ' ; they resuscitate the memories of the nursery and the private scbooL ... Reticence has fled to
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	or
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	, and , as all speech is unguarded , so all life is public . ''

		Verily , one is ready to say with
Ovid	LOCATION	in the enforced seclusion of his distant exile , '' Bene qui latuit , bene viiit . ''

		Heaven deliver us from the insanity of this ever-spreading '' social pushfulness , '' as our author calls it !

		But after these and many other pictures of all sorts of degeneracy , chiefly among the aristocracy , we are refreshed with a few final chapters on the more hopeful signs for the future ; and these indications of higher ideals the writer finds in the very class he has been holding up to repro - bation , as well as among the ranks of the people . ''

		I am well assured that among young Englishmen of all grades and classes there is a vein of manly self - control and self-devotion which may yet prove to be the salvation of
England	LOCATION	when national judgments begin to overtake national sins ... We are officially informed that the supply of clergy is falling off ; but though the young men at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	who are now seeking holy orders may be fewer than they were twenty years ago , I am convinced that their quality is better .

		There is nothing epicene or namby-pamby about them .

		They are fine , manly , active fellows , keen in mind and strong in body ; men who have rowed for their colleges or plaved ' rugger ' for the university , and ready to con - secrate all their splendid gifts of health and skill and trained endurance to the service of religion and hn - manitv ... Snch institutions as
Toynbee Hall	ORGANIZATION	and
Mansfield House	ORGANIZATION	, though conducted on secular lines , display the same energy of youthful real directed to high ends ; and I fancy that most of the great provin - cial towns conld tell the same tale as Liverpool with its
Newsboys	ORGANIZATION	' Home and Food and
Betterment Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		... A few years ago there was a vulgar fashion , for which
Thackeray	PERSON	and Leech were mainly responsible , of holding up clerks and servants to promiscuous and ptointless ridicule .

		A truer conception of honorable service now obtains , and English footmen and grooms have given as good an account of themselves in
South Africa	LOCATION	as the sons of the houses which they served . ''

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	is a keen observer , and he turns to good literary account what he sees and what he hears .

		His acquaintance with the Dowager Duchess of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, whose long life covers the years 1792-1883 , has furnished him with numerous early nineteenth-century items of interest .

		From
Bishop Wilberforce	ORGANIZATION	also , and from
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Beaoonsfield	LOCATION	,
Lord Aberdeen	LOCATION	, and other noble sources , he draws many anec - dotes of high life , -- not always new , but never tedious .

		His rather curious excuse for neg - lecting the less exalted classes is that his master ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, has already chosen the com - mon people for his own province .

		Yet he is not a snob , and if he shows an occasional touch 82 THE DIAL -LSB- Jaly 16 , of
Thackeray	PERSON	's snobbish anti-snobbery , it is too slight to offend .

		To those who relish dexterous word-play the book offers an occa - sional toothsome morsel , despite , or perhaps partly because of , its rather free use of the most up-to-date slang -- in apologetic quotation marks .

		Ochlocracy ^ a handy antonym to oligarchy , masquerades as othlocracy , but in a quoted sentence , so that the blame can not be fixed .

		Now and then a little-used Latin phrase greets one as a pleasant surprise in its English dress .

		Finally , and best of all , the brief space accorded to each topic shows the author to have learned well that hardest of lessons for a fluent writer , that a part is better than the whole .

		Two Good Garden Books .

		* Two of the best of Mr.
Lane	PERSON	's numerous garden books are
Canon Ellacombe	ORGANIZATION	's '' In My Vicarage Garden '' and Mrs.
Milne-Home	PERSON	's '' Stray Leaves from a Border Garden . ''

		It is a matter of fact and of interest that the En - glish clergy have been garden-lovers since the days of old when priests and monks found in their gardens sources of physic , pleasure , and profit .

		Through their missions they secured rare and beautiful plants , and introduced val - ued fruits and vegetables ; and in the sheltered '' gardens enclosed '' of their monasteries they could preserve and multiply , experiment with and disperse , the new plants .

		Of the modern English clergy , the best - known flower-lovers and flower-rearers are Dean Hole , champion of the English Hose ; and
Canon	ORGANIZATION	EUacombe , author of '' In a Glou - cestershire Garden '' and of that most satis - fying , charming , and perfect book , '' The Plant-Lore and Garden-Craft of Shakespeare . ''

		In this book , '' In My Vicarage Garden , and Elsewhere , '' appears aftermath of the author 's Shakespearian research , in the chapters en - titled `` Plant Names , '' `` York and Lancaster Roses , '' and '' Shakespere and Architecture . ''

		Fascinating subjects are '' The Scents of Flow - ers '' and '' Medical Properties of Flowers , '' in which the curious '' doctrine of signatures '' is most ably and interestingly explained .

John Lane	PERSON	.

		the Preacher gave as one of the qualities of the Wise Man , '' certain knowledge of the things that are ... the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots . ''

		It was , in brief , '' nature 's own prescription , '' -- a belief that each plant revealed in its shape or color some resemblance to a disease or to some portion of the body , and therefore was of value in that disease or for strengthening that organ .

		Thus , a heart-shaped leaf was used in heart disease ; a spotted leaf like pulmonaria was for diseased lungs ; a plant with swellings at the joints of the stem or the leaf-stalks would cure gout .

		This doctrine was universally believed , and be - loved ; for it was quoted as a proof of the loving care and thoughtful provision of the Creator .

		Though the working out of this principle is , of course , wholly wrong , yet the principle itself was based on right ; and its influence is still shown in our modern botanical arrangement and classification of plants .

		A chapter of special interest is entitled '' Railway Gardens . ''

		This does not mean the beds and borders of ornamental flowers at rail - way stations , growing so cheerfully under ad - verse conditions , and so welcome to the eye of the traveller .

		The subject is , instead , the expanse or groups of unusual and unexpected flowers which spring up in startling beauty in railway '' cuts , '' in ballast heaps , in refuse '' dumps . ''

		The raw ugly track of the railway contractor is quickly covered with a garden of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's planting , -- a rare garden , too ; for flowers which have not been seen in a certain vicinity for years will bloom forth in abun - dance after the blasting out of a line of rock .

		The ballast heaps below
Philadelphia	LOCATION	have re - vealed hundreds of rare plants , many from the Orient , which have been classified and written about as
Ballast Plants	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sweeps of old-time garden-flowers reappear and blossom in glorious profusion .

		No flower-dreams of deeper sentiment come to me than the thought of the wandering of those flower-seeds , -- their dor - mant years of silence and darkness , their travel hither , their sudden release and resurrection through modern progress .

		Stray Leaves from a Border Garden , '' Mrs.
Milne-Home	PERSON	's book , reveals not only a romantic home and picturesque garden on that historic spot ,

		The book is an intimate record , -- a human document , in the best sense of that much-twisted term .

Bryck	PERSON	' 9 Essays ox Histobt and jurispkijdkxck .

		* We think there are few books which in a quiet way will do the serious student more good , or deserve better of its readers , than Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's recent volume of '' Studies in His - tory and Jurisprudence . ''

		These essays form a book on whose nine hundred and odd pages the reader will find very little chaff of words , and much excellent and substantial informa - tion , presented in a popular manner and with the charm of literary style .

		They bear the stamp of the mind not only of an academic teacher of many years '' experience , but also of a statesman active in the service of his coun - try , and perhaps still more of a student and exponent of historical and constitutional ques - tions .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's treatment of such questions has always been eminently characterized by fairness , sound sense , and the practical grasp of a man prominent in active life and accus - tomed to living issues as well as to theories • StTDIKS Df HiSTORT AXD JrBISPRrDKKCB .

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, and speculations .

		When a writer of such rec - ognized standing , wide experience and scholar - ship discusses matters of historical and practical importance , his remarks naturally awaken keen interest ; and the friendly hearing which any word of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	can command in
America	LOCATION	will add considerably to the attention given this new work of his .

		Attention is aroused by the opening essays , wherein the author compares the two greatest nations of European history , ancient and mod - ern , -- the Romans and the English .

		The study of
Kome	ORGANIZATION	becomes nowadays more and more a necessary introduction to historical study in general , even among the English ; and no less than half the number of essays con - tained in Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's book are more or less directly concerned with the universal side of
Kome	ORGANIZATION	's rule .

		Of course , the similarity of
Koman	PERSON	and English political ideas instantly presents itself , both countries establishing their law among many nations ; and the simi - larity is to be noted , also , in their imperialistic tendencies and their holding distant provinces by means of colonization .

		As Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	ex - presses it in his preface , '' The longer one lives the more is one impressed by the close connec - tion between the old Graeco-Italian world and our own .

		We are still very near the ancients . ''

		The empire of
India	LOCATION	is the largest and so far the most successful experiment in
England	LOCATION	's imperial policy .

		The two first essays set forth the chief points of resemblance between
Rome	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		The subject is not treated in any great detail , but what is said gives a sufficiently vivid impression of the difficulties encountered by each nation in governing a foreign province .

		Of these difficulties , those felt by the English in properly ruling
India	LOCATION	appear by all odds the more serious .

		Other essays related to these are the fourteenth and fifteenth , which treat of methods of law - making and the history of the development of jurisprudence in Borne and in
England	LOCATION	; and these are among the most suggestive in the book .

		The last essay discussing kiudred legal points is the one '' On Marriage and Divorce in Roman and English law , '' which will not only excite interest in itself but to many will appear a timely addition to the present active controversy regarding the revision of divorce laws .

		The author 's rather conservative view , which seems to consider frequency of divorce largely a convenient stepping-stone to polyg - amy , will doubtless be approved by many .

		It is in modern constitutional law and his - tory that Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	is considered most pro- ficient , and the reader follows with pleasure his treatment of such questions as '' Flexible and Rigid Constitutions , '' `` The Action of Centripetal and
Centrifugal Forces	ORGANIZATION	on
Politi	PERSON	- cal Constitutions , '' `` The Commonwealth of
Australia	LOCATION	, '' and , last but not least , as a precious anomaly , the essay on the old constitution of the only permanent republic of pure Germanic origin , primitive
Iceland	LOCATION	.

		Although one of the briefer essays , this is nevertheless one of the most interesting .

		The author is evidently delighted with this quaint old commonwealth , whose peculiarities he explains with his cus - tomary lucidity .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	probably never visited the historic isle , nor studied its ancient laws ; but he has drawn his information from the next best source , the writings of the great jurist and
Germanist Konrad Maurer	PERSON	, whose monographs and historical works hold so high authority in Germanistic literature .

		Perhaps Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's account will awaken some interest , even among American students , in the Ger - manic North , where lie the true sources of an understanding of Germanic life .

		These essays on constitutions , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	supplements by others of a philosophical char - acter , in which he discusses '' Obedience , '' `` The Nature of Sovereignty , '' `` The Law of Nature , '' '' The Relations of Law and Religion , '' essays which under any circumstances will command admiration for the author 's clear reasoning , observing mind , and judicious treat - ment .

		They are well adapted to the under - standing of any thoughtful person , and will no doubt be of influence both in political and pro- fessional life .

		One of the chief characteristics of the book is its prevalent tone of caution .

		Perhaps it is due to this extremely temperate spirit that even Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	sometimes seems vague , and afraid of broaching vital questions , -- especially when treating of the far-reaching imperial policy of
England	LOCATION	, with which he perhaps does not altogether sympathize .

		Thus , one of the few things which the reader accepts with incre - dulity , even from Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, is the statement -LRB- pp. 119-120 -RRB- that English law may become the law of all
India	LOCATION	and the Christian religion supersede the native beliefs .

		This , it appears to us , is to carry the comparison between
Rome	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	too far .

		Of course , such an event depends in the end upon the continuance of English rule . ''

		Experience , '' says Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, '' goes to show that no form of heathenism ... does ultimately withstand the solvent power of

		THE DIAL 85 European science and thought . ''

		Bat we doabt exceedingly that an
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	belief , even when fortified by science , -- which , it may be remarked , generally helps to neutralize its force , -- will ever transplant an Oriental belief , conceived and upheld as it is by the far subtler power of distinguishing between the apparent and the real which is inherent in the Oriental mind .

		When one reads that , in one part of
India	LOCATION	, out of a population num - bering more than forty-four millions a little more than a hundred thousand are Christians , who are again divided up into denominations , one does not know whether to laugh or to weep over the phantom of future
Christiani	PERSON	- zation of the East in general and
India	LOCATION	in par - ticular .

		Besides , if it is true , as many earnest voices assert -- voices from among the En - glish residents themselves -- that English rule has served only to impoverish
India	LOCATION	-LRB- Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	himself points to excessive taxation as one of the greatest dangers of English rule -RRB- , how can the expensive English government be maintained on an increasing public debt and a decreasing power of the population to yield adequate revenue ?

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	points to the large area not yet under cultivation ; but re - formers point to the increasing frequency of famine and plagues , the financial results of which may yet prove too much for even the British administration and its unlimited money credit .

		And as for the ultimate sway of En - glish law .

		as long as the Hindoos themselves are not trained to administer it , or appointed as justices of it , English law remains at best an adaptation .

		The Oriental mind will by degrees outlive it , and rise to something more congenial with its own tendencies .

		Mr.
Brvce	PERSON	himself pictures what would be the result if
England	LOCATION	withdrew her forces ; but it is never - theless true that no nation as gifted as the
Hindoo	PERSON	can forever remain in bondage to a foreign and alien race so utterly unsympathetic to the mass of the people as the English has proved itself to be .

		The awakening of the
East	LOCATION	must come : and when the united nations of
Europe	LOCATION	shall be able to cope with En - gland at sea , a European war will ensue which will seal the fate of English dominion in
India	LOCATION	.

		Unhappily , these conjectures are not .

		as Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	suggests , merely speculative .

		The book concludes with two addresses , one introductory , the other valedictory ; the open - ing and closing of an activity as academic teacher the best fruit of which these essays con - tain .

		The author himself expresses the fear that some of these may not altogether be able to meet the demands of modern criticism ; bat , to quote his own words , '' Life is short ... and it seems better to let what I have written , under the constant pressure of other duties , go forth now . ''

		It seems but fitting to express the expectation that in view of the author 's well-earned popularity with the American pub - lic , this last book of his should be at least as widely read as his others have been .

		Books on thk liOUisiAXA Pukchask .

		* Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	has rightly judged the time appropriate for the publication of a popular account of the purchase of
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		The scope of his book would have been better in - dicated had he retained the title by which it was originally announced and called it '' The Story '' rather than `` The History '' of the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	.

		The work is distinctly intended for the general reader , and even for readers of the younger class .

		With this ob - ject in view , the author has enlarged upon the dramatic and picturesque features of the event , and has either touched very lightly or omitted altogether the more abstruse and difficult ones .

		His main purpose has been to show that the transfer was almost wholly the work of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon , and thus to correct the common opinion that it resulted from the superior insight and wisdom of
Jefferson	LOCATION	.

		Jefferson 's merit con - sisted almost solely in accepting the good for - tune that befell him .

		Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	tells the whole story of
Napoleon	PERSON	's quarrel with his brothers
Joseph	PERSON	and
Lucien	PERSON	over the sale , which he is the first to render accessible in English in its entirety .

		A somewhat fuller account of the
San Domingo	LOCATION	revolt would have been interesting and at the same time would have brought out more clearly the pressure under which
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	acted .

		But measured by its purpose the story is well told and the book entirely successful .

		For the student , it does not and is not intended to supersede the chapters in Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's history .

		Upon one point Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	has tripped .

July 16	DATE	, with those countries , '' summoned them to a conference on
Easter Sunday of 1803	DATE	.

		To one of the ministers '' the administration of the colonies was familiar '' ; the other '' had served in the auxiliary army -LRB- I ` armee auxil - iare -RRB- sent by
France	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	during their revolution . ''

		The first minister was Marbois himself , who was minister of finance , and had served in the
United States	LOCATION	in a diplomatic capacity and in
San Domingo	LOCATION	as Intendant of the colony .

		It was prob - ably well understood , at the time
Marbois	PERSON	wrote , who the second minister was ; but later writers have rather curiously omitted his iden - tification .

		Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	assumes that it was Decres , minister of marine .

		This is scarcely possible .

		Decres served in the fleet , and not in the army , as described by Marbois ; and he was so young at the time , his service was so short and his position so subordinate , that he could scarcely have become '' familiar '' with
America	LOCATION	.

		The minister referred to was un - doubtedly
Berthier	PERSON	, minister of war .


Berthier	PERSON	served three years in the `` auxiliary army '' in
America	LOCATION	, was aide-de-camp to
Kochambeau	LOCATION	, attained the rank of colonel , and , after peace was negotiated , returned to
France	LOCATION	by way of
San Domingo	LOCATION	.

		He thus had every opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of conditions both in the
United States	LOCATION	and in the colony .

		There were , moreover , several reasons why
Berthier	PERSON	was most likely to be consulted .

		His relations with
Napoleon	PERSON	were most confidential , he was the negotiator of the preliminary treaty of
St. Ildefonso	LOCATION	for the retrocession of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, and , in view of the fact that the sale of the province turned upon war with
England	LOCATION	, he was , next after
Napoleon	PERSON	himself , most directly interested in the subject .

		Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	refers to Clay as the author of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise .

		The statement is probably accidental , but it does seem as if the impression that Clay arranged what we think of as the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise would never be effaced .

		Another
Louisiana	LOCATION	book is '' an historical study , '' by Mr.
Louis Houck	PERSON	, entitled `` The Boundaries of the
Louisiana	LOCATION	Purchase . ''

		The author says that '' The fact that much erro - neous information in regard to the boundaries of the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	has , during the last few years , been industriously circulated by the daily press and otherwise , must be the excuse for the publication of this study . ''

		Inasmuch as Mr.
Houck	PERSON	is himself wrong upon all the essential points , his little book will scarcely serve its intended purpose of setting the pub - lic right .

		His work shows a very considerable amount of investigation , but very little histor - ical judgment .

		He seems to have adopted the motto , '' My country , right or wrong , '' and , upon that principle , to have knocked down to the credit of the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	every - thing that has at any time been claimed for it .

		Although the boundaries of
Louisiana	LOCATION	were never definitely described , its general extent is perfectly clear and perfectly certain .

		It included the
Isle of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	east of the Mis - sissippi , and the whole basin of that river and its tributaries west of it .

		Mr.
Houck	PERSON	claims that it included in addition
Florida	LOCATION	west of the Perdido river ,
Texas	LOCATION	, and
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		The case of
Florida	LOCATION	is too clear for contro - versy .

		Having failed in their efforts to acquire
West Florida	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	set up the claim , under an apparent ambiguity in the treaty , that the part west of the Perdido was included in
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		Historical facts , too involved and complicated for present state - ment , are absolutely conclusive against this contention .

		Mr.
Houck	PERSON	considers that the decision of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	proved the American construction ; but , although
Mar	PERSON	- shall did argue that the language of the treaty would admit of either construction , and that strong arguments might he adduced in sup - port of the American one , he avoided any inquiry into the merits of the question , and based his judgment solely upon the ground that the court was bound to follow in such questions the opinion of the political depart - ments of the government .

		The claim to

		The French claim to L/onisiana rested wholly upon the occupation of the

		The

		The idea that

		From his * • Chapters of Erie , '' in which , more than thirty years ago , he first made his bow to the reading public , to his just pub - lished volume , '' Lee at
Appomattox	LOCATION	, and Other Papers , '' ' he has written upon a great variety of important topics , but always with a ripe scholarship , a grac `` of style , and a thorongh understanding of the subject discussed , which endow his volumes with a perennial charm .

		The opening paper , which gives title to the volume , is in effect a contrast between the methods of
General Lee of the Confederate	ORGANIZATION	army and President Krnger in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		The capture of
Pretoria	LOCATION	by
General Roberts	ORGANIZATION	, in
June , 1900	DATE	, was the
Appomattox	LOCATION	of the
South African Republic	LOCATION	.

		After each battle , the result of the war was no longer doubtful .

		But in the
Southern States	LOCATION	still existed Confederate armies of magnitude , and throughout the Con - federacy was the feeling of great bitterness toward the North .


Jefferson Davis	PERSON	, after the surrender of Lee 's army , issued a proclamation worthy of
Kruger	PERSON	, urging that a guerrilla war - fare be kept up until the North should drop the contest from sheer exhaustion .

		But
Lee	PERSON	was a man of broader and grander type .

		He saw that the Confederacy was doomed , and had the wisdom to take a course which should stop the needless effusion of blood and save the
Southern States	LOCATION	from a devastation like •

		that which marked
Sherman	PERSON	's march from
Atlanta	LOCATION	.

		His personal popularity caused his views , rather than those of
Davis	LOCATION	, to prevail .


Kruger	PERSON	, seeing clearly the inevitable end , per - sisted in a course which , as Mr.
Adams	PERSON	states , he knew must result '' in the probable destruc - tion of one of the combatants , in great loss to the other , and in utter disregard of the best interests of both . ''

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has given in detail General
Lee	PERSON	's actions and his discussions with his officers for the twenty-four hours be - fore his final surrender , and gives him great and deserved credit for a course which was perhaps the greatest factor in bringing the two warring factions of the nation to the present conditions of harmony .

		The second and most important paper in Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's volume is entitled `` The Treaty of
Washington	LOCATION	, '' and refers to the treaty concluded between the
United States	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	pro- yiding for the arbitration of the claim of the
United States	LOCATION	for damages suffered by our merchant marine from
Confederate	ORGANIZATION	cruisers fitted out in English ports , which treaty also made a new standard in reference to the rights of private property in cases of war .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, through access to papers of his father , -- who was our ambassador in
London	LOCATION	during the Civil War , and afterward a member of the
Court of Arbitration	ORGANIZATION	, -- and also to the papers of
Ham	ORGANIZATION	- ilton Fish , has been enabled to give an inside account , and a most interesting one , of the origin and adjustment of such claims , much of which is wholly new to the general public .

		The English Cabinet took the position that while it would be an infraction of the laws of neutrality for ships of war to be built and equipped in English shipyards , and sold to the
Confederacy	LOCATION	, yet it was no infraction of the law for unequipped war-ships to be built and so sold , and for the armament of such ships to be built and so sold , in case the armament was not put aboard the ship in an English port .

		So the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' was built as a war vessel , and sailed from
Liverpool	LOCATION	to the
Azores	LOCATION	.

		At the date of her sailing her armament and mu - nitions of war were shipped on another vessel from
London	LOCATION	to the same port , and were there transferred to the ship .

		This method of getting around the spirit of the law was sanctioned by the English Cabinet , and ap - held by the Courts .

		Three vessels , the ''
Flor	PERSON	- ida , '' ''
Alabama	LOCATION	, '' and '' Shenandoah . ''

		were thus fitted out , and preyed destructively upon our commerce .

		The English position was based upon a sympathy on the part of the 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	governing classes for the South , a belief by these classes that the South would win its independence , and a desire to promote the lucrative business of building ships for the world in English shipyards .

		After a time , aided by the gradual triumph of the Northern armies , the English people became awakened to the dangers of their position in case their nation , owning nearly half the merchant marine of the world , should become involved in war .

		Such a war , for instance , as that which has prevailed in
South Africa	LOCATION	would have allowed such nations as the
United States	LOCATION	or
Germany	LOCATION	, under this precedent established by
England	LOCATION	, to cover the ocean with privateers carrying the flag of the Dutch Eepublic , to the utter destruction of the English merchant navy .

		Thereupon the English government stopped the further building of privateers ; and then followed years of diplomacy , whereby
England	LOCATION	sought to render ineffective the precedent she had herself established , and the
United States	LOCATION	to recover damages for the work of the English-built privateers .

		These negotiations were completed during the presi - dency of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, and largely through the work of his premier ,
Hamilton	PERSON	Fish .

		The history of the rupture between
Charles Sumner	PERSON	and
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	's administration , one factor in which was the recall of Mr.
Motley	PERSON	-LRB- who , because he owed his appointment to
Sumner	PERSON	, conceived his duty to be to report to Sumner rather than to the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from his position as Embassador to
England	LOCATION	, is fully and most interestingly told by Mr.
Adams	PERSON	.

		Another article , entitled '' An Undeveloped Function , '' embodies the suggestion that our various Historical Societies , from a broad standpoint , should endeavor to shed light by their discussions on political questions of na - tional importance .

		In '' A
National Change of Heart	ORGANIZATION	'' is indicated the reason of the friend - ship which of late has developed in
England	LOCATION	toward the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The whole volume is most interesting and instructive ; it is one of the comparatively few books of the year of permanent value .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has been not alone a man of letters , but a man of affairs , -- has successfully man - aged great corporations , has travelled widely , and been on terms of intimacy with many of the most notable statesmen and diplomats of his period .

		From this training and experience few men now living could have so clearly dis - cussed the subjects treated in the volume .

		Engiuh poetry ^ ^ attempt to consider scientifically in ihe crucible the general phenomena of poetry and o/thescienti , i. ^ ^ suggest a new system of prosody is the avowed purpose of Prof.
Mark H. Liddell	PERSON	's '' Introduction to the Scientific Study of English Poetry '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		In this book the theories presented are based upon the belief that language and literature offer a field for scientific treatment much like that of econonaics or ethics .

		Professor
Liddell	PERSON	sets aside all definitions and '' present no - tions '' of poetry , and calls them '' vague and bewil - dering , '' '' literary and not scientific , '' based upon '' the emotional susceptibility of the individual to respond to poetic phenomena , and not upon the ab - solute and catholic concepts of science . ''

		All such general notions of the nature of poetic phenomena the author considers quite valueless for the study of poetry ; and after several pages devoted to the in - adequacy of present definitions he arrives at a defi - nition of poetry of his own making , which reads as follows : '' Poetry is literature , usually of a high de - gree of
Human Interest	ORGANIZATION	, which in addition to its
Human Interest	ORGANIZATION	has in it an added
Esthetic Interest	ORGANIZATION	due to the arrangement of some easily recognizable and constantly present concomitant of thought-for - mulation into a form of aesthetic appeal for which an appreciative ^ ^ thetic Sentiment has been gradually developed in the minds of those who habitually think by means of the language in which the poetry is written . ''

		By the aid of an algebraic formula .

		Professor
Liddell	PERSON	is enabled to express this defi - nition of poetry in the following concise form : x + HI +
VF	ORGANIZATION	, -- meaning '' id6as formulated in terms of correlated sound-group-images '' + Human Interest + Verse Form .

		Professor
Liddell	PERSON	then pro- ceeds to show the inadequacy of the present system of English prosody , and states that in his treatment of the subject of poetry from a strictly historical and inductive point of view he at the outset parts com - pany with the usual treatises on English prosody .

		Historically , his book is decidedly disappointing , as there is practically no account given of the differ - ent kinds of poetry nor their stages of development ; and the author 's inductive point of view has led him into some strange inferences and generalizations , to which it would not be unjust to apply his own ad - jectives `` vague and bewildering . ''

		His system of prosody involves much that is revolutionary and is destructive of well established rules , and , '' failing scientific formulation and scientific terminology , '' he has invented a nomenclature and notation of his own which is too eccentric to be helpful .

		For '' verse '' he substitutes the words '' thought-mo - ment '' ; for `` feet , '' `` waves of impulse '' ; and he prefers to do away with the use of any terms used in classic prosody .

		We can not see that Professor
Liddell	PERSON	has added anything to the excellent work which has already been done in the study of English prosody .

		His methods and his style are for the most part unsatisfactory , and his theories may most

		^ ^ A reasonably full , accurate , and m * t ^ ^ il '' popular treatment of the nebular mlar litem .

		theory of the evolution of the solar system has long been a desideratum .

		Sir
Robert Ball	PERSON	has at last supplied this in his latest volume entitled `` The Earths Beginning '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Like '' Star-land , '' by the same author , this volume had its origin in a series of lectures given to audiences of young people under the auspices of the
Royal Institution of Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , un - like the earlier volume , the present one will be best appreciated by adult readers .

		After a gen - eral statement of the nebular theory , and a de - scription of some of the most notable nebuls .

		with special reference to those of spiral form -- since tbis has now been shown by photogrraphy to be the typical form -- the author considers the sun .

		He shows that the heat of the orb of day is now main - tained by the same process of contraction that has been going on for ages , and reasons backward to the primeval nebula in which the solar sjrstem originated .

		Next follows one of the most interesting portions of the book , in which our knowledge of the present state of the earth 's interior is set forth admirably , with a discussion of seismic and volcanic phenomena .

		Several chapters are then devoted to the evidences for the truth of the nebular hypothesis derived from our planetary system .

		The book closes with a series of short appendices giving mathematical explanations of matters of interest in connection with the contraction of a nebula .

		Here and there the critical reader will detect a minor blemish ; three of these we may mention .

		Near the bottom of page 36 the foci of certain ellipses are said to lie at the sun 's centre ; on page 55 Professor
Barnard	PERSON	is given credit which properly belongs to Professor
Bailey	PERSON	; on page 252 we read of `` the area which each particle of the planet de - scribes , '' which is clearly not the author 's meaning .

		But minor inaccuracies like these detract little from the solid merit of the book .

		It is excellently printed on heavy paper , and is embellished with four colored plates and sixty-three other illnstratioBS , most of which are taken from celestial photog ^ raphs .

		JVUcnw / The eleventh volume of '' The World 's Epoch-Makers '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- is devoted to '' The
Medici	PERSON	and the Italian Renaissance , '' and is written by the editor of the series , Mr.
Oliphant Smeaton	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	.

		The purpose of the volume is to trace the continuity of aim which moved the various members of the great house of Medici , and show by what steps and in what forms they contributed to that wonderful period known as the Italian Renaissance , from which dates all modem eirilisation .

		In a broad and general sense , the Renaissance has not ended yet ; bat in its more limited and customary application it stands for the hundred years between the death of
Giovanni de	ORGANIZATION	' Medici -- the founder of the great - ness of the family -LRB- 1428 -RRB- -- and the Sack of
Rome	LOCATION	-LRB- 1527 -RRB- under the Medicean Pope ,
Clement	PERSON	VIL It was a century of romance and fascination , a mingled web of good and ill ; and throughout all its central figures are seen to be the successive rep - resentatives of this Florentine family of merchant princes --
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cosimo his son ,
Lorenro	PERSON	his great - grandson , and
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	, afterwards Pope
Leo X.	PERSON	, his greatrg ^ reat-gracdson .

		Had these failed to take the deep and absorbing interest they did in the movement , it would not have accomplished that mission of the intellectual regeneration of
Europe	LOCATION	which it was destined to achieve ; in all probabil - ity it would have died down into a mere philo - logical '' insect-study '' of the Greek and Latin classics , without effecting that stimulation of life , thought , and enterprise of which one of the results was the discovery of the '' New World . ''

		Recent investigations and a more critical analysis of their policy have tempered on the one hand the indis - criminate eulogies of Roscoe .

		and on the other hand have disproved many of the charges brought against them by
Sismondi	ORGANIZATION	and
Gino Capponi	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Smeaton	PERSON	admits that their crimes were manifold ; that the character of even the best of them was all too fre - quently stained with the vices of their age to a degree reprobated even in that ^ ; e when moral squeamishness was not general .

		But notwith - standing all , he feels that their services to the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	cover their multitude of sins .

		Certainly it is cause for gratitude that at last we have a small book which describes minutely and consecutively the precise nature of these services , and eliminates from the tangled web of Florentine politics and Florentine history such clear character-studies of these makers of the modern time .

		Every traveller in
Egypt	LOCATION	, every * ?

		* ■ | * ™ ' * '' '' * reader of E ^ ptian history , and every antiquarian , has seen a scar - abeus .

		Several works have been published which exhibit a large number of these curious old bugs .

		Mr.
John Ward	PERSON	, who published '' Pyramids and Progress '' a couple of years ago , has now put out '' The Sacred Beetle , a Popular Treatise on Egyptian Scarabs in Art and History '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- .

		It answers the question `` What is a scarab ? ''

		in a simple and popular manner .

		We find in the back of the book sixteen full-page collotype plates of scarabs , not from pen-and-ink drawings as found in earlier works , but from elegant well-reproduced photo - graphs , giving the exact form and face of the originals , which belong to periods stretching from the third down to the twenty-fifth dynasty .

Egypt	LOCATION	, -- connected with the finding of a certain scarab .

		Some of his finest royal scarabs are those belonging to the reign of Thothemes III. ,
Egypt	LOCATION	's '' Alexander the Great . ''

		Besides the plates of scarabs , the book contains ninety-two illustrations in the text , most of them of value in understanding the scarabs under survey on the same or the accompanying page .

		Such popular works are immensely helpful in pre - senting an otherwise technical subject .

Siena	LOCATION	.

		The literary portion of Mr.
Gilbert Hastings	PERSON	's volume on ''
Siena	LOCATION	, Its Architecture and Art '' -LRB- De La More Press ,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- is in length not more than an average magazine article , -- scarcely enough to necessitate the index with which it is nevertheless provided .

		It is a nearly square quarto of 55 pages , and is , as it is undoubtedly intended to be , a book to delight the eyes of the bibliophile , -- made so by the choice of paper , type , and artistic printing , by photogravures and full-page illustrations in half-tone .

		The plain board cover is evidently intended to be replaced by the possessor with binding according to his indi - vidual taste .

		As a souvenir of a visit to
Siena	LOCATION	it is also a delight .

		That the reader may gain informa - tion which the letter-press fails to give , and be aided to a greater appreciation of the architectural and art history of this much-neglected Italian city , the book is furnished with a brief bibliography ; but the greater number of titles given therein are of papers which have appeared in the periodical press ; and it would seem that a person desirous of learning much of
Siena	LOCATION	would be doomed to disap - pointment even after having consulted all that is therein indicated .

Edward E.l!THn	PERSON	, .

		I - '' ' > ' i H `` '' > ' y v. , are the subjects of recent additions to the `` Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Both volumes are written by trained historians and are authoritative accounts in untechnical form of the periods of his - tory covered .

		The volume on
Edward	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Edward Jenks	PERSON	, opens with a sketch of the Middle Ages in
Europe	LOCATION	and the Emergence of
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, and then treats of Edward as soldier , statesman , and lawgiver .

		It is a book of value for reference or for mature readers , but it will hardly attract one who is not making a serious study of the history of the period .

		The life of
Henry V.	ORGANIZATION	has more of general interest , owing to the attractive personality of the king , to his brilliant and startling successes over a greater and stronger nation , and to the gloom of preceding and following reigns .

		Henry was a real hero , and the stripping process to which modern writers are subjecting the heroes of old robs him of nothing but some traditional stories of a later date that were little to his credit .

		This book also , written by Mr.
Charles L. Kingsford	PERSON	, is one of per - manent value as well as interest .

		Their general features are similar to those of their predecessors , -- critical Introduction , Books of Reference , Historical Directory , and
Biographical Data	ORGANIZATION	, followed by fifteen pictures with descriptive text of two or three pages for each .

		As a repre - sentative selection , the choice in '' Tuscan Sculp - ture '' is open to criticism .

		Donatello is represented by five examples ,
Luca	PERSON	and
Andrea	PERSON	della Robbia by three each , and
Jacopo	PERSON	della Qaercia by one .

		This is well ; but why should the comparatively minor artist Mino da
Fiesole	LOCATION	have two examples ,
Nanni di Banco	ORGANIZATION	and
Rosellino	PERSON	each one , while
Ghiberti	PERSON	, the most epoch-making name of the period , is not even mentioned ?

		Ghiberti 's bronze doors for the
Florence Baptistery	LOCATION	are the most remarkable works of sculpture finished during the earlier Renaissance ; and a book , however elementary , which ignores them must be regarded as inadequate .

		-- In the volume on Van Dyck the selection is good and representa - tive , being divided about equally between portraits and subject-pieces .

		This artist 's merits and limi - tations are clearly pointed out , and the reasons given why , although not ranking among the world 's foremost masters , Van ''
Dyck	PERSON	is nevertheless a notable and indeed a beloved figure in art history .

		The elaborate celebration by
Dart	PERSON	- o/VaH ^ r ' `` O '' * ^ College of the centennial anni - versary of the graduation of the greatest of her sons was marked by the excellent oration of Congressman

Daniel Webster	PERSON	, which has now appeared in a tasteful little volume published by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
MifiBin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is none of the gorgeous rhetoric that characterized
Rufus Choate	PERSON	's splendid eulogy delivered from the same platform fifty years ago ; but the oration contains a fine summary of the im - portant facts in
Webster	PERSON	's lite , and expresses what must be in the main the judgment of history upon him as lawyer , orator , and statesman .

		In all , he is ranked as among the greatest ; while in oratory he is put at the head of all who have used the En - glish language , unless
Burke	PERSON	may be allowed to stand beside him .

		The oration was in every way worthy of the great occasion that called it forth , and will be of permanent value for both its form and its content .

		Since then , numerous excellent texts have appeared , and it has been subjected to keen competi - tion , lu its unrevised condition , it had fallen behind in the race for favor , and was getting less representative of present day economic theory with every year .

		Yet the revision has not been as thoroughgoing as we could have wished .

		Some of the charts have not been extended to date ; the old erroneous illustration of the law of diminishing returns is repeated ; the disingenuous denial of '' double profits '' to oote-issuing national banks Ls restated , and the absurdly childish exercises have not been detected .

		Bnt the book is so sound and lucid in its fundamentals that we must give it high praise , in spite of these and other defects .

		Is it true , as is suggested by Miss
Augusta N. Campbell Davidson	PERSON	in her '' Translations from Lucian '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , that the clear-visioned philosopher of Samosata '' has fallen at tbe present day almost wholly out of general reading '' ?

		XOTES as TOPICS IX LEADING PERIODICALS ... • '' LIST OF XEW BOOE > ■ 6t '' TEAR OF CONTINENTAL LITERATURE .

		Following our cnstom of many years , we have prepared , for this and a following num - ber of Th
# Dial	ORGANIZATION	, a summary of the valuable reports upon the European literatures of the past twelvemonth , published in '' The Athe - naeum '' for
July 5	DATE	.

		There are twelve reports in all , and we now present , largely condensed , the following five :
Belgium	LOCATION	, by Professor
Paul Frederioq	PERSON	;
Bohemia	LOCATION	, by Dr.
V. Tille	PERSON	; Den - mark , by Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	;
France	LOCATION	, by
M. Jules Pravieux	PERSON	; and
Germany	LOCATION	, by Dr.
Ernst Ueilbom	PERSON	.

		The remaining seven will be sum - marized in a later issue .


Sweden	LOCATION	and
Norway	LOCATION	are not represented in this year 's reports , which is a matter for much regret .

		Professor Frederioq opens his Belgian report by calling attention to the new
Congo	LOCATION	litera - ture that has arisen of recent years .

		He then proceeds to the consideration of belles-Uttrea in the following terms : < ■ In the field of literature , pure and simple , the Bel - gian triamTirate which has migrated to
Paris	LOCATION	retain * its snpremaey ; I mean
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Lemonnier	PERSON	, and
Bodenbach	ORGANIZATION	.

		The last of the three has been taken be - fore his time , but he is still alive for us in his drama ' Le Mirage , ' which abounds in his special qualitr of refined archness .


M. Camille Lemonnier	PERSON	is a coatzaat to him in his violence .

		Brought up at tiM awiTM mt Bruges and accused of pornographic tendencies , he has revenged himself by his novel ' Les Deux Consciences , ' in which he confronts a realistic writer with a pious magistrate of
Bruges	LOCATION	.

		Published first in the ■ Grande ilevne ' at
Paris	LOCATION	, this deep-cut record of passion has been very successful .

		Another novel by
M. Lemonnier	PERSON	deals also with
Belgium	LOCATION	, but rural surroundings . '

		Le Vent dans les
Moulins	PERSON	' exhibits the awakening of the Flemish peasants which is due to universal suffrage and the birth of the party of Christian democracy .

		This book forms a companion piece to that of
M. Cyiiel Buysse	PERSON	I noticed last year , ■ A Lion of
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	, ' but in ipite of
M. Lemonnier	PERSON	's ability his attractive idyl is perverted because he does not know the true Flemish peasant thoroughly .

		The last of the trio ,
M. Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	, a book from whom is a European event , has published this year ' Le Temple Enseveli ' ; but his especial and exquisite surprise for us is his superb Italian drama of the fifteenth eenttiry , '
Monna Vanna	PERSON	. '

		I need not speak here at length of two books which all the world has read or will read . ''

		A new and noteworthy literary phenomenon is presented by
M. Leopold Conrouble	PERSON	's '' Famille 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	,
Kackebroek	PERSON	, '' a droll novel of
Brussels	LOCATION	man - ners , which we should judge from the descrip - tion to be not unlike the popular chronicles of the
Buchholz Family	ORGANIZATION	, which took
Berlin	LOCATION	by storm some fifteen years ago .

		Among scholarly books , mention is made of the Balzac studies of
M. de Spoelberch de Louvenjoul	ORGANIZATION	; of '' L'Historie de la Cooperation en Belgique , '' by
M. Louis Bertrand	PERSON	; of '' L'Organisation du Suffrage Universel en Belgique , '' by
M. Leon Dupriez	PERSON	; and of '' L'Evolutionnisme en Morale , '' a critique of the Spencerian philoso - phy by
M. Jean Halleux	PERSON	.

		Flemish writings include '' The Field of Flax , '' a '' really beau - tiful poem '' by
M. Eene de Clercq	PERSON	; two pretty operas ; and village or peasant tales by ''
Stijn Streuvels	PERSON	, ''
M. Herman Teirlinck	PERSON	, and
M. Pol de Mont.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Tille	PERSON	's Bohemian summary says : '' The greatest stir in social and literary circles was caused by Mr.
Macbar	PERSON	's < Feuilletons , ' a collection of reminiscences of the bard life of a student and struggles of a literary beginner who , in time , turned out one of our prominent authors .

		He draws here with startling truthfulness sketches of persons with whom he had intercourse , of the difficulties of a life which often troubles and depresses youthful talent , and supplies glimpses of bis own mental development . ''

		In fiction , the author remarks , '' a desire pre - vails to portray as far as possible the realities of life , which is a sign of an honest artistic tendency . ''

		Among the novels mentioned are '' With Us , '' by Mr.
Alvis Jerasek	PERSON	; '' Ours , '' by Mr.
Holocek	PERSON	; '' Where Do the Children Go ? ''

		by Mr.
Klostermann	PERSON	; '' The Romance of
Ivo	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Sova	PERSON	; ''
Rina	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Kron	PERSON	- bauer ; and '' Passion and Strength '' and • ' Punishment , '' two novels of modern social life by Mr.
Hladik	PERSON	.

		The following general statement is of interest : ' ■ The desire to achieve a specially Bohemian novel appears in the younger generation of writers very pal - pably , but as yet endeavor is more frequent than accomplishment , although many of the results are in - teresting enough .

		The older writers have worked out a distinct and comparatively good type of historical novel , and have made some creditable attempts at the social and conversational novel besides .

		The latest efforts are devoted to the psychological narrative , with a social or artistic background . ''

		Poetry is chiefly represented by the two vet - erans , Messrs.
Machar	PERSON	and Vrchlicky .

		The former has published '' Golgotha , '' and the lat - ter two volumes , '' I Let the World Pass by Me , '' and '' Cid in the Light of Spanish Romance . '' ''

		Hands , '' by Mr.
Brezina	PERSON	, is a collection of poems of mystical or visionary tendency . ''

		This mysticism is an interesting , but isolated phe - nomenon on the Bohemian Parnassus , having created for itself a language of its own , full of rich , high-flown , almost exalted imagery , which snatches up the reader into mystical spheres of a visionary world . ''

		One dramatic production of the year , Mr.
Sim	PERSON	- acek 's naturalistic play '' The Lost Ones , '' caused a great stir among the critics . ''

		The author tries to copy real life -- that is to say , the low everyday life of lost existences -- and gives details which are the less poetical the truer they are .

		On the stage the play had no success , but the work is not abortive in spite of that .

		The author bad a special object in view , and carried it out consistently -- to bring out the moral misery of a certain class in such types as are found ready-made in life . ''

		Danish literature offers no very striking recent developments , although Dr.
Ipsen	PERSON	finds a number of interesting books upon which to report .

		His own critical study of the work of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	is too modestly men - tioned at the end of his article , an injustice which we now repair by giving it the first place in this abstract .

		A great historical trilogy of the sixteenth century in
Denmark	LOCATION	has been written by
Herr Johannes Jensen	PERSON	, a work in which `` there is not an ounce of history or study , only a picturesque display of human life in its natural strength and colour . ''


Herr Johannes Jbrgensen	PERSON	has written two books on
Italy	LOCATION	, '' Romerske Masaiker '' and ''
Romerske Helgene	PERSON	, '' dealing with the country not '' as the cradle of art and the home of beauty , but as the home of the Church . '' ''

		Sejr og Thora , '' by
Herr Peder MoUer	PERSON	, is '' a big novel in which rustic simplicity is contrasted with the emptiness and frivolities of the capital , which he considers a great centre of moral infection . ''


Herr Harald Kidde	PERSON	is '' a young and very promising man who has written a most beau - tiful book , in which he portrays all the tender feelings of a refined boy who leaves a lovely home to face the rough winds of the world and the experiences of life . ''

		This book , which is to be continued in a second volume , is en - titled '' Aage og Else , '' those being the names of the hero and heroine .

		Other works of fic - tion are '' Gsering , '' by
Herr Jacob Knudsen	PERSON	; ''
Hjertets Gerninger	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Sven Lange	PERSON	; '' Race , '' by
Herr Frederic Poulsen	PERSON	; ''
Hallin	PERSON	- gerne , '' by
Herr Theodor Ewald	PERSON	.

		An incur - sion into old romance is the poet
Herr Ernst	PERSON	von der
Recke	ORGANIZATION	's drama `` Det Lukkede Land , '' written in blank verse , and dealing with the English tradition of
King Arthur	PERSON	and his Court , with Guinevere and
Lancelot	PERSON	.

		In lyric poetry , there are several meritorious collec -
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 tions : ' • Dansk Tunge , ' '' by
Herr V. Rordam	PERSON	; ''
Roseme	PERSON	, ' '' by
Herr Aage Mettbison	PERSON	-
Hansen	PERSON	; `` Sne . ''

		by
Herr Viggo von Stuckenberg	PERSON	; and '' Undervejs , '' by
Herr Olaf Hansen	PERSON	, in which are found some beautiful verses called `` In the Town of the Ruins * -LRB-
Visby	LOCATION	, in
Gotland	LOCATION	-RRB- , and a few songs to
Iceland	LOCATION	, which is seldom thought of in Danish poetry .

		But the anthor is a con - noisseur of its literature and a lover of its scenery .

		AI .


Jules Pravieux	PERSON	, discussing the condition of contemporary French literature , takes ex - ception to the current reproach of '' anarchy , '' arguing that '' What is so styled is , as we shall see in the course of this HterarT sketch , nothing more than a great Tarietv of works and of talent .

		When we have reviewed the dramatic , poetic , philosophic , historic , and sociological works , the fiction and books of criticism , which have been published since our last review , and which have made their mark among the successes of the year , we shall arrive , I think , at the following conclusion -- that there is something better to do than to depreciate and reject all that is not fashioned after one particular model , and that is to receive with equal eagerness , from whatever quarter ther come , by whatever ideal they are inspired , those works which offer an original interpre - tation of beauty -- one perhaps in its essence , but infi - nitely varied in its form . ''

		The drama continues to offer the most note - worthy manifestations of French literary art , and occupies the first place in our summary . ''

		It can be said , without being paradoxical , that at perhaps no other epoch has the drama in this country produced a greater number of interesting works than during the past few years .

		Never before have so many dramatic authors written plays showing such true obser - vation or such subtle analysis .

		But it must at the same time be admitted that not one of these plavs is in a class by itself , with the exception perhaps of ' L'Enig - me , ' by
M. Paul Hervieu	PERSON	.

		This piece , which adds vet another to the number of great successes at the
Commie Frangaise	ORGANIZATION	, has only two acts , but they are the work of a master .

		If the classic art of all ages be that which concentrates the most emotion and thought in the few - est words with the greatest clearness , then
M. Hervieu	PERSON	in ' L'Enigme ' proves himself a pure classic .

		He re - generates in it French art , and in his own way draws near to the art of an ^ schylos or a Sophocles . ''

		M.
Henri Lavedan	PERSON	, in '' Le
Marquis de Priola	PERSON	, '' '' Finds his inspiration in the great and immortal por - trait of
Don Juan	PERSON	.

		How is it that some men whom the world in general deems commonplace have the wonderful gift of making themselves loved ?

		Whence comes the spirit of these men ?

		M. Lavedan , following in the footsteps of Moli ^ re ,
Musset	LOCATION	, and D'Annuniio , has taken up this problem , and has made of it a comedy of a somewhat harsh and rough character , but interest - ing and even powerful .

		The second act is very im - pressive , and through the whole course of the play the serious touch of a dramatic writer can be discerned . ''

		M. Francois de
Carel	ORGANIZATION	, in '' La Fille Sauvage , '' '' Has sketched the symbolic legend of Humanity .

		The idea is lofty and beautiful , though , unfortunately , the incident chosen to represent it is improbable and out of place .

		The author has attempted to crowd into the play , the action of which takes place in a few years , the immense psychical evolution of humanity through - out the ages .

		This compression brings about effects which are abrupt and not always sublime . ''

		Other noteworthy plays of the year are `` L'Archiduc
Paul	PERSON	, '' by
M. Abel Hermant	PERSON	; '' Le Nuage , '' by
M. Gnstave Gaiche	PERSON	; and '' La Terre , '' a dramatization of
M. Zola	PERSON	's well-known novel .

		French poetry has been en - riched by
M. Ary Renan	PERSON	's '' Reves d' Artiste , ''
M. Albert Samain	PERSON	's '' Le Chariot d' Or , ''
M. Charles Giierin	PERSON	's '' Semeur de Cendres , '' the '' Stances '' of
M. Jean Moreas	PERSON	, and the '' Pe - tites Legendes '' of
M. Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	.

		Bat M. Pravieux feels constrained to say : '' If we are not actually wanting in poets , not one of them has produced a work which is irresistible .

		The school which they represent marks a phase in poetic evolution , but no single man seems to have talent great enough to distinguish that phase by his own name .

		Symbolism remains apparently something more or less anonymous .

		We owe it much , because , partly by in - spiration , partly by execution , it has given new life to a poetry long concealed by the brilliant rhetoric of Par - nassus .

		But
Parnassus	PERSON	has left behind it several defi - nite performances , and the symbolists have , perhaps , only paved the way for more vigorous spirits . ''

		M.
Paul Bourget	PERSON	beads the list of novelists with ''
Monique	PERSON	, '' a pathetic story of the work - ing classes , and '' L'Etape , '' a more vigorous analytical work of high moral scope .

		M.
Paul Adam	PERSON	, in '' L'Enfant d' Austerlitz , '' ' • has at - tempted to portray a whole generation , bat his characters are uncertain and even mediocre . ''

		M. Edouard Estaunie , '' whose writings are always interesting to the critics , '' has written '' L'Epave , '' which * ' is indeed bat a novelette , one might almost say a novel with a purpose , which proves very little . ''

		M. Rod has pub - lished ' • L'Eau Courante , '' and '' Still remains faithful to his favourite form .

		With a few elements of truth and sincere observation of the outward facts of life ,
M. Rod	PERSON	has produced a striking picture and an impressive narrative -- in a word , a fine work .

		The scope of the book oversteps the bounds of convention to which the author should have confined it , but it bears that stamp of general truth which estab - lishes both works and reputations . ''

		M.
Jules Claretie	PERSON	's '' Le Sang Fran ^ ais '' is '' the work of a true patriot , and in the stories of the Franco-German war he recalls to our mind certain passages of Daudet on the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	, but in his historical chapters it reaches a still higher level . ''

		Paul and
Victor Margueritte	PERSON	in ''
Braves Gens	PERSON	'' write of the 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, war of
1870	DATE	with power and truth , although the story is more history than romance . ''

		M.
Rend Bazin	PERSON	, ia • Les Oberld , ' has not written an historical romance ; but though the romantic tendency predominates in it , it has another side which has made it a success .

		In ' Les Oberld * the
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	question is admirably treated .

		This searching study affords excellent material for the development of char - acter .

		The style of the writing is really charming , a style through which can be seen the heart of things , and in which the great talent of the writer appears full of delicacy , grace , deep emotion , and sure psychology , with a healthy , deep , and elevated poetic instinct . ''

		Turning : to the historical field , we find the usual abundance of literature concerning the Kevolution and the
First Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here may be mentioned in particular M. Aulard 's '' His - toire Politique de la Kevolution Fran ^ aise '' and '' Etudes et Lemons sur la Revolution Fran ^ aise , '' M. Funck-Brentano 's '' L' Affaire du
Collier	PERSON	, '' and
M. Arthur Levy	PERSON	's ''
Napoleon	PERSON	et la Paix . ''

		The
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	also comes in for its share of attention , the '' Memoires du Comte de Reiset '' being the most important publication for this period .

		Of historical writing in general we are told : '' There seems to be a veritable passion for recon - structing the past ; public and private records are searched with indefatigable sagacity .

		Taine has in
France	LOCATION	a few devoted disciples who have taken to his method , and divested it of the somewhat systematic character which often distinguished the works of the author of ' Origines de la
France Contemporaine	LOCATION	, ' and it can be said that many of the historical productions of the year have not fallen far short of perfection .

		All our historians abstain from generalities , and leave phi - losophy to be dealt with by books devoted to it -- what they endeavor to obtain and what they publish is fact , documentary fact .

		If this zeal does not abate , and there is every reason to believe that it will not , the twentieth century will , by its historical publications , reform many current opinions . ''

		M.
Alfred Fouillee	PERSON	is the author of '' La Re - forme de I ` Enseignement par la Philosophie , '' an important educational work .

		The author '' Considers that all teaching should be supplemented and quickened by philosophy -- that philosophy should have a large part in all education ; but the philosophy for which he asks is social philosophy , which concerns itself with great problems of morality and sociology . ''

		A work not far from the same category is M. Ossip-Lourie 's '' La Philosophie Sociale dans le Theatre d'Ibsen . ''

		This writer evidently is one of the few who really understand the great Norwegian , as the following statement of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's philosophy will attest : '' To his mind society is in au ill state , it rests on hypocritical conventions , on lies , but he believes in the goodness of human nature -- its goodness , that is to say , in so far that , if it is left to itself , its ills and vices will disappear .

		In this
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	shows himself Utopian , forgetting the true conditions of human nature in his dreams of an unattainable perfection .

		M. Ossip -
Louri ^	PERSON	, whole-hearted in his admiration , can only see in the plays of the Norwegian dramatist great and powerful lessons set out with a courageous candor . ''


M. Fouillee	PERSON	has also written a book on '' La Philosophie Russe Contemporaine , '' in which '' he asserts that though Russian thought is readily revolutionary as a reaction against excessive despotism , it has by temperament a moral tendency .

		What is the aim of life ?

		How shall we order our lives ?

		That is the mighty problem it brings forward , therein lie its originality and power . ''

		Other books on social philosophy are M. Fourniere 's '' Essai sur r Individualisme , ''
M. Bourdeau	PERSON	's `` L'Ev - olution du Socialisme , '' and
M. Halevy	PERSON	's '' La Formation du Radicalisme Philosophique -- La
Jeunesse du Bentham	PERSON	. ''

		Among works of criticism , the following may be mentioned : '' La Formation du Style par 1 ' Assimilation des Auteurs , '' by M. Albalat ; '' La Littera - ture d'Aujourd ` hui , '' by
M. Ernest Charles	PERSON	; ''
Stendhal	PERSON	-
Beyle	PERSON	, '' by
M. Arthur Chuquet	PERSON	; and '' LePretre dans le Roman Fran9ais , '' by
M. Paul Franche	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Heilborn	PERSON	's account of German litera - ture opens with these reflections : '' In literature , as in other things , there are years of fruitful harvest alternating with years of scarcity , and our granaries in
Germany	LOCATION	are this time some - what poorly filled .

		Almost all our better-known au - thors have come before the public with new works , but what they have offered has proved of comparatively small consequence either for their own artistic devel - opment or for literature in general .

		And now we see a strange phenomenon asserting itself .

		As though literature were an organism , in which if one limb or organ fails another develops with double vigour , in precisely the same way writers hitherto overlooked or little known have this year come forward with pro- ductions which engage deep and serious attention and should give new impulses to literature . ''

		Beginning with the stage , and specifically with
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's `` Es Lebe das Leben , '' he says that this play `` Shows with terrible clearness how greatly abilities even of a high order are crippled by the want of con - stant spiritual development .

		The drama has adultery for its theme , adultery committed years before ; and in order to set the stone a-rolling
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	has supplied a profusion of forced and insufficient motives which necessarily hamper the ease and smoothness of the dialogue .

		... It is not only a poor drama , it is also immoral at the core ; and it is interesting to observe how
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	, the virtuoso -- what with the confusion of his subject-matter and the perfunctory character of his mental operations -- has also lost the great technical dexterity which he has hitherto shown . ''

		In '' Ueber den Wassern , ''
Herr Georg Engel	PERSON	'' Obtains a purely superficial excitement by making a

		The onlr persons saved are the inmates of the clergyman 's boose , and their lives , too , are threatened bv the waters .

		Face to face with death , a fanatical voung clergrman baa enjoined on bim the task of reclaiming a girl and bringing her to repentance , but he refuses to do this , on the ground that her sin is too execrable ; finallv , however , he does speak to her , and touches her cod - scienoe , but he declares that repentance alone would be ineffectual to expiate her offence .

		She must seek death in the service of others .

		This she accordingly does for his sake . ''


Herr Max Halbe	PERSON	's ''
Haus Rosenhagen	PERSON	' '' has for its theme `` The desire for the acquisition of land -- a desire which has been inherited for generations by a family of wealthy proprietors , and which they have indalged at the expense of their weaker neighbors .

		The son of the house is about to enter , literally and in spirit , upon the inheritance of his fathers ; the passion which possessed tbem is to blaze up in him ; the enmity which they have sown is to bear him strange fruit .

		Halbe , however , has not succeeded in maintaining the situation consistently to its conclusion . ''


Herr Paul Liudau	PERSON	, in '' Nacht und Morgen '' supplies ' • that peculiar combination of the drama of adultery with the romance of the police-court which he has learnt from Sardou . ''

		The fairy drama has become the fashion , and is illustrated by several pieces , the most note - worthy of which is '' Der
Weg	PERSON	znm Licht , '' by
Herr Georg Hirschfeld	PERSON	.

		The greatest popular theatrical success of the year has been scored by
Herr Meyer	PERSON	-
Forster	PERSON	with `` Alt-Heidelberg , '' ' which is a dramatization of his own lisht ro - mance ''
Carl Heinrich	PERSON	. '' '


Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	's new play , '' * Der
Rothe Hahn	PERSON	. '

		* links itself with the earlier ' * Biberpelz , '' and as a work of art ' • can lay claim to no great merit .

		It is interesting because it testifies to the inner de - velopment of a serious and strenuous artist upon whom the spiritual tendencies of the age , intangible and hard of interpretation as they are , have not been lost . ''

		Perhaps the most promising dramatic work of the year has been the series of `` Lebendige Stunden ' '' -- one-act plays by
Herr Arthur Schnitzler	PERSON	. ''

		He has proved two things in these new one-act plays of his : that he draws his creations from his own mental experience , and that he is , at the same time , capable of mastering his impressions and regarding them objectively -- both prime requisites , it seems to me , in all true art . ''

		Pasing lightly over the insignificant output of the year 's verse .

		Dr.
Heilborn	PERSON	turns to fiction as `` the power which determines our artistic aims and the development of our literature . ''

		He first enumerates a few works of lesser im - portance -- ``
Felix Notvest	PERSON	, '' by
Herr J. C. Heer	PERSON	; '' Unter der Geissel , '' bv
Herr	PERSON	von Wil - denbruch ; ''
Ninon	PERSON	und Andere Erzahlungen , '' by
Herr Paul Heyse	PERSON	: ''
Ein Mecklenburger	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Adolf Wilbrandt	PERSON	; and ''
Cacilie von Sarryn	PERSON	, ' by
Herr Georg von Ompteda	PERSON	-- and then turns for more extended comment to '' the three books of the year -- the books which have in very truth given our recent literature its individual stamp , and which afford some - thing like repose after a long pilgrimage through the book market .

		In these three books outward events and circumstances sink into insignificance beside what is purely psycholog - ical .

		All three have been written by authors hitherto little known . ''

		The first of these books is by
Fran Riccarda Huch	PERSON	, and is called '' Aus der Triumphgasse . ' ''

		It pictures the lives of the poor and the vile in a series of sketches that are redeemed from the charge of being merely sordid by a vein of romantic idealism . ''

		Yet the last word is not spoken by romanticism either ; a new transformation sets in .

		We begin to see the souls of these people as they originally came forth from the hand of God ; memories from some former state of existence stir and rise up within us -- we sur - mise dimly that they will return to the hand of their Creator in pristine purity when once the breath of life has left them .

		For the soul retains its majesty in all the degradations of life .

		And , indeed , this is the true action of the book , that all masks and disguises are stripped off , and souls reveal themselves as souls .

		Behind the phantasmagoria of life stand the eternal forms . '' ''


Freund Hein	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Emil Strauss	PERSON	, is a simple story of a boy whose '' soul lives wholly in music . ''

		The discord between his outer and inner life makes existence intolerable to him , and he makes an end of it . ''

		But it is , indeed , as a true friend that Death pre - sents himself ; the eraving of the soul for repose has become all-powerfal .

		And so in this novel , too , the claims of the spirit are higher than those of life , and since the c & se stands thus .

		Death loses all his terrors . ''

		The third of these books is ''
Jorn Uhl	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Gustav Frenssen	PERSON	, a Protestant pastor of Holstein .

		It presents the Christian conception of life with great force and pathos and shows how the soul grows strong through suffering .

		Thinking of this novel , says the writer , '' I see stretched before my eyes the broad and fruit - ful lands of German soil , inhabited by a resolute and vigorous race , and I say to myself that this soil will bear fruit in the future , even as it has in the past -- fruit of many kinds . ''

		Unlike the other contributors to this conspec - tus of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literature , Dr.
Heilborn	PERSON	leaves scholarly writing wholly out of his ac - count , confining his observations almost solely to the two departments of fiction and the liter - ature of the stage .

		54 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, C ^ # lltfo § ooks .

		Reminiscences op Twenty Years .

		* Charming as is the genial temper that pre - supposes one 's readers interested in all one 's personal experiences , a little practice in the use of the blue pencil is apt to produce results more generally satisfactory to the busy reading public .

		The difference between the trained professional journalist and the non-professional diarist is well illustrated by the volume of rem - iniscences noticed at some length in the pre - ceding issue of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, and the far bulkier collection now under review .

		From a literary point of view , the non-professional writer suf - fers by the comparison .

		Lord
Ronald Sutherland Gower	PERSON	is too well known as a sculptor , a fine-art critic , a trav - eller , and a writer of occasional books , to need formal introduction .

		His volume of reminis - cences published twenty years ago established his reputation as a pleasing raconteur .

		The present collection forms a sequel to the earlier work .

		The beaten roads of European travel are all familiar to him , and he seems to have hobnobbed with royalty and chatted with prime ministers wherever he went .

		His avuncular relation to the
Duke of Argyll	ORGANIZATION	puts him on terms of some intimacy with the English royal family .

		The earlier chapters of his book con - tain frequent references to his work in
Paris	LOCATION	on the Shakespeare monument that was soon to be erected at
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	.

		This is his account of its unveiling in the
fall of 1888	DATE	: `` The Great Day has come and passed -- that of
last Wednesday , 10th October	DATE	, when my Monument of Shakespeare was unveiled at
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	.

		On that morning Sir
Arthur Hodgson	PERSON	and I met
George Augustus Sala	PERSON	at the station , who might truly have been called the guest of the occasion and of the day , and I shall always feel grateful to him for having taken the trouble to leave
London	LOCATION	at seven on a cold , raw , foggy morning , in order to take part in the function relating to my
Shakespearian Monument	ORGANIZATION	.

		He appeared in his famous Astracan-lined greatcoat , and with his speech ready written out , which he gave to the correspondent of a local newspaper , who was await - ing him on the platform .

		There also came by the same train a lively little American lady ,
Miss `` Wakeman	PERSON	, who is correspondent for half-a-dozen American papers .

		A little before twelve , we drove down into
Stratford	LOCATION	from
Clopton	LOCATION	.

		The company met in the
Memorial Library	ORGANIZATION	,

		The Mayor -- Sir
Arthur	PERSON	-- led off by a most laudatory oration .

		After this I called on Lady
Hodgson	PERSON	to unveil the
Monument	ORGANIZATION	, which was accomplished without difficulty , and a loud and ap - proving cheer greeted the appearance of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, which looked well in the soft sunshine which seemed to bathe it in a kindly benison of light and life .

		The Volunteer baud struck up '
Warwickshire	ORGANIZATION	's Lads and Lasses , ' and the bells pealed from
Shakespeare 's Church	ORGANIZATION	tower .

		I felt very grateful and very glad to have , by God 's good grace , been allowed to see the end and completion of my long labour , and to know that it was approved of by so many .

		A big luncheon followed in the Picture Gallery , followed by much speechifying .


George Augustus Sala	PERSON	spoke admirably , with great effect , and even pathos , and I felt a lump in my throat during his peroration . ''

		Six full-page views are given of the monument as a whole and of its details .

		The following reference to an interview with
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	is worth quoting : `` The Cardinal soon appeared , preceded by a priest , who at once retired , leaving us alone .

		We sat cheek by jowl , he laying bis beretta on a plain table by his side .

		The Cardinal wore a scarlet skull-cap , a black , gown-like dress , with a crimson sash round the waist .

		I stayed about half-an-hour .

		The most interesting subject he spoke about referred to his hymn , ' Lead Kindly Light , ' ^ which he said he had composed on board ship during a calm between
Sardinia	LOCATION	and
Corsica	LOCATION	.

		That hymn , he said , was not his feeling now , ' for we Catholics , ' he said with a kind smile , ' believe that we have found the light . '

		... I shall never forget his kind look as he wished me farewell and thanked me for having come to see him . ''

		As the book is more interesting than any - thino - that can be said about it , it will be per - missible to quote further passages .

		A visit to the
Bismarck	PERSON	family at Kissingen in the sum - mer of
1890	DATE	is well described . ''

		The Prince spoke to me in English very well , if not fluently ; he pronounces some words oddly , for in - stance , a word which he used constantly , ' especially ' which he pronounced ' espeecially . '

		I got him to speak about himself , the most interesting subject to hear him talk about .

		He alluded to his twenty-eight years of in - cessant work , and of the anxiety of those years .

		They had quite obliterated for him , he said , the things he cared most for previously , riding and shooting , and he added , music and painting ; but especially riding , he said again , of which he was once passionately fond ; now he only regarded it as a healthy exercise , and no longer delighted as of yore in his horses .

		The tremen - dous work he had to go through had , he said , driven all these things away from him ; bis work had been like gambling on a vast scale , and the stakes the prosperity if not the very existence of his country .

		Other minis - ters were , he said , content with holding their portfolios , but he had all the state work on his shoulders .

		The old King -LRB- ' King ' he always called him , and never Emperor -RRB- had often said laughingly to him , ' I would not be in your skin for all the world . '

		He then told me in a some - what involved manner an anecdote of
General York	ORGANIZATION	, whose desertion from
Prussia	LOCATION	to
Russia	LOCATION	had had such an effect upon the deserter that his hair blanched in a

		THE DIAL 65 single night , ' and I , ' said the Prince , ■ hare had not only one such night as that , but dozens . '

		He spoke of the old Emperor with more esteem than admiration , ' a grand soldier , ' he called him , and ■ a most gentleman - like old man , ' bat not remarkable as a statesman ... ' I was , ' said
Bismarck	PERSON	, ' probably the only person who saw the old King en robe de chambre , when I was sent for by him late at night ' ; and he described what a change it made in the appearance of the venerable monarch to be minus bis wig and his ratelier , for the white locks which appeared on his head in the daytime were fastened to bands .

		Latterly he was quite bald . ''

		Lord
Sutherland Gower	PERSON	eujoyed the friend - ship of
Herbert Bismarck	PERSON	.

		Meeting him in
Switzerland	LOCATION	in the
summer of 1892	DATE	, when the Count was on his wedding tour , he notes that the newly married man was glad of the sight of an old friend . ''

		I think , '' he adds , '' honey - mooning people generally are pleased to see a friend during the period when they try hard to imagine themselves thoroughly happy . ''

		The author 's first experience with an automobile , in
Paris	LOCATION	, in
1891	DATE	, furnishes the substance of a rather curious entry in his diary . ''

		One day that
July	DATE	in
Paris	LOCATION	I had my first expe - rience of a steam-motor car .

		An engineer named Ser - palet came to the entrance of my hotel , with a steam carriage that he has invented , which be calls a ' steam phaeton . '

		It is worked by steam and runs on three wheels .

		Six people can be seated in this carriage ; the boiler is at the back .

		We went up the Champs Elys ^ es , and into the Bois at a good pace , rather sur - prising but not alarming the horses when passing them .

		The carriage can be turned with ease , and can be slowed down , or stopped without difficulty ; but whether this will be a gain to locomotion is doubtful ; it was De Les - seps who recommended me to see this new invention . ''

		Meeting the
King of Italy	ORGANIZATION	and the Prince of
Naples	LOCATION	at
Palermo	LOCATION	, in the same year , he has this to say of them : '' His Majesty was most affable , he asked a quantity of questions , and seemed in no hurry to proceed farther np the room .

		The King is only forty-seven , but he looks sixty ; he speaks in short sentences and rapidly ; there is a decided charm about his manner , and one feels in the presence of an honest man , a Itomme de cceur -LRB- not de cour -RRB- , as be has always proved iiimself to be .

		He said that after being absent from
Palermo	LOCATION	ten years , he found many changes , old friends dead , and others grown old , and that it was not an easy thing to recollect those he had known on former occasions here .

		After His Majesty had finished speaking with me I was introduced by
General Pallavicini	ORGANIZATION	to the Prince of
Naples	LOCATION	, a very short little youth , with a weak mouth and retreating chin , but with a pleasing manner .

		The Prince speaks English as if it were his native tongue . ''

		A '' breakfast '' at
Marlborough House	ORGANIZATION	in
1893	DATE	, '' to meet Her Majesty , '' gives us a char - acteristic glimpse of Gladstone . ''

		The
G. O. M.	PERSON	was in great form , looking wonder - fully hale , strong , and stouter in the face than he did a year or two ago , all the ' sturm und drang ' that he has had to go through seems to have augmented his mar - vellous intellect and physiqne .

		Oar host drew him oat on a variety of subjects , and we beard him discourse on the Welsh language , on the definition of the term ' bore , ' for which there is no word in French , as he pointed ont , and on a hundred other subjects .

		Oar dinner lasted from soon after eight till past ten-thirty , when Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	rose to drive off to Dollis Hill . ''


Cliveden	ORGANIZATION	, our author 's old home , now owned by Mr.
Astor	PERSON	, is thus referred to : '' Early in
June	DATE	-LSB-
1895	DATE	-RSB- I paid Mr.
Astor	PERSON	a visit at my old home ,
Cliveden	ORGANIZATION	, where I had not been for a very long time .

		To revisit that place where so many years of my early life had passed -LRB- chequered with much sad - ness in later years , when my sister
Constance	PERSON	passed there the
last summer	DATE	of her life -RRB- , was , of course , full of sadness ; but I wished to see with my own eyes what
Astor	PERSON	had actually done to the place ; and I found , as I had expected , that all the accounts of his having dis - figured the place , were lies .

		He has certainly built an ugly wall , with glass on the top , along the roadside be - tween the two lodges , bat except for that no walls had been added or boilt ` all round the place , ' as reported ; and in removing the ugly yellow wing which West - minster built in the place of the old one , which has now been rebuilt to correspond , as formerly , with its fellow , an improvement has been effected .

		Within , little ia changed , although the entrance-hall is to be altered ; everything is respected and cared for . ''

		Not the least pleasing feature of this book is its excellent index , a most useful adjunct to such a collection of odds and -LRB- mds .

		The illus - trations , fifteen in number , are also good .

		But a little more attention to the irksome details of manuscript revision would have improved the noble lord 's entertaining volume .

		One brief reference of his to '' Count
Stolberg Wem	PERSON	- gerode , whom
Herbert Bismarck	PERSON	told me is the owner of the famous Broken Mountain in the
Hartz Mountains	LOCATION	, '' contains a threefold illus - tration of the unhappy results of neglect in this particular .

		Those however who share
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's dislike for the '' ambition of fine writing '' will welcome the volume all the more cordially for its unstudied dress and its spon - taneity of style .

		66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August	DATE	Ij country , have in their turn done much to arouse interest in the study and preservation of family records , antiquities , and all other memorials of our ancestors .

		Such interest must be the in - evitable result of volumes like the one before us .

		The life of
Philip Freneau	PERSON	, as told by
Miss Austin	LOCATION	, is an interesting story .

		The outlines of his life have been set forth several times already ; fifteen authors , it is stated in the preface , have written upon the subject .

		Miss
Austin	LOCATION	has had the advantage over all of them , however , in having the use of '' some unex - pected data in the form of notebooks and mar - ginal notes , '' which '' have thrown light upon some hitherto unaccounted-for years in the poet 's life , and have served to link together the portions already given to the public , as well as to correct many misstatements . ''

		In the first fifty pages of the book -- a large part , some will say -- are set forth the effect of the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes	ORGANIZATION	and the con - sequent Huguenot emigration ; followed by a description of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	and early
New York	LOCATION	, and an account of the early Huguenot settlement there .

		Fortunate indeed for the city was the coming of these thrifty and pious set - tlers .

		In the little Eglise du
St. Esprit	LOCATION	, at the corner of King and
Nassau Streets	LOCATION	, worshipped the ancestors of some of our foremost citizens .

		To quote the words of Dr.
Vermilye	PERSON	-LRB-
Huguenot Sqc	ORGANIZATION	.

		Proc , i. 26 -RRB- : `` They were the yeast in the Dutch cake .

		They were inventive ; skilled in various workmanship ; per - sistent in overcoming difficulties ; of a sprightly cheer - fulness and an instinctive gentility .

		They were edu - cated -- had even founded a college for themselves in
Leyden	LOCATION	.

		They were religious ; whom -LSB- sic -RSB- fierce winds of persecution had torn from the native tree , only to sprout again , the same religious people , wherever they touched ground .

		It was a good and hardy stock . ''

		These words suffice to indicate the general character of
Philip Freneau	ORGANIZATION	's ancestors .

		His grandfather ,
Andre Fresueau	PERSON	, who settled in
New York	LOCATION	in
1707	DATE	, was engaged in the ship - ping and foreign trade , and was a prominent resident of lower Broadway , in his day an aristocratic part of the city .

		Miss
Austin	LOCATION	's account of his children , by the way , is any - thing but clear .

		Who are
Thomas	PERSON	,
Louis	LOCATION	, and
Francois	PERSON	-LRB- p. 63 -RRB- ?

		We can only infer that they were brothers of
Pierre	PERSON	and Andre junior , and uncles of
Philip	LOCATION	, the poet .

		If this is true , the customary statement that
Pierre	PERSON	had but one brother , Andre , is of course inaccurate .

		Of the business and character of
Pierre	PERSON	-LRB- who , say
Duyckinck	PERSON	and others , was a wine-merchant like his brother Andre -RRB- , we learn nothing what - ever .

		The poet himself , the eldest of five chil - dren , first saw the light in
Frankfort	LOCATION	Street ,
New York	LOCATION	, on
January 2	DATE	-LRB- O. S. -RRB- ,
1752	DATE	; but before the year was over his father had re - moved to the estate in
Monmouth County	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, where the boy 's early years were passed .

		Philip was doubtless precocious ; and we may well believe that , possessing the advan - tages of refined surroundings and a careful training , he began to write when very young .

		But we can not suppose , as
Miss Austin	LOCATION	ap - parently does -LRB- p. 70 -RRB- , that '' The Wild Honey - suckle '' -LRB- which Professor
Bronson	PERSON	rightly pro- nounces '' the high-water mark of American poetry of the eighteenth century '' -RRB- was the work of a mere boy .

		No tyro , we think , could write , `` They died -- nor were those flowers more gay , The flowers that did in Eden bloom . ''

		We have only to compare this piece with the poems which are known to have been
Freneau	ORGANIZATION	's early work -- `` Discovery , '' `` Columbus to Ferdinand , '' '' Eetirement , '' '' The Dying Elm , '' and others -- to see the advance he had made in freeing himself from conventional and arti - ficial forms of expression .

		It is to be remem - bered , too , that these verses are not to be found in the first collection of his poems , published in
1786	DATE	.

		The college life at
Nassau Hall	ORGANIZATION	,
Princeton	LOCATION	, in the days when
Freneau	PERSON	was a student there , -- rooming with
James Madison	PERSON	, destined to be the fourth President , -- is described as fully , probably , as the materials will permit .

		The rising bell rang at five o'clock and a half-hour was allowed for dressing , after which came prayers ; but from these the small boys were excused in winter .

		Breakfast came at eight ; recitations , from nine till one ; then all dined together , at three tables .

		From three to five , more study ; then evenmg prayers , and supper at seven .

		At nine the bell rang for study . ''

		After nine any might go to bed , but to go before was reproachful . ''

		On
Sunday	DATE	every student , unless sick , was required to attend public worship , both morning and afternoon .

		In spite of this rigorous training , however , there were occasional delinquencies .


Philip Fithian	PERSON	writes to his father -LRB-
January	DATE	13,1772 -RRB- : '' I am sorry that I may inform you , that two of our Members were expelled from the College yesterday ; not for Drunkenness , nor Fighting , nor for Swearing , nor Sabbath-Breaking ; But they were sent from this
Seminary	LOCATION	, where the greatest Pains and Care are taken to cultivate and encourage Decency ,
& Honesty , & Honour	ORGANIZATION	, for stealing Hens !

		Shameful , mean , unmanly Conduct ! ''

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 57 Liberal doses of Latin , Greek ,
Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	, logic , and moral philosophy were administered ; yet along with these Freneau found time for reading and for much writing of verse , some of which certainly possesses great merit .

		At his graduation in
1771	DATE	, he presented by proxy an argument showing • ' that ancient poetry ex - cels the modern . ''

		President
Witherspoon	PERSON	was a loyal patriot , and his students were not slow in expressing their indignation at the imposi - tions heaped upon the colonists .

		In these col - lege years .

		Freneau received the vocation which was to earn for him the well-deserved title of ' • the Patriot Poet of the Revolution . ''

		His pen became '' his bayonet , and its wounds were mortal . ''

		Ttie Revolutionary years are well set forth .

		At times , possibly , the author draws too largely upon her imagination ; and she sometimes -LRB- & s on page 123 -RRB- turns almost abruptly from the most stirring scenes to narrate some bit of family history , relatively unimportant ; indeed her excursions into the genealogy of the Provost ,
Ledyard	LOCATION	,
Scott	PERSON	, and other families , while en - tertaining , do not add to our knowledge of the poet Freneau or of the events which inspired his poems , and therefore really mar the unity of the book .

		But she has made skilful use of the scanty materials at her disposal , and has woven a lively and .

		in the main , doubtless , a reliable narrative of
Freneau	ORGANIZATION	's operations during the struggle with
England	LOCATION	.

		And a busy , stirring life it was .

		Sailor , traveller in the
West Indies	LOCATION	, privateer , playing '' sad havoc with the English merchantmen '' ; captive on board '' The Scorpion '' and '' The Hunter '' ; his pen ever busy with those terrible satires which revealed such intense hatred of foreign misrule of a proud-spirited people .

		King `` Log , '' `` the Xero of our times '' ; `` the ruffian Gage '' ;
Cornwallis	PERSON	, '' hatched by some demon on a stormy day '' ; Bute and North , '' twin sons of hell , '' -- all came in for a share of his lively and withering ridicule .

		Perhaps there is no more remarkable collection of its kind in existence than Freneau 's '' Poems Relating to the American Revolution , '' which
Duyckinck	PERSON	edited in
1865	DATE	.

		The influence his verses must have exerted on the disheartened patriots is incalculable .

		■ ■ From
Concord	LOCATION	to
Yorktown	LOCATION	, during the bleak winter at
Vallej Forge	ORGANIZATION	, and round the camp-fires on
Temple Hill	ORGANIZATION	, his verses encouraged the desponding soldiers .

		The newspapers widely published them , and they were written on slips of paper and distributed throughout the army , or pasted in some conspicuous place to be memorized .

		And not alone by the camp-fire did they accomplish their work , but even on the field ; his ear - nestness and zeal encouraged the patriots to greater efforts , or urged them on at the point of his l '' yooet -LRB- tlw pen -RRB- when he saw any signs of their lagging be - hind ; and afterwards be immortalized the victoriea they won .

		Not a memorable incident either by land or by water escaped his ever watchful and unwearied pen . ''

		The war over ,
Freneau	ORGANIZATION	's muse continued to j be active , but brooded often on more peaceful j themes .

		In
1787	DATE	, for example , he contributed I no fewer than twelve poems to '' The American : Museum , '' among them '' The Death Song of a Cherokee Indian , '' '' To the Memory of Col. I
John Laurens	PERSON	, '' and '' Lines Occasioned by a Visit to an Old Indian Burying Ground . ''

		Notwithstanding frequent mercantile voyages to the
West Indies	LOCATION	, '' Captain '' Freneau found time to prepare and publish -LRB- 1786-88 -RRB- two volumes of poems , essays , and tales .

		After - ward , giving up the sea , he turned to journalism .

		The true position of '' The National Gazette '' was first clearly explained in
1895	DATE	by the late
Paul Leicest	PERSON	`` r `` Ford -LRB- '' The Nation , '' Ix .

		143 -RRB- .

		Doubtless
Jefferson	PERSON	told the truth when in his letter to
Washington	LOCATION	he protested that he never influenced Freneau nor wrote for `` The Gazette , '' and it is hard not to accept
Freneau	PERSON	's affida - vit of
August 8 , 1792	DATE	; but , as Mr.
Ford	PERSON	con - clusively shows , they could not have told the whole truth .

		Not merely was '' The Gazette '' to fnmish '' a juster view of the affairs of
Europe	LOCATION	than could be obtained from any other public source '' ; it was , in reality , also to serve as a partisan organ for the Republicans .

		It amply fulfilled its mission ; its bitter animosity to the administration caused
Washington	LOCATION	great an - noyance , while in the view of
Jefferson	PERSON	and his followers it '' saved the Constitution , which was fast galloping into monarchy . ''

		It is hard for us , even in these days of Philippine disputes , to comprehend the extremes to which men were then carried by partisan feeling ; yet , after all , milder editorials from the author of '' Mac - Swiggen '' and `` The British Prison Ship '' would have surprised us .

		At the early age of forty-one , Freneau re - tired to his estate at
Mount Pleasant	LOCATION	, where he was to spend the second half of his life in seclusion .

		Of this period of his life we have few records , much having perished in the disastrous fire of
October 18 , 1818	DATE	.

		We know that he wrote much poetry , and put out three more editions of it -LRB- 1797 ,
1809	DATE	, 1815 -RRB- ; that he dabbled in journalism and made almanacs ; that he again turned to the sea and made many voyages to the
West Indies	LOCATION	; that 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, he entertained many old friends , visited much in
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and conducted a large correspondence .

		In the main , he lived the peaceful life of a country gentleman , bear - ing malice toward none , beloved by many and respected by all .

		Miss Austin prudently refrains from express - ing critical judgments of Freneau 's poetry , quoting freely instead from Dr.
Francis	PERSON	and Mr.
Delaneey	PERSON	; and we shall not prolong this notice with critical remarks , since to what these writers and Professor
Tyler	PERSON	have said little can be added .

		Freneau 's fame is secure .

		The greatest and most versatile of the Revo - lutionary group , the greatest American poet before
Bryant	PERSON	, he has written some lines that have never been surpassed .

		His best verses are still read , and will long continue to give delight .

		A new edition of his poetry , edited by Professor
Pattee	PERSON	, has been announced for publication this year , to which
Miss Austin	ORGANIZATION	's sumptuous volume will form a worthy com - panion .

		She has made the poet and his times live again for us ; and this is the test of a successful biography , q ^ ark

		RECOIiliECTIONS OF THE AMERICAN Stage .

		* In '' Reminiscences of a Dramatic Critic , '' Mr.
Henry Austin Clapp	PERSON	, who is recognized by some as the leading exponent in
New England	LOCATION	of honest and discriminating criticism of the drama , reviews some of the chief features of the stage during the
past quarter	DATE	of a century .

		These reminiscences , however , are not exhaust - ive in any sense of the word , and do not pro- fess to present the history of the theatre in the
United States	LOCATION	during the period mentioned .

		He has chronicled , merely , those recollections which have remained most vivid in his mem - ory , in a manner that will elicit praise from many and censure from a few .

		The author calls attention to the fact that of the large body of English playwrights who produced dramas , '' always with extreme facil - ity and sometimes with contemporaneous suc - cess , '' between
1845	DATE	and
1875	DATE	, -- excepting , of course .

		negative working-day rule of prediction can be fur - nished .

		It seems to be a part of the present order of things , at least in English-speaking countries , that our dramas shall be ephemeral .

		Even the best of them are like insects , made to flaunt their little wings for a few hours in the sunshine of popular favor .

		The caprice of fashion deals out death with relentless speed to these plays .

		That they furnish the public with much enter - tainment is not to be questioned ; but they have no essential beauty , or imposing breadth , or prevailing power to make their appeal potent beyond a year or less of life . '

		The best of this kind are but shadows , ' said the Dramatist of the World , in one of his remark - able expressions about the art of which he was Prime Minister and Master .

		The rule of negative prediction is simple enough : The play which never passes into literature ; the play which , in ` the cold supremacy of print , ' can not endure reading and re-reading has the sure seed of death within it .

		Out of a hundred con - temporary dramas , ninety are fiat and unprofitable on a first perusal , and ninety-and-nine are warranted to cause mental nausea at a second .

		Take
Robertson	PERSON	's ' School , ' for instance , which was performed to hun - dreds of thousands of delighted spectators , in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, in the early seventies .

		Reading it delib - erately to-day is like absorbing a gallon of weak eau sucree flavored with the juice of half a lemon and a small pinch of ginger .

		Contrast with that work , and work of its quality , the half a hundred tragedies and comedies which remain to us from the Greeks of the fifth and fourth centuries before Christ .

		The newest of these plays are two thousand two hundred years old ; they are written in a dead language ; and they have the atmosphere of a remote land and an alien age and civ - ilization ; yet they still receive the quick sympathy and command the reverent admiration of the world .

		The corollary of the rule for negative prediction is obvious : The nation which is producing no readable dramatic literature is producing no dramas of permanent impor - tance from the point of view of life and art , which are indeed one point and the same . ''

		During Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	's thirty years ' service as a dramatic critic , many truly great actors have made their final exit .

		In his book the personal gossip and anecdote which generally lends zest and piquancy to such narratives are missing .

		The author explains that he has , in the inter - ests of candid criticism , avoided personal ac - quaintance with player folk , that his head `` might neither be quite turned , nor much deflected from a true level . ''

		His
Reminiscen	PERSON	- ces take form as a series of reconsiderations of the plays and players of the past , from the point of view of a disinterested critic .

		The first on his canvas is that veteran figure of the
Boston Museum	ORGANIZATION	,
William Warren	PERSON	.

		When his seventieth birthday was celebrated , a little while before the close of his professional career , the tale of this wonderful actor 's work was told : he had given 13,345 performances , and had appeared in 577 characters !

		For many years he was a most interesting figure in Bos - ton , not only upon the stage , but upon the
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 59 streets over which he took his deliberate and slightly varied walks . ''

		His tall , large , well-formed figure , and his easy , rather peculiar gait , which seemed alwavs about to be - come , but never quite became , a roll or swagger ; his noble head with the bright penetrating eyes and the ex - traordinary sensitive mouth , made equally to utter mirth or pathos or wisdom , produced the effect of a unique personality ... I remember hearing it said , at a time near the close of the Great War , by some men who were native here , that
Edward Everett	PERSON	,
A.B.	LOCATION	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, LL.D. , ei-Governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, ex-United States Seuator from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, ex - President of Har -
vard College	ORGANIZATION	, ex-Minister to
England	LOCATION	, litterateur , ora - tor , statesman , was , in respect of distinction of manners , in a class with but one other of his ' fellow citizens ; that other one appeared in the local directory as '
Warren	PERSON	,
William	LOCATION	, comedian , boards 2 Bulfiuch Place . ' ''

		According to Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	,
Charlotte Ciish	LOCATION	- man , whom he saw in her assumptions of
Meg Merrilies	PERSON	,
Lady Macbeth	LOCATION	, and
Queen Katha	PERSON	- rine , is the only actress native to our soil to whom the adjective `` great '' can be fitly ap - plied .

		Miss
Cushman	PERSON	's impersonation of Queen Katharine , he says , '' must be accounted her crowning achievement , and , therefore , the highest histrionic work of any American ac - tress . ''

		He speaks of
Charles Fechter	PERSON	as an exceedingly fascinating and eloquently appeal - ing actor , who was somewhat handicapped by the plainness of his features , the bluntness of his figure , and his foreign intonations .

		Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	remarks that he has '' generally felt , and often expressed , a distaste for broken En - glish on the stage , and I regard the easy-going toleration of the imperfect speech of alien actors as one of the signs of the rawness of our public . ''

		`` We are told that the elder
Salvini	PERSON	's Othello -- by which this actor is most widely remembered -- `` was Shakspeare orientalized and supersensualized , at the cost of some of the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's heroic conception , and of much of the Poet 's beautiful thought . ''

		Yet we are compelled to agree with his broad statement that ''
Salvini	PERSON	was
Charles Fechter	PERSON	carried up to the second power of all the Frenchman 's virtues , with scarcely a hint of his limitations . ''

		The Hamlet of both actors met with a chorus of disapproval from American audiences .

		Perhaps the best and most thoughtful chap - ter in Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	's book is the essay on the art of
Henry Irving	ORGANIZATION	.

		The critic has studied the actor from various standpoints , and it is un - doubtedly true that his final conclusions are voiced by a large portion of the theatre - going public of this country .

		He believes that '' Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's art would be much more effectual than it is if ' to do ' were one-half ' as easy ' with him as his knowledge of ' what were good to do ' is clear ; that if abundance , brilliancy , clearness and refinement of thought , artistic insight , definiteness of purpose , sin - cerity of feeling , and intensity of devotion were all that is needed in a player , he would be easily first among the actors of our time ; that , since the highest end of acting is not to refresh and stimulate the mind , to re - fine and gratify the taste , or to charm the fancy , but strongly to move the spirit and profoundly to stir the heart , his claim to a place among the greatest masters of his craft is not yet made out . ''

		This same opinion is expressed by that studious English critic , Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	, who is authority for the statement that Irving 's audi - ences are '' intellectually interested , but not emotionally excited . ''

		And it has been fre - quently pointed out that Mr.
Irving	PERSON	violates one of the important duties of the stage -- to bear aloft the standard of correct speech , and to make a constant appeal to the public ear in behalf of pure and refined enunciation .

		To Messrs.
Howard	PERSON	and
Gillette	ORGANIZATION	are con - ceded the best plays that
America	LOCATION	has produced . ''

		Secret Service '' is pointed out as the high - water mark of our play writing ; it is , so to speak , the Hamlet of American dramatic liter - ature .

		The author is encouraged to believe that '' A better day for the drama and the theatre is sure to dawn .

		The actors are readier than the public for a change to nobler condi - tions ; and the public , now learning to demand of and for itself the best things in many de - partments of life , will not always rest content with conditions that encourage mediocrity in that Theatre upon which it depends for the larger part of its entertainment . ''

		The remedy that he has in mind for these conditions is an endowed theatre , which he suggests , prophet - ically , will become a reality within a few years .

		It is a pessimistic rather than an optimistic view which Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	takes of prevailing the - atrical conditions in this country ; yet he does not sum up conditions completely and con - cisely , giving causes and pointing out remedies .

		We might add that one cause for the failure of any drama of recent years to rise above the general level may be found , absurd as it may appear , in the close intercourse maintained be - tween different countries .

		To-day , as a quarter of a century ago , the French play is not merely a model , but is actually the basis of a large proportion of the dramatic literature of the time .

		The result is an influence exerted upon the writers of other countries which is gradu - ally destructive of aU originality .

		Among other subjects treated are '' Spectacle , Farce ,
Melodrama	LOCATION	, and Minstrelsy Fifty Years Ago . '' ''

		The Isolation of Actors , '' and `` Actual 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, and Ideal Training for the Stage . ''

		Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	's judgments are in the main remarkably just and true ; the work is notably free from that extravagant laudation which marks the ` pren - tice hand .

		The author 's style , though perhaps somewhat too conscious , does not reflect the influence of daily newspaper work , and betok - ens an untainted reverence for all that is true and best in dramatic art .

		are the voluminous works of his father , the late Mr.
John William Walshe	PERSON	, F.S.A. , who died on the
2nd July , 1900	DATE	, aged sixty-three , at
Assisi	LOCATION	, in
Umbria	LOCATION	, where he had passed the latter half of his life .

		Mr.
Walshe	PERSON	was well known to scholars as perhaps the greatest living authority on matters Franciscan ; otherwise he had practically no fame . ''

		This statement is followed by a minute description of the manuscripts in question , with historical and bibliographical notes , and an account of how the editor has dealt with them in preparing the present '' Life , '' together with his plans for further publi - cation .

		It takes some time to realize that this is all an elaborate piece of mystification , and to recall the fact that the name of
Walshe	PERSON	does not figure in any actual list of Franciscan scholars , living or dead .

		The present imaginary biography is offered to us as the work of the son ,
Philip Walshe	PERSON	, who survived his father long enough to prepare it , but not long enough to arrange for the publication of the memoir or of the works themselves .

		Having said this much by way of explanation , we may now speak briefly of the memoir itself .

		It is , in sub - stance , the story of a saint , whose instincts from boyhood impelled him to the spiritual life , who groped his way out of the sordid middle-class com - mercialism of his early English environment into what proved to him the clear light and perfect happiness of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		He made his way to
Italy	LOCATION	while a young man , entered the house - hold of a Catholic English nobleman residing at
Lucca	LOCATION	, there received the faith , married the daughter of the house , and succeeded to its tradi - tions .

		Attracted in middle life to the history of St.
Francis	PERSON	, he removed to
Assisi	LOCATION	, became a tertiary of the Franciscan order , and died in the fulness of time , '' of the love of God , '' as the memoir simply afiirms .

		In all this there is little to attract the ordinary reader of novels , who may as well be warned at once that here is no book for him .

		But to the more serious reader the book has many things to offer .

		In the first place , it offers a psy - chological study of marvellous delicacy , such a study as may be found elsewhere only in the '' Lives of the Saints '' or in the history of the mystics .

		This alone should distinguish the work ; but we may say in addition that it is written in a style at once simple , strong , and beautiful , that it makes throughout the scholar 's appeal to the scholar , and I that , with no more than an occasional hint of the controversial spirit , it portrays the great historic church , not the chuich of an ignorant peasantry led by a hardly less ignorant priesthood , but the church which
Newman	ORGANIZATION	found irresistible in its claims , and to which
Joseph De Maistre	ORGANIZATION	gave the rapturous allegiance of bis powerful intelligence .

		Our experience with the novels of '' Benjamin Swift '' has been such that , with all his skill and penetration , we think of him as a writer who is unnecessarily and perversely disagreeable .

		It is therefore something of a surprise to find that '' The Game of Love '' is not founded upon the sort of
1902	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 61 nnpleasant conception in which he has hitherto delighted , but is simply a well-arranged story of normal baman character , as far as the chief actors are concerned .

		There is a professional pickpocket , to be Bare , whom we encounter in the opening pages , not without some apprehension that he may figure as the hero ; there is also a physician who becomes a criminal for the sake of science and love com - bined , and there is a miser of the conventional sort .

		Bat these are minor characters , although their fate is closely interwoven with the plot .

		The main in - terest is of a healthy human sort , and is surprisingly well sustained .

		The final disentanglement of all the complications requires a rather breathless hur - rying from point to point , and might profitably have been elaborat `` d .

		The novelist is as brilliant as ever in his use of epigram or incisive comment , and his humor , which rarely fails him when needed , is thoroughly enjoyable . ''

		Spindle and Plough , '' by Mrs.
Henry Dudeney	PERSON	, is a novel upon which it is possible to bestow almost unqualified praise .

		The earlier books of this pow - erful writer have been marred by her insistence npon a realism bo brutal and squalid as to produce a marked sense of repulsion , tending to ob § care the really fine qualities of her work .

		In • ' Spindle and Plough '' there is still realism and to spare , but either the nature of the theme or the writer 's im - provement in taste has spared us the repulsive sort of detail in which • • The Maternity of Harriott Wicken '' abounded , and leaves the reader free to ex - press his unrestrained admiration .

		Mrs.
Dudeney	PERSON	's heroine this time is
Shaiisha Pilgrim	PERSON	, a woman of primitive and passionate nature , absolutely un - worldly , and instinctively abhorrent of every mani - festation of vulgarity or vice .

		This fine , frank , op '' en-air creature takes a deep delight -- a whole - some and not a sentimental delight -- in contact with nature , and has found in her professional training as a landscape gardener the very resource that she most needs .

		Contrasted with her we have three other persons , -- her widowed mother , a vain and silly person to whom anything but petty and child - ish views of life are impossible ; her employer , whom nature might have made a gentleman had he not become hopelessly sophisticated by the influences of an artificial society ; and the mean - natured , doll-faced creature whom he marries after
Shaiisha	PERSON	has contemptuously rejected his overtures .

		Then there is another person , a rustic named
Felix Rale	PERSON	, who seems to be a good deal of a man until unexpected good lack develops a streak of vulgarity in his nature , making Shaiisha wonder how she could ever have been attracted to him .

		Later in the story , when the mother has eloped with a pursy and altogether obnoxious tradesman , when the gen - tleman and the shallow little schemer have plunged into the misery of marriage , and when Shaiisha herself , growing old , begins to realise that some - thing is lacking in her life , Felix Rule reappears , humiliated by the loss of his money , and finds to his surprise that in this dejected guise he makes a real appeal to the sympathies of the woman whom he had formerly sought to win by the offer of a social position and a life of idleness .

		Amid all these changing scenes and searching tests , the character of the heroine rings true , and grows nobler and finer with every year .

		Her scorn for the petty vanities of those aboat her is tempered by a large and sympathetic tolerance for their weakness , and she ever renews her own strength at the primal sources .

		Finally , she becomes the possessor of the - estate and the garden that she so passionately loves , and the human emotions , so long repressed , find satisfaction in the companionship of the chas - tened
Felix Rale	PERSON	.

		We have said nothing of the quiet but pervasive humor of this book , nothing of its skilful management of plot and incident , nothing of its unaffected and striking style .

		It is just such a book as we have hoped that Mrs.
Dudeney	PERSON	would some day write , just such a book as we knew she had it within her power to write .

		The similarity of this work to the most characteristic work of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	is likely to be insisted upon overmuch , but is still fairly obvious , and should not be left an - mentioned . '

		■ The Way of Elseape '' is a novel that opens brightly in the south of
France	LOCATION	.

		A young medical student from
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, engaged to a worthy young woman of that city , has sought the shores of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	for rest and relaxation .

		He meets a vivacious French-English maiden , promptly falls in love with her , and the consequences , as we do not even surmise at the time but learn only long after - wards , are of the most serious character .

		Called home by duty , as it seems , he wrestles with his mem - ories for a time , then marries , tries to forget the girl whom he has wronged , and degenerates into a suc - cessful and fashionable practitioner .

		He has his re - ward , for his wife develops a taste for distributing tracts and leading prayer-meetings .

		Meanwhile the heroine , after a brave straggle with her sufferings , shapes for herself a serviceable career , first as a governess , then as the guardian and protector of four children , her half-sisters , thrown upon the world by the death of their mother .

		It is with the development of the heroine 's character , under this pressure , that the story is chiefly concerned .

		It would be a good story were it not dominated by a hectic religiosity .

		The old worn theme of the pride of the intellect and its
fall	DATE	, of the need of something upon which to lean in time of trouble , is brought into action with the usual morbid emphasis , until we discover that we have been reading a sort of Sunday-school story all the time , and not a serious work of fiction .

		Miss
Eleanor C. Price	PERSON	is the author of an agree - able and carefully-studied story called * ' Angelot . ''

		It is a tale of the
First Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and has to do with the
Angevin Chouannerie	PERSON	.

		The period is that of the Emperor 's prime , when he was the undispated master of
France	LOCATION	, and when conspiracy was eagerly sought out by the agents of the ruler and relent - lessly punished .

		The various types of the period are portrayed , -- the irreconcilable royalist , the 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, time-serving adherent of the new rSffime , the police spy , and the soldier of the Empire .

		The latter is a vulgar and brutal person of low birth , who seeks to force a marriage with a daughter of the aristocracy .

		Angelot , being the favored suitor , as far as the her - oine is concerned , becomes a thorn in the general 's flesh , and is made the victim of much persecution .

		True love triumphs in the end , to the discomfiture of the general , and all ends happily .

		The story is not particularly stirring , but it is pleasantly told , and reveals a close acquaintance with the scenes and the society which it seeks to depict .

		A story of very different type , and much more nearly related to literature , is the '' Sons of the Sword , '' by Mrs.
Margaret L. Woods	PERSON	.

		This also is a Napoleonic romance , with a scene laid in
Spain	LOCATION	during the struggle for the conquest of the
Penin	PERSON	- sula , and the Emperor himself plays a conspicuous part .

		He is portrayed with an art which does not spare the despicable aspects of his nature , yet which does not grudge him the possession of some of the nobler traits of character .

		The heroine is an Irish refugee , with whom one of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's favorite officers seeks at first to have sport , and ends by becoming the serious lover .

		Presented to us at the outset in a disagreeable light , we undergo , together with the heroine , a gradual change of feel - ing toward him , until at last he appears as an ac - ceptable hero through the display of courage and self-sacrificing devotion .

		There really seems to be no need that he should die in the last chapter , and it is not easy to forgive the author for thus dispos - ing of him .

		The book contains many vivid scenes of battles , and forced marches , and quarrels between the French soldiers and the infuriated Spanish peasantry .

		Some of these scenes are extraordina - rily well done , and the whole romance is one of deep and sustained interest .

		Mr.
Marriot Watson	PERSON	has the happy faculty of combining invention with style .

		The style may be described as simplified Meredithian , and one must acquire the taste for it ; but style of any kind is so rare in the romance of adventure that we must not be too critical . ''

		The House Divided '' may cer - tainly boast of a distinguished manner , and is , be - sides , a story of quite thrilling interest .

		lb is placed in the
eighteenth century	DATE	, a period which the author knows well , and the scene is the southern coast of
England	LOCATION	.

		The hero comes from
Vermont	LOCATION	, upon advices from his lawyer , to lay claim to an estate which is held by the
Earl of Deverill	ORGANIZATION	, a nobleman of the swearing and sporting type , who fears neither God nor the devil , and who is outspoken to the point of the coarsest brutality .

		He lays various plots for the ruin of the claimant ; and , these fail - ing him , provokes a personal encounter in which he slays his opponent , only to learn that the man whom he has slain is in reality his own son .

		instead of being the son of his hated old-time rival .

		The love scenes in this remarkable romance have a ten - der beauty which more than suggests the magic of the great novelist who has obviously been the author 's exemplar .

		Mr.
Marriott Watson	PERSON	is ex - ceptionally happy in his portraiture of women , and nothing could easily be finer than the contrasted types of the virginal heroine and the passionate woman of the world whose jealousy brings about the tragic ending .

		Of style , the romances of Mr.
Marchmont	PERSON	are guiltless ; and it is upon invention alone that he depends for his effects .

		They are usually well - contrived from the theatrical point of view , and the latest novel of this ingenious writer is quite as good as its several predecessors .

		The historical background of ''
Sarita	PERSON	, the Carlist , '' is not of the imaginary '' Zenda '' sort , but is furnished forth by recent happenings in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The time is the very eve of the late war , and the assassination of C ^ novas is reproduced in the assassination of the Minister
Qaesada	PERSON	, who is the evil genius of the story .

		The Queen Regent and the young
King	PERSON	also figure , and the central episode is the thwarting of a Carlist plot for the abduction of the latter .

		This makes the third novel of Carlist intrigue that we have read within the past few naonths .

		In the advertising pages of '' My Lady Para - mount '' we are confronted with some words of our own concerning one of Mr.
Harland	PERSON	's earlier books , to the effect that the author '' has not gone to the school of the best Frenchmen in vain , and has at last shown himself capable of workmanship so deli - cate that we have not the heart to say aught but praise concerning it . ''

		Consistency is too fair a jewel to be purposely flawed , and we are thus under bonds , as it were , to say nice things about Mr.
Har	PERSON	- land 's latest book .

		The task is , fortunately , not a strain upon the conscience , for '' My Lady Para - mount '' deserves to have nice things said about it .

		As a comedy of sentiment and as a breathless love - story , it is charmingly exciting from beginning to end .

		It coruscates with cleverness , and its plot , albeit fantastic , lends itself admirably to the writer 's stylistic purposes .

		There is a jester of whom we grow slightly weary , but both hero and heroine are all that the heart could wish .

		The former is an English gentleman with certain hereditary rights in a petty Italian island state .

		The heroine is in actual possession , for the legitimate heir has been dispossessed as a consequence of the political revo - lution by which
United Italy	LOCATION	was wrought .

		But the heroine has both a conscience and a romantic imagination , which together lead her to the es - capade of an incognito trip to
England	LOCATION	, where she meets her cousin , and deliberately plots to make him fall in love with her .

		He proves the most willing of victims , and all conflicting claims are in the end thus reconciled .

		Our sympathies , as far as history is concerned , have to be enlisted upon the wrong or reactionary side , which in this , as in so many other romantic instances , is given a sort of artistic rehabilitation .

		It is like the
Stuart	PERSON	case in English history : the wrong side is the pictur - esque one , and gets much the best of it at the hands of the story-tellers .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 6 `` `` Mile .

		Foacfaette '' is so good a novel in some respects that it is a pity it coald not be a better one in others .

		It is the story of a rag-picker 's found - ling who becomes , successively , an inmate of the
Bon Pasteur	LOCATION	, a Parisian moucharde .

		an artist 's model , and a congpienoas figure in the free-and-easy life of the Quarter .

		It is not quite
Murger	PERSON	's Bobeme over again , which would be quite impossible at this later date , but it offers an approach to that portrayal of an irresponsible and insouciant society .

		The later chapters deal with the recent time when the Parisian air was charged with Dreyfasard electricity , and when revolutions were every day incipient .

		Fou - chette is a bright and winsome young woman , with finer qualities of mind and heart than her circum - stances would lead one to expect .

		We come near to shedding a tear when , at the end , the man whom she loves , and whose guardian angel she has been , remains all unsuspecting of her devotion , makes a happy marriage with a colorless young woman in whom we can not take the least interest , and leaves Fonchette no refuge bat the convent .

		Mr.
Charles Theodore Murray	PERSON	is the writer of this entertMning and well-informed novel .

		He leaves numerous things unexplained or insufficiently accounted for , but the main thread of his narrative is kept pretty steadily in hand .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's • • Bylow Hill '' has the dimensions of a novelette , and .

		within its limits , accomplishes the portrayal of a group of half a doren people in iheir mutual relations .

		The scene is a
New England	LOCATION	town , and the i ^ sae is made tragic by a mistaken marriage and an insanely jealous husband .

		Some - how we feel that Mr.
Cable	PERSON	has never become quite acclimated to his Northern home , and , with all the delicacy of his literary art , we miss in this story the vital glow and the variety of his earlier work .

		He has never had the gift of lucid exposition , and .

		even when working on so reduced a scale as the present one , he contrives to puzzle us not a little in our effort to differentiate his characters and understand their motives .

		The story may be read with satisfaction in its grace of manner and subtlety of analysis , bat will add nothing to the author 's reputation .

		* • The Courage of Conviction , '' by Mr.
T. R. Sul	PERSON	- livan , is a novel of
New York	LOCATION	life .

		It is based upon familiar themes .

		-- the woman who marries without love , and the man who is tempted by material re - wards to forsake the higher calling which nature has planned for him .

		Both come to grief , as is just , and afterwards contrive to patch up , after a fashion , the lives that their mistaken choice has marred .

		There is far too much of moralizing in this work , and not nearly enough of narrative .

		It is very well devised , and carefully written , but can - not be credited with either distinction or absorbing interest .

		The republication of two earlier novels , and the appearance of a new one . ''

		The Rescue , '' calls marked attention to the work of Miss
Anne Douglas Sedgwick	PERSON	, who appears to be a writer of exceptional merit . ''

		The Rescue '' is a novel which , first of all .

		has distinction of style , a quality in which it sug - gests the fine and subtle art of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	.

		It is the simple story of the tragedy of a woman 's soul .

		Her life seemingly wrecked by an unhappy mar - riage , the heroine is early left a widow with a single child .

		The degradation of her term of forced com - panionship with the selfish and vulgar man whom she has called husband has so wounded her pride that , when his death frees her , the very springs of happiness seem to have been dried up forever , and she faces a dreary future which offers no promise of cheer .

		Her mistake appears irreparable , and she ac - cepts the penalty with dignity and strength of spirit .

		Some score of years later , a man much younger than herself chances apon an old photograph , learns something of her history , and deliberately seeks her out in the belief that his own happiness is destined to be bound up with hers .

		The situation thus created is clearly unnatural , and it would take more than
Miss Sedgwick	PERSON	's art to make us enter into it with complete sympathy .

		That we be - come as interested as we do is no small tribute to her achievement .

		The tragedy of the situation is not wholly retrospective , tor the daughter of this woman is a constant reminder of the past .

		This daughter has inherited her father 's character rather than her mother 's , and as one mean or vicious trait after another becomes revealed , the mother has a bittor straggle between doty toward her child and repulsion for the hereditary endowment which no amount of careful training seems able to modify .

		In the end , the daughter sinks to her natural level , and the mother accepts the eagerly proffered love of the mtui who has restored a sort of happiness , albeit maeh chastened , to her existence .

		The whole story is told with admirable incisiveness and colored by the exhibition of deep but duly restrained emo - tion .

		Its psychological truthfulness is as apparent as its sincerity , and it is an example of saeeess at - tained by strictly legitimate means .

		Mrs.
Elisabeth PuUen	PERSON	-LRB- formerly Cavaua -RRB- will be pleasantly remembered as the author of certain charming stories of
Southern Italy	LOCATION	, in which the shrewd humor of a keen American observer was made to react upon an intimate knowledge of Italian life and character .

		But these stories hardly prepared us for the delightfully whimsical narra - tive of adventure called '' Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	, '' with which Mrs.
Fallen	PERSON	has now broken a long silence .

		It is a story of brigands , as the title-page avers , but of brigands that belong to the category of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's pirates , and that seem to have stepped directly from the opera bouffe stage .

		This suggestion of the story-teller whom we have so recently lost is inevitable , not only because his name is constantly brought to mind by Mrs.
Pul	PERSON	- len 's arrangement of incidents , but also because of the striking similarity of design in the eases of the leading figures of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's last book and the one now under consideration .

		For Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	, like Captain Bonnet , is a man of dual soul .

		To the outward observer , both are staid , prosaic , and 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, altogether respectable members of society , engaged in commercial life , and seemingly quite guiltless of a romantic inspiration .

		But Captain Bonnet , as we know , was a pirate at heart , and became one in fact when the opportunity offered ; and so Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	, when he realized his long-cherished dream of visiting
Italy	LOCATION	, and having taken the jour - ney , fell into the hands of the brigands , found himself quite at home , and rising to the situation , became a brigand chieftain himself .

		How he cap - tivated his captors , how they acclaimed him as their leader , how he drew up a constitution for the band on strictly business principles , and how he superintended their operations in the interest of good management and fair dealing , -- how he did all these things , and others , makes a long story , which is inimitably told by Mrs.
Pullen	PERSON	.

		Of course the story could not end with things in this shape , and so we are told finally how Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	ob - tains amnesty for his fellow-robbers , and for him - self a charming Italian wife .

		In all this there is the best of entertainment and innocent excitement , for which the author deserves and shall have our heartiest thanks .

		The young man of wealth who devotes himself , in spite of family opposition , to the amelioration of industrial conditions has become a somewhat familiar figure of late in our popular fiction .

		The usual upshot is that his well-intentioned efforts meet with ingratitude , that he unchains forces that he can not control , and that he abandons the ex - periment a sadder and wiser man than when he entered upon it .

		The hero of ``
Philip Longstreth	PERSON	'' is such a reformer , but his career does not follow the usual course .

		His efforts are actually appre - ciated by their beneficiaries , and he really does suc - ceed in creating a relation of mutual helpfulness and service between himself and the employes of his factory .

		So much for the sociological side of the story .

		On the sentimental side , he is in love with two women , one of his own class , the other an operative .

		We are left in doubt until the very end as to which of the two is to become his wife .

		When convention triumphs over sentiment we are rather disappointed , because the factory girl is the more attractive of the two women .

		Miss
Marie Van Vorst	PERSON	is the author of this novel , which has so many faults that we lack the space in which to particularize . ''

		The Washingtonians , '' by Miss
Pauline Brad	PERSON	- ford
Mackie	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Herbert Hopkins	PERSON	-RRB- , is a novel of the Capital during the last year of the Civil War .

		To a certain extent , it is a novel h , clef , for besides the figure of the President we have unmistakable portraits of Secretary Chase and his brilliant daughter , and very likely others not so readily recognizable .

		The misguided effort of the Secre - tary to become
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's successor , abetted by his ambitious daughter , affords the substance of the plot , which is well-managed , and betrays besides a considerable knowledge of social and political
Washington	LOCATION	in the sixties .

		The story ends with the news frodi
Ohio	LOCATION	declaring that the convention has given a majority for the President .

		Mrs. Hop - kins is always a pleasing writer , and her presenta - tion of the heroine is an excellent piece of firm and distinct characterization .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		NOTES ON NOVELS .

		The
Pennyroyal District	ORGANIZATION	in
Kentucky	LOCATION	ventures to look down upon the
Blue Grass Region	ORGANIZATION	of that favored commonwealth , having been settled by officers of the Coutinental army ou grants from the parent State of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Here Mrs.
Nancy Huston	PERSON	Banks places the scene of her serene and delightful story of '' Oldfield '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , certain from its uame , characters , and treatment to remind the reader of '' Crauford . ''

		Little Miss
Judy Bramwell	PERSON	will serve as a type of new-world gentlewoman , drawn as her portrait is with a loving care and a tenderness that make it very real .

		Being a
Kentucky	LOCATION	story it is ilievitable that there should be something in the nature of a blood feud in its pages .

		With great good sense ,
Mrs. Banks	LOCATION	has turned this rem - nant of savagery the other way around , and the dra - matic climax of the book comes with the refusal of a wise judge upon the bench to undertake the miserable business of personal vengeance .

		Everywhere the story shows signs of deliberation , of writing for love of the art of writing , and of a large and kindly interest in humanity .

		Short stories bound up into a volume are becoming rare in these days , hardly one such book appearing to a score containing extended novels .

		Even so good a col - lection as Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	has made hears the title of the 6rst of the five tales which comprise its content without qualifying phrase , and it comes into the world as ''
Ranson	PERSON	's Folly '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- .

		The stories are various -- one of the army , one of a dog , one of the newspaper world , one of love abroad , an 'd one in quite the manner of
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' New Arabian Nights . ''

		All are workmanlike , all are interesting , and they have the unquestionable advantage of being written purely to afford amusement , and not in the least for edification .

		Gathered as they are from the pages of the magazines in which they have appeared , they are doubtless already familiar to many readers ; but they lose nothing by be - ing placed in apposition here .

		VVales is a country so far from the beaten track of travel , so remote from the bustle of modern life as practiced in the great world , that Mr.
Allen Raine	PERSON	, who writes '' A Welsh Witch '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- as his sixth or seventh story of the
Principality	LOCATION	, poses before the reader as a discoverer .

		His heroine , as the name indicates , is of no common type , -- a child of the people , with gypsy blood to send her heart beating with that of nature , one who is regarded by her conventional neighbors with superstitious awe .

		Apart from this figure , and that of her distressfully drunken father , the story is idyllic in its cast , working out a pretty though interrupted ro - mance with much skill .

		Those who have followed Mr.
Raine	PERSON	's work from the beginning will find little diffi - culty in understanding the numerous Cymric words and phrases with which it is sprinkled ; others may be
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 tronbled br this too obTions device to add the impres - sion of locality .

		Writing out of an extended experience and clearly within its boands , Mi ^ s
Clara Morris	PERSON	has drawn snch a picture of the American stage in < * A Pasteboard Crown '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- as must shock more than one of her admirers .

		Her heroine is a girl of family and breeding , her hero an actor - manager in the best repute ; yet the girl goes altogether wrong with her patron , and the man is shown to be conscienceless in art and morals both .

		The story is unquestionably disagreeable , from the moment of the girl 's downfall until the tragic close , though redeemed in part by her sister 's happy marriage and motherhood .

		The fourth of Miss
Morris	PERSON	's pub - lished works , ic shows well-defined dissimilarities in manner from its predecessors , many more than its being a first continuous novel demand .

		Heretofore the reader has been able to trace resemblances between the author 's histrionic art and her literary art , finding in both a characteristic crudity and power .

		In this work there is a finish largely lacking before , with a sense of propor - tion and a broader knowledge that give it distinction .

		Mr.
Harry Leon Wilson	PERSON	, the author of '' The Spend - ers , a Tale of the Third Generation '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , was bom in
Illinois	LOCATION	, and has divided his adult life between
Ifebraska	ORGANIZATION	and
Xew York	LOCATION	.

		His very readable romance shows a wide knowledge of both eastern and western
America	LOCATION	, the scenes alternating between the mountains and the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast .

		The theme is an attractive one , most of the book being given up to an account of the manner in which the widow of a Western capitalist passes a season in
New York	LOCATION	with her son and daughter , the three making money fly and extracting all the merri - ment possible out of a frivolous and dissipated life ; and though the mother is given to charitable deeds for a share of her expenditure , a certain lack of sensibility , noticeable throughout the narrative , places her on the same level as her children .

		The grandfather of these persons is the most striking figure in the book and the dem ex machina who eventually rescues the boy and puts him in the way of redemption , but only through hard work in the money-getting world .

		The pictures , by Mrs.
O'Neill Latham	PERSON	, are admirably illustrative of the spirit of the book , -- a sympathy explicable , per - haps , by her recent marriage to the author .

		Mr.
Barry Pain	PERSON	is a maker of excellent fun , and his ingenious tale of '' The One Before '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- the best of light reading .

		A magic ring , eagerly sought for by an Oriental owner throughout the story , has the power to confer upon its wearer the character of the person who had worn it just before .

		The ring makes several instructive shifts under Mr.
Pain	PERSON	's skilful direction , but the most important one places it , fresh from the hand of a professional lion-tamer , on the finger of a wife subjected to the exactions of a petty domestic tyrant .

		The change in the relative positions of the couple after the magic becomes efficacious is as pleasant as it is in - structive .

		To this character drawing is added the zest of a search for the missing jewel , conducted by a rather discordant family of
London	LOCATION	Jews .

		In these , as in the Gentiles of the book , Mr.
Pain	PERSON	has a genius for search - ing out and exploiting weaknesses and foibles , leaving the story laughworthy throughout , even in the course of true love which trickles through it .

		One whirl of the revolutionary wheel in some
South American Republic	ORGANIZATION	gives Miss
Margery Williams	PERSON	the material for her novelette of '' The Late Returning '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a tropical passion of the revolutionary leader for the favorite of the chief executive against whom he conspires lending the other element of ro - mance .

		The narrative is in good part from the mouths of newspaper men from these L'nited States , young fellows who are conducting a daily journal in the capi - tal of the unnamed country under difficulties largely exotic .

		The book is brief , but filled with matter , and shows a skill in handling that promises still better work in the future .

		It wiU certainly interest its readers , even in hot weather .

		Mr.
Frederick Trevor Hill	PERSON	's story of '' The Minority '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- is one of commercial chicanery for the most part , dealing with great industrial combinations , labor difficulties , speculations on the
Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	, and other similar components of our present civilization .

		The principal character is a young man who has inher - ited a large manufacturing business , and feels a senti - mental and somewhat patronizing obligation toward his working people .

		This sentiment dissipates itself rapidly when they show their readiness to strike , though it is really the commercial rivals of the concern who insti - gate the workmen 's demands .

		The villain of the book is the father of the heroine , and his pntting her in the young manufacturer 's way to aid him in getting the better of the young man financially leads to the event - ual happiness of both .

		The treatment tends more to realism than to optimism , but it is no bad picture of the times .

		It would be doing a serious injustice to everyone con - cerned to call the titular character of Mr.
Will N. Har	PERSON	- ben 's '' Abner Daniel '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- a southern ``
David Hamm	PERSON	. ''

		The story does not ramble , but presents a clear picture of life in
Georgia	LOCATION	, setting forth the manner in which a speculator in timber-land is allowed to realize a comfortable fortune by various devices admitted in the world of commerce , but for the most part far more expedient than commendable .

		In the several transac - tions the bachelor uncle ,
Abner	PERSON	, plays the part of a chorus , while others take the more active parts until the climax .

		In this
Abner	PERSON	has a full share , however much he is overshadowed elsewhere .

		We like to think of the South as a part of
America	LOCATION	not yet commercial - ized , and Mr.
Harben	PERSON	is by no means convincing , though always interesting and doubtless correct , in showing the part such speculations play in its development , both material and intellectual . ''

		Hearts Courageous '' -LRB- Bowen-Merrill -RRB- is a great improvement in every respect upon the former books of Miss
Hallie Erminie Rives	PERSON	, being a well worked out romance of the .

		\ merican Revolution .

		The leading part is played by a French nobleman , an emissary of
Louis XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		sent to
America	LOCATION	to report to his royal mas - ter on the condition of the colonies in respect of their revolt against British rule .

		By a device neither original nor shop - worn , he is made to appear as an impostor masquerading in his own personality , and held by the British to be in their employ .

		The resulting situations are filled with excitement , complicated by the love the Frenchman has awakened in a patriotic
Virginia	LOCATION	girl of fine family .

		Many of the leading characters of the period come into the argument at one time or another .

		The chief fault of the book is the obviousness of the Frenchman 's disguise ; though this will but little trouble an inexperienced reader .

		Another romance of the Revolntion is Mr.
James Eugene Farmer	PERSON	's ''
Brinton Eliot	PERSON	: From
Yale	ORGANIZATION	to York - town '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book opens with a fairly well realized description of
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	just before New 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	,
England	LOCATION	revolted openly , with
Nathan Hale	PERSON	, and many another contributor to our national independence of lesser note , as undergraduates in that time-honored in - stitution of learning .

		The poet Freneau appears also , and is made to compose some of his stinging satires on British misrule for Mr.
Farmer	PERSON	's pages .

		Throughout the work appears as a praiseworthy attempt to show the obligations of the fathers of the Republic to the men of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	; but the manner is rather that of an ama - teur than of an accomplished writer of fiction .

		Yet the faults are chiefly those of a first novel , and Mr.
Farmer	PERSON	has all the world before him when he chooses a topic not so limited in its scope .

		With the frauk intention to preach peace as one of the essentials of Christianity , ''
Edna Lyall	PERSON	'' -LRB- Miss
Ada Ellen Bayly	PERSON	-RRB- has taken for her latest novel the title of `` The Hinderers '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , from the woe pro- nounced by Jesus upon the lawyers , -- '' Them that were entering in ye hindered , '' -- and both her hero and heroine stand against the mania for conquest and aggrandizement which has dominated Great
Britain	LOCATION	since the beginning of hostilities in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		With so insistent a theme , it is inevitable that the lit - erary art of the book must suffer ; yet it is a word spoken in season , even though the war itself has ceased .

		For the rest , the story is one of English fashionable life , with the frivolity and self-seeking of the upper middle classes in abrupt contrast with the lives of a few highly principled men and women .

		A new edition of Mr.
Clive Holland	PERSON	's '' My Japanese Wife '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- attests the popularity of that pleasing account of the failure of a delightful little girl of Nip - pon to adapt herself to British ways when taken by her fond husband to his home .

		Mr.
Holland	PERSON	has rewritten a few passages in the book without changing its pur - port or interest , and new pictures have been made for it .

		These , while endeavoring to realize Japanese methods , go only half way , and the result is not alto - gether satisfactory .

		The misunderstandings of a married pair afford the nucleus around which Mr.
W. E. Norris	PERSON	has framed `` The Credit of the County '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a mildly realistic novel of English country life .

		A rather silly young girl is wedded by a man who makes too few allowances for her youth and lack of stability , and he is hardly to be blamed for holding that she shall be his wife in nothing but name after he has surprised her in the act of permitting a vapid youth of the neigh - borhood to kiss her .

		The head of a pushing and newly - rich family also witnesses the indiscretion , and shrewdly uses it as a lever to pry his way into the mildly aristo - cratic society thereabouts .

		The book is slight , though workmanlike , and will make acceptable
summer	DATE	reading .


Sara Jeannette Duncan	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Everard Cotes	PERSON	-RRB- may certainly be regarded as one likely to hold the scales even , in such a consideration of British and American social life as she depicts in '' Those Delightful Amer - icans '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		Born in
Canada	LOCATION	and accustomed to Americans from infancy , long a resident in
India	LOCATION	and well known in English society as well , she is ad - mirably fitted to analyze the differences between lives so widely variant and yet so closely akin .

		She might perhaps be quarrelled with as having selected for her exemplars of American society the men and women and youth of a generation which had made its own fortunes , but if she had gone elsewhere her contrast between these people and her satisfied English aristo - crats would have been less acute and by no means so amusing .

		The episode of the elderly woman of vast wealth who prefers to attend to her own housekeeping in a palace on the
Hudson River	LOCATION	, and finds herself con - fronted with a genuine English butler secured for her by her old-country friends , is delicious .

		Miss
Duncan	PERSON	's sympathies , too , are evidently with the Americans in most respects ; though the book is so artfully con - trived that her English readers will probably consider the reverse to be her intention .

		Mr.
Orr Keuyon	PERSON	assists his readers by setting forth the aims of his '' Amor Victor '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- in a '' Note Explanatory '' which he prints at the end of the vol - ume , and prefixes a `` Note Pi-efatory '' to ask that the explanatory note be read both '' before and after taking '' in the body of the story .

		These aims are high , it is hardly needful to remark , but they are imper - fectly realized .

		The sufferings of the early Christians in the reign of Tiberius are rather lost sight of , so near a demigod is the protagonist , who himself loses sight of his baptism by the Beloved Apostle from time to time .

		The scenes in the arena of the Coliseum at
Rome	LOCATION	are told with an evident love for vivid description , and the horrors come out in full force .

		But a large part of the concluding explanation might have been omitted to advantage .

		The growth of a little
Maine	LOCATION	settlement to the stature of a fashionable sea-side resort is set forth in Mrs.
Henrietta G. Rowe	PERSON	's '' A Maid of Bar Harbor '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and the '' unearned increment '' of the single-taxers plays no small part in developing the characters of the original residents , a brother going down to moral ruin , and a sister to comfort of both soul and body .

		This compensating effect of greed is one of the good things in the book , but its chief point lies in the manner in which the evolution of the little village is suggested from page to page .

		Mrs.
Rowe	PERSON	has a real heroine , and has done wisely in selecting for the mate of so nice a girl the playmate of her childhood .

		Though Mr.
J. A. Altsheler	PERSON	introduces
Tarleton	LOCATION	and
Morgan	PERSON	into `` My Captive '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , and ends his narrative with the American victory at
Cowpens	LOCATION	, his situations are nowhere essentially those of the
Revolu	PERSON	- tionary war , and the numerous captures and recaptures of the patriotic hero and Tory heroine , which make up the greater part of his story , are fairly assignable to any condition of partisan warfare in any country .

		It is a story of event , and not of character ; yet the growth of love between the capturer and the captive , and the reversal now and again of the positions of the two , are not devoid of the power to hold attention .

		Mr.
E. L. Vincent	PERSON	is an optimist in politics , and the principal figure in his ''
Margaret Bowlby	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a young miner who is able singlehanded to triumph over wrong and corruption in the legislature of no less a state than
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		He does not do much him - self , except to present an impregnable armor of right - eousness to his adversaries at all times ; yet this leads him to the governorship of the great commonwealth , in a manner that every reader must sincerely wish might be prophetic .

		From this statement it may be judged that the author is not deeply versed either in practical politics or in the history of the particular legislature he has chosen as the Augean stable for his Hercules to cleanse .

		Nor does he go far in the way of convincing his readers by the development of character .

		But as a counsel of perfection , the story makes very pleasant reading in these days of political degradation and dismay .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 Two yooDg men and one jooDg woman , all Amer - icans of tbe better class , form a sort of joint
Robinson Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	in Mr.
Charles L. Marsh	PERSON	's '' Not on the Chart '' -LRB- Stakea -RRB- .

		One of them is an engineer , and the other a ■ ■ i w Ma lly informed person so far as the two men are concerned , and it is inevitable that they should both fall in love with the young woman .

		The ensuing rivalry and its results are well brought out and never fail of inter - est. .

		The great strain on the probabilities lies in the astonishing amount of knowledge of everything pos - sessed by the unsuccessful lover , -- yet there is prece - dent and to spare in other and earlier tales of castaways upon desert islands .

		Mrs.
Sheppard Stevens	PERSON	has drawn extensively on tbe history of the city of
St. Louis	LOCATION	at tbe beginning of tbe last century for her novel '' In the # agle 's Talon '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The simple and primitive life of the French residents is soon exchanged , however , for the whirl of
Paris	LOCATION	under tbe
First Consul	ORGANIZATION	, and the dra - matic climax is interwoven with the making of tbe treaty by which
France	LOCATION	ceded tbe territory of
Louisiana	LOCATION	- Mrs.
Stevens	PERSON	has left several loose ends in her book , which is rather unevenly written .

		Mr.
R. H. Davis	PERSON	records , in one of bis short stories , that a great British statesman found his best recreation in reading detective stories .

		Many another must con - fess a sly fondness for this sort of pastime , -- a demand which can not , after all , be very great or it is to be pre - sumed that more such stories would be written .

		Mr.
A. W. Marcbmont	PERSON	, in `` Miser
Hoadley	PERSON	's Secret '' -LRB-
New Amsterdam Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , tells a very good one , in which the chief character leads a double life , and tbe mys - tery depends upon strong resemblances between two criminals implicated .

		An oversight on the author 's part leaves some valuable jewels in the hands of one of tbe villains , and quite unaccounted for ; and the heroine is somewhat too manly , and the hero a trifle ladylike .

		Tet it is one of the best recent stories of its kind , and can be depended upon for keeping its readers awake .

		The demand for stories of animals , and nature stories in general , has been rather marked of late .

		Miss
Ellen Velvin	PERSON	, F.Z.S. , is well equipped for the task she un - dertakes in ''
Rataplan	PERSON	, a RJague Elephant , and Other Stories '' -LRB- Altemns -RRB- .

		A scientific knowledge of tbe habits of the fifteen beasts and one bird which enter into her scheme results in much information pleasantly concealed for younger readers ; and there are hints at the broader democracy that includes all created things in its scope , tbe rights of pets under children 's domination , and of the better side of tbe nature of our humbler kinsfolk .

		The numerons illustrations in color , by Mr.
Gnstave Verbeck	PERSON	, add greatly to the attractive - ness of the volume , which will make an excellent gift at any time of the year for young and growing people .

		The ability to write vividly and well enables Mr.
William Steams Davis	PERSON	to succeed where so many have failed , in writing a novel out of ancient sacred and pro- fane historv commingled .

		His last novel , ''
Belshazzar	PERSON	, a Tale of the Fall of Babylon '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , embodies a considerable amount of learning , much of the latest knowledge of the Assyriologists finding place in his narrative , though in its main facts it follows rather the book of
Daniel	PERSON	.

		Some of this knowledge is not fully realized , and there is a general lack of psychical distinction between the oriental characters utilized , making it a story of event rather than of development .

		Still , it is a stirring romance ,
Daniel	PERSON	and the Prophet of the
Captivity	LOCATION	, tbe second
Isaiah	PERSON	, playing a great part in the development of tbe plot .

		One fault is the insist - ent use of quotation marks to indicate certain techni - calities of Assyriological study , a practice seriously interfering with the book 's verisimilitude .

		Nor is the enormous antiquity of Mesopotamian civilization suffi - ciently insisted upon .

		The themes of the ten transcripts from metropolitan life that make up Miss
Elizabeth G. Jordan	PERSON	's '' Tales of Destiny '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- are invariably on the tragical side of life , redeemed in most instances by a feeling of sym - pathetic humanity which may be taken for humor in its better sense .

		Those who recall Miss
Jordan	PERSON	's ** Tales of the City Room '' will find several stories from tbe same source here , while the milder and more serene '' Tales of the Cloister '' furnish no further inspira - tion , -- an omission to be regretted .

		It is to be added , by way of compensation , that few books in general lit - erature have appeared lately which contain so much BiOTality , pure and undefiled , leading in occasional epi - sodes to the absorption of the literary by the ethical interest .

		Miss
Jordan	PERSON	is a keen observer and analyst , and it is to be hoped she will soon essay some fictional work of greater magnitude .

		`` Strangers at the Gate : Tales of Russian Jewry '' -LRB-
Jewish Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains no fewer than eighteen episodes from a racial life left uninterpreted in American literature except for Mr.
Samuel Gordon	PERSON	, the author of these and two or three similar collections .

		So far do his scenes and characters transcend ordinary
Gentile	PERSON	experience that it is difficult to appreciate the real worth of bis writing .

		So far from the oriental exaggeration which might well attach to these tales , there is everywhere a fine reserve and an indieation of reserved strength which promise even better things than these vignettes from Jewish life in
Russia	LOCATION	-- or Russian life in
Jewry	LOCATION	.

		There is material enough and to spare for such an author as Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	in the Ghettos of the great American cities , and it is greatly to be desired that his attention should turn to this fertile field .

		Mrs.
Lucy Meacham Tbmston	PERSON	's '' A Girl of
Virginia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a well-conceived story of tbe
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, successfully embodying the academic life of one of the worthiest and most notable of American educational institutions .

		The contrast be - tween the feeling of the modern commercial world and certain fine old Virginian traditions is admirably worked out .

		It is a great pity the text of this book could not have been more carefully revised , as to details of style and grammar .

		It is hard to do jostiee to tbe book called ''
Mistress Dorothy	PERSON	of Haddon Hall '' -LRB-
Fenno	PERSON	-RRB- , by a writer hitherto unknown , Mr.
Henry Hastings	PERSON	.

		The title and seleetion of characters both trespass upon Mr.
Charles Major	PERSON	's successful romance to an extent which makes confusion of the two almost inevitable .

		As the present story forces comparisons with its predecessor , it may be said at once that , quite apart from its lack of originality , it is in every way inferior .

		Mr.
Hastings	PERSON	has all the faults of a novice , his historical holdings in the period he discusses are almost invisible , and his work is crude and unsatisfactory .

		In her '' Lafitte of
Louisiana	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , .

		Miss
Mary Devereux	PERSON	has been as successful in the choice of a hero as was Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	with
Eleazar Williams	PERSON	in ''
Lazarre	PERSON	. ''

		Indeed , there are many curi - ous parallels to be drawn between the '' Pirate of tbe Gulf '' and the pretender to tbe throne of
France	LOCATION	, so far 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, as their biographies and traditions which have grown up around them are concerned .

		One tradition in the present volume connects
Jean Lafitte	PERSON	with the return of
Napoleon	PERSON	from
Elba	LOCATION	; and of this
Miss Deverenx	LOCATION	has wisely made the most .

		His exploits as a pirate and privateer are little detailed , as they are little known ; but there is real disappointment in the author 's failure to discuss at length
Lafitte	PERSON	's splendid service at the battle of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and to describe that notable victory , altogether too little known to the present gen - eration .

		The book is long , and was evidently written in haste ; but it is nowhere lacking in interest .

		The eternal contrast between urban sophistication and rural simplicity , the former embodied in masculine and the latter in feminine form , lies at the bottom of Mr.
William Henry Carson	PERSON	's '' The Fool '' -LRB-
Dilling	PERSON	- ham -RRB- .

		A grotesque character , whose uncomplimentary local soubriquet gives title to the book , is introduced by way of chorus to the characters , and as the general instrument of fate in bringing about the happiness of those concerned .

		The story is frequently amusing , though lacking in art as distinguished from artificiality .

		Readers nowadays are no more to be contented with an ordinary love-affair in a book than amusement-seekers would be with an old-fashioned circus .

		Mrs.
Ellen Olney Kirk	PERSON	's latest story for girls , '' A Remedy for Love '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , enables the figure to be carried a step fur - ther ; for she has three several heroes and as many hero - ines , -- just as the Sells and Ringlings have three rings in their great tents .

		Two of the heroines are young girls , just '' out '' in society , and their lovers are '' according , '' as they say in
New England	LOCATION	; but the third hero is no less a personage than the young girls ' widowed papa .

		The book is full of cross-purposes , and all the amusement to be legitimately derived from surprises ; and , while not a remarkable work in any respect , will make good reading for those whose age finds the topic engrossing .

		`` The Suitors of Yvonne '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is Mr.
Rafael Sabatini	PERSON	's contribution to the cause of the sword-and - cloak romance , with
Cardinal Mazarin	PERSON	in the lurid back - ground to lend historical verity to slashing fighting and intermittent but assiduous love-making .

		A ruffling gamester in fortunes sadly reduced ; a maid of high birth and great expectations surpassing in beauty the houris of the Moslem paradise ; a rival who is in every way suited for the maid , -- given these , and the prob - lem is presented for solution .

		It is romance of the best possible sort , -- romance with the courage of its convictions , -- and there is not a dull page for the reader to yawn over .

		The world owes a debt of grati - tude to the inventor of this sort of literature , -- much more , in truth , than to this latest exemplar of it , whose work was largely done for him by distant predecessors .

		Notes . ''

		The Book of Orchids , '' by Mr.
W. H. White	PERSON	, is a new volume in Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	's rapidly growing series of '' Handbooks of Practical Gardening . ''

		Messrs.

Henry Frowde	PERSON	, at the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Miss
Clara Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	's Life of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	, in the authorized translation of Mr.
E. M. Cope	PERSON	, is published in a second edition by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is probably the best popular account of its subject to be had . ''

		The Poems of
Schiller	PERSON	, '' translated by Mr.
E. P. Arnold-Foster	PERSON	, are published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The translation is painstaking but not distin - guished , and it is difficult to understand for what pub - lic such a work is issued . ''

		The Unknown God , '' an essay by Sir
Henry Thompson	PERSON	, is a booklet published by
Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This striking essay was first published in '' The Fortnightly Review '' a few months ago , where it attracted much attention .

		Mr.
B. H. Blaokwell	PERSON	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, is the publisher of `` A Primer of Greek Constitutional History '' by Mr.
A. H. Walker	PERSON	.

		This book is based in part upon the larger work of Mr.
Greenidge	PERSON	, and is specially planned for the needs of the English public-school boy .

		A new edition , in a single volume , of the '' Life and Letters of Lady
Sarah Lennox	PERSON	, '' reviewed at length in The Dial for
March 16	DATE	last , is published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The text and illustrations are in all respects identical with the original edition in two volumes .

		The
New Amsterdam Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just published a neat three-volume reprint of the
1814	DATE	edition of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark Journals	ORGANIZATION	.

		Portraits of the explorers and maps of their route add to the attractiveness of this edition , which is , however , simply a reprint without any modern scholarly apparatus .

		The first number of '' The Gulf States Historical Magazine , '' edited by Mr.
Thomas M. Owen	PERSON	, and pub - lished at
Montgomery	LOCATION	,
Alabama	LOCATION	, presents a highly creditable appearance , and betokens anew the growing interest of the South in intellectual undertakings .

		The magazine will be issued six times a year , and the reputation of the editor as a student of Southern his - tory offers a guaranty that the contents will be of value .

		We have seldom seen a more tasteful or attractive catalogue than the one just sent us by Messrs.
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Denham & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, describing the books , manuscripts , autographs , and drawings for sale by that firm .

		Beautifully printed at the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	, and illustrated with numerous reproductions of various sorts , it is a publication which the collector will delight in , and a model of its kind .

		The American agent for
Messrs. Denham & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is Mr.
E. A. Denham	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		We are glad to note the appearance of a new edition , with illustrations , of that sterling romance of Indian life in

		It is a work of unusual strength and iatereet , and well deserves the success denoted by this attnetiTe illustrated edition , which will be welcomed bj old admirers of the book and should introduce it to a large circle of new ones .

		The eight full-page pic - tures by Mr.

		A YEAR OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS .

		BRIEFER MENTION m NOTES i '' 9 LIST OF N'EW BOOKS 100 The most interesting , and perhaps the most important , among the educational publications of the year is the survey of recent progress and present conditions made by President
Harper	PERSON	a few weeks ago , and read by him at the Min - neapolis meeting of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The paper was prepared with great care and thoroughness , after correspond - ence and consultation with over a hundred of the best known workers in the educational field , and offers a comprehensive account of what has recently been accomplished in all the main departments of teaching and school ad - ministration .

		It is the work of an expert who has had the assistance of many other experts , and deserves to be read carefully by every American who is engaged in educational work .

		The opening paragraph of this address reads as follows : '' In attempting a survey of the progress of ednca - tional work during the period of a single year , one qaiekly discovers three or four things : -LRB- 1 -RRB- that sach a survey will contain no adequate presentation of the mass of material which may rightly lay claim to be in - claded -- a volume of hundreds of pages being hardly snfiBcient , much less a paper of forty or fifty minutes ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that no sharp line can be drawn between different years , since the more important events really assume the nature of movements , and most of them cover a period of several years ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- that prejudice against taking forward steps in education has been greatly di - minished , and skepticism as to the value of the old conventional usages in schools and colleges is largely on the increase ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- that , whatever may have been true in the past , no very close connection any longer exists between the educational movements of
England	LOCATION	and the continent , and those of our own land .

		At all events , we may no longer be counted merely as followers ; in some respects , we may perhaps claim the position of leadership . ''

		If Dr.
Harper	PERSON	's hour was inadequate for anything like a full presentation of the many topics clamoring for attention , our own ten or fifteen minutes must be still more inadequate , and we will attempt no more than a selection of passages , accompanied by a few words of brief description and comment .

		The important subject of the training of teachers yields the following observations , which we believe to be essentially sound : * ' The teacher is beginning to recognize more clearly the importance of study for the sake of information as distinguished from that of method study .

		This differ - 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, ence is the old bone of contention between the normal school and the college .

		A radical step , and one which seems to acknowledge this general principle , has been taken during the past year in the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The city normal school , whose function it is to train teachers for the elementary field , has advanced its course of study to three years , and has made its requirement for admission coordinate with that of the leading colleges in the country ... This need of broader scholarship has nowhere been more deeply appreciated than among the teachers themselves , and in testimony of this state - ment we need only recall the interest and support of that great multitude of elementary teachers who spend a part of their vacations in the
summer	DATE	schools and colleges .

		The encouragement of
summer	DATE	study by the superintendents of the great cities , and the avidity with which such opportunities have been seized , present a situation heretofore unknown ; and one from which the greatest possible results may be expected .

		It is not method study simply that these teachers hunger for ; it is rather information on special subjects in which they have discovered their weakness . ''

		The sooner the old type of normal school is banished from our educational systems , the healthier our pedagogical condition will be .

		That normal school work should be , in any radi - cal sense , different from the regular academic work of the college or other higher institution , is one of the most mischievous notions that ever obtained a foothold in our educational theory .

		After a while , we shall come to realize that pedagogy itself is a good deal of a fetich , and that the really educated teacher knows by instinct about all that he needs to know of the art of teaching .

		The subject of secondary education occupies a large space -- but not larger than is com - mensurate with its importance -- in Dr.
Har	PERSON	- per 's survey . ''

		It is thought by some of the ablest representatives of secondary education in
New England	LOCATION	that the expe - rience of the past year includes as an encouraging fea - ture , the change on the part of the colleges to revert to the old standards of requirements which laid emphasis upon power and discipline rather than upon technical knowledge .

		It is believed that a beginning in this direc - tion has already been observed , and that there exists a widespread conviction that such a course is required by sound doctrine .

		Certain western institutions have laid emphasis upon this point for several years .

		It is grati - fying to note that the recognition of this principle is gaining ground in the
New England	LOCATION	colleges .

		The principle involved is one essential to the best interests of secondary education , and unless this principle is adopted unreservedly , secondary training will not only lose a large share of its value , but in many cases prove distinctly injurious .

		The tendency toward the intro - duction of elective work in secondary schools has un - questionably increased during this past year .

		In so far as such election is virtually an arrangement of studies in groups of closely connected subjects , no exception to it may be taken ; but to the proposition that the average secondary student is able , even with the parents ' help , to select his subjects , and that such selection , because it is an election on his part , is preferable to the group - ing of subjects which the best experience has approved , the writer desires to enter earnest protest -- a protest based upon experience with students of a still maturer age .

		It has been my experience , after careful study of the facts as brought to light in the operation of dif - ferent systems , that the average boy or girl in the freshman or sophomore college years exhibits an utter inability to make wise decision between various courses of instruction .

		The choice will be determined , in a majority of instances , by the hour of recitation , or some statement concerning the course by a fellow - student .

		Least of all does he have in mind the rela - tionship of the course to the work which lies before him .

		I am , therefore , strongly of the opinion that , unless the choice of subject in secondary work is prac - tically controlled by the principal , election will prove injurious rather than helpful . ''

		This condemnation of the absurdity of turning boys and girls loose upon a course of study , to patch up their own programmes in accord - ance with their own whims , might profitably be made more emphatic than it is ; and with the condemnation there should be coupled some more or less sarcastic comment upon the solemn nonsense which is commonly advanced as argument in behalf of the elective system .

		The growth of secondary education in this country is one of the most striking phenomena of recent years .

		Within a decade the number of high-school students has doubled , the great majority of students who enter college come from high-schools , the number of such schools is increasing rapidly in every state , and the scope of the high-school curriculum is being extended every year . ''

		These schools have come to occupy a unique field independent of higher institutions .

		In many sections of the country the work is coordinate with the work of the smaller colleges , and the preparatory schools connected with the smaller colleges no longer occupy their former place of importance and dignity .

		In fact , the high school is rapidly coming to be a rival of the smaller college itself .

		In some states the high school now does the work of the freshman year , and even some of the work of the sophomore year , this being recognized and accepted by the state universities .

		This tendency , while subversive of the relationships which have hitherto existed between college and preparatory school , and while injurious in the extreme to the growth and de - velopment of the smaller college , is a tendency which is invaluable and which deserves encouragement .

		It is a movement in the interests of economy , of better sec - ondary education , and of better and broader higher education .

		The time is coming when , in every state , the leading high schools will carry the work to the end of the sophomore year in college .

		Nothing can be said in justification of the policy of stopping at an earlier point than this . ''

		Upon the controverted question of the simpli - fication of college degrees .

		Dr.
Harper	PERSON	argues , with convincing logic , for the preservation of
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE JDTATi 81 the distinction , at present still generally made , between the two or three fundamental types of intellectual training . ''

		There are those who believe that the distiDctioiis proposed in the different degrees are distinctions based upon real differences ; that a course the larger part of which is in science may properly be called a conrse in
Bcieiiee	LOCATION	, and the degree given be a degree in science .

		The word ` science ' is one which its enthusiastic adro - eates should honor by use rather than dishonor by rejection .

		By the side of the old college of arts , the characteristic feature of which was the study of the classics , there hare grown up two sister colleges : that of science , and that of modem history and literature .

		Surely this fact may well be recognized ; and nothing is gained by adapting the old degree to the new college , when it is so easy to employ a degree the name of which explains itself .

		This step can hardly be regarded as a forward step in education .

		The breaking down of real distinctions means backward movement , not progreas . ''

		We thoroughly agree with the writer in this opinion , believing that the arts degree has a prestige peculiarly its own , which it is entitled to preserve .

		The degree in science may win for itself , in some instances has already won for itself , a like prestige : but it should not nsurp the distinctive badge of a fundamentally different discipline .

		The freedom of university teaching finds a staunch friend in Dr.
Harper	PERSON	, and he sees reason for encouragement in the fact that the public strongly espouses the cause of the pro- fessor who is made , or ever seems to be made , the victim of official persecution . ''

		Every month of the last twelve months has added to the security and permanence of the professor in the prosecution of his work .

		Every month has added to his dignity and to the importance which attaches to his words .

		Every month has made it clearer that public sentiment is on the side of the professor in any contest entered into with the institution of which he is a mem - ber .

		Within five years the sentiment has become almost universal that , once a man is appointed to do work in a university , the university is responsible for the appoint - ment , but not for the views which the man later may propound .

		Gradually , but surely , even the common people are coming to perceive the difference between the university and the individual professors who form its staff .

		The time has not yet come , to be sure , when the people make distinctions of this same kind between the president of an institution and the institution itself .

		It is still wrongly understood that the words of a presi - dent must be words carrying with them the force and inffaence and authority of the university as a whole .

		Ten years from now in the West and
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, men will be able to make this additional distinction .

		But great has been the progress which has thus far obtained in the attitude of the public toward the individual pro- fessor . ''

		A professor may abuse his position by promul - gating crude ideas in a sensational way , by speaking authoritatively on matters outside of his own special department of work , or by as - suming a partisan attitude toward controverted subjects .

		But even then his position remains sacred .

		There are only two causes that justify a demand for the resignation of a professor in full university standing . ''

		His resignation will be demanded , and will be ac - cepted , when , in the opinion of those in authority , be has been guilty of immorality , or when for any reaao * he has proved himself to be incompetent to perform the aerrice called for . ''

		In view of the fact that the institution of which Dr.
Harper	PERSON	is the administrative head has been widely , although unjustly , accused of interfer - ing with the free expression of opinion , it is well that this emphatic disclaimer should be made .

		The recent transfer of the control of higher education from the clergy to the laity is an im - portant development , and invites the following comment : '' In the
Association of American Universities	ORGANIZATION	only one institution is under the administration of a clergy - man ; that one is the
Roman Catholic University	ORGANIZATION	at
Wkshington	LOCATION	, and is essentially a theological institution .

		Speoal attention was drawn to this fact in the address of Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	at the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	celebration .

		The signifi - eance of it is self-evident , and , when coupled with the fact that so small a number of college graduates in our universities now plan for the profession of preaching , the significance grows even more startling .

		Moreover , from no quarter , not even from the clergy , do we find criticism of this policy .

		It seems to meet with general favor and approval .

		Surely , if anywhere , the old regime would have continued in
Princeton	LOCATION	; but even at
Princeton	LOCATION	the new policy has been adopted .

		The fact is itself a commentary upon the function and place of higher edoeaUon in the public mind .

		It does not mean that our institutions of learning are any less religions cither in fact or in theory , for it may be confidently ■ Hiataioed that never , in the history of higher educa - titm , has the religious spirit prevailed more widely , or extended more deeply , than at present .

		It does not mean that questions of ethics or of philosophy occupy a leas prominent place than in former years .

		It does not mean that biblical instruction is now taking a seeondary place in comparison with that which it has hitherto oe - enpied ; for here again , as everyone knows , never before in the history of college education have biblical studies occupied the place in academic instruction which they hold to-day .

		But if it does not mean these things , what does it mean ?

		Simply that the work of education is itself a profession , separate and distinct from preaching .

		In truth , the position of the university president has become a unique position , a profession by itself ; one the demands of which are greater perhaps than those made upon any other profession .

		This new phase is a growth of the
last two decades	DATE	.

		What its future development will be no one can prophesy ; but it stands out to-day as distinct from the office of the clergy , on the one hand , as from that of the specialist in any department of science , on the other .

		The college president must be a specialist , and he must also be a generalist .

		Scholar - ship is expected of him ; at the same time , thorough business training .

		The capacity for desk work is de -
82	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, manded , and , besides , skill in public speaking ; and , above all , if not knowledge of all things , at least sym - pathy with all knowledge .

		The past year has made large contribution to the further differentiation of this new character in modern life . ''

		The closing section of this address is de - voted to a consideration of the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	and Rhodes foundations -- '' the two greatest single events in the history of higher education dur - ing ... the past ten years . ''

		Concerning the former of these gifts , after expressing the opin - ion that the '' gift to Scotch universities up to the present time has resulted in far greater injury than good to those institutions and to the cause of education in that country , '' Dr.
Harper	PERSON	goes on to say : '' The
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	fund has been established for re - search and ought to contribute largely to institutional cooperation ; but if , instead of encouraging the work of research and investigation as already established in our institutions of learning , it endeavors to detach such work from those institutions and to gather to itself the responsibility and the credit for such work ; if , instead of strengthening the work where it already exists , it un - dertakes to establish new fonndatious , independent of these institutions , in order that its own work may be more tangible , it will prove to be the greatest curse to higher education in this country instead of a blessing . ''

		With what is said of the
Rhodes	LOCATION	scholarship endowment we are compelled to take sharp issue .

		First of all we read : '' It the Rhodes scholarships are to be employed to detach from the American environment one hundred or more young men of special ability each year and trans - port them to foreign soil in order to imbue them with foreign ideas at an age when they are peculiarly impres - sionable ; if the purpose of this foundation is to draw all men to a recognition of the doctrine of imperialism as it is embodied in the British Empire , the execution of this trust may prove a curse instead of a blessing to those who avail themselves of its privileges . ''

		This is a piece of ad captandum reasoning which has the demagogic flavor of the news - paper editorial , and is quite unworthy of the president of a great university .

		We must take still more serious exception to what fol - lows .

		When the announcement of the
Rhodes	PERSON	bequest was made , we at once pointed out that our university leaders would probably attempt to influence a diversion of the fund from the object clearly in the mind of the giver .

		A number of subsequent utterances from univer - sity men have already realized our prediction , and to this number Dr.
Harper	PERSON	's suggestion must now be added .

		In saying that '' the form of the gift is sufficiently indefinite to make it possible to modify the original propo - sition and to permit these scholarships to be for graduate work rather thau for undergrad - uate work , '' he completely misrepresents the terms of the bequest .

		Both the letter and the spirit of the
Rhodes	PERSON	will make it perfectly clear that the founder had boys in mind -- public-school boys , and not graduate students of universities or even undergraduates .

		If the trustees , acting on the advice of American uni - versity men , should seek to evade or to nullify this carefully expressed purpose , they would be acting in bad faith so manifest that it could not be concealed by any sort of rhetorical juggling .

		The plea will not avail that the founder would have acted more wisely had he provided for a hundred American university students ; that is possibly true , but the plain fact is that he provided instead for a hundred boys from the high schools and academies of this country .

		We can not believe that the body of honorable and responsible men intrusted with the execution of these testamentary pro- visions will be persuaded to act as President
Harper	PERSON	suggests that they may act ; the case against such a course is too clear , and the declared purpose of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	too evident , to warrant us in entertaining this suggestion save as a danger against which the trustees must be on their guard .

		THE
ELECTIVE BOARD OF EDUCATION	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Educational Commission of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, in a recent report to the Mayor who created it , very truthfully and cogently said : '' The function of a board of education , acting under the authority of state law , is to represent the people in the establish - ment and maintenance of the public school system . ''

		The report further says that the method of select - ing the members of these boards has varied some - what under different conditions , but that a large majority of the members are elected by the people direct .

		And in a foot-note to its report , the Com - mission adds that in fully nine-tenths of the school districts of the
United States	LOCATION	the elective system will probably be continued .

		It is also stated in the same report that in the larger cities of this country thirteen out of twenty-three obtain their boards of education by means of an election by the people .

		Especial reference is made to the last statement , because the purpose and scope of this article are confined chiefly to boards of education in the larger cities , to those school boards whose members serve without pay and are not required or expected to give much time or energy to the details of school work .

		In a system which so vitally and directly concerns every family , and almost the entire population of the country , it seems unaccountable that the entire
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 88 adult population should not be allowed the right to an active and intimat-e participation in some of the forms of administration of the affairs of the public schools .

		Self-interest , the interest of the individual , is an exceedingly strong moving force .

		To say , as had been said by advocates of the appointive method of securing boards of education , that some of these interested people do not know enough to exercise the right of franchise intelligently and wisely is to say , in effect , that a representative form of govern - ment is a failure , and the intrinsic value of demo - cratic institutions is mainly mythical .

		The number of persons is not large that is quite ready to admit that .

		One of the most ptotent arguments in favor of the elective board of education is that such a board is removed from party politics , and is responsible directly to the people , which the apfwintive board is not ; and that it compels the people to take an active and -LRB- ultimately if not immediately -RRB- an intelli - gent interest in the public schools .

		Such a board is thoroughly democratic ; it comes from the people , to serve the -LRB- > eople , and is easily approached by all the patrons of the school .

		The appointive method , on the other hand , denies to the great mass of the adult population the right to an active participation in school affairs .

		If the cause of public education were a purely local or class matt `` r , it might be per - missible to have less than the entire municipality , in any other than a representative form of govern - ment , for its constituency .

		But the public school system is not intended for a part of the community , nor for a class or clique or party .

		It includes among its patrons and friends the entire community ; and .

		in our form of government , it is preeminently a democratic institution .

		Why , then , should it be argued that in the large cities , where the average of intelligence is probably as high as elsewhere , the management of the public schools should be with - drawn from the whole people and placed in the hands of one person , or of a few persons at most ?

		Why should parents and relatives and friends of the school children be denied the right of taking some interest in matters which so deeply and closely concern them and their futuref It is said that the functions of the board of edu - cation are twofold , -- executive and legislative ; and * that the executive function is one that must always be delegated .

		This is granted .

		But shall those most interested be denied the right to say how and by whom these functions shall be exercised ?

		Is it a sufficient answer to say that one man .

		-- the mayor , perhaps , who is usually an adept in political meth - ods , but too often a mere tyro in practical educa - tional methods .

		-- ■ knows better than the whole people who will best serve them on a board of edu - cation ?

		And is he likely to exercise his knowledge and enforce bis -LRB- political methods more honestly and unselfishly than the entire community would do ?

		In a case within the writer 's knowledge , where appointments were to be made on a board of edu - cation , the following were some of the arguments and influences used to obtain places on the govern - ing board : '' I desire to have Mr.
A.	PERSON	appointed from my own ward , '' said
John Smith	PERSON	, who had been instrumental in securing the enactment of the new school law ; '' he is a particular friend of mine , and a good Republican . ''

		He was appointed .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	asked to have Mr.
B.	PERSON	appointed from another ward . ''

		He has not , '' said he , '' the best educa - tional or moral qualifications for the place .

		In fact , he has been implicated in some shady transactions , which I do not like to talk about .

		But there is a money difference between Mr.
B.	PERSON	and myself , and if he gets this appointment the prestige which it will give him will make it possible for him to pajr me the balance coming to me . ''

		He too was ap - pointed .

		Mr.
C.	PERSON	was appointed from another ward , not , as was stated at the time , '' because he had any particular qualifications for the position , but the third political party must have at least one repre - sentative on the board , and this seems to be the only plaee left . ''

		Mr.
D.	PERSON	was not appointed from another ward because another applicant had a stronger '' pull '' with the appointing power .

		The * ' puU '' in this ease was said to have been that the successful party was a profitable client of the ap - pointing pMwer .

		It is difficult to conceive of a board of education being made up in a more reprehensible manner than has here been indicated .

		It is confidenUy asserted that the voting masses would never be guilty of motives so low , vicious , and unworthy , in easting about for persons to serve them as the school officers of a grO ' t city .

		The
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	, -- a committee of educational experts , who are doubtless honest and siaeere , but who are not believed to be very close to the masses , and who take what may be called the professional view of the qaestion , -- favor the ap - pointive board of education .

		They say .

		among other things : '' We are strongly of the opinion that in view of the well-known difficulty about securing the attendance of the most interested and intelligent electors at school elections , as well as because of the apparent impossibility of freeing school elections from political or municipal issues , the better man - ner of elections is by appointment . ''

		These objections are of questionable validity . ''

		The most interested electors '' would seem to be precisely the ones most likely to be present at school elections .

		Whether or not these electors are also '' intelligent '' may be a matter open for investigation .

		Undoubtedly , the majority of these '' interested electors '' can lay no claim to a college edoeation , but they have a tolerably fair under - standing of the theory and practical workings of a democratic form of government , and are '' in - telligent '' enough to be good citizens .

		Whether or not it is possible , or even desirable , to '' free school elections from political or municipal issues '' de - pends very largely on the circumstances and condi - tions surrounding each particular case .

		Unques - tionably , any '' manner of election '' is preferable 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, to appointments made aa has been indicated in another part of this article .

		In
St. Louis	LOCATION	, where there is an elective board of education , it is said that `` if the school board is appointed , the source of power is a political factor which will make itself felt in the election and nomi - nation of superintendents and echool oflBcers . ''

		Here is testimony which directly controverts the argu - ment of the
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	, by insisting that the politics of the situation finds its most pronounced exemplification in the appointive rather than in the elective plan .

		Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	,
United States Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sioner of Education , favors boards elected by the people , for the reason that such boards are more independent than those appointed by the mayor or by the courts .

		He is satisfied , in other words , that representation of the people is essential for cities as well as for states .

		In his bird 's - eye view of the
St. Louis	LOCATION	public school system , Dr.
Harris	PERSON	combats the position taken by the
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	in these words : '' A board elected by the people direct , for the special purpose of managing the schools , and vested with limited powers of taxation , is sure to look after school interests , at least to the extent of the popular demand in that direction , and is not liable to be diverted from the care of the schools so much as to sacrifice them to other municipal inter - ests . ''

		Certainly this is strong testimony from one of the leaders of educational thought in this country , one who has been intimately and prominently con - nected with the public school system for many years .

		The argument of the
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	seems to be directed against the elective system chiefly because of fear of the contaminating influence of the lowest and most reprehensible forms of `` prac - tical politics . ''

		But personal considerations and favoritism in the oflBcial selection of school boards are far more portentous .

		If the elective system has proper safeguards in its working details , there is little danger of harm to the cause of public educa - tion .

		These boards should be large enough to ap - portion the work to the different committees , and not make the individual burdens great ; each mem - ber should be a city officer , with no local or ward functions to perform ; nominations should be made independently of and without recognition from po - litical parties , by nomination papers ; both sexes should be allowed to vote and to hold school office ; one-third or one-half of the board should be voted for at a time , in order that the entire personnel of the board may not be changed suddenly .

		The school superintendent should be the servant of the board , and elected by it for a term of years .

		He should have much to say about purely professional and scientific work , -- the selection of text-books ; the examination , appointment , and promotion of teach - ers ; the construction of school buildings .

		But these functions of the superintendent should not be abso - lute .

		`` The court of last resort '' should be the board of education upon all questions .

		The public school system of this country is ad - mittedly among the greatest of its institutions .

		It has become such because it has been administered directly by the people .

		The time is not likely to come when the control of our public schools shall be withdrawn from the many and placed in the hands of a few .

		It is freely admitted that the ad - ministration of our public schools in large cities , like the government of our larger municipalities gener - ally , has not been wholly successful .

		Nevertheless , the relief must come , in both instances , primarily from the people themselves .

		And any attempt to withdraw self-government from the masses will , we confidently believe , not lessen but augment the dangers which threaten us .

		THE CASE `` NOT PROVEN . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The stand taken against the word '' proven '' by some of your correspondents is somewhat amusing .

		One of them says , '' The rhetorics are all against it . ''

		He might have added that most of the dictionaries and text-books on English grammar are against it ; but that does not warrant him in maintaining that the use of the word is '' a silly affectation of an unreal archaism . ''

		Good usage is not determined by makers of dictionaries and text - books ; it must be determined by our best writers , -- they are our higher courts of appeal .

		Professor
Carruth	PERSON	is right : '' The dictionary was made for man , and not man for the dictionary . ''

		The same is true with regard to text - books on grammar and rhetoric : we should make them servants for us , and not ourselves servants for them .

		Good usage in English is simply a matter of fashion .

		We follow , of course , certain general laws ; but these laws are flexible , and can be changed at any time that force , clearness , ease , or any other condition of our lan - guage , may require .

		To illustrate : the verbs reach and teach may , like othe ?

		weak verbs , form the past tense by adding either - ed or - t. Why do we say reached , and not teachedl or why taught , and not raughtf Children , and foreigners who do not speak our language fluently , , frequently use the form teached ; Chaucer used raught , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	sometimes used the same form .

		Raught is now out of fashion ; and teached is not yet fashion - able , and may never be .

		Since these verbs in the present tense are similar in form and pronunciation , there seems to be no logical reason why they should have different past tense forms .

		Your correspondents , who are dis - tressed about the growing tendency of our modern writers to use proven , may regard this irregularity in the tense forms of these two verbs as a '' perversion . ''

		But it is not a perversion ; it is perfectly natural -- as natural as any other fashion .

		Rule : In English we use certain forms and expressions because we use them ; we do not use certain other forms and expressions because we do not use them .

		Strong verbs in English , in accordance with a general
1902	DATE	. -RRB-

		THE DIAL 85 law , form the past t `` nse br a change in the vowel sound ; but the syllable - ed , - d , or - t , which is always added in the past tense of the weak verbs , is not added , and many of the verbs of this class take - en as the perfect participle ending .

		But this law , to < S , is flexible ; some of the verbs of this class take the weak forms in the past tense and perfect participle .

		Note the following : Pretera Pott Per/tet pariieipU .

		QeaTe -LRB- to split -RSB- cUtc or tian -LRB- elatt -RRB- dorcn -LRB- cleft -RRB- ■ bore -LRB- iheand -RRB- Bt0T `` -LRB- atsTSd -RRB- tliron -LRB- tkrirad -RRB- • hone -LRB- -LRB- hinsd -RRB- ifaiOTe -LRB- abrirad -RRB- etc , etc If our strong verbs become weak , we may expect our weak verbs to take forms analogous to those of the strong class .

		This , too , is perfectly natural .

		The strong perfect participle of the verb prove is also found , and should of course be included in this list .

		The form paxxn is rare .

		Milton uses it : ''
Bise	PERSON	, rise , uid heave tby rosy head From thy coral-povea bed . ''

		-- Camiu , L 886 .

		Foughten , a rare perfect participle form of the strong Teihjight , is used by
Tennyson	PERSON	whenever the metre or rhythm of his verse requires it : '' Then qoickly from tie/itfUm field he sent Ulfia ^ . ''

Boughlen	PERSON	has at present only a colloquial use ; but if it should become fashionable , -- that is , if our reputable writers should , by use of the word , find that they can add to their verse more emotional effect , or even more rhythmical effect , or can add to their prose more emo - tional effect , or even a mere mechanical means for attaining more force or ease , -- it should then have equal recognition with foughten .

		If this form should gain recognition in literature it would probably be re - garded by purists as a very '' distressing perversion , '' because we would then have a verb with a double ending for its perfect participle , - t for the weak and - en for the strong ending .

		But this would be no worse than many other double forms in our language .

		Note , for example , the double plural in cherubam , a form found in the
Bible	LOCATION	; or the double feminine ending in songstress , a word now in good use .

		Your correspondent quoted several sentences in which the form proven is used .

		The very fact that he found these examples in the '' current issue of one of our better magazines , '' in an '' editorial of what may , perhaps , be called our leading weekly , '' and in The Dial , ought to convince him that the word is not a '' distressing per - version . ''

		If he will investigate further he will probably find that it occurs frequently in much of our best modem literature , both prose and verse .

		I find the following in Tennvson : '' Ko boon is here But ioatice , ao thy aay hepm * '' true . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of
Thk Diai	ORGANIZATION	.

		. -RRB-

		The publication , by Prof.
Charles W. Kent	PERSON	, of the exercises connected with the unveiling of the bust of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	in the library of the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	throws much light upon the conduct of the poet while a student of that institution , and his reasons for leaving it .

		The records of the
University	ORGANIZATION	were scrutinized for entries bearing upon the charges against
Poe	PERSON	for which he is so strongly indicted in
Griswold	LOCATION	's memoir .

		The student days of the accused covered a period of ten months in the course of the second year -LRB-
1826	DATE	-RRB- of the
University	ORGANIZATION	's existence .

		Professor Kent reminds us of the turbulent and unrestrained character of university life in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's day , by saying that the atten - tion of the faculty was directed principally '' to discipliaing stndents guilty of the use of anient and vin - ous liqaors , or of gambling .

		There were open outbreaks as well as petsonal rebellion against ndes .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	seemed in imminent peril from within , becaose of the nnre - sbnuned wildness , rampant disrespect , and obstreperous con - duct of a body of immature young men , who mistook this new liberty for license . ''

		Further on , he says : ** At one of the numeroos trials conducted by the Faculty a entun witness deposed that there were not fifty students at the
University	ORGANIZATION	who did not play cards .

		With as much readiness and no less accuracy he might have affirmed that not fifty of the fathers of these students were free from the same vice .

		The sentiments against it in the Faculty could not have been unyielding , for in
1825	DATE	three out of seven of the members wished gambling removed from the infractions pun - ished seriously and transferred to the list of minor offences punishable by insignificant fines . ''

		After referring to the countless records of trials of students guilty of drunkenness and dissipated conduct , the writer adds : '' But in all these records we nowhere find any mention of the name of
Edgar Poe	PERSON	; and when a long list of students sum - moned to appear before the Albemarle grand jury was made out ,
Poe	PERSON	was not included , though many of his boon cotn - panions were .

		Poe was not .

		then , among the offenders known to university or civil law , but from the private testimony of his collet mates it is evident that he did sometimes play 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, Beven-np and loo , his favorite games ... His partner , after - wards a devout clergyman , and his adversaries , including frequently two friends who became respectively a well-known divine and a pious judge , were far better known to the Uni - versity sporting circle than was
Poe	PERSON	. ''

		The testimony of Mr.
Wertenbaker	PERSON	, the Librarian , seems conclusive as to
Poe	PERSON	's practice of gambling .

		In referring to a visit to
Poe	PERSON	's room , he is quoted as having said : '' On this occasion he spoke with regret of the large amount of money he had wasted and of the debts he had contracted during the session .

		If my memory is not at fault , he esti - mated his indebtedness at
$ 2,000	MONEY	, and , though they were gaming debts , he was earnest and emphatic in the declaration that be was bound by honor to pay at the earliest opportunity every cent of them . ''

		Alluding to this interview vrith the Librarian , Mr.
Kent	PERSON	declares : ''
Poe	PERSON	's confession to him contains the real reason why he never returned to the
University	ORGANIZATION	.


Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	was not expelled , nor dismissed , nor suspended , nor required to with - draw , nor forbidden to return , nor disciplined in any wise whatsoever , at the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	; but Mr.
Allan	PERSON	was shocked and incensed at the extent of his dishonorable ' debts of honor , ' -- which he at first refused to consider , but finally settled , -- and determined to put his extravagant foster-son in his counting-room . ''

		The purpose of the editor of this memorial of
Poe	PERSON	is not to gloss over the irregularities of his student life , but rather to show the real facts .

		It is , and must be , regarded as an official vindication of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	from the suspicion of having been summarily dealt with by the faculty of the institution which now treasures his name as one of the most illustrious that ever adorned ' * '' ' • ° `` 8 -

		THE TRANSMUTATIONS OF A WORD .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Over seventy years ago , upon migrating from Mass - achusetts to
Illinois	LOCATION	, I first encountered the strange and barbarous word Sockdolager .

		I soon learned that it meant the finishing blow in a flst-fight ; a severe stroke .

		Bartlett picked it up for his '' Dictionary of Americanisms , '' and told its origin .

		It is a ludicrous transposition of the vocal elements of the word Dox - ology .

		Some wag noticed that the singing of the Dox - ology dissolved the worshipping concourse , the purpose of the assembling being fulfilled ; if the purpose was a flght , the finishing blow dissolved the ring of specta - tors and abetters .

		He avoided the possible irreverence of a direct comparison of the different meetings by a comical metathesis of the sounds of d and s , as the Yankee farmer invoked the use of a stout needle upon the object of his wrath instead of pronouncing an eter - nal doom .

		Sockdolager answered the purpose as well as the more solemn word .

		Bartlett 's '' Americanisms '' and so-called '' Sketches of Western Life '' spread knowledge of the word , whose very barbarism made it as noticeable as an In - dian .

		A contributor to the ' • Atlantic Monthly '' of
March , 1893	DATE	-LRB- p. 425 -RRB- , picked up • ' socdollager '' and defined it .

		Some students of slang imagined a con - nection with the verb to slug , and turned it into '' slog - dollager . ''

		English `` Punch '' quite outdid American slangers in
1862	DATE	, when it invented '' slogdollagize '' !

		Someone , with what notion I can not see , made '' stock - dollager . ''

		As our American dictionaries admit slang when duly marked with the bar sinister , sockdolager i '' to be found in the '' Standard '' and in the ''
Interna	LOCATION	- tional . ''

		Entering
Illinois College	ORGANIZATION	in
1840	DATE	, I found the word further transformed .

		The first syllable only was used in our game of `` bull-pen , '' called also `` sock-ball . ''

		Four players , among whom a ball was passed from hand to hand , stood at the corners of a square of about fifty feet ; inside the square four other players danced about , who must dodge the swift balls sent at them by the players on the corners when these thought that they could score a hit .

		The phrases `` sock him '' and '' sock it to him '' were used .

		In this form the word reached
England	LOCATION	, -- for the English keep up with American slang .

		It appears in ''
Hotten	PERSON	's
Slang Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary '' of
1860	DATE	.

		Stormonth -LRB- 1885 -RRB- defines '' Sock , in slang , to knock a man 's hat over his eyes and nose by a smart blow '' ; and for this he gives a derivation from the Gaelic .


Bartlett	PERSON	-LRB- edition of
1859	DATE	-RRB- finds thi & use of the word local in
America	LOCATION	, and in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	only .

		But now our western Americanism meets a real En - glish word of like meaning .

		Halliwell finds in western
England	LOCATION	the word sog , a blow ; and ``
Wright	PERSON	's Pro- vincial Dictionary '' gives sock as a Berkshire word meaning to strike a hard blow .

		Here is the singular concurrence in signification of a curtailed western wag - gery , -- sockdolager shortened to sack , with an English provincialism .

		If newspaperdom can confer respectability , sack may hold up its head ; for a headline in a great
Chicago	LOCATION	daily introduced an extract from
Governor Williams	ORGANIZATION	's message to the legislature of
Indiana	LOCATION	thus : '' How he socked it to the
Indiana	LOCATION	Legislature . ''

		In an article in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' for
June	DATE	of this year , in discussing a style of newspaper editorials which the critic calls '' editorialene , '' he names what he deems a favorite occupation of certain writers of that stuff , saying '' It < socks it to the satraps ' at a safe distance . ''

		The history of the word does not end here .

		From the tendency of people , especially of the illiterate , to substitute a familiar word for a similar unfamiliar one , sack was changed to soak .

		I do not remember this until after
1870	DATE	; it must by that time have gained sufficient currency to attract my attention to it as no longer an idiotism , but an addition to our stock of slang .

		And now it becomes allied with other meanings of soak .

		A thing is soaked to prepare it for further use , or so that it may be not stiff but pliant and fit for use ; so we hear that '' A. has it in soak for B. '' Perhaps here is an indistinct consciousness of the English proverbial say - ing , '' to have a rod in pickle . ''

		But people of the class that uses this slang are far more likely to have in mind the other use of soak , and to mean that the grudge is like a thing in the pawnshop .

		All the former uses of sock now are found with the later slang .

		We hear '' He soaks him with a hard ball , '' or '' Let 'em soak it to him . ''

		Probably some new forms will
spring	DATE	from this development , as side - shoots sprout on a willow .

		I shall not be surprised if in a few years I shall discover that '' au old soaker '' is not a sot ruined by alcohol , but a hard hitter with fists ; the epithet '' old '' referring not to age , but to eminence in degree , as '' a high old time '' may be only a debauch begun twelve hours before .

		Such is the story of the changes of one word in the life-time of one man .

		* So far as material goes , nothing was easier than for Mr.
E. Burton Holmes	PERSON	to transmute himself from the lectare platform into author - ship .

		His pictures had been provided for the illustration of his lectures , and his lectures had been reduced to writing from the first .

		The combination of the two into seemly toI - ames became chiefly a matter of mechanics .

		But it is not so easy to take up the respon - sibilities of authorship and carry them to a successful issue .

		It has become a generally accepted belief among critics that stories which sound well in the telling often sound ill in the reading ; and the reverse is quite as true .

		Sub - tract the personality of the speaker from many a man famous in the pulpit or on the rostrum , and his ringing periods appear in cold print as vacnons , jejune , and incoherent .

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's very success before large audiences in every part of the
United States	LOCATION	made this danger a real one in his case .

		But it is a danger that may be dismissed .

		As the extracts presently to be given from his printed books will attest , he has a clear and forceful if somewhat ornate style ; his writing everywhere is informed by a keen sense of the beauties of art and nature , and of the poetry in the universe ; and his keen powers of obser - vation and comparison supplement a soond intellectual training in enabhng him to bring before his readers , as before his auditors , the beauties and fascinations of the scenes he has chosen for celebration from travels in many and far countries .

		In effecting this result , the photographs taken by himself or under his immediate supervision in almost every instance play an intimate and important part , connect - ing themselves with the subject-matter in a way seldom attained in any book .

		Each of the ten volumes which are to form Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's completed work contains about four hundred pages and as many reproduced photographs .

		In each are three lectures , on countries geographically related , a fine colored plate serving as the frontispiece for every lec - tare .

		The first volume deals with the northern coast of

		tropolis of the Moors , '' and '' Through the Heart of the Moorish Empire , '' respectively .

		Here , as throughout the work , may be found displayed a keen sense of humor , never coarse , never indiscriminate , but interpreting the dif - ferences of the foreigner in a manner hardly possible otherwise .

		The following anecdote is illustrative : '' Here we may recall the story of the English clergy - man , who , touched at the sight of all this misery and ignorance , resolved to tell the gospel-story to the peo - ple of
Tangier	LOCATION	-- to make a pnblic exhortation in the market place .

		With the greatest difficulty he secnred a capable interpreter , for most of the hotel guides feared to assist him in his rash and dangerous crusade .

		When the pious preacher began bis sermon in the marketplace , be was not only surprised , but thoroughly delighted at the reverence with which his glowing words , translated by his guide , were received by the attentive throng of Moslems .

		When he had finished , be was even urged to speak again .

		Undoubtedly the good man carried away a soul filled with joy because of the good seed he had planted here .

		One English newspaper chronicled the marked interest shown by the heathen in the words of Christian truth ; but it is to be hoped that the good man will never learn that while he stood in the centre of this meeting-place and spoke , his diplomatic inter - preter and guide not only held the respectful ears of the crowd , but possibly saved the missionary 's life by cleverly turning the orthodox sermon into one of the favorite romances from the ' Arabian Nights .

		* '' When in
Fez	LOCATION	it was Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's privilege to attend a dinner given by the Moorish Secre - tary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, '' one of the highest and by a curious coincidence one of the richest dignitaries in
Morocco	LOCATION	, '' as he observes .

		This is what happened , after the party was seated at the table -- a concession to prejudices against squatting on the floor : '' There appeared a huge round platter , three feet in diameter , on which had been erected a pyramid of chickens .

		To each of us an entire bird was given .

		Then our host , with deft fingers , tore bis portion very neatly into shreds , picked out the choicest morsels of the chicken and passed them to us .

		Then followed pyramids of pigeons , then huge chunks of mutton , then sausages on spits ; and that these sausages were not less than two inches thick and one foot long I am positively certain , because we each were compelled to take a whole one , and I remember my vain efforts to get it all upon m V plate , three inches of protruding sausage threatening the table-cloth on each side .

		And every course was carved by our host , who used nothing sharper than his finoremails , and every time he came upon a morsel of especial daintiness , he courteously offered it to one of us .

		We were almost stuffed to death , for the consul warned us that to refuse the proffered tidbits would be a great affront .

		There were no sauces , no vegetables , nothing but meats roasted underground by slow fires that had burned all night .

		We had nothing with which to wash down this ' all too solid ' food except sickly lukewarm rosewater .

		And not content with stuffing us and forcing us to drink that perfumed Uquid , our host would every now and then give a signal , whereupon the 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, servants would spray rosewater down our backs and in our ears .

		Never was anything more welcome than the tiny cups of Turkish coffee that at last were brought to ead our torture . ''

		The second volume is concerned with
Paris	LOCATION	entirely , -- one of the lectures with the city in general , and two with the Exposition of
1900	DATE	.

		The third volume deals first with the Olympian games in
April , 1896	DATE	.

		More re - mindful and interesting souvenirs of these events could hardly be devised .

		The third volume , in addition to the Olympian games -LRB- the third modern Olympiad is to be celebrated in
Chi	LOCATION	- cago in
1904	DATE	-RRB- contains an account of numerous ramblings through
Greece	LOCATION	andThessaly , taking the reader to most of the spots famous in clas - sical times .

		The fourth volume returns at first to the northern coast of
Africa	LOCATION	, treating of
Algiers	LOCATION	and other cities of the
Barbary States	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	falls into an error in his dates when he speaks of the suppression of piracy as not taking place '' until the then young American republic , emerging victorious from the War of
1812	DATE	, had expended a little of her surplus energy in chastising the high sea robbers . ''

		Wandering afield among the Ka - byles , we can sympathize with Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	in the following : '' Imagine my surprise upon being accosted in one of these villages by a smiling
Kabyle	LOCATION	, who exclaimed with a distinctly American accent , ` Ah there , mister !

		I saw you on the Midway . '

		The speaker has spent six months in
Chicago	LOCATION	selling
Kabyle	LOCATION	jewelry at the World 's Fair . ''

		The succeeding lecture , on the '' Oases of the Algerian Desert , '' deals with the Roman ruins of Timgad , the ancient Thamugas , and with the unexpectedly pleasant city of
Biskra	LOCATION	, proving to the American man of the cities that the comforts of home were sometimes nearer than he thought , as in this instance : '' When weary of dreaming in the garden , we may take a spin in the horse-ear of
Biskra	LOCATION	, for this unique oasis is not without its progressive institutions .

		But the rails are very badly laid , and every few hundred yards there comes a lurch , followed by the suggestion of an earthquake , whereupon the French conductor po - litely requests the passengers to assist in replacing the car upon the rails .

		Thus a street-car ride , which with ns is a passive enjoyment , becomes to the Biskran an excellent form of training for both nerve and muscle . ''

		On this ride appears an amusing illustration of the same instincts that lead the man of civili - zation in
America	LOCATION	to buy fish to take home from an expedition near some stream , making the needful variations for a changre of skies . ''

		Having passed the limits of the oasis , we behold close to the track upon a hillock a sight which makes our blood run cold -- a gigantic lion , crouching as if about to spring .

		My friend feels for his revolver ; I look despairingly at the distant palm-trees ; the other passengers sit motionless , their faces expressive only of calm interest .

		We begin to doubt the excitability of the French .

		The car is brought to a standstill .

		With a painfully deliberate slowness a man in hunting costume takes a gun from beneath the seat .

		This reassures us ; but why does he not make haste to shoot ?

		Why does he wait for that fool of a photographer who is setting up his tripod in the face of such a danger ?

		In wonder we await the denouement .

		The man draws near with superhuman coolness ; the huge beast , daunted , bows his head .

		The hunter stands over him in an attitude of victory .

		The photographic artist -- a veritable hero -- then secures proofs of the courage of the lion-tamer .

		And then at last the truth breaks in upon us as two poor Arabs appear , calmly tie a rope around the lion 's neck , and serenely lead away the desert king .

		The poor old beast is blind and tame and harmless .

		His keepers make a living by renting him to amateur pho - tographers or to ambitious sportsmen desirous of send - ing home convincing ' proofs ' of their prowess . ''

		The last of the three lectures in this fourth volume has to do with southern
Spain	LOCATION	, and the inevitable bull-fight .

		Here there is a wholly unexpected conclusion ; for when Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	came from the arena and saw the horses -- seventeen in number -- that were lying dead as the result of a Spanish holiday , '' What do they do with all these bodies ? ''

		he asked of a boy standing by , and was promptly told , in Spanish , '' Oh , they make sausages and ship them to
America	LOCATION	. ''

		And there was a pretty neat adaptation of an old phrase by a gypsy boy who replied to Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's statement that he was going to
Paris	LOCATION	-- '' O
Paris	LOCATION	!

		el ultimo suspiro del Americano '' -LRB- the last sigh of the American -RRB- .

		The fifth volume takes up the two archipel - agoes in the
Pacific	LOCATION	which have fallen under the American flag .

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	is not in the least concerned with the political or economical as - pects of
Hawaii	LOCATION	or the
Philippines	LOCATION	, -- indeed , he could not very well be , -- but there are many questions quite unanswered in his lec - tures .

		These chapters are divided from one another by an intermediate discourse on '' The Edge of

Bacoor Bay	LOCATION	, while lying in quarantine in the harbor of
Manila	LOCATION	.

		The Filipino patriots were still in possession of the entire archipelago , with the exception of the capital city , -- and they would doubtless have had that , if
Dewey	LOCATION	had not prevented them from driving
Spain	LOCATION	out of its last foot - hold in the group .

		Naturally , when he went ashore he associated with the Americans of the `` ity , and these were almost all army officers .

		Some Americans are becoming dimly aware of the fact that the army and navy of any country are as favorable to war , professionally , as the lawyer is to clients , the physician to patients , or the priest to penitents .

		They were not questioning the liberation of the Filipino na - tion by the simple process of shooting all of its members who believed that the '' consent of the governed '' was in some way essential to government by Americans .

		Nor does Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	question it ; nor can he be blamed greatly , depending upon public favor as he does , if he goes a little out of his way to attest his sympathy with our
Army of Liberation	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a certain smugness in the following , however , which is not wholly pleasant : '' It is not mv province to discuss the iafiaence for good or evil of these Spanish friars in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Their rale is ended , and the church , at last awake to their shortcomings in the past , will , without doubt , ander the guidance of American Catholics , transform the institutions which the friars have founded and fos - tered in
the Philippines	LOCATION	into agencies for future good . ''

		There is no hint here , as there is none in the usual American newspaper of to-day , that the government of the
United States	LOCATION	has adopted in the most solemn manner , by the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	, the friars as her own , and stands pledged before the world to place them not only in full possession of all their temporal rights and properties , but to secure them in the full performance of all their spiritual functions , -- one of the several untoward re - sults of the refusal to permit any native Fil - ipino to have a voice in the provisions of this Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	, when we paid 120,000.000 for 9,000,000 of him .

		If what Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	savs is true .

		-- and there is not the slightest proof of it , up to this moment , -- America has been as shamefully remiss in carrying out its treaty obligations as she has been in securing human rights to the native population .

		The position of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, meanwhile , is impreg - nable ; and the only possible attitude of the American government toward the
Papacy	LOCATION	is one of abject pleading to be released from the effect of the treaty it deliberately entered into with its eyes wilfully shut .

		Some of the `` new diplomacy '' seems more lurid than effulgent .

		In the last volume published , the sixth , Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	gets back to safe ground once more , -- that of his own country .

		He calls the volume , aptly enough , the '' American Wonderland , '' and therein informs us of the Yellowstone Park , the Grand Canon of the
Colorado	LOCATION	, and the
Snake Dance	ORGANIZATION	of the Moki Indians .

		The na - tional reservation , fifty-five by sixty-five miles in extent , which takes in the geysers , lakes , forests , and rivers of the Yellowstone region , is a severe test of anyone 's powers of description , but its difficulties are not to be compared with those attendant on giving the outer world some adequate notion of what the
Grand Canon	LOCATION	of
Arizona	LOCATION	really is to the bystander .

		At the beginning of this arduous undertaking , none the easier for being self-imposed , Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	confesses his own failure , as well as the failure of his photographic apparatus , to delineate the singular majesty of this greatest of natural ex - hibitions .

		He makes his meaning clear enough , however , when he writes : ■ ■ I believe that when we behold that scene for the first time , a series of new biun-oells are -LSB- tte -RSB- generated , and until they have become sufficientlj developed , the ea & on withholds its message .

		In the average mind there is no place for an impression so unlike anv before re - ceived .

		At first sight the mentality is dazzled .

		He who looks but once sees not the canon .

		He who would know its glory most first prepare the tablets of his mind , -- erase all preconceived images , and then witii reverence approach the brink , and sitting there day after day teach his blind eyes and blinder sense to read through the medium of feeling the exalted message which this supremest of earthly scenes imprints upon the soul . ''

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	wisely avails himself of the lan - guage of Captain
Clarence Edward Dutton	PERSON	, soldier and geologist , when he says : '' ' It is useless to select special points of contempla - tion .

		The instant the attention lays hold of them it is drawn to something else , and if it seeks to recur to them it can not find them .

		Everything is superlative , trans - cending the power of intelligence to comprehend it .

		There is no central point around which the other ele - ments are grouped and to which they are tributary .

		The grandest objects are naerged in a congregation of others equally grand .

		If any one of these stupendous creations had been placed upon the plains of eentral
Europe	LOCATION	, it would have influenced modem art as pro- foundly as
Fujiyama	ORGANIZATION	has influenced the decorative art of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Yet here are hundreds of them swallowed up in the confusion of multitude . ' ''

		Yet it is not too much to say , these apolo - gies having been duly made , that this lecture 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, does succeed , with its word-painting and pho - tographic views , in really awakening in the student a conception of what it is that the canon is to mean to him when gazed on with living eyes and without artificial aids to appre - hension .

		No single sentence , nor paragraph , nor page , nor illustration , can be taken as typical of the means adopted to secure this admirable and praiseworthy result , but the article as a whole does go far toward its suc - cessful accomplishment .

		The last lecture comes , after this , as some - thing of an anti-climax , though it is well told , and does not in any particular exceed Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's really remarkable and evidently growing powers of description .

		It may be hoped , for all that , that at some future day another visit will be paid the
Grand Canon	ORGANIZATION	, and another attempt made to master its won - ders and glories with riper powers and more accustomed hand .

		And the wish may also be expressed that an index of the entire work will be inserted at the close of the final volume , making it as serviceable for future reference as it is for present enjoyment while one is turning its attractive pages .

		`` The Idbal .

		Roman Senator . ''

		* It is a far cry from the formerly accepted view of the Emperor Tiberius to that of Mr.
J. C. Tarver	PERSON	, who can even find in him `` the ideal Roman Senator . ''

		His reign has been very generally held in the past as a notable example of the evils possible to a degenerate despotism .

		According to Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	, the world has seen few rulers comparable to this same Tiberius in all the qualities which secure justice and peace and prosperity to the governed and deserve to be rewarded with affection and respect for the governor .

		It is known to most people , though Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	reveals little if any knowledge in that direction , that the extremely unfavorable view has long since challenged seriously inju - rious criticism .

		Dr.
Sievers	PERSON	and
Adolf Stahr	PERSON	, in
Germany	LOCATION	, plead strongly for a more favor - able view about half a century ago .

		Others , in
Germany	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, have wrought effectively in the same line , including
Furneaux	PERSON	, the
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	editor of
Taci	PERSON	- tus , and the late Professor
William F. Allen	PERSON	, whose edition of the first six books of the An - nals is more generally used than any other .

		But just as the soundest scholarship has al - ready rejected many of the worst features of the old portrait as unhistorical , so it will surely reject the little less than saintly figure which comes to it under the name of Tiberius from the pencil of Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	.

		If one may reason back from results to probable methods , it might seem that Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	began by building up an ideal
Tiberius	PERSON	upon the foundations laid in the eulogy by Velleius Paterculus .

		Afterward , one might imagine , he discovered with indignation that one
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	, regarded by many as an his - torian of some power , had taken a view of the subject in many respects radically different .

		Tacitus is therefore relegated to the position of a malignant pamphleteer , utterly incompetent to write history , powerful only to obscure the truth by the diabolical ingenuity of his master - fully deceptive rhetoric .

		The wickedness of his assault on the good , the merciful , the wise Ti - berius , is enhanced by the fact that it was not really
Tiberius	PERSON	whom he was after ,
Domitian	PERSON	being the inferential goal of his bitterness .

		When Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	finds something in Tacitus peculiarly damaging to Tiberius if true , his mind seems automatically to go through some such logical process as this : '' Tacitus may have found this in the Memoirs of the younger
Agrippina	LOCATION	; therefore he must have found it there , and therefore he did find it there .

		Now Agrippina would naturally have lied about Ti - berius in any case ; therefore she probably lied about him in all cases , and we may conclude with certainty that she did lie about him in this particular case . ''

		The result of such an attitude of mind toward the chief Roman au - thority for the reign of Tiberius is a book which can not be seriously regarded as an im - portant contribution to Roman history .

		If Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	had taken pains to give
Taci	PERSON	- tus a careful and unbiassed reading before taking up his own pen , he would have written a different book .

		The unjust severity of the condemnation visited upon Tiberius by gener - ations past was based not so much upon what Tacitus really says as upon the carelessness with which
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	was read and interpreted .

		The rehabilitation of the Emperor 's character , so far as a truthful rehabilitation is possible , depends almost entirely upon the Annals of Tacitus ; and the work will be done most ef - fectively by one who goes to the text unblinded by the presupposition of devilish malignity in an author who , with all his strong feeling as to the right or wrong of the transactions re - corded , tried always to be fair .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 91 Students of far better temper and higher qualifications than are displayed by Mr. Tar - ver have found in the life and character of Tiberius a problem incapable of any entirely satisfactory solution .

		It is plain enough that Tacitus himself , with a much larger fund of evidence than is accessible to modern investi - gators , found it a point of great difficulty .

		To hold with Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	that the supposed reign of terror which characterized his later years is a pure myth , based upon the slanders of dis - appointed members of the imperial household and
Koman	PERSON	nobles embittered because he had wrested from them the privilege of plundering the Provinces , is to hold against inherent prob - ability as well as positive evidence .

		The cloud overhanging those last years will not clear away , and the real problem is to reconcile it with equally certain facts as to the long years preceding .

		Tacitus admits -- or , rather , positively states -- that
Tiberius	PERSON	led a life without reproach , according to the standards of the time , up to a point when radical changes of character for the worse are extremely rare .

		We say '' according to the standards of the time , '' that no one may unconsciously follow Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	in the assumption that what we are told of Tiberius warrants us in crediting him with the highest modern standards of spotless purity , up to the approach of old age .

		Any tribute to masculine character in the period in question would have to be very emphatic and very specific to warrant such interpretation .

		After
Tiberius	PERSON	reached the throne , Tacitus finds signs of deflection from his former stand - ards , a hateful cruelty becoming prominent during the career of Sejanus , and cruelty and lust together dominating the years which re - mained after Sejanus had fallen .

		Tacitus can account for this puzzling transformation in an old man only on the theory that the virtue of the former years was a mere veneering , as - sumed for the sake of policy , and that the catas - trophe at the close was but the breaking out of natural instincts always present though so long and so successfully restrained .

		We have already said that Tacitus himself seems aware of the difficulty of such an ex - planation .

		The careful student of to-day feels it still more , but he feels no less the difficulty of the assumption than a man of so high a level of character and attainment as Tiberius appears to have maintained could in his old age have fallen into the position of a cruel reprobate .

		The best suggestion yet made is that which finds the explanation in the taint of insanity present in the
Clandian	PERSON	family .

		A cold , suspicious nature , thrown off its mental balance , could easily reach any depth of cru - elty , and all the more so when in possession of irresponsible power .

		And with the same lack of a well-balanced mental restraint , a serious perversion of the sexual instincts , even in old age , is not so far out of the range of human probability as in itself to discredit evi - dence otherwise apparently reliable .

		Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	writes with a strong bias in favor of a genuinely monarchical government .

		In his view ,
Tiberius	PERSON	made about his only serious mistake in attempting to emancipate the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	from his own control -LRB- an attempt , by the way , which Tiberius never really made at all -RRB- .

		A congress or parliament is to him merely a '' debating society , '' absurd as a gov - erning body and useful only as it becomes a puppet in the hands of some managing power .

		He is incapable of realizing that anything of real value was lost when
Rome	LOCATION	passed into the hands of a single ruler .

		In all this he simply carries certain present tendencies of thought to the extreme , and may do some good in the way of stimulating a needed reaction against the tendencies themselves .

		`` The Rexding of ``

		* A portion of Mr.
Granville Hall	PERSON	's history of '' The Rending of
Virginia	LOCATION	'' is serviceable , inasmuch as it preserves official papers neces - sary to a judicial treatment of its subject ; but the book itself is far from being written in a judicial manner .

		The strong anti-slavery and anti state-rights sentiments of the author color the whole treatment .

		The terms '' Rebellion '' and '' Conspiracy '' are met with passim , and the State of
Virginia	LOCATION	is not even given credit for logical sincerity in her advocacy of secession , the whole matter being treated as but an illegal pro-slavery movement .

		It is too late in the day for such a one-sided treatment of secession , and even impartial Northern critics are coming to admit as much .

		But the chief burden of this large volume of over 600 pages is an effort to show that the formation of the
State of West Virginia	LOCATION	was justifiable and constitutionally legal .

		`` 2 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, was passed by a vote of 23 to 17 in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and 96 to 55 in the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		When it reached the President , he requested the opinions of his cabinet officers , and the cabinet was equally divided , -- Messrs.
Seward	PERSON	, Chase , and
Stanton	PERSON	holding that the act was constitutional ;
Messrs. Welles	PERSON	,
Blair	PERSON	, and
Bates	PERSON	, that it was unconstitutional in that the State of
Virginia	LOCATION	had never given her consent to the division .

		A brief quotation from the opinion of Attorney-General
Bates	PERSON	must suf - fice .

		He says -LRB- p. 494 -RRB- : '' The act of consent is less in the nature of a law than of a contract .

		It is a grant of power ; an agree - ment to be divided .

		And who made the agreement ?

		The representatives of the forty-eight counties with themselves .

		Is that fair dealing ?

		Is that honest leg - islation ?

		Is that a legitimate use of a constitutional power by the legislature of
Virginia	LOCATION	?

		It seems to me that it is a mere abuse , nothing less than an attempted secession , hardly valid under the flimsy forms of law . ''

		The cabinet being thus evenly divided , the President had to decide for himself , after all ; and his opinion is simply a case of special plead - ing , through which any constitutional lawyer could `` drive a coach and four . ''

		Mr.
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	, in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' took the bull by the horns . ''

		He said -LRB- p. 478 -RRB- that he '' was not deluded by the idea that we are admitting this
State	ORGANIZATION	in pursuance of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	. '' ''

		It was a ' mockery ' to say that the Legislature of
Virginia	LOCATION	had con - sented . ''

		He held , therefore , '' that the State of
Virginia	LOCATION	had never given its consent ; but this might admit
West Virginia	LOCATION	, not by virtue of any provision of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, but under one absolute power which the laws of war give us in the circum - stances in which we are placed . ''

		He should `` vote for the bill on that theory , and that alone . ''

		This theory is at least intelligible , and less specious than seeking constitutional argu - ments for an unconstitutional act .

		We have no space to notice the seizure vi et armies of the counties of Berkley and
Jeffer	PERSON	- son , for which there was not even the pretended consent of the few counties assumed to form the
State	ORGANIZATION	of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		The formation of the
State of West Virginia	LOCATION	was a CaBsarean operation , not a natural birth , and can only be defended by the excuse , as Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	held , of the '' war power '' -- that convenient excuse for many other questionable acts .

		A very different view of '' The Dismembership of
Virginia	LOCATION	'' will be found in an article with this title , written by Mr.
William Baird	PERSON	, of Essex county ,
Virginia	LOCATION	, originally printed in the '' Publications of the
Southern Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-

		The work may serve as memoires pour sev ` oir , but it is far from being such a '' History '' as one might expect from a participator in the events recorded .

		A more judicial temper is needed , for history does not let itself be written from a partisan point of view .

		The lack of an index interferes very much with the use of the volume .

		Xo book of a generation ago has weathered these years as have the two books of
Whitney	LOCATION	; they can even now confidently be placed in the hands of students .

		But , essentially sound as they are , they are not of to-day .

		Professor
Oertel	PERSON	's book is .

		In fact , it is everywhere peeping into the to-morrow of the science .

		The latest investi - gations and the present state of controversies are duly registered .

		In other words .

		Profes - sor Oertel is writing for the serious student of his science , the future bearers of its doctrines .

		Herein lies the strength and the comparative weakness of his book .

		It will have no such wide appeal as Professor
Whitney	PERSON	's lyceum statements , and its very timeliness bears within it the stigmata of early eld .

		However , these are the accidents of the book .

		Its style is clear , its method logical , its subject-matter full and weighty , its vision wide and distinct .

		It is an admirable book of authoritative instruction , and as such will commend itself to an increas - ing body of students including many who are not , and do not care to be , specialists .

		Of the five lectures , the first , '' Historical Introduc - tion , '' and the last . ''

		Semantic Changes . ''

		hold unchallenged possession of the field , so far as any discussions in the English language are concerned .

		But the book as a whole , even by the side of
Paul	PERSON	's '' Prinzipien , '' von Gabelentz 's '' Sprachwissenschaft , '' the two recent books by Sweet , and -LRB- to be catholic in our summary -RRB- the philosophical discussion by Wundt , has quite independent value .

		``
India	LOCATION	.

		Old and New , '' by Professor
E. Washburn Hopkins	PERSON	, consists of a series of essays and addresses of a more popular char - acter .

		Its scope is wide , and shows again how varied the answer may be to the question , '' What can
India	LOCATION	teach us ? ''

		Whether we deal with origins or with present-day problems , with literature , philosophy , religion , or poli - tics ,
India	LOCATION	has some message for us , some prac ^ tical hint , touched usually with a poetic charm , which appeals to both reasou and imagination .

		The first three essays , -- '' The
Rig Yeda	PERSON	, '' `` The Early Lyric Poetry of
India	LOCATION	, '' and '' Sanskrit Epic Poetry , ' '' -- deal with the lit - erary phases of old
India	LOCATION	in a manner that combines scholarly disquisition with popular illustration and summarizing .

		`` A Study of Gods '' illustrates how the far past is still living in
India	LOCATION	to-day . ''

		Christ in
India	LOCATION	'' is a closely reasoned reply to the theory that Christianity is borrowed from Buddhism , a fine piece of scholarly writing that is not an example `` of the style in which grave historical subjects are treated by certain debaters , whose object does not seem to be to arrive at truth , but only to convince others . ''

		The ensuing chapters , on `` Ancient and Modern Hindu Guilds , '' * • Land - Tenure in
India	LOCATION	, '' '' The Cause and Care of Famine , '' and '' The Plague , '' fix our attention more and more upon the living and throbbing question of modern
India	LOCATION	.

		The volume , to which is prefixed a memorial address in honor of Professor
Salisbury	PERSON	, closes with an epilogue , or rather peroration , upon new
India	LOCATION	, from which we quote : `` For , thanks to
England	LOCATION	, there is a
New India	LOCATION	, no loDger enslared but free , no longer blinded but en - lightened , not perfect but striring for perfection , weak but great , potentially strong , awaking to-day to the fnll consciousness of a glorious past and the posubility of a still more glorious future .

		Old
India	LOCATION	endured and dreamed of God .

		Her bastards revile and dream of themselves .

		Bnt
New India	LOCATION	thinks , her dream is of the future .

		And what is this noble dream ?

		She dreams not of independence , bnt of political equality based on moral likeness .

		She seeks to prove that in fiscal and judicial administration all native officials can , without Europeaa supervision , be as incormptible as are British officiala , claiming that to proved ability and integrity is due a recognition of the Indian 's right to share in the gov - ernment of the Indian 's country .

		So may her dream be aocomplisbed , and may
England	LOCATION	, even at some seem - ing cost , be ready to meet her halfway , proving in her turn , and before it is too late , that she eaiea leas for revenne than for righteoaww , '' One misses in the book the eloquence of the late
Max Miiller	PERSON	, but the sobriety of tone inspires confidence in the writer 's solidity and authority , and the book is throughout readable . ''

		The Great Epic of
India	LOCATION	, '' by the same author , is a rather voluminous special investi - gation .

		It embraces a minute analvsis of the
Mababharata	LOCATION	, its contents and metres , and thus arrives at a tenable view of the origin and constitution of the epic .

		The general student will be interested in the summaristic statement that '' there is no ' date of the epic ' which will cover aU its parts -LRB- though hand-book makers may safely assign it in general to the second century B.C. -RRB- . ''

		Professor
E. P. Morris	PERSON	's book `` On
Prin	PERSON	- ciples and Methods in Syntax '' is also a special study , but one that may well detain us somewhat longer .

		For the book is written with special reference to
Latin	LOCATION	; and most of us who teach language , or deal with it seriously , derive our syntactic organum , for better or worse , from our study of Latin .

		Professor
Morris	PERSON	has gone resolutely to work to clear away the prepossessions that have robbed 94 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
August 16	DATE	, studies in syntax of the fullest results .

		A first reading leaves one with a tinge of pes - simism .

		But closer reading , and a little after - thought , shows that the book is even keener and surer in its suggestions and directions than in its criticism .

		The net result is a body of working principles that can not but lead to productive work .

		Of his main contention the author has given a brief summary in a para - graph contributed to Professor
Oertel	PERSON	's book . ''

		It may be laid down as a general rule that the sig - nificance of every concrete case form , mode form , or tense form depends to a considerable degree on their setting and on the meaning of the word to which case , mode , or tense endings have been added .

		So that it is really incorrect to speak of the meaning of the ablative ending -LRB- e. g. , - o -RRB- or of the subjunctive ending -LRB- e. g. , - am -RRB- , as if all the meaning rested upon them .

		We ought to speak of the meaning of the ablative ending - o with such and such nouns , and of the subjunctive ending - am of such and such verbs .

		Even the person , in the latter case , would be an important semantic element . ''

		The chapter on parataxis likewise merits spe - cial attention .

		The investigator must hence - forth reckon with Professor
Morris	PERSON	's theses ; the student will find the book suggestive and stimulating ; but oh , if only some of those pedagogues would read it , with whom section - numbers in
Harkness	LOCATION	, or
Allen	PERSON	and
Green	ORGANIZATION	- ough , have ceased to be references and have become obsessions !

		It is curious to note how the cry of method reechoes through these four volumes .

		But it is a cry for correct and fruitful methods , or such at least as command consideration .

		Allin all , the volumes fittingly hold a place in the secu - lar series in which they are included .

		They appeal to the senate of scholarship and to the referendum of thought ; they reflect the spirit of both university and the college , of both truth and culture .

		In both senses they are worthy of the great

		The book should be read not only for its views , which are stimulating , but for the rSsumS which it incidentally gives of many of the impor - tant educational experiments of the
last decade	DATE	, and for the outline of elementary method from the subjective or child-study standpoint .

		The volume has , however , many of the defects of a radical plea .

		It is loosely put together , exaggerations abound , and it is lacking in judicial quality .

		Some of the references are inexact , and the evidence cited to support the alarmist position as to over-pressure in the schools is insufficient , while some of the authorities are so old as to be practically worthless .

		In a book of its general purpose , these defects may be considered of minor significance .

		In general , it deserves the popularity which it has already achieved .

		Mr.
H. Thiselton Mark	PERSON	, of
Owens College	ORGANIZATION	,
Manchester	LOCATION	, has collected bis general impressions of American schools in a volume entitled '' Indi - viduality and the Moral Aim in American Educa - tion . ''

		He examined many phases of education , in order to characterize the American spirit ; the plans of school organization , methods of classification , training of teachers , child study , the kindergarten , women 's clubs , colleges and universities , the educa - cational press , -- all these pass successively under his microscope .

		The resulting conclusions may be recommended as an antidote to the recent utter - ances of Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	.

		`` There is prob - ably nothing more beautiful in education anywhere than the school-life of the children in the best primary and grammar grades .

		Here the school work becomes the child 's willing expression of himself , the school life is part and parcel of his The Training or Teachers , and Methods of In - struction .

		The aim of `` The Art of Teaching , '' Dr.
Emer	PERSON	- eon
E. White	ORGANIZATION	's concluding contribation to his ped - agogical series , is to set before the elementary teacher clear-cut standards and tests of efiBciency by which she may judge her own work .

		The first section of the volume treats of the fundamental aims of good teaching , as exemplified in drills , oral instruction , examinations , class or individual instruction , etc. .

		The latter half offers suggestions in regard to the different subjects of the elemen - tary curriculum .

		On the theoretical side Dr. White is conservative , perhaps unduly so in his estimate of the services of philosophy and genetic psychology to education ; but his treatment of every-day schoolroom problems represents a wealth of mature judgment which few teachers can afford to dis - pense with .

		Prof.
S. S. Laurie	PERSON	has issued a new edition of his selected papers on '' The Training of Teachers and Methods of Instruction . ''

		Two new articles , one on university education and another on history and citizenship in the school , are included .

		The essays naturally fall into three groups : -LRB- 1 -RRB- those dealing with the professional training of teachers ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- those treating of the functions of different grades of schools -LRB- primary , secondary , university -RRB- ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- those handling problems of the curriculum and the internal management of schools .

		These articles are thoughtful and well-prepared discus - sions of important issues in education , and are written in a philosophic spirit .

		While written to meet special occasions in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, Professor
Laurie	PERSON	has so well viewed the problems in their wider aspects that an American can read them with profit .

		The paper on ' • The Religious
Exluca	PERSON	- tion of the Toung '' is one which might well be republished in cheap form for popular use .

		Professor
Pinloche	PERSON	's long-heralded volume on `` Pestalozzi and the Foundation of the
Modern Elementary School	ORGANIZATION	, '' which concludes the • ' Great Educators '' series , is something of a disappoint - ment , largely because of its unsympathetic picture of
Pestalozzi	ORGANIZATION	's personality .

		The larger portion of the book is given to a systematic statement of
Pestalozzi	ORGANIZATION	's views on education colled from his own writings ; this will be of great service to students , as some of the originals are not accessible in En - glish translations .

		This section would have been of more value had Professor Pinloche explained
Pestalozzi	LOCATION	and compared his ideas at different periods of his career , --
Pestalozzi	ORGANIZATION	's emotional out - bursts being at times unsatisfactory expressions of his own views .

		The concluding chapters on
Pesta	LOCATION	- lozzi 's influence are slight and scrappy .

		The book contains signs of having been written in haste .

		In four hundred pages , Professor
Kemp	PERSON	hag written a new history of education , which covers the entire territory from the ancient Egyptians to
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		More space is given to accounts of the educational systems of modern
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	than is usual in similar treatises , and less attention is paid to the personality of the educa - tional reformers .

		Professor
Kemp	PERSON	writes force - ful , idiomatic English , devoid of technical express - ions ; consequently the book is better suited to the needs of immature students than most of its rivals for popular favor .

		At times , the author 's popular style carries him beyond the pale , as in the case of his description of Rosmini as `` a brainy , learned , and pious Italian priest . ''

		A useful list of books is appended , which might have been strengthened by more descriptive notes , and the initials , at least , of the authors .

		A select committee of the
New England History Teachers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, consisting of
C. D. Hazen	PERSON	,

Sarah M. Dean	PERSON	,
Max Farrand	PERSON	, and
A. B. Hart	PERSON	, has enriched the literature of method with one of the best pieces of descriptive bibliog - raphy yet published , in its report on '' Historical Sources in Schools . ''

		The first part of the report consists of a brief and conservative discussion of the source method of teaching history .

		The four remaining sections describe the sources , -LRB- 1 -RRB- of an - cient history , -LRB- 2 -RRB- medieval and modern European history , -LRB- 3 -RRB- English history , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- American his - tory ; the main divisions thus corresponding to the recommendations of the
Committee of Seven	ORGANIZATION	.

		The list of sources , arranged topically , is not the aso & l mere collection of titles , publishers , and prices , bat a series of valuable descriptive and critical para - graphs which no teacher of history in secondary schools can afford to be without .

		Although Mr.
Walter H. Page	PERSON	has Bd ^ ionai < md edited , and edited with eminent suc - cess , the most '' literary of our magazines , we fancy he would hardly like to be called a man of letters .

		To him the world is a place in which to do things rather than a place to live in and write about , and the literature that tells how things are done , or that provides an impetus for the doing of others , is the sort of writing that most appeals to him .

		He is an idealist of a very practical sort , familiar with many political and social problems at first hand , and having a firm grasp upon the solid facts of the situations he chooses to discuss .

		These characteristics are very evident in the little book which he calls ' ■ The Rebuilding of Old Commonwealths '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , and which is made up of two addresses and one magazine essay , all produced within the
last five years	DATE	.

		These pa - pers deal with the South , for that is the region of the author 's birth and boyhood ; their message is that of a man who has not got far enough away from his early environment to have his sympathies dulled or his understanding made sluggish .

		Public edu - cation considered as the corner-stone of the demo -
96	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, cratic edifice is the theme of these papers .

		In the first of them , '' The Forgotten Man , '' Mr.
Page	PERSON	speaks some home truths to the people of
North Carolina	LOCATION	, his own native State .

		Not in any carping spirit , but with stern insistence upon the logic of the case , he points out that the
State	ORGANIZATION	spends
$ 3.40	MONEY	per year per pupil for its public schools , and that in consequence one white person in every four is illiterate , while nearly three hundred thousand
North Carolinians	LOCATION	born have impoverished the common - wealth by finding homes in other
States	LOCATION	.

		Here is '' a slight hint of the cost of ignorance and of the extravagance of keeping taxes too low . ''

		The sub - stance of this address is condensed in the admirable epigram , '' We pay for schools not so much out of our purses as out of our state of mind . ''

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	's second paper , '' The School that Built a Town , '' is a plea , ringing if not impassioned , for the sacredness of the educational calling as the '' one true science of building a stable and broad-based democratic social structure . ''

		To his hearers he says , '' What - ever others may be doing , you are working with the central secret of human progress , '' and the school audience which he is addressing is inspired by his story of how the public school system of
Northwood	ORGANIZATION	raised the life of the entire community to a higher plane .

		`` The Rebuilding of Old Commonwealths , '' the third and last of these papers , is a keen diag - nosis of the social conditions of the South , which shows that slavery is now , as it was fifty years ago , mainly responsible for the discouraging facts of the situation , and again pointing to public education as the sole efficient agency for the estab - lishment of a truly democratic social order .

		This paper , like the other two , is stimulating and sug - gestive in the highest degree , and deserves to find the widest possible audience of readers . '

		*** '' ' ? '

		The preparation of a school text - 0 -RCB- English book of the history of English liter - tuerature .

		ature presents a task of constantly increasing difficulty .

		The number of good texts is already considerable , and there is not much latitude possible as to the selection or omission of facts .

		Nor is there much more in the matter of critical estimates ; for authoritative opinion concerning the chief English authors is fairly well crystallized , and a new writer has no right to be original .

		Beyond an occasional variation of the accent , or shading of the emphasis , he can not go if he is to be a safe guide for young students .

		He may express his own opinion concerning the relative supremacy of
Shelley	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, or of
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	; he may construct his own hierarchy of the Elizabethan dramatists ; he may correct erro - neous popular judgments .

		But he is under bonds not to be biassed or sensational or erratic in the views which he promulgates .

		The latest '' History of English Literature '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- is the work of Professors
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	and
Robert Morss Lovett	PERSON	, and its controlling principle is stated in the following words : '' The fact has been held constantly in mind that literature , being the vital and fluid thing it is , must be taught , if at all , more by suggestion , and by stimulation of the student 's own instinctive mental life , than by dogmatic assertion .

		More than any other branch of study , literature demands on the part of the teacher an attitude of respect toward the intelligence of the student ; and if at any point the authors of this book may seem to have taken too much alertness of mind for granted , their defence must be that only by challenge and invitation can any permanent result in the way of intellectual growth be accomplished . ''

		This is the apology of the authors , if any apology is needed , for having written their book , not in the dry fashion of the ordinary school-text , but with the literary grace and delicacy of phrase that we look for in the critical essayist who addresses an adult audience .

		They have produced the best-written elementary text-book of the subject that we have ever read ; whether it will prove proportionally ex - cellent as a teaching manual is a matter of some doubt .

		It is a book that can be read straight through with pleasure ; whether it is a book that can be prof - itably studied , paragraph by paragraph , by crude young minds of slight literary range , is quite another matter .

		What we have said may be illus - trated by a few sentences from the characterization of Hamlet . ''

		The core of his purpose is always firm ; and it is one of the ironies of circumstance that Hamlet has come to stand in most minds for a type of irresolution .

		This misunderstanding of the char - acter is largely due to the exaltation of excitement in
Hamlet	LOCATION	, which causes his mind , even in the mo - ment when he is pursuing his purpose with most intentness , to play with feverish brilliancy over the questions of man 's life and death ; which makes his throbbing white-hot imagination a meeting-place for grotesque and extravagant fancies ; and which leads him , so to speak , to cover the solid framework of his enterprise with a wild festoonery of intellectual whim , to envelop it in fitful eloquence , swift and subtle wit , contemptuous irony and mordant sat - ire . ''

		Fine as this unquestionably is in thought and expression , it must remain meaningless ver - biage to nine-tenths of the young readers for whom it is intended .

		But even if this book should prove ill-adapted to its immediate purpose , there is matter for congratulation in its having been produced .

		It stands in refreshing contrast to the formal text - books , and is the book that we should next recom - mend to students and readers who have graduated from their
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's '' Primer . ''

		It is well proportioned , giving much space to the last two centuries , yet not filling that space with superfluous names , titles , and dates .

		The writers have felt that an author worth mentioning at all was worth dis - cussing with some seriousness , and this has been their method throughout .

		The '' Reading Guide '' at the end occupies twenty-five pages , and is of great value .

		We have noticed a few slips , but they
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 ler ^ ft are hardly worth mentioning .

		They inclade saeh things , for example , as the misquotation '' broad - ening down from precedent to precedent . ''

		and the statement that ' ■ The Cloister and the Hearth '' is a story '' of the life of Erasmus , '' instead of dealing with the parents of
Erasmus	LOCATION	.

		So completely has wood-engraving been superseded by the modern `` process '' methods of picture re - prodaetion that we of to-day are apt to forget or overlook the large part played by the graver 's tool in tbe history of popular art .

		Up to little more than a generation ago .

		engraving on wood was practically the only method of reproducing an artist 's drawing for the purpose * of the printing press ; wood-engraving was then a flourishing pro- fession , and the engraver was a mighty personage upon whose skill the artist must depend entirely for the impression of his work received by the general public .

		An interesting realization of this vanished condition may be gained from the volume entitled ' > The
Brothers Dalziel	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Dntton -RRB- .

		a record , autobiographic in form , of the work of
George	PERSON	and
Edward Dalziel	PERSON	, two noted English wood-engravers .

		For half a century -LRB- 1840-1890 -RRB- these brothers , perhaps the leaders of their profession in
England	LOCATION	, worked in close association with many of the fore - most artists of the period , not only in the repro - dnction of their drawings on tbe block , but also in the superintendence and publication of elaborate ar ^ books , such as • ■
Dalziel	PERSON	's Arabian Nights '' and ''
Dalziel	PERSON	's Bible Gallery . ''

		The last-named collec - tion includes some of the most notable work of what has been called the golden age of English illustra - tion .

		To its preparation the Dalziels devoted years of ptatient labor and many thousands of dollars , en - listing the services of such artists as
Lord Leighton	LOCATION	, Borne Jones .

		Holman Hunt .

		Ford
Madox Brown	PERSON	, and Mr.
G. F. Watts	PERSON	.

		Yet the enterprise was financially almost a complete failure , some two hundred copies being the extent of the sales .

		Messrs.
Dalziel	PERSON	's informal account of their half - century of work is liberally sprinkled with appre - ciative letters -LRB- many reproduced in facsimile -RRB- from the artists whose blocks passed through their hands .

		There is one from
Rossetti	PERSON	, in which he speaks of two engravings -LRB- evidently those for the ''
Moxon	PERSON	''
Tennyson	PERSON	-RRB- as • • now highly satisfactory and well repaying all your pains . ''

		It will be recalled that
Rossetti	PERSON	's first experience with the Dalziels , in con - nection with the drawing for AUingbam 's • ' The Maid of Elfin-Mere , '' was one of sore trial for both artist and engraver , and the inspiration for such pleas - antries as the following : '' O woodman spare that block , O K '' A Bot aa jhow !

		It took ten days hy clock .

		I 'd fain protect it now .

		dons -- Wild Unslit `` r from
Dalziel	PERSON	's workakop . ''

		Bat , with due allowance for
Rossetti	PERSON	's humorous exaggeration , it must be said that his tribulations were owing rather to his own ignorance of tbe tech - nical requirements in the case than to any fault of the engravers .

		That the relations of the Brother - hood with their many exacting clients were gener - ally of the most genial and satisfactory sort there is ample testimony in these pages .

		Of the thon - cands of blocks sent oat from their workshop , the Messrs.
Dalziel	PERSON	have selected the most noteworthy for reproduction in the present volume .

		There are upwards of 150 plates in all , including specimens of the work of nearly every prominent English artist of the earlier Victorian period who haa worked in black-and-white .

		The collection thus brought together is a remarkable one , which the art-lover should not overlook .

		We trust the kindly memory of the
Brothers Dalziel	ORGANIZATION	and their distin - guished work may be kept alive for many a day by this handsome volume .

		The publication of Mr.
John Cor	PERSON	- m OmfJ ^ ' bin 's '' An American at Oxford '' -LRB- Hoaghton -RRB- has an unanticipated timeliness , coming , as it does , just after the an - nouncement of the Rhodes bequest .

		Every yoang man in
America	LOCATION	who is ambitious to become a Rhodes scholar at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	will be certain to want this book , to say nothing of the many others who will be attracted to it as an interesting contribu - tion to educational literature .

		What Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	does is to give us , in simple and sometimes too colloquial language , an account of the Oxford stu - dent 's life , in and out of doors , from the time of his matriculation to the time when he leaves the venerable city of the
Isis	ORGANIZATION	armed with his pass or honors degree , as the ca `` e may be .

		We know of no other book that gives precisely this information , which is frequently of a nature to impress very earionsly the youth whose ideas of university life are derived from experience of American or Ger - man institutions .

		We are told about the provisions for the comfort of students , their breakfasts from the college kitchen , their dinners in halL , their clois - tered conditions of life , and their athletic sports .

		Emphasis is properly placed upon the social aspects of life at
Oxford	LOCATION	, for in these aspects may be found the most distinctive difference between the English universities and those of other countries .

		We regret to notice that Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	thinks that the Rhodes trustees '' should be most vigorously urged to select the scholars from the graduates of American uni - versities . ''

		That the founder of the scholarships had DO such idea in his mind is perfectly evident from the terms of his will , and this suggestion is tantamount to a plea for bad faith on the part of the executors .

		Mr.
Sherwin Cody	PERSON	is one of a nnm - neauea/tie -RSB- ^ j. ^ f writers who have recently
Oman	LOCATION	oXmy .

		_ .

		^ been trying to make out a case for the artistic differentiation of the short story from tbe more extended work of fiction .

		They claim that the short story is not a novel in miniature , but a distinct literary form , with its own laws and mode of development .

		The argument is ingenious , but 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, it has always seemed to as a little sophistical , and the question is at least still open for debate .

		Mr.
Cody	PERSON	has lately illustrated his thesis by collecting a dozen or more of typical examples , and publishing them in a volume with general and special intro - ductions .

		This volume is entitled '' Selections from the World 's Greatest Short Stories '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , and , whatever we may think of the editor 's thesis , the volume is a good one to read and to possess .

		As to the selection made , there are many possible opinions .

		Six of the stories are '' Patient Griselda , '' '' Aladdin , '' Balzac 's '' A Passion in the Desert , ''
Irving	PERSON	's `` Rip Van Winkle , ''
Poe	PERSON	's `` The Gold - Bug , '' and
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' The Great Stone Face . ''

		There can hardly be any question about the claim of these six to be included in any representative collection , and the same may perhaps be said of the ''
Christmas Carol	PERSON	'' of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	.

		But we have grave doubts concerning '' A Princess 's Tragedy , '' from
Thackeray	PERSON	's ''
Barry Lyndon	PERSON	, '' as also concerning the selections made from Maupassant and Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		As for the incongruity of putting things by Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	and Mr.
Arthur Mor	PERSON	- rison in such a collection , there can be no doubt at all .

		And where is Tourgu ^ nie # P , the greatest of all masters of this form of literature ?

		The labor involved in the prepara - A nti ^ treatue jj ^ ^ „ -LCB- ^ modern manual of Zoology on Zoology ... .

		j ^ .

		- - ii IS 80 great and the expense of illus - tration so considerable that there is a growing ten - dency to make such treatises somewhat of an inter - national undertaking .

		An illustration of this effort to obliterate national limitations is to be found in Messrs.
Shipley	PERSON	and
McBride	PERSON	's '' Zoology '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , which has been written with both the English and the American constituency in view .

		The English training of both authors gives , how - ever , somewhat of a British bias to the terminology , and the sources of illustration are less American than students in this country might wish .

		This affects the work in question merely in the matter of convenience to users of the book upon this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Science cares little for political boundaries , and good books from any land are wel - comed in all .

		It has been the aim of the authors to prepare an elementary treatise in which the sub - ject should be developed as the reader advances .

		To this end the earlier chapters deal with the fun - damentals of the science in an elementary way , while the later ones are more advanced both in method and matter .

		The authors have taken great liberties in the arrangement of the systematic por - tion of the text , to the consternation of those who rejoice in uniformity of classification and arrange - ment .

		Many new figures , either from original drawings or original sources , appear in this text for the first time .

		The compass of the book , and the skill with which the authors have chosen the matter from the great array of results of the investigations of recent years , render their manual one of our best short treatises on zoology .

		The forest , as a living perpetual re - A timely volume goarce of the nation , is just hee \ n - on foresl culture ... ' • i i ning to claim its own with the American people .

		Time was when we looked to it merely for lumber , or sought only to rid the land of its presence ; but now its relation to water sup - ply , and thus to irrigation and navigation , is added to the prospect of a lumber famine .

		Growth of interest in silviculture is also evidenced by the establishment of courses of instruction in our uni - versities , and the increase in our national forest re - serves .

		The claims of recreation and sport are likewise potent , since they enlist aesthetic interests in the cause of forestry .

		All these considerations tend to make Professor
John Gifford	PERSON	's book on '' Practical Forestry '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- both timely and attractive .

		It is a popular presentation of the re - lation of trees to the manifold phases of our civil - ization , and to the phenomena and forces of nature , to soil , flood , and wind ; to the landscape and to health .

		The agencies operative in the extension and limitation of forests , and methods for their formation and improvement , are discussed , and the industries which have been built upon their products are described .

		Brief reference is made to tropical forests , and the public reservations in this country are enumerated .

		The scope of the work , the sug - gestions for economic utilization of the forest , the condemnation of wholesale destruction and of fire waste , combine to make the book a force in the education of the reading public to the importance of prompt action in all public questions affecting our woodlands .

		Owners of country homes , and all lovers of nature , will find in it many suggestions of value .

		An attractive Psychology .

		Text-books in Psychology , though by no means the barren and dull con - tributions that they are supposed to be , are yet rarely of the type to make attractive general reading , -- that of Professor
James	PERSON	being always the notable exception .

		What may be de - manded of a text is that it shall prove both helpful and attractive to the student who approaches the subject-matter with a student 's interest and attitude .

		The recent text by Dr.
Lightner Witmer	PERSON	of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- complies with these requirements to more than the usual ex - tent .

		The specific traits of the book are the selec - tions of its illustrative material , whereby charts and diagrams and illustrations enable the student to prove for himself many of the essential principles , and so in a modest measure furnish him with a miniature psychological outfit of an experimental kind ; and again the selection and treatment of portions of the field best suited to the illustration of the facts and principles of mental analysis .

		Such a selection necessarily omits a great deal that a student might care to know ; but by confining the attention to those portions that are really pedagog - ically suitable , the text gains in intent where it loses in extent .

		and is often trite , contains plenty of amusing aneedotes with much witty criticism and interesting general - ization .

		From the view-point of his cosmopolitan career , the author compares national characteristics , noting such matters as the philosophic cheerfulness of the French , the astounding length of the Amer - ican memory , or the unfortunate assumption of the Englishman that he may be as disagreeable as he pleases when he travels .

		The author dispenses good advice in epigram to all the world and his wife , present an4 prospective , and analyses and classifies • ' ■ Her Royal Highness Woman '' as she appears in her endless variety to her subject man .

		His work strikes the popular note indicative of the lecturer and journalist ; and in spite of the fact that there is almost too much of it , is clever and timely enough to find many readers .

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
P. Blakuton 's Son & Co.	ORGANIZATION	haT `` iaaoed the first number of `` The Medical Book News , '' a bi-monthly publication designed to furnish information of use to medical men in selecting books pertaining to medicine and the allied scieneea .

		`` The Isoperimetric Problem of a Given Snrfaee , '' by Professor
Oskar Bolza	PERSON	, and `` The Production of Mnscnlar Twitcbings , '' by Professor
Jacques Loeb	PERSON	, are two further preprints from the forthcoming
Decen	PERSON	- nial Publications of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		An Introduction to Physical Geography , '' by Messrs.
Grove Karl Gilbert	PERSON	and
Albert Perry Brigham	PERSON	, is a new '' Twentieth Century Text-Book '' published by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	.

		It is prepared for the early high school course , is concrete in treatment , and amply illastrated . ''

		The Middle Agea , '' by Professor
Phaip Van Nesa Myers	PERSON	, is a revision of the first half of the author 's • oeeeasf q1 '' Medieval and Modern History '' of sixteen years ago .

		It will presently be followed by `` The Modem Ages , '' both paUieatkms eoming from
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
University of Chieago Press	ORGANIZATION	announces a re - print , edited by Prof.
Frwlerie Ives Carpenter	PERSON	, of '' The Life and Repentaunce of
Marie Magdalene	PERSON	, '' a sixteen th-centnry morality play by
Lewis Wager	PERSON	, now for the first time reprinted and provided with editorial apparatus .

		Another volume of literary interest soon to appear from the same press , is '' The Diary and Correspondence of
Wilhelm Miiller	PERSON	, '' edited by Dr.
Philip S. Allen	PERSON	and Dr.
James T. Hatfield	PERSON	.

		We note with pleasure the signs of prosperity and progress in our old friend under a new name , '' Out West , '' formerly '' The Land of Sunshine , '' Mr.
Lum	PERSON	- mis 's vigorous magazine of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.


Chang	PERSON	- ing the name of a periodical is always haxardous , but in this case the wisdom of the step seeaw vindicated , and the new magazine has an air of maturity and ful - ness corresponding with its broadened field and title .

		The
August	DATE	number gives the third section of Mr.
Lommis	PERSON	's remarkable series of papers , descriptive and expository , on
California	LOCATION	, which , with theit profuse and novel illustrations , would make any magazine conspic - nous .

		The illustrations as a whole seem better than usual in this number , and the reading matter of a too THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, more even and inviting quality .

		The editorial vrriting , of course , does not fail in interest , and never can so long as it continues to be charged with Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's unhampered fervor of conviction and flavored with his breezy and enlivening personality .

		The '' History of the Roman People , '' which Dr.
William Fairley	PERSON	has translated -LRB- and to a certain ex - tent edited -RRB- from the French of Professor
Charles Seignobos	PERSON	, represents the best form of scholarly French text-buok , and is now offered for use in American schools and colleges .

		The author writes with graphic power , literary charm , and philosophical purpose , which qualities are mostly retained in this adaptation of his work .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		In a review of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's '' Studies in History and Jurisprudence , '' in The Dial for
July 16	DATE	, in discussing the chapter on the old constitution of
Iceland	LOCATION	it was incidentally remarked that '' Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	probably never visited the historic isle , '' etc. .

		This surmise is evidently an error ; for a correspondent calls our attention to a passage from the author 's earlier work , '' The
American Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which he says : '' Sixteen years ago I travelled in
Iceland	LOCATION	with two friends '' -LRB- introductory chapter , p. 9 of ed .

		of
1888	DATE	-RRB- .

		A revised edition of Mr.
G. A. Wentworth	PERSON	's `` Col - lege Algebra '' is published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same publishers also send us a revised edition of Dr.
Alfred P. Gage	PERSON	's '' Introduction to Physical Science , '' and a new '' Manual of Astronomy '' by Pro- fessor
Charles A. Young	PERSON	.

		The latter work occupies an intermediate position between the author 's two earlier texts , which have been drawn upon freely in its prepar - ation .

		It is a leather-bound volume of over six hun - dred pages , with many illustrations .

		A fifth volume of `` Old South Leaflets '' brings together a new collection of twenty-five of these valu - able reprints of source material , and will be welcomed by every teacher of American history .

		The contents are too varied for any general description , but we may note the group of eight that deal with the early exploration and colonization of the new world .

		The remaining pamphlets deal with subjects as far apart as More 's '' Utopia , ''
Dante	PERSON	's '' De Monarchia , ''
Bede on Augustine	PERSON	,
Horace Mann	PERSON	on free schools , Grotius on '' War and Peace , '' and the
Hague Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

1902	DATE	, which we believe will be of interest .

		Our most noteworthy undertaking is the new popular edition of `` The Ex - pedition of
Lewis	PERSON	and

		In two square octavo volumes of over 500 pages each , printed from new type of a large clear face , on fine laid paper , with new photogravure portraits and fac-simile maps , and with an introduction by Dr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	and a copious index , this will undoubtedly take its place as the standard popular edition of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	.

		n. CoDtinaing from a previoos number oar summary of the '' Athenaeum ' '' annual reports of the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literatures , we now present the following abstracts : Grreeoe , by Professor
S. P. Lambros	PERSON	;
Holland	LOCATION	, by Mr.
H. S. M. van Wickevoort Crommelin	PERSON	:
Hungary	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Leopold Katscher	PERSON	;
Italy	LOCATION	, by Dr.
Gnido Biagi	PERSON	;
Poland	LOCATION	, by Dr.
Adam Belcikowski	PERSON	;
Rassia	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Valerii Briasov	PERSON	; and
Spain	LOCATION	, by
Don Kafael Altamira	PERSON	.

		One would expect from
Athens	LOCATION	some acooant of the riotous proceedings evoked last autumn by the vernacular translation of the
New Testa	LOCATION	- ment , but Professor Lambros makes only a passing allusion to the matter . ''

		The attempt to introduce into historical description popular idiom only tolerated in poetry is not in aceord - aaee with the desire of the nation ; on ethnic grounds the Greeks wish to be purists .

		So the experiment of translating the Gospel into popular dialect by Mr.
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Pallis	PERSON	was regarded as anti-national and anti- religioos , and led
last November	DATE	to a rising of the • tndenta and people of
Athens	LOCATION	which ended in & tal ■ eenes and the resignation of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The chief literary happening of the year in
Greece	LOCATION	has been the Centennial festival of the patriotic poet Solomos , whose poems have ap - peared in a new critical edition , and whose statue was unveiled in
Zante	LOCATION
last June	DATE	.

		In belles-lettres , '' Mr.
Panajotis Zanos	PERSON	has published three plays , ' Di - ogenes Romaros , ' ■ .

		Andromeda and Perseus , ' ■ Com - nenus and Theodora . '

		The last deals with the taking of
Thessalonica	LOCATION	by the Turks in
1430	DATE	.

		Mr.
NichoU ^ Lascaris	PERSON	has produced various one-act comedies .

		Mr.
A. Nicolaras	PERSON	has written a beautiful play on Ariadne .

		The best publication of the dramatic year is the `
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- demos ' of Mr.
K. Angelopnjos	PERSON	.

		Full of feeling are the first attempts in poetry of a young lady ,
Miss Aemilia Kurtelis	PERSON	, entitled ' Chrysanthema . '

		A pseudonymous writer ,
Vangos	LOCATION	, has mystified people by an old Roman manuscript of folk-poetry .

		The name of the new
Macpherson	PERSON	can not be revealed at present .

		The poem itself is not without merit , but has nothing of Ossian 's swing about it . ''

		Historical and philological works are as nu - merous as ever , but not very interesting save to the specialist .


Heer Crommelin	PERSON	, writing of things Dutch , 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, says that `` the book which must puzzle the critic of
Holland	LOCATION	most this year is , undoubtedly ,
Heer Jan Apol	PERSON	's ' Phaethon and the Fool . '

		It is no more than a common tale of youthful ex - periences and feelings , but told in a sort of poetic ecstasy . ''

		The works of
Heer Cyriel Buysse	PERSON	-LRB- `` Van Arme Menschen '' -RRB- , of
Heer	PERSON	van Hulzen -LRB- '' Zwervers '' -RRB- , of
Heer Brandt	PERSON	van Doorne -LRB- `` Verweghe en Zijn Vrouw '' -RRB- , of
Heer van Eckeren	PERSON	-LRB- '' Donkere Machten '' -RRB- , and of
Heer Louis Couperus	PERSON	, are characterized by '' a healthy endeavor to put away all undue elaboration and to strive only for a pure ex - pression of thoughts and feelings worth utter - ing . ''


Heer Couperus	PERSON	has produced this year not less than three volumes , two of which belong to a sort of tetralogy , '' De
Boeken	PERSON	der Kleine Zielen '' ; while the third , called '' Babel , '' dis - cusses '' the extreme pains our times takes to produce monstrous superfluities . ''

		`` The theme is a huge scheme for rebuilding the
Tower of Babel	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is resolved that this time the tower shall reach the throne of Baal .

		Thus it becomes a work of years and years , which costs the Utcs and happiness of thousands .

		But the self-seeking pride of the master - builders , who suffer others to do the hard work , is kept back neither by floods or the fire of heaven , wbich threaten to destroy the building , nor by any reasons of sentiment .

		The impossibility of reaching heaven by a tower built on the blood of slaves is at length acknowl - edged by
Cyrus	PERSON	, a shepherd 's son of royal descent who had joined the builders .

		He leaves them when it dawns on him that their labour leads to no other goal than the unreasonable glorification of a few ; and when he com - municates this discovery to the enslaved multitude , a flower , the flower of mercy , springs up from the hard granite of the tower , a miracle which surpasses the dazzling enterprise of man . ''

		Other works of Active art are : '' Na Scheiding en Dood , '' by Mrs.
Atink	PERSON	; '' Doodendans , '' by
Heer Stijn Streuvels	PERSON	; and '' De Jonge Do - minee , '' by
Heer J. Eigenhuis	PERSON	.

		The '' Hol - landsche Belletrie '' of Dr.
C. van Deventers	PERSON	is a critical work dealing with the writers of the present day .

		The author '' Is especially attracted by the psychological element in literature , and is ready to forgive many faults as to form and plan , and even as to the exposition of char - acter , if only the author is thoroughly in earnest , and the spirit of his work is sympathetic . ''

		In poetry , after some years of considerable dearth , new life is evident .

		There is Dr.
van Eeden	PERSON	's ''
Passielooze Lilie	PERSON	, '' poems notable for their sweetness and thoughtfulness . ''

		Less popular , though not less in craf tmanship , is Dr.
J. B. Schepers	PERSON	's ' Bragi , ' which has been very well received ... An interesting event of the year has been the appearance of political songs of the time by the young
Heer C. S. Adama van Scheltema	PERSON	, a socialist , grandson of a well-known public man . ''

		On the stage , the most conspicuous figure is that of
Heer Herman Heyermans	PERSON	. ''

		His works are so well written that in reading them one has no difficulty in forgetting their doubtful dra - matic merit .

		His latest work , ' Ora et
Labora	LOCATION	, ' is little more than a melodrama -LRB- which probably accounts for its success on the stage -RRB- , but the dialogue is very clever .

		Heer Heyermans meets life with a laugh and a sneer , but he renders it with a sigh and a tear , to please the pit . ''

		Fiction in
Hungary	LOCATION	, writes Mr.
Leopold Katscher	PERSON	, '' has been at an extraordinarily low ebb during the past twelve months -- so much so that only two novels and three volumes of short stories deserve mention . ''

		The novels are '' Heathens , '' by Mr.
Ferencz Herczeg	PERSON	, and '' The Tartod Bear-Hunting , '' by Mr.
Dezso Malonyay	PERSON	.

		The former of these novels is a vigorous historical romance of the eleventh century ; the latter is Transylvanian and mod - ern .

		The three volumes of stories are `` Insig - nificant Tales , '' by Mr.
Bela Szivus	PERSON	, who has been styled the Hungarian Gorky ; '' Wan - derers , '' by Mr.
Ede Kabos	PERSON	; and '' Living Pictures , '' by Mr.
Istvan Barsony	PERSON	.

		`` The best volume of poetry this year is Mr.
Lajos Bart6k	PERSON	's ' Hope and Remembrance , ' which is calculated to increase his deserved popularity .

		It contains verse of fiery imagination , rare beauty of form , and patriotic elevation . ''

		On the stage '' no play of literary value has had a lasting success ; still , several really good dramas and tragedies have been produced . ''

		Mr.
Jeno Rakosi	PERSON	is the author of ''
Queen Tagma	PERSON	, '' a '' half-historical , half-legendary and fanciful tragedy , strangly influenced by Shake - speare and the Greek classics ; a romantic and powerful piece of work . ''

		Mr.
Lajos Palagyi	PERSON	's `` The Slaves '' is a Roman verse-drama of the times of Nero .

		Mrs.
Gyorgy Vero	PERSON	's ''
Cain	PERSON	'' is distinguished from other treatments of the subject by its substitution for envy of ill-fated love for a woman as
Cain	ORGANIZATION	's motive for slaying Abel -- the love of both brothers for one sis - ter .

		Among works of serious scholarship , the following are important : '' The Memorial of King Matthias Corvinus , '' by many hands , edited by Professor
Marki	PERSON	; `` Labour , '' by Mr.
Jenb Kunz	PERSON	; '' Essays on Political Econ - omy , '' by Professor
Bela Foldes	PERSON	; '' The Pro- tection of Marriage in Criminal Law , '' by Mr.
Rustem Vanbery	PERSON	; and the '' Dictionary of the Revival of the
Magyar Language	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Kalman Sziby	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Guido Biagi	PERSON	is pessimistic on the sub - ject of the intellectual life of
Italy	LOCATION	at the present time .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 111 '' We hare ezperieneed a period of lassitode , of lan - guor , that shows do sign of passing awaj ... We are witnessing a fatal decadence in Tarious branches of lit - erature , and the public is getting rapidlr disgusted by a sense of satietT and nausea .

		Lectures or conferences , for instaoce , bare become a veritable nuisance , a pub - lic calamitT .

		No one any longer desires to listen to them , whether he be invited or -LRB- as Leopardi proposed -RRB- paid something to lend his ears and patience . ''

		The decadence of the theatre is anivereally lamented . ''

		Now the theatres are full of translations from the French of comedies the subjects of which are generally lewd , with improbable plots , in which are jumbled incidents of dubious humour and scenes grotesquely salacious .

		Passiou is not the subject of these prodnc - tions , but rather sensual caprice . ''

		The one production of the year that helps to redeem this deplorable situation is , of course , the ''
Francesca da Rimini	PERSON	' of Signor d'An - nunzio .

		In this work of genius , the author '' Wished to prove that a work of art , as regards the public , the subject , and poetry itself , should be repre - sented with the aid of whatever may serve to make its value and purpose best understood .

		What is done elsewhere when the plays of Shakespeare are acted , what is done in
France	LOCATION	by grandiose neurotic repre - sentation , might at least be attempted for an Italian drama .

		And the poet , with the taste of an artist and the patience of a scholar , determined to search out and study every minute detail of costume , furniture , and scenery , in order to supply correspondinglv faithful pictures of the troublous life which he evoked bv the breath of his poetry ... The audience felt that they were in the presence of a work of art ; they breathed as it were that air of bygone times , so full of perfumed breezes , where the warm blood spirting forth waters the beds of flowers , where the sweet scents of poetry mingle with the acrid odours of battle .

		The faithful and vigorous reproduction of those scenes of medieval life struck by its boldness the mind of the ordinary pub - lie , and was very favourably received by graver critics . ''

		There have been published during the year `` two collections of poems of the highest value . '' '

		One of them is the single - volume abridgment of the complete works of
Signor Carducci	PERSON	.

		the other is a similar abridgment of the poems of his alumnus ,
Signor Giovanni Marradi	PERSON	.

		Of this poet , '' A Livomese , his master had already written that be had ' the gift of full-throated song , the inspiration of melody , ' and it was great praise ; but be has , especially by his '
Rapsodia Garibaldina	PERSON	, ' shown that he is able to sing , and sing well , of ` the profound intuitions of life and of history . '

		Marradi is now recognized as a poet of every-day life , as he is acknowledged on all hands to be a marvellous artificer of verse , a vigorous word - Pointer .

		To read his songs is to enjoy sweet and strong music , to hear once more all the beauties of classic art express our deepest feelings , the Olympic illusions which atone for what he calls ' the pallid mel - ancholy of the world . '

		So long as
Italy	LOCATION	has such ar - tists , we need not despair of her future . ''

		In the field of romance a few works are men - tioned , none of which are of much importance .

		The titles include ''
Lett	PERSON	`` re d'Amore , '' by Sig -
nora Serao	PERSON	; '' Servetta , '' by Signora ''
Regina	PERSON	di Luanto '' ; '' II Capolavoro , '' by
Signor Gia	ORGANIZATION	- stino
L. Ferri	PERSON	; '' Qnando il Sogno e Finito , '' by
Signor Guiseppe de Rossi	PERSON	; and '' II Ritomo dell ' Aretusa , '' by
Signor Enrico Castelnuovo	PERSON	. ''


Signor Francesco d'Ovidio	PERSON	, one of the masters of criticism , has published his ' Stndj snlla Divina Corn - media , ' which constitute one of the most valaable con - tribiftions to modem Dante literature .

		This book of d'Ovidio 's has been widely studied and discussed by the most competent authorities , and is recognized gen - erally here as a work of the first importance . ''

		History is represented by ''
Episodi del Risor	PERSON	- zimento Italiano , '' by General
Giacomo Du	PERSON	- rando : ''
Scrilti Politici	PERSON	e I ` Epistolario di
Carlo Cattaneo	PERSON	, '' edited by Mrs.
Jessie White Mario	PERSON	; ''
Epistolario Inediti di G. Mazzini	PERSON	, '' and
Signor Guglielmo Ferrero	PERSON	's '' Grandezza e Decadenza di Roma . ''

		A travel book of real importance , the Duke of the Abmzzi 's ''
Viag	ORGANIZATION	- gio al
Polo Nord	ORGANIZATION	, '' will be published nert
October	DATE	.

		The Hugo centenary was celebrated in
Italy	LOCATION	, as well as the eightieth birthday of the
Marchesa del Grillo	ORGANIZATION	, better known to the public as
Adelaide Ristori	LOCATION	.

		And the recent unveiling , in
Florence	LOCATION	, of a monument to
Rossini	ORGANIZATION	, is said to mark '' the first time that the Pantheon of Italian glory has opened to a musician . ''

		Dr.
Adam Belcikowski	PERSON	tells us that `` The Affaire Dolenga , '' by Mr.
J. Weyssenhoff	PERSON	, has been the greatest success of the year in Polish fiction . ''

		A highminded and talented young engineer wins the love of the somewhat eccen - tric daughter of a prince , but conventional prejudices prove too strong , and her happiness is sacrificed to them . ''

		A novel called ''
Miss Mary	PERSON	, '' the work of Mr.
K. Przerwa-Tetmajer	PERSON	, '' Is hardly a snoceasfnl eompoand of imagination and realism .

		A millionaire 's daughter , of Jewish descent , has fallen in love with a musician , but on the failure of his opera she refuses to be his wife and marries m mined count instead .

		Uer passion is roused once more when the composer , who has meanwliflepaaaed through the torments of hell , at laat makes lii '''' -- if renowned on both sides of the globe ; bat now be , in his tntn , seomfnlly rejects her love . ''

		Other works of fiction are `` Fame '' and `` Fiat Lux , '' both by Mr.
A. Krechowiecki	PERSON	; '' Mr.
Philip	PERSON	of Konopie , '' by Mr.
K. Glinski	PERSON	; '' Nigh to Heaven , '' a novel of student life by Mr.
E. Paszkowski	PERSON	; '' The
Grey Yam	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
J. Swierk	PERSON	; '' The Art Worshippers , '' by Mr.
K. Rojon	PERSON	; and '' From Bygone Years , '' by Mr.
G. Danilowski	PERSON	.

		Lyric poetry is rep - resented chiefly by three works , Mr.
J. Kas	PERSON	- prowicz 's '' The End of the World , '' a song - 112 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, cycle , '' the subject of which is the tragic conflict of a soul full of doubt and despair , yet at the same time deeply religious and longing ardently for faith '' ; Mr.
L. Rydel	PERSON	's '' Poems , '' which '' make a very different and most har - monious impression '' ; and Mr.
L. Staff	PERSON	's `` Mas - ter Twardowski , '' dealing '' with a legendary wizard of the sixteenth century who has much in common with the German Faust . ''

		A num - ber of plays are mentioned , including one by the writer of the present article ; and the re - port closes with a few words about Professor
A. Briickner	PERSON	's new history of Polish litera - ture , written in the German language . ''

		In Russian society and Russian literature , '' writes Mr.
Briusov	PERSON	, '' There has been observed for some time a mystic aud religious movement .

		During the last year it exhibited itself with special force .

		A new society has been formed in
Petersburg	LOCATION	for religious and philosophic meetings .

		... At the assemblies papers are read on religious and ecclesiastical questions , judgment is passed upon them , and opinions are uttered with a freedom rare in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Ecclesiastics take part with laymen , who are chiefly authors .

		Vestments alternate with overcoats , and many ladies come .

		For the first time , after a rupture of two centuries , the literature of the layman has stretched out a hand to spiritual thought .

		For the first time problems have made their appear - ance , and questions have been discussed equally impor - tant to both . ''

		In connection with these assemblies , and in a way marked by their influence , several publi - cations are mentioned , among them Professor
Merezhkovski	PERSON	's '' Christ and Antichrist in Russian Literature , '' Mr.
N. Minski	PERSON	's `` Philo - sophic Dialogues , '' Mr.
Boborgkin	PERSON	's novel '' The Confessors , '' and a collection of stories by
Mrs Zenaida Gippius	PERSON	. '

		< Mr.
Leonid Andreev	PERSON	has had the gpreatest success in belles-lettres , strictly so-called .

		His first volume of tales was sold off in a few weeks .

		He has remained in the fundamental form of his productions true to tradi - tion -- ' t. e. , he is completely accessible to the ordinary reader , but at the same time , in some of his methods and moods , he is near to the ` new poetry . '

		He pos - sesses the talents of a raconteur , and may be expected in the future to find out an independent path . ''

		With the success of this book can alone be compared that of the books of '' Maxim Gorky , '' which are now sold by tens of thousands .

		`` He has published the fifth volume of his works , and in this have appeared the conclusion of his novel • The Trio ' and his drama ' The Bourgeeis , ' which was played at
Petersburg	LOCATION	with great success .

		In this play a bourgeois family in easy circumstances is living in a little town .

		The children have been educated -- the son is a student , the daughter a teacher ; and misunder - standings arise between the parents and the children . ''

		The first place in Russian poetry must be given to '' Songs from the Nook , '' by Mr.
K. Sluchevski	PERSON	. ''

		He is one of the most remarkable Russian poets .

		He has now been writing for almost half a century , but till lately he had not secured the fame he deserves .

		The great public knows Sluchevski by name only , but he is surrounded with the affectionate regard of his friends and all poets .

		If in
Russia	LOCATION	a plebiscite were taken among poets , as it is in
France	LOCATION	,
Sluchevski	PERSON	would certainly receive the greatest number of votes . '

		The
Nook	ORGANIZATION	' is the name of the poet 's estate , where he spends his
summer	DATE	holidays . ''

		The
Gogol	PERSON	jubilee has been celebrated this year , and has called forth the publication of new editions , unprinted letters , numerous fragments , and a large amount of critical discussion .

		The Spanish chronicle for the year , com - piled by
Don Rafael Altamira	PERSON	, has the usual lengthy list of historical and antiquarian pro- ductions , works of little interest to others than specialists , which we will pass unmentioned , save for a note upon
Canovas del Castillo	PERSON	, who has been made the subject of two biog - raphies .

		His character '' Is certainly most interesting to an historian .

		He was a genuine representative of the Bourbon restoration , and also of the strange and deplorable pessimism which , by paralyzing the arms of many men of ability , was the cause of almost all our disasters during the closing years of the nineteenth century .

		But the time has not yet come for panegyrists , even of the utmost honesty of purpose , to extol his career in eulogistic phrases . ''

		In belles lettres '' two facts are observable : the return of our authors to the cultivation of the story , from which they have been inclined to hold aloof of recent years , and the invasion of Castilian poetry by modernity . ''

		Among the best works of fiction are '' Adventuras , Inventos , y Mistificaciones de Silvestre Par - adox , '' and '' Camino de Perfeccion , '' both by
Senor Baroja	PERSON	, a new writer ; '' Sonata de Otono , '' by
Senor Valle Inclan	PERSON	; '' La Con - quista de la Elegancia , '' by Senor Danvila ; and '' Sonnica la Cortesana , '' by
Senor Blasca IbaSez	ORGANIZATION	.

		The annals of verse-writing and of the stage are of `` o particular interest , although
Senor Galdos	PERSON	has produced ''
Alma y Vida	PERSON	, '' an admirable symbolistic drama .

		The limited edition of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's Essays , which
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce , will un - doubtedly prove the crowning achievement of
The Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Florio	PERSON	translation is the one selected , and the work will comprise three folio vol - umes of uncommon typographical beauty .

		The front - ispieces , decorative title-pages , and initial letters will all be engraved on wood , and in the bibliography there will be facsimile reproductions of title-pages and other interesting material from famous old editions .

		* Whatever the defects of Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	's '' History of the
Nineteenth Century Year	ORGANIZATION	by Year , '' it is to be said at the outset that they are largely inherent in the plan of his rather formidable undertaking .

		Though it is difficult to see how any other method of treating so vast a subject would have enabled him to tell the story better , it is certain that the presenta - tion of wholly dissociate matters in successive paragraphs , throughout his three volumes , is frequently disconcerting .

		On the other hand , the fact that the story as told is almost con - tinuously interesting , even though it runs through
1912	DATE	closely-printed pages , attests the wisdom and ability of the author at once .

		Certainly , to take up each country by itself and carry on its history through more than a hundred years would hardly have been likely to produce better results , while it would have necessitated the narration of all international affairs at least twice over .

		Carefully though not voluminously indexed as it is , '' A History of the Nineteenth Century Year by Year '' forms a valuable addition to works of reference in any library , at the same time that it affords pleasant reading as a whole .

		The use of mar - ginal annotations of topics is an assistance to every reader ; and the numerous illustrations , many of thepi in color , add to the desirability of the volumes .

		It has long been the belief of Americans that from among their number were to arise the great historians of the modem world .

		Holding aloof from
Europe	LOCATION	to an extent which lessens national prejudices to the minimum , able from a point of view so far removed to assume the attitude of '' contemporaneous pos - terity , '' and pledged by reason of their nation - ality to regard favorably all government which is based upon generous and sound political principle rather than upon political expediency , it appears to be the duty of Americans to in - terpret to the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	the actualities and tendencies of their own acts .

		The neces - sity for this is the greater , in view of the fact that British historians , however dispassionate , have never been able to treat European affairs with the accuracy which they have bestowed • A HisTOBT or

		upon American affairs , and this at a time when identity of language enables them in a great measure to form American opinion in r ^ ard to the annals of the Continent of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Here the citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	hold a just balance , the mixing of races and nationalities in our country going far toward divesting us of all bias .

		And it is of the cen - tury so recently closed -- the century in which the term `` chauvinism '' took its rise -- that this is especially true .

		Throughout his account of the life of the na - tions of the world , Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	discloses a steadfast Americanism which has the courage , of its convictions .

		His work is in no sense philosophical , its aim being rather to collect and present facts than expound their tenden - cies .

		Yet his adherence to the broad dem - ocratic principles upon which this republic was founded can be discerned , though his views are those of the conservative rather than the radical believer in popular government .

		He has done wisely in using a translation , by Mr.
Maurice Magnus	PERSON	, of the introduction prepared by
Grer	PERSON	- vinus for his history of the nineteenth century , projected but never realized , as the introduc - tion to his own work .

		It brings the age just closed into perspective , and enables the reader to trace tendencies stretching far back of the year 1800 , with which the account opens .

		In his preface , Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	remarks : ■ ■ It is the pride of Americans that their hemisphere has eoDtribnted its share , and over , to the snm-total aecomplished by the world since the death of Wash - ington .

		In the roll-eall of the great men of this age few names stand forth more brightly than those of
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
Bolivar	LOCATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	,
Farragnt	LOCATION	, and Lee , or those of
Fulton	LOCATION	,
Ericsson	ORGANIZATION	,
Morse	PERSON	,
Edison	ORGANIZATION	,
Diaz	PERSON	, aad Dewey . ''

		Considerations snch as tbeae have entered largely into the preparation of this work .

		To them mast be ascribed the apparent preponderance given to the part played by
America	LOCATION	in the history of the world during the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		When a similar work was undertaken by GerviDos , the great German historian , he laid the responsibility for modern statecraft and ideals of goremment at the feet of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		These words indicate that dispassionate atti - tude which must characterize the work of the true historian , and no American will quarrel with the setting of the affairs of the new world upon an equal footing with those of the old in a history of this kind .

		This is one evidence of the author 's good faith ; another may be found in his inclusion of the arts of peace as essential factors in the world 's development and progress , the sombre events of war and conquest being often brightened by citations 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, from the poets , while the authors , artists , and inventors of the age are given equal promi - nence with the rulers , statesmen , and warriors .

		Even matters so seemingly slight as the in - vention of patent leather may be found side by side with the echoes of the tramp of armies ; while the poets of all
Christendom	LOCATION	appear , those of foreign speech in adequate translation .

		The pages are consecutively numbered from the beginning to the end of the work , making reference easy .

		The style is popular , almost familiar , and its journalistic tendency is ad - mirably suited to the subject matter , -- the history being largely a journal of the times , and too closely related to the present , for the most part , to permit of any other treatment .

		It is interesting to note that the eighteenth century ended , as the twentieth began , with a dispute regarding its initial year .

		Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	seems to lend himself to those who would have the century open in a year with a round num - ber , by formally including the year
1800	DATE	, after a preliminary chapter of forecast .

		But he also includes the year
1901	DATE	by way of close , so that his book does not add its mite toward a settlement of a highly unimportant dispute .

		His first volume contains a map of the world at the beginning of the epoch , just as the last includes one at its close ; in this latter there is a mistake in coloring ,
France	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	being apparently assigned the same tint , though on the map itself they are duly differentiated .

		Where so much ground is covered , neces - sarily a process of selection must be adopted .

		Yet it would be unfair to draw a hard and fast line at any point .

		Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	apparently intends that his work shall be interesting as well as important ; hence he shows a fondness for events that combine these two elements in greater or less degree .

		There is little oppor - tunity for humor , but plenty for good nature and human sympathy .

		Still , one may read of
January , 1812	DATE	, that ''
Wellington	LOCATION	, to use
Napier	PERSON	's expressive phrase , ' instantly jumped with both feet upon
Ciudad Rodrigo	ORGANIZATION	. ' ''

		And there seems to be something of a moral for the readers of to-day in the statement respecting the first steamboat , that '' Next , the courts were asked for an injunction to restrain Fulton from using his new machine on the Hudson . ''

		Wherever there has been an authoritative pre - sentation of any part of his broad subject by another , Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	has gladly made use of it , duly weighing the evidence where more than one side has had a hearing .

		The first of the three volumes is practically given up to the first
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		With the exception of the withholding of the important fact that the government of
Great Britain	LOCATION	sought to end the life of the Emperor of the French by assassination , there is here the fair - est possible statement of the life of that gigan - tic figure , the facts being set down without malice or extenuation .

		Even a matter coming so near home as the war between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, in 1812-14 , shows no national prepossessions , -- a return for the com - pliment paid Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	by the publishers of the '' History of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' in permitting him to furnish the correspond - ing chapter of that work .

		It is a downright pleasure to see the facts regarding the battle of
Lundy	ORGANIZATION	's Lane made clear , without boasting of a great American victory on that hard - fought field .

		There is , however , no mention made of the destruction of the government buildings and records of
York	LOCATION	, now
Toronto	LOCATION	, which justified in some measure the British vandalism in
Washington	LOCATION	; nor is anything said of Major
Croghan	PERSON	's defense of
Fort Ste	LOCATION	- phenson , the most brilliant exploit of Ameri - can arms on land in the North , and one of real moment .

		The second volume carries the tale down to the close of
1857	DATE	.

		Some exception will doubt - less be taken to this account of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's last mo - ments : '' On his way to
New York	LOCATION	to settle up affairs in anticipation of his marriage ,
Poe	PERSON	fell in with some of his companions in dissipa - tion at
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		He became drunk , wan - dered through the streets , and was finally taken to a hospital in an unconscious condi - tion .

		Later he became delirious , and finally expired . ''

		But here , as elsewhere , Mr.
Emer	PERSON	- son 's critical judgment is generally sound re - garding authors , as in his brief estimate of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's genius .

		The Mexican War falls within this period , and its events are presented with entire dispassion , as may be seen in the treat - ment of the battle of
Buena Vista	LOCATION	, where , as is noted , '' Both sides claimed the victory .

		The Mexicans chanted Te Deums . ''

		It is in the last volume , especially in its latter pages , that the most exceptions will be taken to Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	's selection of material .

		He is here obliged to rely upon newspaper informa - tion in good part , and his treatment of the Spanish War has nothing of the authority which attends his discussion of the War be - tween the States .

		An example of his writing at its best will be found in this extract :
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 '' On the foUowiDg morning the
Merrimae	PERSON	came out into the Roads to finish her work of destruction .

		There she beheld her new antagonist -LRB- the Monitor -RRB- lying beside the
Minnesota	LOCATION	like a ' tin can on a shingle . '

		Lieutenant Jones commanded the Merrimae in place of the wounded
Buchanan	PERSON	.

		He realized at once that the new outlandish vessel was his foremost adyersarr .

		The day was suunj and bright , and crowds of spectators thronged the shores to behold the great duel .

		After exchanging shots with the
Minnesota	LOCATION	, the Merrimae eloeed with the Monitor .

		Both vessels pounded each other ineffectually .

		The Monitor 's cast-iron balls broke upon the armor of the Merrimae , while the Merrimac 's shells burst to no purpose over the Monitor 's turret .

		After thus exchanging fire for two hours , the
Merri	PERSON	- mac 's gunners quit to save the ammunition .

		Manifestly the Monitor had an immense advantage in her superior speed and mauceuvring power , as well as in the greatest radius afforded by the revolving turret .

		Lieutenant
Worden	PERSON	, accordingly , resolved to ram his enemy .

		He missed the Merrimae by only two feet , both ships graz - ing .

		The Merrimae retaliated in kind .

		Jones ran his stem right over the Monitor 's deck , the force of the blow knocking down most of bis men .

		Before they conld get over the side of the ship , the Monitor glided away from under the Merrimae .

		The slow speed of the Merrimae saved the Monitor .

		It was indeed for - tnnate for
Worden	PERSON	that the Merrimae had lost her ram on the previous day .

		Later the Monitor drifted into shoal water , and the Merrimae , unable to follow , drew off .

		Thus the engagement ended as a drawn battle .

		Neither ship had been seriously injured , nor had either lost a single man .

		The Monitor had been struck twenty - two times without appreciable injury .

		The Merrimae , as a result of her two days ' fighting , had ninety-seven indentations in her armor .

		Bloodless as this first encounter between ironclads was , it proved one of the decisive battles of the Civil War , securing to the North the command of the sea .

		The demonstration of the superior merits of steam power and armor protection in action was so striking that it practically sealed the doom of the old ships . ''

		A carious inadvertence is to be noted in the following : ' • While marching , the soldiers chanted their favorite song , ' The Battle Cry of Freedom , ' the tune of which is known to the present day in
America	LOCATION	as '' Marching through
Georgia	LOCATION	. ' ''

		The closeness with which events in times of peace are followed is to be seen in the account of the attempt of
Gould	PERSON	and
Fisk	PERSON	to secure the
Albany	LOCATION	and Susquehanna Rail - road , on page
1478	DATE	.

		This is the basis of Messrs.
Merwin	PERSON	and
Webster	PERSON	's `` The Short Line War , '' which was criticized on its publi - cation for telling an impossible story .

		The account of the labor disturbances of
1894	DATE	is given in this language : '' In the middle of
June	DATE	the great Pullman car strike started in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		In connection with this movement 40,000 raUroad employees struck in the
Western States	LOCATION	.

		By the beginning of
July	DATE	the intervention of the
United States	LOCATION	troops was found necessary to protect interstate commerce and the transmission of the mails .

		Many thousands of strikers refused to allow the trains to be moved .

		Most of the remaining buildings of the
Chicago	LOCATION	World 's Fair were set on fire , and other outrages com - mitted .

		The troops repeatedly charged the mob .

		At one time the strikers destroyed all the station yards at the various railroads .

		On the
9th of July	DATE	, President
Cleveland	LOCATION	issued a proclamation practically declaring martial law in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The Federal courts punished those strikers that failed to obey injunctions for con - tempt of court .

		On
July 16	DATE	, the labor strike through - out the
Union	ORGANIZATION	was practically brought to a close , and the
Honse	PERSON	of Representatives thanked the President for his energetic action . ''

		Nothing could illustrate better than this mixture of truth and falsehood the danger of relying upon sensational newspaper accounts when there are official documents fully cover - ing the ground .

		Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	is referred to the
Cooper Union	ORGANIZATION	speech of the late Governor
John P. Altgeld	PERSON	, and to the report of the com - mission of enquiry headed by the Hon.
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	.

		From these he may learn that the Pullman strike began in
May	DATE	; that many more than 40,000 railway employees struck late in
June	DATE	: that the Federal troops were sent into
Illinois	LOCATION	, for the first time in the his - tory of the
United States	LOCATION	, without any request from the
State	ORGANIZATION	authorities , and that they did practically nothing to protect interstate com - merce or the transmission of the mails ; that the strikers offered at all times to move the mail trains : that the destruction of the World 's Fair buildings has never been laid to the strikers ' door , and that none of the other damage , which by no means included `` all the station yards '' in the city , has ever been brought home to the strikers in any way ; that the troops did not '' repeatedly charge the mob , '' for the excellent reason that there were few mobs at any time during the strike ; and that the government , after sentencing the leaders of the strike to imprisonment for dis - obeying an injunction of the court in commit - ting a crime , abandoned voluntarily the attempt to prove them guilty of the identical crime on criminal prosecution -- quorum omnia pars fui .

		It is to be regretted that Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	says nothing of the offer of
Spain	LOCATION	to arbitrate all differences with the
United States	LOCATION	previous to the outbreak of the recent war ; and that nothing whatever is said of the several impor - tant battles fought by the Filipinos against the Spanish , by which the latter were cooped up in
Manila	LOCATION	.

		Nothing is said , either , of President
McKinley	PERSON	's proclamation command - ing the Filipino army to lay down its arms , which was the beginning of the war of subju - gation : nor of the extension of the American lines beyond the limits set by the protocol , 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, which was the provoking cause of actua !

		hos - tilities .

		Nor is anything said of the provisions of the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	regarding the friars in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, which has been the cause of so much of the trouble in the archipelago .

		When Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	says , discussing the '' bot - tling up '' of
Cervera	PERSON	's squadron in the harbor of
Santiago	LOCATION	by
Schley	PERSON	, '' His resulting loose tactics , it is asserted , caused him to be super - seded by Captain
Sampson	PERSON	, his inferior in rank , '' he is in error ,
Sampson	PERSON	having been put over
Schley	PERSON	at the outbreak of hostilities .

		The account of the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	and the controversies leading to it would have been much the gainer if Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	had made himself familiar with the short history written by Mr.
F. W. Gooch	PERSON	for '' The Heart of the Empire . ''

		But here the annalist may shield himself behind his privilege of selec - tion , it being manifestly impossible to include everything and keep his work within practical bounds .

		Generally speaking , the '' History of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' is a worthy book and a valuable addition to historical literature .

		* Among the many books and articles that have been written upon the treatment of
Eus	ORGANIZATION	- sian prisoners and exiles , Dr.
Howard	PERSON	's work is unique in that it is written from inside knowledge of that which it describes .

		As the author says in his Introduction , the ordinary investigator labors under so many disadvan - tages that he can not know the real facts ; he must depend upon the accounts of officials or of prisoners whose statements he can not verify ; his visits are known beforehand and carefully prepared for .

		* ' But the daily routine of the ordinary actual life of prisoners and exiles , in prison and out of prison , when no traveller is near ; the ordinary methods and life of the officials ; the actual working of the system in its different details and departments , -- these may be as unknown to this traveller at the end of his trip as when he started .

		of man on every continent ; and , what is bet - ter , his studies and activities have brought about permanent good for society in more than one direction .

		He was an English boy who came to
America	LOCATION	because it seemed to be pos - sible for him to get a college education here .

		Graduating from
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	a few years before the Civil War , the same eager interest in men that led him afterwards to give years to the investigation of prison conditions in the various countries of the world , led him to be - come a clerk in a
St. Louis	LOCATION	slave-market , in order that he might get at the facts of slavery .

		These facts kindled a burning hatred of the institution , and he nearly lost his life in the attempt to serve as an agent of the '' under - ground railway '' in connection with his service in the slave-market .

		He served with honor in the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	army , to the permanent injury of his health .

		In his profession he was remark - ably successful , both at home and abroad .

		The prevalent method of resuscitation of persons seemingly drowned was worked out by him , and is known by his name .

		A pleasant in - cident is recorded of his life in the remote corner of the earth which the present book describes . ''

		The reports of a drowning accident had caused me to hurry down to the beach , where I found Dr. A. en - deavoring to resuscitate the patient .

		Asking him where be had learned the method of artificial respiration he was employing , he told me that it was the American method , known as the ' direct method ' of Professor
Howard	PERSON	, and that he had learned it in
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	.

		He was immensely astonished at finding that the person who was showing his pleasure in the returning life of the patient was himself the author of the method ; and from that day onward , both in the hospital and out of it , Dr. A. treated me with as much consideration and respect as if I were the senior physician of the post , and he merely an assistant . ''

		Dr.
Howard	PERSON	has received the credit of being the originator , and largely the organizer , of
the London Ambulance Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		His influence was strong in the same direction in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		His medical writings are highly esteemed by the profession .

		During the whole of his active life of forty years he was especially interested in the different convict systems of the world , the study of criminology and prison reform .

		Gen - eral
O. O. Howard	PERSON	says , in the Preface , that the author went through the principal prisons of
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	, and through every convict prison between
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	and
Siberia	LOCATION	; in
Russia	LOCATION	he travelled many hundred miles , in hourly contact with five hundred exiles , by road , river , and rail .

		He made practical studies of the Armenians '

		117 troubles in their midst .

		He went again and again into the Russian Jew question , and was twice put under arrest , utterly uncertain as to I what mieht await him .

		Such is the man to whom we are indebted for this interesting and authoritative account of Russian prison ad - ministration in the most remote of her convict settlements , to which only the most hardened and depraved criminals are sent , -- the bleak island of
Sakhalin	LOCATION	, out in the ocean beyond
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		The narrative opens with a description of
Vladivostok	LOCATION	, important as the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian railway , as it was ten years ago .

		Dr.
Howard	PERSON	was allowed to go through every part of the prison at that place , without any opportunity having been given to prepare for his coming : and to talk freely with any of the prisoners , apart from guide or official .

		While there was great slackness in the administration , according to Western ideas , and abundant filth , he found no evidence of such general harshness as we have been ac - customed to associate with Russian prison ad - ministration .

		The combination of tact and assurance that enabled Dr.
Howard	PERSON	to pene - trate where all others had failed to penetrate , and to get all that he wanted where others had failed to get anything , is a cause of constant admiration to the reader .

		He succeeded in making confidential friends at sight of chiefs of police , prison officials , governors of pro- vinces , and all others , apparently , who could be useful to him .

		It was not in his plans to visit
Sakhalin	LOCATION	, though he was deeply interested in the place as completing the penal system of
Siberia	LOCATION	, being the place to which the incorri - gibles were sent : but no foreigner had been allowed to visit the island , and he did not sup - pose that a way could be opened for him .

		But it was his good fortune to dine one evening where the Governor of the island was a guest , returning from his annual holiday trip : this official gave him a hearty invitation to be his guest for the
summer	DATE	, and Dr.
Howard	PERSON	was only too glad to accept it .

		The descriptions of the life of the officials in their remote place of exile , as well as of the soldiers , and the convicts of various grades , are most interesting , and there are many things that would be well worth quoting if space allowed .

		Though there were but a few free Russians there , this very isolation brought out national or race characteristics , as well as in - dividual character , with startling clearness .

		One gets an insight into the religious and in - tellectual life of the average Russian that could not be gained by contact with the people under ordinary conditions .

		Through his pro- fession and the admiration that Dr.
A.	PERSON	felt for him .

		Dr.
Howard	PERSON	had free access to the hos - pital through his stay on the island . ''

		While , on the one hand , Dr. A. professed that the hospital was greatly indebted to me , I , on the other hand , declared that I was mnch more indebted to it , there being no other spot on the island where I could so well and deeply have studied the pathology of the exile system as here , whither eame everything whieh most deeply testified against it .

		On the slightest excose every exile and convict claims his right of seeing the doctor , and it is impossible , therefore , fop any cruelty or abuse of any kind whatsoever to continue long in operation without some evidence of it coming under the eye of the physician ... Thus the doctor has his finger literally on the pulse of the physical and moral life of the whole settlement all the time .

		It would be too flattering to say that this hospital was my observa - tory .

		It was my chemical and pathological laboratory . ''

		With this prolonged opportunity for close study of the Russian penal system among the worst convicts , in a place remote from official inspection and control , considered even in
Russia	LOCATION	to be a hell , almost out of the world , it will be a surprise to many that the conclusions of this competent observer are distinctly favor - able to its fundamental idea , as compared with the penal systems of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		This fundamental idea is '' the utilization of the prisoner for the highest good of the state . '' ''

		The state does not seek to punish the prisoner , but to profit by him .

		The segregation of the prisoner to the service of the state implies protection of society from the criminal .

		In accordance with the general imperial policy as described , the minute the prisoner arrives at his Siberian destination , he is asked what he ean do best .

		If there is no pressing reason to the eoa - trary , he is at once employed accordingly .

		If he has DO special skill , he is put to such work as the settle - ment most needs .

		Or , if the prisoner shows special capacity , he may be put nnder training in one of the prison shops as an apprentice .

		If during his probation - ary prison period be has commended himself , he is not oniv allowed to do the best he can for himself outside the prison under mild surveillance , but , to get started , may receive temporary help from the officials , subject to reimbursement at fixed rates .

		This especially applies to agricultural laborers , who receive allotments of land , clothes , rations , implements , cattle , seed , etc. , for two years .

		This is done systematically by the state , not for the good of the prisioner , but for its own benefit .

		Scattered throughout
Siberia	LOCATION	, in its towns and cities , are scores of millionaires , the results of that system ; and the more of these the better the
Government	ORGANIZATION	likes it , because this all reacts to the benefit of the state .

		... Under this system the
Russian Government	ORGANIZATION	does not waste its murderers , but , like a wise sanitary engi - neer dealing with sewage , protects society against them by removing them and then utilizing them , so that , instead of loss , the state gets an actual profit .

		That there is punishment to the prisoner from first to last .

		The cruelties of which we read , -- the com - mon accounts of which Dr.
Howard	PERSON	believes to have been generally exaggerated , though he himself gives some very revolting instances of prison punishments of the worst grade of of - fenders , -- he ascribes to the maladministration inevitable under an absolute government , and under conditions of remoteness from the central authority .

		We commend our readers to the author 's chapter on this subject , including an elaborate comparison of results with those of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		The book is full of interest for its vivid de - scriptions , as well as for the information it contains .

		One chapter tells of the punishment by the knout , one case of which the author , alone of foreigners , saw and followed up by hospital observation .

		Another chapter is on the physiognomy and the remorse of mur - derers , -- and with ten thousand of them around him through a whole

		CUSHING AND HIS WORK AMONG THE ZuNi Indians .

		* Mr.
Cushing	PERSON	's life at
Zuni	ORGANIZATION	is perhaps the incident in American anthropological research which is best known to the general public .

		He was probably the first of our ethnologists who actually took up his abode in an Indian town merely for purposes of study .

		In mag - azine articles and lectures , he has himself given us glimpses of his life at Zuni -- of his reception by the kindly old governor , of his experiences with his fellow-townsmen , of his adoption into their priesthoods .

		Other writers from time to time have given further details ; among the most interesting of these descrip - tions is an article entitled '' An Aboriginal Pilgrimage , '' in which the journey of the Zuni priests to the
Ocean of Sunrise	ORGANIZATION	is de - lightfully chronicled .

		Few persons , however , have ever realized fully the hardships and trials and disease which the earnest investi - gator suffered in pursuing his investigations .

		Did time and space permit , we would gladly sketch
Cushing	PERSON	's life-work ; but we can only refer to a few points .

		The work
Cushing	PERSON	did was preeminently practical .

		At Zuni , he spoke * ZuNi Folk-Tales .

		the language of the people , he wore their dress he ate their food ; he assisted in their councils , he participated in their ceremonials .

		When studying an art or an industry , he was only satisfied after he had himself mastered the technique .

		Was it pottery ?

		-- he must him - self shape a vessel ; was it weaving ?

		-- he must himself fabricate a blanket ; was it arrow - making ?

		-- he must himself be able to smooth the stick , to feather the shaft , to shape the point .

		When investigating mythologies , his mystical and poetical nature came easily into rapport with those of the shamans whose cos - mogonic legends he was writing down .

		Unfortunately ,
Cushing	PERSON	wrote but little .

		Brief articles by him , of uneven value , are widely scattered through periodicals ; there are fragmentary reports of the archaeological ex - pedition into the
Salt River Valley	LOCATION	;
Edna Dean Proctor	PERSON	's '' Song of the Ancient People '' was inspired and commentated by him .

		Three papers of the highest importance appeared in annual Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology -- ''
Zuni Fetiches	PERSON	, '' '' A Study of Pueblo Pot - tery , '' '' Outlines of Zuiii Creation Myths . ''

		In connection with the Pepper -
Hearst Expedition	ORGANIZATION	, he published a '' Preliminary Report on the Exploration of Ancient Key-dweller Remains on the Gulf-coast of
Florida	LOCATION	. ''

		The work here reported was one of the most startling and in - teresting in all American archaeology .

		In his last years , Mr.
Cushing	PERSON	worked in collabora - tion with Dr.
Culin	PERSON	, of the
University of Penn	ORGANIZATION	- sylvania , upon Indian games ; and a report of their work will appear in the future .

		Valuable as this work is , and considerable as it would be for an ordinary investigator , it is small in comparison with the enormous mass of material which Cushing must have gathered during his years of industry , the greater part of which will probably never see the light .

		We are grateful , then , in a special degree , for the fact that some of that material , left almost ready for publication by the author , now ap - pears as a handsome book under the title of '' Zuni Folk-Tales . ''

		It has been published under the care of an editorial committee , of which Dr.
F. W. Hodge	PERSON	is the active member .

		It is a worthy memorial of
Cushing	LOCATION	, the man and the student .

		An excellent portrait of him forms the frontispiece ; an introduction by Major

		THE DIAL .

		119 The stories themselves are not the great legends of the tribe .

		They are not the co '' - mogonic story , nor the migration legend , nor the hero myth , -- though cosmogonic and mi - gration and hero elements occur in them .

		They are rather the simple , every-day , popular tales .

		Many of them deal with the twin heroes , '' the beloved twain '' ; their adventures in destroying monsters , in freeing captives , in making love , are favorite popular themes .

		Others are coyote stories ; this animal , at once cunning and a fool , is always trying to imitate others , and always getting into difficulty .

		In these animal tales , considerable shrewdness and keen obser - vation of animal life and character are shown .

		Other stories tell of the adventurer of poor and neglected youths or maidens , and of warriors bold .

		Naturally , one of the great values of the collection is the light that is incidentally thrown by it upon the life of the people to whom it relates .

		Modes of hunting , dress , fondness for ornament , tools , weapons , implements , forms of civility , modes of courting , -- these and a hundred other ethnographic facts are brought ont .

		A second value of the collection is the opportunity it gives for comparison with other tales ; this is equally great , whether we see in such resemblances evidence of contact or a common origin , or merely exemplification of the uniform action of the hnman mind every - where when similar conditions are presented .

		Some resemblances in these Zuni tales to stories told elsewhere are fairly startling , and raise many interesting questions .

		Lastly , these stories give glimpses of racial psychology .

		And here the simplicity and directness of
Cushing	LOCATION	's transcription is important .

		Interesting indeed are the runs , or formal phrases , which recur again and again , but especially at the beginning and end of tales .

		The poetical strain which runs through many , and the bold employment of metaphor and other figures , are delightful .

		Constantly , too , we gain a knowledge of the animistic ideas of the Indian and of his mon - sters , divine beings , etc. .

		The editor of the volume has wisely omitted comment and explanation .

		Notes and sug - gestions , unless
Cushing	PERSON	's own , would have fitted badly .

		As it stands , the book will ap - peal to two sets of readers .

		Many will read it for itself ; for it has a quaintness , a flavor , a charm , and a character that warrant its gen - eral reading .

		It will be read by the student for its folk-lore content and its ethnographic importance .

		And for whatever reason it is read , or by whatever readers , it will increase knowledge of , and sympathy for , those simple Zuni folk with whom Gushing lived and whom he loved .

		The general reader does not wish annotation : the scientific investigator will sup - ply his own .

		One story of the collection , indeed , is reprinted from the '' Journal of American Folk-lore '' ; it is told for the sci - entist , and has
Cushing	ORGANIZATION	's own notes .

		It has its value , but its simplicity , its charm , its soul , are lost in the preparation of it for the scien - tific reader only .

		We can but be glad that the others are not annotated ; that they speak more to the heart and less to the mind : that they appeal first to the man , and then to the scholar .

		Such a form of narration is the most fitting in a book which is to stand before the world as a monument to

		Yet the times are changing , and human society is coming to realize that it is something more than an aggregation of individuals .

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, how to use that sharp two-edged tool with which he has so often cut his fingers .

		The works before us illustrate the relation between supply and demand .

		They have not been written , like popular novels , to amuse the public and enrich the authors .

		Their purpose is serious , and they have all cost more labor , no doubt , than can be fairly recompensed by any possible financial returns .

		Nevertheless , they are the articulate expression of a widespread cry , '' What shall we do to be saved ? ''

		They are characteristic of the twentieth century , -- if we may venture to see characteristics in a babe so young .

		Though comparisons are often unfair , we think it not amiss to say at the outset that Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	's '' Democracy and Social Ethics '' is by far the best book of the lot .

		It is , what the others are not , a study at close range ; and yet it has not the common fault of such studies , of lacking a philosophic ground - work .

		Miss Addams knows her people as individuals , yet never loses sight of their rela - tionship to society .

		If we may venture to formulate her remedy for existing social evils , we may say perhaps that it is to give each in - dividual such knowledge of and concern for his social status as he now has for his indi - vidual status .

		By social status we here mean not his rank in society , -- not , in short , the way society treats him , -- but the way he treats society , his utility and efficiency therein .

		By thus shifting and broadening his interests , the pyramid , which formerly stood upon its apex , is placed securely on its base , and that with no loss of individuality .

		If anyone doubts the last statement , let him consider the case of Miss Addams herself .

		Educational methods are criticised because of their failure to give the ordinary workman an understanding of the meaning of his work . ''

		The man in the factory , as well as the man with the hoe , has a grievance beyond being overworked and dis - inherited , in that he does not know what it is all about .

		... If a workingman is to have a conception of his value at all , he must see industry in its unity and entirety ; he must have a conception that will include not only himself and his immediate family and com - munity , but the industrial organisation as a whole . ''

		We may perhaps leave the book with one more significant quotation . ''

		It is as yet most difficult for us to free ourselves from the individualistic point of view sufficiently to group events in their social relations and to judge fairly those who are endeavoring to produce a social result through all the difficulties of associated action .

		The philanthropist still finds his path much easier than do those who are attempting a social morality .

		In the first place , the public , anxious to praise what it recog - nizes as an undoubted moral effort often attended with real personal sacrifice , joyfully seizes upon this mani - festation and overpraises it , recognising the philan - thropist as an old friend in the paths of righteousness , whereas the others are strangers and possibly to be distrusted as aliens .

		It is easy to confuse the response to an abnormal number of individual claims with the response to the social claim .

		An exaggerated personal morality is often mistaken for a social morality , and until it attempts to minister to a social situation its total inadequacy is not discovered . ''

		Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	, in '' Social Salvation , '' pub - lishes a series of lectures which were delivered in
March	DATE	of the present year before the stu - dents of the
Divinity School of Yale Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity .

		The lectures are addressed to men who are preparing for the ministry ; but Dr. Glad - den justly considers that they will be found no less interesting to the lay public .

		The subjects are seven : '' Religion and the Social Question , '' '' The Care of the Poor , '' '' The State and the Unemployed , '' '' Our Brothers in Bonds , '' '' Social Vices , '' '' Public Education , '' '' The Redemption of the
City	LOCATION	. ''

		As might be ex - pected , the style is clear and forcible , and there are many passages worth remembering .

		Per - haps the following is the most significant of the tenor of the work , and of the tendencies we have referred to : '' The truth is that Democracy , with universal suf - frage , is our dispensation ; we are in for it , and we must fight it out along that line ; if we are to be saved at all , we must be saved by the people ; if we are to be re - formed , the reform must
spring	DATE	from the intelligent choice of the people ; it must express their wishes ; the notion that by some sort of hocus-pocus we can get society reformed without letting the people know it does undoubtedly haunt the brains of some astute political promoters , but it will not work . ''

		And again : '' The city of the future which we saw in our dream is simply a great community cooperative for the public good , and in order that the cooperation may be effect - ive , the people must know what is good and how to cooperate .

		And this involves a mighty change in the characters of multitudes of them ! ''

		Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	, like
Miss Addams	PERSON	, finds fault with the social conduct of persons who in pri - vate affairs are above reproach .

		He says : '' The thoroughgoing partisanship of the reputable people is another prime cause of bad government .

		The great majority of moral and upright citizens can be re - lied on to vote the regular ticket if
Beelzebub	ORGANIZATION	is the nominee .

		This infatuation affects deacons and elders of churches , Sunday-school superintendents , staid pro- fessional men , great multitudes of citizens who are on most other subjects tolerably sane . ''

		Yet , with all this , one does not feel that Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	has been able entirely to free himself from a certain bias of caste ; he seems , as it
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 were , to remain elevated in his polpit , looking over the heads of his people rather than meet - ing them face to face .

		Perhaps this impres - sion would not have arisen except by contraat with
Miss Addams	PERSON	's simply direct and frankly Democratic book : but the following passage is illnstrative of the attitude referred to : `` There are always , in snch times -LSB- of depression of trade -RSB- , individuals who have a little money and much good-will , and who feel called upon to give liberally to 5ie relief funds to be administered by certain charities .

		It would be better if they would begin some enterprise of repair or improvement upon their houses or their grounds and would set idle men at work upon it , pay - ing out as wages what they intend to give in charity .

		If the work is not greatly needed , it will be a far greater benefaction to furnish it than to bestow alms upon idle laborers .

		In view of the fact that the work is not needed , the wages offered may fairly be less than tboM paid in flash times , and the trade-unions , in such niKwi , should relax their demands .

		Thus there is an economic adjustment , and the man of good-will serves himself as well as his neighbor by getting his work done more cheaply in the hard times . ''

		Mr.
M. A. Lane	PERSON	's '' The Level of Social Motion '' is , as its sub-title indicates , '' an in - qairy into the future conditions of human society . ''

		In the course of ten chapters the author discusses at great length such subjects as '' The Flow of Moral Energy , '' '' Organism and Environment , '' '' The Increment of Psychic Capacity , '' '' Social Kinetics , '' '' The Law of Capitalization , '' and so forth , hinting every now and then at a law which he has discovered which will shed a flood of light on the intricate questions considered .

		In Chapter XI .

		at last we read , '' the time has now come to lay before the reader the supreme conclusion of oar theory . ''

		This conclusion is , that '' the hnman population of the earth is moving with acceler - ating force toward a mean , or normal number , which , when once reached , can never again be disturbed . ''

		This is explained by the suppo - sition that as wealth is generally diffused , in - telligence will become universal ; and as it is snp | > osed that an increased use of the brain checks fertility , the race will begin to diminish in numbers .

		Hereupon , however , the most fertile individuals will be preserved by natural selection , and the result will be an increased but more stupid population .

		This increase , however , will again be checked by the demand which will arise for intelligent mates , and sexual selection will restore the equilibrium .

		This is a very brief statement of the author 's position , but we hope it is accurate .

		For his own part , the writer of these lines can only say that he has given many hours to the study of the book , and has read the '' supreme conclusion '' twice , but is quite unable to make sense of it .

		The author appears to be sincere and diligent , and of course incidentally says many things which are true ; bat we think he has built him a house of gossamer .

		Dr.
A. C. Hall	PERSON	, in his '' Crime in its
Bela	PERSON	- tion to Social Progress , '' defines a crime as '' any act or omission to act , punished by society as a wrong against itself . ''

		A sin , therefore , is not necessarily a crime , nor is a crime in - variably a sin ; moreover , a crime must be an offense that is punished , not merely threatened with punishment by statute .

		From this con - ception of crime , which is endorsed by the best authorities , it follows that it can not exist except in organized societies , and that it increases with civilization .

		All progressive societies are continually creating new crimes , and the num - ber of persons violating the law is thereby in - creased .

		For example , in
England	LOCATION	numbers of people are now annually arrested for cruelty to animals , not sending their children to school , and not complying with the vaccination act , -- crimes which were unimaginable as snch nof long ago .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	therefore insists that we should regard the increase of '' criminals , '' not with alarm , but actually as a sign of social health and progress .

		We may look forward to a time when crime will be unknown owing to the perfect socialization of every individual ; but in the meanwhile -- and it must be a long while -- progress toward this ideal condition is necessarily accompanied by friction , manifest - ing itself as crime .

		For the rest , the bulk of the book consists of an interesting historical study of crime ; a little too like a scrap-book , we think , while some of the stories of animal crimes are likely to afford merriment to the scoffer .

Madame Van Mayden	ORGANIZATION	, the translator and editor , is by marriage a great-great-grand - daughter of the letter-writer .

		The fact that Vol - taire borrowed these letters of travel from their writer , read them , and praised them as both enter - taining and nseful , is their sufficient endorsement .

		The state of English society revealed by them is not exactly calculated to make one a praiser of the past .

		The young foreigner witnessed the hanging of the notorious
Jonathan Wild	PERSON	, an execution that was regretted by many good people on the ground that they should thenceforth have no one to whom to go to recover their stolen property at half its value , -- this system of money-raising on stolen goods having been brought to a state of perfection by the robber-captain .

		Criminals were executed every six weeks at
Tyburn	LOCATION	, in batches of five , ten , and even fifteen .

		Popular amusements were of a most degrading character .

		Water , although abun - dant and good , was unknown as a beverage , says the author .

		More grain is said to have been used for beer than for bread .

		An especially entertain - ing chapter is devoted to the coronation of George II .

		and
Queen Caroline	PERSON	.

		The coronation proces - sion was composed of seventy-two divisions and was ^ f unprecedented '' pomp and magnificence . ''

		A carious after-piece to the banquet at
Westminster Hall	ORGANIZATION	was the letting in of the populace after the invited guests had dined and departed .

		The result was the speedy disappearance , not only of every - thing eatable and drinkable , but of all things mov - able as well , including the tables and benches .

		Nine illustrations and a map , from contemporary sources , add to the value and interest of this highly readable volume .

C. R. Mann	PERSON	and
R. A. Millikan	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	to bring out a translation of Drude 's '' Theory of Optics '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The great merit of this work lies in the fact that it includes an authoritative presenta - tion of the results of original work in the past decade in this field of physics , by a leader in the science .

		Indeed , the book itself , in the section devoted to physical optics , contains some original hypotheses of the author .

		We find here , for the first time in English , a satisfactory presentation of the theory of optical instruments as elaborated by Abbe and his followers .

		In the department of physical optics , the author sets forth very fully the electromagnetic theory as to the nature of light .

		The ion-hypothesis of
Helmholtz	ORGANIZATION	is adopted as the simplest , most intelligible , and most consistent way of presenting dispersion , absorption , and rotary polarization , as well as magneto-optical phenomena and the optical properties of bodies in motion .

		The discussion of the relation of optics to thermo - dynamics and to the kinetic theory of gases serves not only to illustrate the interrelations of the sci - ences , but also to demonstrate the virility with which this domain of science has been exploited .

		There is nothing better in English , or in any other language , which gives in such small compass so full and complete a presentation of the science of mod - ern optics .

		The book is written for the physicist , and presupposes a knowledge of differential and integral calculus .

		In the preface to the translation , Professor
Michelson	PERSON	states that no one who desires to gain an insight into the most modern aspects of optical research can afford to be unfamiliar with this remarkably original and consecutive presenta - tion of the subject of optics .

		`` '' > `` ° `` ```` ``'' y `` -LRB- Dodd -RRB- will bring pleasure to countless readers , glad of an opportunity to have him discourse to them once more with all his old-time grace and lucidity .

		The title of the book , '' Fashions in Literature , '' taken from the opening essay , is hardly represen - tative .

		Many of the papers were originally ad - dresses , and their topics are more often social than literary .

		The education of the negro , the charac - teristics of the American newspaper , the proper disposition of criminals , the civic ideals we should strive toward and the national conditions we must face , the relation of literature to the stage and of truth to literature , -- all these diverse matters are discussed with characteristic lightness of touch and suggestive largeness of view .

		Most of the papers belong to the closing years of a long and full life , but there is no trace in them of the acerbity or dis - illusionment of age .

		Instead , we find genial humor , unfailing but not unreasoning optimism , and infec - tious enthusiasm for the best in American life and letters ; and we close the book with a sense of widened reach and deepened insight that it is within the gift of few American men of letters to impart .

		`` The man who publishes a book i ^ ^ Laiina without an index ought to be damned ten miles beyond Hell , where the Devil could not get for stinging-nettles . ''

		Mr.

		The practical directions as to index-making , occupying about half the book , are the result of long experience , and contain suggestions which even the expert will find profitable .

		sapposed to be a reference to the passage * ■ Mr.

		The closing chapter of the book is a well-argued plea in behalf of a general or universal index , in the course of which Mr.
Wheatley	PERSON	pays just tribute to the memory of Dr.
W. F. Poole	PERSON	, greatest of American indexers .

		The volume concludes , as it should , with an index which stands as a model of the author 's precepts .

		Mr.

		After showing the utter inefficiency of the armies and the military organization of the earlier part of the century , he gives us an elaborate and authoritative discussion of the army as remodelled by
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	.

		As is necessary in treating of this army alone , there are chapters on Religion in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and Politics in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is a real contribution to the history of the period .

		Without seeing the sub-title , '' And the Classical Circle of
Weimar	LOCATION	, '' even the semi-initiated knew that the particular duchess was
Anna Amalia	PERSON	or Louise of
Saxe	PERSON	-
Weimar	LOCATION	.

		The handsome outfitting of the two large volumes was a confirmation of the anticipated treat .

		But alas , for a lost op | > ortn - nity !

		To portray the court of Saxe-Weimar in its best estate was a task challenging the highest grade of critical , historical , and literary skill .

		It could not be done well without an intimate knowledge and appreciation of the great German authors who frequented that court , and it ought to have been ondertaken only by a person of broad and cosmo - politan spirit who could judge both human beings and monarchs .

		The author of the present book ,
F. Gerard	PERSON	, manifests none of these qualifications .

		It is the product apparently of a '' Ejunmerjungfer , '' with all her worshipful and tremulous awe of titles , her interest in costumes and tittle-tattle , her igno - rance of literature and the deep interests of indi - Tidaals and nations , and her abominable English .

		Qootation-marks around pet words , italics for others , French and German words unnecessarily introduced and elaborately explained , commonplace informa - tion conscientiously injected into parentheses and foot-notes , and everywhere the showman 's '' Let as next '' and the fondly cherished editorial '' We , '' -- all these could be forgiven if only there were soma strong quality to compensate .


Anna Amalia	PERSON	does not lack heroic and pathetic elements , but they are not here .

		Her daily life would have been an inter - esting study in the court manners of the eighteenth century , but it is not here .

		Her relations with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and

Henry E. Bourne	PERSON	, is a volume of the `` American Teachers ' Series '' published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a much-needed volume , and its scope is com - mensurate with the importance of a subject which is only just coming to its own in our educational pro- grammes .

		The work has two sections , the first being on '' The Study and Teaching of History , '' and the second on '' The Course of Study . ''

		The second part , in par - ticular , is full of direct practical usefulness to the teacher on account of its syllabi and its bibliographies .

		We can commend this work very highly . ''

		Some of the Rhymes of Ironquill , '' a volume con - siderably expanded from earlier editions , but still lead - ing off with the ridiculous doggerel of '' The Washer - woman 's Song , '' is published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		These rhymes , as is now generally known , are the product of Mr.
Eugene F. Ware	PERSON	, of
Topeka	LOCATION	, whose recent appointment to a federal position by President
Roosevelt	PERSON	was probably meant in good faith to be an official recognition of American literature , and will doubtless add not a little to the vogue of the rhyme - ster .

		Although these efforts have , in fact , no relation whatever to literature , they constitute an entertaining sort of grimly humorous journalism , and our only quarrel with them is that innocent readers here and there may take them to be a form of poetry .

		Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	is , it seems , already an '' author '' in the sense of attaining to a standard library edition of his complete writings .

		It is a sub - scription edition , in ten volumes , styled the '' Beacon , '' -LRB- which befits a '' maker '' who alternates between light - house and literature -RRB- , and is published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		There are illustrations in color , a portrait , and several stories hitherto unpub - lished in book form . ''

		Caleb West , '' ''
Laguerre	PERSON	's and Well - Worn Roads , '' '' Colonel
Carter	PERSON	, '' and '' A White Umbrella in
Mexico	LOCATION	'' are the four volumes now at hand , and the other six will follow in rapid succession .

		Dr.
Willard Clark Gore	PERSON	is the author of a mono - graph on '' The Imagination in
Spinoza	LOCATION	and
Hume	PERSON	, '' published in the ''
University of Chicago Contributions to Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The object of the work , says the writer , '' is to make a specific test , or at least to find an illustration , of the general proposition that philoso - phy , or metaphysics , and psychology form a logical partnership , or organic unity , which can not be ignored or dissolved without impairing interests that each holds to be peculiarly its own . ''

		The interest of this theme , combined with Mr.
Gore	PERSON	's attractive and lucid hand - ling , makes the study one of much value .

		Mr.
Edwyn Robert Bevar	PERSON	is the latest of translators to attempt the '' Prometheus Bound '' of .31 schylus , and his version appears in a simply sumptuous octavo , with wide margins , from the press of Messrs.
Ballantyne	PERSON	,
Hanson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with the publisher 's imprint of Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	.

		The translator contributes a brief preface and a lengthy introduction .

		In the former he explains that the Elizabethan drama , the English Bible , and the Miltonic epic have been , in a sense , the models for his guidance -- truly a wise and well-considered choice .

		Certainly he has produced a vigorous and dignified version of '' the most sublime poem in the world '' -- a version that will at least compare favorably with any of its rivals . ''

		The Ancestor , '' a new periodical publication of English origin , for which the Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	are the American agents , starts out with an issue dated
April	DATE	, to be a quarterly review ; but the single number is in fact a handsome volume of large octavo size , bound in substantial boards .

		Considering the illustra - tions and the well-nigh sumptuous character of the paper and print , the price of a dollar and a half per part is surprisingly moderate .

		Among the contrib - utors , most of whom are titled , the name of Mr.
J. Horace Round	PERSON	figures no less than four times in the first table of contents , which promises well for the his - torical scholarship of the undertaking .

		Upwards of a score of full-page plates , besides others in the text , constitute the illustrations of this volume .

		`` Meteorite Studies , '' by Mr.

Mexico	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Seth Eugene Meek	PERSON	, are recent pub - lications of the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	. ''


Jack Sheppard	PERSON	'' and '' Rookwood , '' each in two vol - umes , and `` Flitch of
Bacon	LOCATION	, '' in one , are recent addi - tions to the `` Windsor '' edition of
W. H. Ainsworth	PERSON	's novels , published by the
J. B. Lippineott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Eiekiel , '' edited by Dr.
O. C. Whitehouse	PERSON	, and `` Jeremiah '' and `` Lamentations , '' edited by Mr.
E. Tyrell Green	PERSON	, are the latest volumes of the ''
Temple Bible	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by the
J. B. Lippineott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Hymns of the Faith '' is the English title given by Mr.
Albert J. Edmunds	PERSON	to his translation of the ``
Dham	PERSON	- mapada , '' made from the
Pali	ORGANIZATION	dialect of Sanskrit , and now published by
the Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Preprints from the forthcoming `` Decennial Publi - cations of the L'niversity of
Chicago	LOCATION	'' are coming to us every few days .

		The latest of them is a masterly study of '' Credit , '' by Professor
J. Laurence Laughlin	PERSON	, a quarto pamphlet of twenty-eight pages .

		A revised edition of Messrs.
Herriek	PERSON	and
Damon	PERSON	's `` Composition and Rhetoric for Schools '' has just been published by Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	,
Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The mod - ifications are in the direction of simplification , but the substance of the earlier edition remains intact .

		An important novel dealing with the careers of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, and their great expedition , will be published in
November	DATE	by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Neither author nor title has yet been announced , but the work is understood to be from the pen of a well-known writer From the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	we have a useful '' List of References on Reciprocity , '' compiled by Mr.
A. P. C. Griffin	PERSON	.

		Books , periodical references , and con - gressional documents upon the subject are catalogued in three lists , and the whole is supplemented by an index of authors .

		`` Harold 's Discussions '' is the fifth volume of the `` Nature-Study Readers '' prepared by Mr.
J. W. Troeger	PERSON	and Miss
Edna Beatrice Troeger	PERSON	, and pub - lished by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	.

		The chapters are concerned with elementary geology , physiography , astronomy , and biology .

		The presentation of the mat - ter is simple and attractive .

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of a new set of school geographies , two in number , which are the work of Mr.
H. Justin Roddy	PERSON	.

		They are , respec - tively , '' ElemenUry '' and '' Complete , '' and aim at a more simplified treatment of the subject than is found in most school books upon this subject .

		``
Schiller	PERSON	's Einfluss auf Grillparzer , by Mr.
O. E. Lessing	PERSON	, and `` The Time ElemenU of the Orestean Trilogy , '' by Mr.
Jonathan Bayley Browder	PERSON	, are two additions to the '' Philology and Literature Series '' of
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both are doctoral dis - sertations , and both are creditable to their authors and to the institution whence they proceed .

		The popularity still enjoyed by the Rev.
S. Baring	PERSON	-
Gould	PERSON	's '' Vicar of Morwenatow '' is attested by an '' eighth edition '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Aside from the pleas - ing features of the book , its value as a biography can perhaps be estimated by striking a mean between the high praise with which the ``
Saturday	DATE	Review '' greeted its first appearance , and the scathing condem - nation it met with from `` The Athenasum . ''

		Messrs.
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish `` The Home Aquarium , '' by Mr.
Eugene Smith	PERSON	.

		This book gives simple praetical directions for keeping the common fauna and flora of our lakes and streams , as well as for the determination of their species .

		For those whose ambition rises above a globe of goldfish it is just the book needed .

		Professor
Earle W. Dow	PERSON	has made a translation , which is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of the chapter on '' The Feudal Regime '' in the '' Histoire G ^ n ^ rale '' of MM .

		Lavisse and
Rambeand	ORGANIZATION	.

		This chap - ter is the work of Professor
Charles Seig	PERSON	^ oboe , and in nowise suffers from its present detachment .

		Mr.
William Frederick Harvey	PERSON	has translated from the Danish , and
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have pub - lished , the learned treatise of Dr.
Christopher Nyrop	PERSON	npon `` The Kiss and its History . ''

		It is an instructive book , and also an entertaining one , prefaced by a warn - ing '' as to the danger of even reading about kisses , '' which is not likely , we fancy , to make any reader close the volume for fear of being led astray .

		We are indebted to a correspondent in
Japan	LOCATION	, Mr.
E. W. Clement	PERSON	, for the following interesting paragraph : '' It is generally supposed that languages , like poets , are ' born , not made ' ; and that the changes in a lan - guage come , not artificially , but naturally .

		But we are now treated to the spectacle of an attempt to effect a tremendous reform in a language , many centuries old , by legislative enactment .

		And the nation which is making this apparently foolish and useless attempt is
Japan	LOCATION	, which has already often startled the world by its marvellous reforms .

		And if its wonderful success in legislative reforms in other lines are any criterion in this case , it will succeed in effecting much-needed re - form in its language .

		At the last session of the Imperial Diet of
Japan	LOCATION	, a sum of money was appropriated for a ' linguistic commission . '

		This was appointed in the spriug of this year , has held several meetings , and has already arrived at some decisions .

		It has been decided , for instance , that ' a phonographic script ' is to be em - ployed ; but the much discussed question , whether it shall be the common Japanese kana -LRB- syllabic charac - ters -RRB- or Roman letters is still on the docket .

		It is also proposed to reduce the number of Chinese idiographs in common use .

		Moreover , the difference * between the written and the spoken language are to be abolished ; and the formal epistolary style is to be reformed .

		It has also been decided that the whole system of Japanese etymology must be ' carefully revised . '

		Even the ` problem of local dialects ' is to be attacked , and ' a standard dialect fixed . '

		It is noticeable that the com - mission is not afflicted with trepidity , but is proceeding with the utmost courage to attack the most difficult problems .

		It is composed of some of the most practical , as well as the most scholarly , men of the Empire ; and its work will be watched with the deepest interest , both at home and abroad .

		And the great changes already effected in the Japanese language since the country was opened are some warrant for believing that this com - mission will achieve a measure of snooess . ''

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	has already written three successful books -- `` Jerry the Dreamer , '' `` The Money Captain , '' and `` The Story of

		They deal with

		It is realism of the most brilliant kind , and yet there is as much romance and excitement in this kind of life as in the old days of chivalry .

		The reader enjoys it all the more because it is familiar .

		The titles of the stories are as follows : ' In the Panic , '' `` A Day in Wheat , '' `` The Plant at High Grove , '' `` The Chairman 's Politics , '' `` The Lame Boy , '' `` The Salt Crowd 's Trade , '' `` The End of the Deal . ''

		Mr.

		BRIEFER MENTION 168 ^ ` OTES 16S AN ` NOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS ... U59 -LRB- A claasfied list of books announced for publication dorii ^ the eoming Fall and
Winter	DATE	aeaaon . -RRB-

		BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		In making these few random notes upon the lists of publishers ' announcements for the season now opening , we are compelled to ex - dude many important categories altogether , and to confine our attention to the books that have some relation to literature in the narrower sense -- that is , to books which contain litera - ture or are concerned with literary history and criticism , with an occasional excursion into the allied realms of history and biography .

		Even with this restriction , we must be confined to the mention of a very few names and titles , delib - erately ignoring many others that are perhaps no less important than those singled out for comment .

		The book of the year , if we mean by that expression the book that will attract the widest attention and be made the subject of the most extensive discussion , is pretty likely to be Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's long-awaited biogfraphy of
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		It is fortunate for
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's memory that Mr.
Morley	PERSON	should have been chosen for his biog ^ pher , and we are sure that the author will do all that literary art can ac - complish to make of
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's figure a living personality for the coming generations .

		Other - wise ,
Gladstone	PERSON	would be in danger of becom - ing little more than the shadow of a name for the general reader of the twentieth century .

		He could not be ignored by the historian , but he could easily be forgotten by the great read - ing public .

		All that he has left b `` hind him in the way of published speeches and miscel - laneous writings is so nearly unreadable , and so utterably inadequate to convey any notion of the power that impressed itself upon his contemporaries that , in default of a great biog - raphy , his fame would be in danger of eclipse within a very few years .

		We have no doubt that Mr.
Morley	PERSON	has produced a great biog - raphy , sympathetic and thoroughly-informed ; we have no means of foretelling whether it will be finally ranked with his
Cobden	PERSON	, or with his trio of French biographical studies .

		Those who cherish
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's memory will devoutly hope that the latter will be its fate .

		Xow that Mr.
Morley	PERSON	has got into the way of writing ag ^ in , may we not express a parenthetic wish that the series of '' Twelve English Statesmen '' may be 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, made twelve in number no less than in name by the early addition of the life of
Chatham	LOCATION	that Mr.
Morley	PERSON	agreed to write when the series was first projected many years ago .

		If Mr.
Morley	PERSON	remains in any active sense the editor of the '' English Men of Letters '' series he is to be congratulated upon the new lease of life recently taken by that enterprise .

		Three new volumes of the series have already been published , and are reviewed in our present issne ; no less than eleven others are now announced as in preparation .

		The choice of biographers has in every case that peculiar ele - ment of fitness which has always distinguished this series of books above all others with which comparisons might be made .

		Hitherto Haw - thorne has been the sole American representa - tive of English literature in the series , but of the new volumes projected no less than four are to have American subjects .

		We note in this connection that the series of ''
American Men of Letters	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has , like its English prototype , been neglected for many years , is now to be extended by the addition of several new volumes .

		While upon the subject of literary and other biography , we may record a number of prom - ised books that may be anticipated with much satisfaction .

		The Kev .


Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	's '' Memories of a Hundred Years '' has already appeared in serial instalments , but we shall be glad to have it published in permanent form .

		An authorized biography of
Bret Harte	PERSON	has been prepared by Mr.
T. Edgar Pember	PERSON	- ton , and can not well fail to prove interesting .

		The elaborate biography of Christopher Col - umbus upon which Mr.
John Boyd Thacher	PERSON	has been working for many years promises to be one of the most sumptuous publications of the season .

		The devotion of a son , in the one case , and of the widow in the other , will pro- vide us , respectively , with two volumes of the letters of
Charles Darwin	PERSON	, and a two-volume life of
Max Miiller	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's two-volume work , '' Studies of a Biographer , '' will have many subjects , and will illustrate once more the author 's singularly happy and incisive method of literary portraiture .

		The recent
Dumas	PERSON	centenary has called attention to the fact that we have in English no life of the novelist better than
Fitzgerald	ORGANIZATION	's hack com - pilation , a defect which now promises to be remedied by the appearance of two new biog - raphies , the work , respectively , of Mr.
Henry A. Spurr	PERSON	and Mr.
Arthur F. Davidson	PERSON	.

		Probably the most important historical an - nouncement of the season is that the first of the twelve projected volumes of '' The Cam - bridge Modern History '' is ready for publica - tion .

		Although the death of
Lord Acton	ORGANIZATION	has made necessary the appointment of a new editor -LRB- Mr.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	-RRB- , the work will be continued upon the original plans , and the volumes may be expected in fairly rapid suc - cession . ''

		The Renaissance '' is the title of the initial volume of the series .

		In this con - nection we may mention the two volumes of Lord
Acton	PERSON	's '' Historical Lectures ' '' that are soon to appear .

		The late
John Fiske	PERSON	will be represented this year by three posthumous volumes .

		Two of the three are `` Essays His - torical and Literary , '' and the third is ''
New France	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	, '' which will fill the gap in the American series , and provide a continuous history of our country from the discovery to the beginning of the constitu - tional period .

		Another work of great impor - tance in this field is the illustrated '' History of the American People '' upon which Presi - dent
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	has long been engaged , and which will soon be in our hands .

		It will occupy five large volumes , and will supply a a real want .

		The most important announcement in the field of literary history is the new `` Illustrated History of English literature '' upon which Mr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	and Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	have for some time been engaged .

		The work will fill four large volumes , and represents a type of history which has long been familiar in the principal European countries , but which for some strange reason has not hitherto been attempted for our own literature .

		The series of '' Literatures of the World '' is to have two additions this season .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	will pub - lish his history of modern Scandinavian liter - ature , and no man living is better qualified for this undertaking .

		For the American litera - ture in the same series the services of Profes - sor
William P. Trent	PERSON	have been enlisted , which is also a happy choice .

		Mr.
Trent	PERSON	is likely to write as good a book as that which we owe to Professor
Wendell	PERSON	, and it will doubtless be free from those qualities which have made the latter work irritating to a cer - tain class of readers .

		A history of German literature by Professor
John G. Robertson	PERSON	is a work that we shall await with much interest .

		If the four new volumes in the
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	studies in literature shall prove as ^
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 153 acceptable as their predecessors , they will make an important addition to the student 's outfit .

		Two works in Shakespearian criticism are promised in the shape of Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury 's `` Shakespeare and Voltaire '' and the late
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	's '' Shakespeare and His Forerunners . ''

		The former volume will be wel - come to those who are acquainted with
M. Jusserand	PERSON	's treatment of the same subject , and the latter , to consist of
Lanier	PERSON	's unpub - lished lectures , will add notably to the author 's reputation .

		English poetry promises to be enriched by a new volume of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poems and a collection of • ' New Poems '' by Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	is to have a fourth drama in verse , with ''
David	PERSON	and Bathsheba '' ' for its subject .

		The trans - lation of Sig .

		dAnnunzios '' Francesca da
Rimini	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		will be a true English poem , a statement which can rarely be made concerning a work of verse-translation .

		We are glad also to note that Mr.
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	's '' A Masque of Judgment '' is to be reissued , and thus brought to the atten - tion of the wide circle that this extraordinary poem deserves to reach .

		As for works of fiction they are legion .

		We note a few of the manv titles , restricting the list to books bv well-known novelists . ''

		No Other Way '' is the title of a posthumous story by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	.

		Other novels from across the
Atlan	LOCATION	- tic are ' - The King 's Byways , '' ' by Mr.
Stanley J. Weyman	PERSON	: `` The Vultures , '' by Mr.
Henry Seton Merriman	PERSON	: and '' Love with Honour , '' by Mr.

		Of American origin are the following : '' Captain
Macklin	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	: ``
Cecilia	PERSON	, the Last of the Vestals , '' by Mr.
F. Marion Craw	PERSON	- ford : '' The Fortunes of
Oliver Horn	PERSON	, '' by Mr.

Henry James	PERSON	: '' The Maid-at-Arms , '' by Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	; and * '
Barbara Ladd	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
C. G. D. Rob	PERSON	- erts .

		Two masters of the art of short-story writing , Mr.
T. B. Aldrich	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	, are to have new collections .

		Of foreign novelists , Mr.
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	prom - ises to make us acquainted with a new Pole , Mr.
Alexander Glovatski	PERSON	, his romance being called ' • The Pharaoh and the Priest '' ; while the great German romancer ,
Herr Felix Dahn	PERSON	, will be reintroduced to our public by means of * ' A Captive of the Roman Eagles , '' one of the finest of his later works .

		THE ACTOR AND THE MAN .

		Many readers of the late
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	's biog - raphy mast have been surprised to discover that this man -- go imaginative in his sympathies , so little ascetic in any way -- had the old Paritanic distrnst of the theatre .

		Have as little to do with it as possible , be counsels ; and of the actor 's pro- fession in particular , be believes it to be necessarily enervating to character .

		It is possible that
Brooks	PERSON	had in mind the oatward temptations of stage-life -- Shakespeare 's '' public means that pnblic manners breed . ''

		Bat on second thought one is inclined to believe that his criticism went deeper and struck at the very nature of an art .

		Curiously enough ,
M. Coqnelin	PERSON	, in his defense of the actor 's profession before
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, admits the force of snch a criticism .

		There is a social stigma attaching to the stage , says
Coqaelin	PERSON	; what is its cause ?

		With characteristic French sub - tlety , he makes no reference to the social dangers of stage-life .

		He assumes that the public is suspi - cious , not so much of them , as of the actor 's art itself and its inSaence upon the man .

		It is the impersonator that it regards with instinctive dis - trnst .

		The actor upon the stage is not speaking for himself , he has simply borrowed the emotions of a part : and the belief persists that emotion thus constantly assumed , adopted in fact as a profession , is incompatible with self-respect , if not with sin - cerity .

		Brooks , no doubt , with others of insight , knew that as a matter of fact it might easily de - bauch the moral sense .

		Needless to say , Coquelin ref nted the criticism ; bat I question if any actor could make so serious a defence without himself feeling the force of the doubt that he dismisses .

		If we are to trust the record of a recent novelist , it is an actress whose `` own self gave her pain , the mutability of her features , the strange mimic power possessed by the muscles of her face , the unconscious art that regulated the meaning of her gestures '' ; and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own passionate resentment of his profession reads like something more than mere disgust with stage asso - ciations : '' Alas , 't is trae I hsre ^ ne here and there .

		And made mvself a motlej to the riew .

		Gored mine own tbooshta , sold cheap what ia most daw .

		Hade old offences of affections new ; Host tme it is that I hare look 'd on tmtii Aakanee and strangely ; -- '' This trafficking in the emotions , which is the very soul of dramatic art -- is there any artist who has lent himself to it again and again without once feeling gome loss of personal integrity , some pang of outraged manhood ?

		Yet surely this objection to the stage , if it is tme at all .

		must hold good for every use of the dramatic temperament , for all art where the artist is com - pelled to experiment in the emotions ; and as a mat - ter of fact , dramatists and novelists and poets have 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, been perfectly well aware of the moral paradox in their own calling .

		Keats says of the '' poetic char - acter , '' as he calls it , -- having always in mind
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's genius with its vast susceptibility , -- '' It has no self .

		It is everything and nothing ... What shocks the virtuous philosopher delights the chameleon poet ... It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one , because they both end in speculation . ''

		Imaginative curiosity indulged for its own sake !

		Is that condition of dramatic sym - pathy indeed so harmless to the man ?

		The poet continues with this interesting bit of autobiog - raphy : '' It is a wretched thing to confess ; but it is a very fact , that not one thing I ever utter can be taken for granted as an opinion growing out of my identical nature -- how can it when I have no nature ?

		When I am in a room with people , if I ever am free from speculating on creations of my own brain , then not myself goes home to myself , but the identity of every one in the room begins to press upon me , so that I am in a very little time annihilated . ''

		So then the most typical of poets is authority for the confession of a recent novelist , and Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's '' Sentimental Tommy '' is not the special instance that somehow the aggrieved reader felt like declaring it to be .

		The poetical character has no self .

		It is everything and nothing .

		Sincerity , as plain men and women know sincerity , is impossible to the artist .

		The passions of art are fictitious passions , and the reader is the dupe , if not of professional , at least of artistic sentimentality .

		Somehow it does not put us on better terms with the artist that he is himself included in the deception that he practises -- that he is not a man , but just an emotional subject .

		For the moment we are almost reconciled to the passing of art altogether .

		For one need not be the worst of Philistines and yet instinctively distrust an enjoyment so little self - respecting in its origin , and ask with all serious - ness whether , if the success of the artist does indeed mean the death of character , art itself is worth the price .

		But the statement itself grows more and more questionable as we come to judge it by the history of normal art .

		Is it really the absence of character that serves the artist ?

		Say that the first condition of his art is his impressionability , to which he yields himself at the expense of those convictions , those self-limitations which shape character .

		Yet , with - out convictions , an art has never been known to develop along healthy lines .

		It lacks precisely that constructive inspiration which separates sane art from our modern diseased impressionism -- the im - pressionism of which d'Annunzio and his analysis of the artist-soul in '' The Flame of Life '' is a fla - grant example .

		Mere curiosity about life , the love of emotional and intellectual adventure for its own sake , is no doubt the first motive of the imaginative as opposed to the moral genius .

		But such an ex - perimental mood serves , though at first almost unconsciously , the understanding of life which later inevitably crystallizes into moral conviction .

		Keats himself is forced to this conclusion ; for although his art never had time to grow up , its serious manhood is foreshadowed in those wonder - ful letters of his .

		He sees how that versatile com - prehension , which is at first the sole aim of art , has the tremendous effect of '' sharpening one 's vision into the heart and nature of man -- of convincing one 's nerves that the world is full of misery and heart-break , pain , sickness and oppression . ''

		In other words , the normal artist finds himself grad - ually weaned from his first indifference and detach - ment .

		He begins to feel , as
Keats	PERSON	quotes , '' the bur - den of the mystery , '' and is forced to explore it on his own account .

		One can watch this deepening sincerity in the development of all sound genius .

		A slight but very genuine art , such as
Stevenson	PERSON	's , bears witness to it .

		Of course
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is al - ways the typical example .

		If one should complain , for instance , of the `` Midsummer-Night 's Dream , '' that its author -LRB- to quote
Emerson	LOCATION	-RRB- is simply '' Master of the Revels , '' and has no moral or personal stake in his own creation , one has but to open '' Lear '' to find oneself in the presence of intense moral sympathies and aversions through which a strong personality speaks .

		Evidently , in the development of an art , a man has been maturing , and steadily using the vicarious sympathies of the artist more and more in the service of conviction , of direct and personal passion .

		At any rate ,
M. Coquelin	PERSON	's plea for the dignity of the actor 's profession rested just here .

		He in - sisted that the actor must never really abnegate his own personality .

		For to impersonate , one must also interpret ; and to interpret , the actor must preserve the critical vantage-point -- the vantage - point of individual experience and intellectual con - viction .

		It is a fine point in criticism , which simply goes to prove that the intellectual attitude of the dramatist , if he is to aim at the best success , can - not really differ from that of other serious callings .

		Shakspeare defined in his maturity the mission of the stage , and incidentally , we may suppose , of his own art : '' to hold , as ` twere , the mirror up to nature ; to show virtue her own feature , scorn her own image , and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure . ''

		The most imaginative of men , the most subtle of natures -LRB- `` just within the possibility of authorship , '' to quote Emerson again -RRB- , he justifies his art by its simple moral purpose .

		Was it not precisely this simplicity of aim which kept
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's genius from the re - fined debauchery of what is sometimes pleased to call itself the '' artistic '' temperament ?

		The man was not the creature of his art .

		The art was ever increasingly the product of the man .

		THE DIAL 155 COMM
UNIC	ORGANIZATION	A TION .

		IS `` HAWTHORNE 'S FIRST DIART '' A FORGERY ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of Thjs Dial . -RRB-

		Five years ago
Hoaghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	published for me a little volume with the title `` Hawthorne 's
First Diary	ORGANIZATION	, with an Account of its Discovery and Loss . ''

		Nearly thirty years previous to this publica - tion , I was in correspondence with a mysterious per - son , whom , after his death in
1871	DATE	, I found to be a mulatto named
William Symmes	PERSON	, who was in the em - ploy of Col.
Baker	PERSON	's detective bureau in
Washington	LOCATION	during the Civil War .

		When
Hawthorne	PERSON	, then in his teens , was living with his mother in
Raymond	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, this negro of about his age was living in an adjoining town , and they often hunted , fished , and skated together .

		In a letter sent to me in
1870	DATE	, for publi - cation in a weekly paper with which I was then con - nected ,
Symmes	PERSON	asserted that from a
Maine	LOCATION	soldier hailing from
Raymond	LOCATION	, whom he nursed in a
Virginia	LOCATION	hospital , he obtained a little manuscript volume a sort of diary kept by
Hawthorne	PERSON	when he was between twelve and sixteen years of age .

		I could not induce him to send me the book , but from time to time he copied some of the items from it , and I published them .

		Persons were mentioned in these items who were living when at last they were printed , and they testified to the accuracy with which events within their memory were recorded .

		The style of many of the passages was decidedly Hawthomesque .

		The mulatto refused to take any money for the articles he furnished , and persistently declined to send the manuscript book from which he alleged the items were copied .

		He promised when he next visited
New England	LOCATION	he would bring the book with him .

		He did not come to
New England	LOCATION	; and died in
Florida	LOCATION	soon after making the promise .

		Much search has been made , but the mannscript has never been found .

		It most be confessed that a suspicions mystery en - veloped the whole affair , and yet the literary style and the corroboratory testimony of many persons mentioned in the alleged '' Diary '' inclined me to full belief in its authenticity .

		Hawthorne 's mother and other relatives were constantly referred to precisely as he would be likely to speak of them , and there was a boyish tone in every paragraph that it would require genius ik any middle-aged man to assume .

		Is it imaginable that a comparatively illiterate and uncultured man could have composed this admirable inscription , alleged to have been written on the fly leaf of the `` Diary '' by
Hawthorne	PERSON	's uncle ,
Richard Manning	PERSON	? ''

		Praseated by
Richard Manning	PERSON	, to his nephew
Nathaniel Hathome	PERSON	-LRB- `` c -RRB- , with the advice that he write ont his thon ^ hts , some every day , in as good words as he can , upon any and all subjects , as it is one of the beet means of his ae - eanag for matore yean , eomnumd of thon ^ t and language .

		`` Raymond ,
June 1 , 1816	DATE	. ''

		One item tells of swapping knives with a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	lad named
Robinson Cook	PERSON	.

		An aged
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	of the name wrote to me at once that he well remembered this transaction .

		Many other items were similarly cor - roborated , so that for nearly thirty years I rested in the belief that the '' Diary '' was genuine in spite of the suspicious circumstances mentioned .

		New and very strong evidence to shake this belief has come to me within a few months .

		I have found that one of the items could not possibly have been written by
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, while it may have been forged by
Symmes	PERSON	.

		A curious drowning incident is recorded , with the date missing , as in most of the other items .

		I have found that the story is true in all its details , bat it happened in
1828	DATE	, years after
Hawthorne	PERSON	left
Raymond	PERSON	, and after he ceased to be the boy who pnrports to be writing .

		Symmes , however , was in that vicinity in
1828	DATE	.

		Sm how cunningly be puts the story into
Hawthorne	PERSON	's month , writing forty years after the event described : `` A yonng man named
Henry Jackson , Jr.	PERSON	, was drowned twu days ago , np in
Crooked River	LOCATION	.

		He and one of his friends were trying which conld swim the faster .


Jackson	PERSON	was behind bat gaining ; his friend kicked at him in fnn , thinking to hit bis shoolder and posh him back , bnt mined , and hit his chin , which cansed him to take in water and itiSBsle , aad before his friend conld help or get help , poor JadaoB was fElder
Leach	PERSON	says -RRB- ` beyond the reach of meiey . '

		I read ont of the
Fnlma	LOCATION	to my mother this mom - iae , aad it plainly declares twenty ^ six times , that ` God 's mcey aadnreth forever . '

		I never saw
Henry Jackson	PERSON	, -- he was a jotag man just married .

		Mother is sad ; says she shall not eoBMat to my swimming any more in the mill-poad , with the boys , fearing that in sport my month might -LRB- et kicked open , and then sorrow for a dead son be added to that for my dead father , which she says would break her heart .

		I love to swim , bat shall not disobey my mother . ''

		Let any one who reads this little story try to tell it in fewer or better chosen words , and he will not fail to notice that a master hand guided the pen .

		What could be neater than the criticism of Elder
Leach	PERSON	's funeral sermon , and the mildly humorous turn in r ^ ard to his mother 's misgivings ?

		If
Hawthorne	PERSON	wiote this paragraph it must have been when he was twenty-four years old , and this thought must be dis - missed .

		If
Symmes	PERSON	wrote it , and I see no escape from this alternative , it was done when he was nearly seventy years of age , after a strenuous life as a cook on a sail - ing vessel , and as a spy upon spies during the civil war .

		It must have required the genius of a Chatterton to have foi ^ d that story in language so like what we may imag - ine young
Hawthorne	PERSON	would use .

		And this is only one of many passages in which equal literary skill is shown .

		Some critics I have eoosulted are disposed to believe the bulk of the ■ * Diary '' is genuine , but that
Symmes	PERSON	ventured upon interpolations .

		For my own part , I con - fess I am puzzled , and have lost hope of ever solving the mystery .

		The chapters of the book dealing with
Hawthorne	PERSON	's life in the
Maine	LOCATION	wilderness , and telling the romantic story of the life of
Symmes	LOCATION	, are reliable , having been gathered from many authentic sources .

		Hawthorne 's biographers have not g ^ ven bis life in
Maine	LOCATION	the number of years nor the importance that really belong to it .

		From the age of ten to the time of his graduation he spent a large part of each year in
Raymond	LOCATION	, which is in the same county as
Brunswick	LOCATION	, the seat of his college .

		The mulatto
Symmes	PERSON	is known to have been his companion in boyish sports .

		The father of
Symmes	PERSON	was a leader of the
Maine	LOCATION	bar a century ago , and he gave his illegitimate son his own name .

		For five generations his white ancestors were clergymen of note in
England	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	, and two of them were martyrs in the
Marian	PERSON	persecution .

		If
Symmes	PERSON	was the forger , possibly we may account for his literary skill by sopposing he inherited it from a long line of cultured ancestors .

		He himself knew nothing of this ancestry , and did not even know how to spell his own name !

		Three English Authors .

		* We are glad that a sketch of
William Haz	PERSON	- litt has been included in the new series of `` English Men of Letters , '' and the work of preparing it could hardly , on the whole , have fallen to better hands than those of Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	.


Kobert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	is the man who could have handled the subject almost ideally , and we understand that he once thought of undertaking it , but was de - terred by the repugnance which was caused him by the `` Liber Amoris '' episode .


Hazlitt	PERSON	was the glorified journalist of English litera - ture , but , being essentially a journalist , his work was miscellaneous and fragmentary .

		As such , it does not command the continued in - terest of new generations of readers , and , although the student of literature and the lover of fine writing will always cherish
Hazlitt	PERSON	's writings , they do not appeal to the larger mod - ern public .

		The new edition of his collected work now in course of publication will help to extend his leasehold in popular esteem , but even that will not avail to make a notable in - crease in his following .

		Such a sketch as Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	has prepared , on the other hand , will make many persons acquainted with a writer who has hitherto been little more than a name to them , and will , besides recalling the annals of his career , give them a fair notion of his literary quality , for the author has wisely in - troduced many illustrative extracts , some of considerable length , and amounting altogether to about a third of the entire volume .

		And it would be strange if some few readers , at least , coming upon such a passage as the elo - quent characterization of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, should not at once take
Hazlitt	PERSON	into their affections , and make further acquaintance with his works .

		Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	deals discreetly with the varied career of this acute critic and confirmed senti - mentalist .

		Nothing extenuating , even in the case of
Hazlitt	PERSON	's relations with his wives and other women , but setting down nought in mal - ice , Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	draws a sympathetic portrait of a personality that repelled more than it at - tracted , but that won the esteem of many good men and the steadfast friendship of
Charles • WiixiAM Hazlitt	PERSON	.

		Lamb .

		An index adds materially to the use - fullness of this work , and we wish that the publishers could see their way to provide simi - lar apparatus for all the books of the series to which this belongs .

		The task of preparing an account of ''
George Eliot	PERSON	'' for this series of critical and biographical studies has fallen into the hands of Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, which means for the reader refined intellectual entertainment as well as the discus - sion of the novelist from a broader than the .

		merely literary point of view .

		Sir
Leslie	PERSON	is not only the sanest of literary critics , but he is also a philosophical scholar peculiarly interested in the problems with which ''
George Eliot	PERSON	'' was possibly too much preoccupied for her best in - terests as a novelist .

		He would be the last to deny that a novelist may properly have views upon serious subjects , and make use of fiction as a medium for their expression . ''

		A novel - ist 's facts can prove nothing , for the simple reason that they are fictions ; and his narra - tive when it is reasoning in disguise , becomes intolerable . ''

		This is undoubtedly true , and needs to be said ; but on the other hand , there is much pertinence in the questions that follow the above remark . ''

		What is a poor novelist to do who happens to have been impressed by some of the great masters of thought , such as Plato or Spiuoza , whose philosophies are em - bodied poetry ?

		Is he to forget all the thoughts that have occurred to him in his philosophical capacity , and to write as though he had no more speculations about the world or human nature than the most frivolous of his readers ?

		If his philosophy has really modified his own microcosm , can he drop it when he describes the world ?

		And why should he be called upon to drop it ?

		Must he not , at any rate , have some tinge of psy - chology . ''

		The one who puts these questions is clearly in sympathy with the novelist 's almost avowed purpose of teaching philosophy by example ; but he does not hesitate to note the failures or the imperfect successes of her method .

		The best of her novels , after all , are those in which her social philosophy is most implicit .

		`` The Mill on the Floss '' would probably be the best of them all were it not hopelessly marred by the closing section .

		The impossible Mr.
Stephen Guest	PERSON	is too much for the critic , who sums up in these words the episode of his re - lations with Maggie : '' We might even have forgiven her , if , after being a little overpowered by the dandified
Stephen	PERSON	, she had shown some power of perceiving what a very poor animal he was .

		The affair jars upon us because it is not a development of her previous aspirations , but sud - denly throws a fresh and unpleasant light upon her character ...
George Eliot	PERSON	did not herself under - 1M2 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 157 stand what a mere hair-dresser 's block she was de - scribing in Mr.
Stephen Guest	PERSON	.

		He is another instance of ber incapacity for portraying the opposite sex . ''

		Of the novelist 's one excursion into the region of historical fiction , Sir L #eslie has a rather poor opinion ; but who can say that the follow - ing criticism is essentially unjust ? ''

		When we take up a book in which one is to be a contemporarr with the Borgias , and to have personal interviews with
Klachiavelli	PERSON	we may expect a similar sensation .

		We are to be spectators of a state of things in which the elementary human passions hare been let loose , when violence and treachery are normal parts of the day 's work , when new intellectual horizons hare opened , and yet the old creeds are still potent , and there is the strangest mingling of high aspirations and bmtal indulgence , when the nobler and baser elements of belief are so strangely blended that the rufi & an is still religious , and the enlightened reformer fanatically superstitious .

		If anybody derives any vivid impression of such a world from ■ Romola ' his eyes most be much keener than mine . ''

		It so happens that a book published since this paragraph was written provides an apt illus - tration of Sir
Leslie	PERSON	's comment .

		`` The Resur - rection of the Gods , ' * by the Russian Professor
Merejkowski	PERSON	, deals with precisely the same period of history , and , although without one - half of the technical skill of the novelist which '' Romola '' displays , it does accomplish pre - cisely what we are told that such a work should accomplish .

		A more exact characterization of the Russian work could not be made than is contained in our quotation from Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		When the author comes at last to the history and character of
Daniel Deronda	PERSON	, he strikes fair game .

		If that blameless prig has not yet '' gone the way of all waxworks , '' in Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's phrase , he is pretty gen - erally recognized as the weakest of the novel - ist 's creations , and we can sympathise with the sly fun that Sir
Leslie	PERSON	delights to poke at him .

		His playful and delicious satire infuses the whole chapter devoted to this novel , but would evaporate if any attempt were made to illus - trate by quotations .

		For the ''
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	'' volume in this series the services of Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	have been enlisted , -- a choice that , on the whole , approves itself to the judicious .

		Mr.
Paul	PERSON	has a pointed epigrammatic style that is almost brilliant , although there is about it a certain degree of dogmatic hardness .

		His sympathy with his subject is keen upon the literary side , but rather defective upon the philosophical side , although he is much more satisfactory than Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	in the discussions of Ar - nolds theological and political writings .

		Be - ing a religious conservative as well as a Glad - stonian he oonld hardly be expected to forego a somewhat caustic criticism of
Arnold	LOCATION	's poli - tics and persuasive religious rationalism .

		He indulges in a good deal of rather minute liter - ary criticism -- the sort that singles out lines and phrases for comment -- and it is not al - ways well-advised .

		But of
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's value as a literary critic he has no doubt whatever . ''

		Mr.

		158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, chronologically .

		Some readers would doubtless prefer a division of these subjects which would give each a volume by itself .

		The author 's pages do not seem to exhibit any common vin - culum uniting the two .

		A final chapter of the second volume is devoted to a terse but clear and instructive resume of the international complications growing out of the war .

		The third volume closes with a chapter treating in a similar manner of the international relations of the
United States	LOCATION	between
1867	DATE	and
1877	DATE	.

		The eminently valuable portion of this work is its constitutional history .

		The presentation of the important subjects of Secession ,
Eman	PERSON	- cipation , the
National Powers	ORGANIZATION	of the Govern - ment , and the War Powers of the Executive in their constitutional relations , is profound and scholarly , and is seasoned with the author 's well-known fearlessness and impartiality .

		The cause of Secession is shown to have been constitutionally and morally groundless ; con - stitutionally because the only real grievance of the secessionists was , that after
March 4 , 1861	DATE	, the legally elected and installed govern - ment of the
United States	LOCATION	would be in the con - trol of a party which would probably legislate contrary to the wishes of the secessionists , on subjects admittedly within the legislative power ; and morally , because the secessionists had been offered compromises , liberal beyond reason , to induce them to abandon their at - tempted secession .

		Our author places fitting emphasis upon the willingness of the Repub - lican leaders in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to avoid war by supporting an irrepealable amendment to the Constitution , forever protecting slavery in the
States	LOCATION	.

		This was the supreme test of their desire for peace .

		They are to be '' considered as having offered everything that could have been expected from wise , honest , and sincere men , for the pacification of the country , and , from the point of view of a sound political science , more than they ought to have done . '' '

		Our author here makes clear his settled opinion that every normal constitution essen - tially requires provisions for its own amend - ment ; so the Eepublicans of
1861	DATE	were conceding unwisely in favoring the
Corwin	PERSON	amendment .

		`` An irrepealable , unamendable provision in a Con - stitution in regard to anything is a rotten spot , which threatens decay to the whole Constitution .

		It is a standing menace to the peaceable development of any political system .

		It is the most direct contradiction possible of one of the most fundamental principles of political science , the principle that the amending power in a constitution , the legally organized sovereign power in the political system of a country , must be able to deal with any and every subject ... The proposition to withdraw from its operation the most serious and burning question of our political ethics was a proposition to set the clock of ages back a century and more , so far as concerned the advancement of liberty and of the science of government .

		... It meant the reversal , in principle , of the chief advance which we had made in the development of our constitutional law from the sys - tem of
1781	DATE	to that of
1787	DATE	. ''

		These vigorous views relate to an episode that is past .

		But they are timely ; for they illus - trate principles of constitutional jurisprudence that are permanent and of perennial interest .

		Professor
Burgess	PERSON	states fully , though briefly , the facts which put to rest the silly story that President Lincoln acted unfairly toward the secessionists in the matter of pro- visioning
Fort Sumter	LOCATION	.

		He defends not only the constitutionality , but the morality also , of the
Emancipation Proclamation	ORGANIZATION	.

		The inherent Nationality of the Federal government , as an essential of political and constitutional science , is very clearly expounded ; and the entire reg - ularity and necessity of the exercise by the President of plenary powers in time of war are demonstrated as vigorously as they were by Solicitor
Whiting	PERSON	himself during the war time . ''

		It is altogether gratuitous to concede that the Gov - ernment of the
United States	LOCATION	overstepped its constitu - tional powers , and acted on the principle that necessity knows no law , in preserving the Union by force against dissolution .

		It overstepped its ordinary limitations , but it had , and has , the constitutional right to do that , in periods of extraordinary danger .

		The root of the error in denying this right lies in the claim that the
Consti	PERSON	- tution made the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The truth is that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	made the Constitution , and that the physical and eth - ical conditions of our territory and population made the Union . ''

		It is unpleasant to observe any defects , how - ever slight , in so fair a composition .

		But our author is an over-earnest controversialist ; and while uniformly measuring his expressions on all subjects of prime importance , he sometimes lapses into mere rhetoric when discussing minor topics .

		His very just animadversions upon the gross errors involved in
John Brown	PERSON	's raid on
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry derive no greater force from the abundant epithets which are here heaped upon the unfortunate
Brown	PERSON	and his ill-fated cause .

		So , again , with reference to
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's ancestry .

		It must have been some unfair pre - judice which described his father as '' a dull , lazy , shiftless , poor white , of
Kentucky	LOCATION	back - woods life , the son of a man of the same sort '' ; and his mother , who is incorrectly said to have been '' the daughter of one
Lucy Hanks	PERSON	, '' as one of another family which '' belonged like -

		THE DIAL , 159 wise to the class of poor white trash . ''

		If it were desirable to refer at all to
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's an - ' cestry , in such a history , the simple facts might have been given , instead of exploded myths .

		| The American people will forgive the poverty ' of Lincoln 's parents , in view of the sturdy yeomanry which made their fathers successfal < pioneers in the new West of the eighteenth cen - | tnry , and in view of the intense antipathy to human slavery which governed their lives and descended to animate and distinguish the life and career of their great son .

		It is not quite clear why our author should admit , while he justifies the act , that Lincoln , on his accession to the Presidency , '' shifted the whole issue '' from the restriction of slavery to the maintenance of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Presi - dent in fact shifted no issue .

		The explanation of his emphasizing the preservation of the un - broken L ^ nion is so simple that no apology would be pertinent .

		The issue on which Lincoln was elected was at once forced to the background .

		Secession in arms brought forward a new and paramount issue : the Union must be fought for and preserved .

		It would have been idle to discuss any lesser issue , in the face of this greatest one of all .

		So thought the loyal mil - lions who rushed to the defence of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, at the call of the President .

		So will thousands of them testify to-day .

		The third volume in our list , entitled '' Re - construction and the Constitution , '' is a de - tailed thesis on the processes employed for the rehabilitation of the insurrectionary States , from
1865	DATE	to
1872	DATE	.

		The discussion refers , almost continuously , to the questions arising , as related to or affected by the Constitution , so that the narrative deals with constitutional history in the proper sense .

		The treatment of these questions by Professor
Burgess	PERSON	is minute , discriminating , and often masterly .

		He is im - partial , both in praising and in blaming the leading actors of the Reconstruction period ; and his fearlessness in criticism , and his sin - cere desire to find and declare the true consti - tutional ground which should have been occu - pied at every step of the momentous proceed - ings , will challenge the commendation of un - biassed readers .

		The executive and the legis - lative branches of the government are by turns censored and applauded , as they have seen or failed to see the step proper to be taken at the moment .

		The Presidential policy is shown to have been erroneous in treating the statehood of the insurrectionary States as in no way vitiated by their attempts at secession , and in seekii ^ to rehabilitate them by the employment of less than a full majority of the qualified electorate .

		The legislative policy was based npon the correct theory that the impaired f ano - tions of the insurrectionary States could be restored only by Congressional action ; but the mistakes made by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in working out this theory were glaringly worse than those of the Executive department in seeking to recon - struct without the agency of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		According to Professor
Burgess	PERSON	, the States of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	derived from the Constitution all their powers of local autonomy , and the logical consequence of an attempt to secede from the
Union	ORGANIZATION	was to deprive the
State	ORGANIZATION	so attempting of such autonomy , and reduce it to a
Terri	LOCATION	- torial condition : for it could not abridge the sovereignty of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	over the land within its limits , and the act of rebellion against that sovereignty could have no other effect than the abjnration of Statehood by the offender .

		This being accepted as true , it is the author 's view that but two modes of reconstrnction were logically feasible . ''

		The one was , to establish territorial civil govem - ments in the late rebellioas region , and maintain them there until the civil relations between the two raees became settled and fixed .

		The other was , to so amead the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, before the re - admission of the * States ' which had renounced the
■ State	ORGANIZATION	' form of local government under the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, as to give
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the national judiciary the power to define and defend the fundamental principles of civil liberty .

		Neither of these methods would have demanded martial law or universal negro suffn ^ . ''

		Professor
Burgess	PERSON	has a good word for the last - named project , which he tersely denominates '' the nationalization of civil liberty . ''

		Bat his preference seems to have been for the plan first mentioned , of placing the insurrection - ary states under Territorial civil government , * ' and keeping them there until the spirit of loyalty to the Nation was established , and the practice of civil equality among all citizens was made thoroughly secure . '

		Our author does not refer to the great and undue anxiety which President
Johnson	PERSON	was exhibiting at that time , to hasten his own scheme of Reconstruction by the appointment of '' Provisional Grovemors . ''

		It was this precipitate action of the President which first invited the counteracting policy of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Several of the
Southern Governors	ORGANIZATION	had summoned their legislatures , as our author states , to meet for the purpose of Reconstruc - tion ; and they were , in some instances , dis - suaded from so meeting by officers of the
Union Army	ORGANIZATION	.


Johnson	PERSON	's hurried appointment of 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, '' Provisional Governors '' was a higher bid for Southern favor , and he was hoping to be thereby made the leading politician of the South .

		Lin - coln , if living , would have had no such motive for haste in making such appointments ; and if there had been disagreement between him and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, he would doubtless have been able to compose the difficulty .

		The delicate tact of Lincoln was wanting in
Johnson	PERSON	's com - position .

		Professor
Burgess	PERSON	is astute to expose each error which
Congress	ORGANIZATION	made , either in departing from the logic of its own correct theory of the mode of Beconstruction , or in going counter to the Constitution .

		Of its errors of the first class , he says that '' they intensified partisan - ship at the expense of statesmanship . ''

		It was a departure from the principles of the Consti - tution , when
Congress	ORGANIZATION	arranged to have States not yet rehabilitated , -- or still '' out of their practical relations , '' as Lincoln phrased it , -- to vote upon amendments to the fundamental law ; as also when a Freedmen 's
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, upon the basis of a war measure , was created in time of peace ; and again when , by the Tenure-of - office act , it was attempted to deprive the President of bis normal functions under the Constitution .

		These purely constitutional ques - tions are discussed with a considerate calmness of expression that gives to the author 's con - clusions the weight and emphasis of a judicial deliverance .

		But when he intermits his exami - nation of these general phases of Congressional power and function , to discuss the measures resorted to by the majority in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, then the jurist descends to the plane of the partisan , and calm exposition gives place to heated de - nunciation and the use of epithets .

		Several of the measures adopted by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are de - clared to have been '' monstrous , '' although one of them is admitted to have been within its Constitutional powers .

		Constitutions were framed for some of the seceding States by `` carpet-bag , scalawag , negro conventions . ''

		The reconstructed legislatures were '' hideous '' bodies of men , and the result of their work came near being '' ghastly . ''

		This intensity of indignation felt by the historian will appeal strongly to all who , with him , disapprove the employment of temporary devices to maintain party control , which are 'm contravention of fundamental principles ; but it must be con - fessed that such a profusion of epithets is out of place in dispassionate history .

		Our author deals gently with the foibles of Secretary
Stan	PERSON	- ton , and none of the many excesses of President
Johnson	PERSON	provoke his resentment , save those attending his famous '' swinging around the circle . ''

		How unwise and how uncalled for were the impeachment of President
Johnson	PERSON	and his trial upon the impeachment , and how fortunate was his acquittal , are clearly demon - strated in a chapter which , by some oversight , has been entitled '' The Attempt to Impeach the President . ''

		This chapter will be read with interest by the many , now living , who depre - cated at the time the extent to which partisan - ship had carried the majority in the lower house of

		One of these has recently been issued privately under the title '' Letters of
James Murray	PERSON	, Loyalist . ''

		This book is formed by a selection from ma - terial left to the heirs of the late

		The story begins back on the Scottish bor - der , in
Roxburghshire	LOCATION	, where
James Murray	PERSON	was born , of a good family .

		But it is not until his departure for the
Carolinas	LOCATION	, in
1735	DATE	, that our interest quickens .

		He was then twenty - two , and in possession of a small patrimony , part of which he laid out in merchandise , ex - pecting also to invest in land on his arrival in
America	LOCATION	.

		His sister accompanied him , to - gether with some other young people sent in his charge , and several mechanics .

		His desti - nation was

North Carolina	LOCATION	during the whole of his residence there .

		Mr.
Murray	PERSON	soon became involved in these disputes himself , as he occupied the position of collector of the port and lat `` r was a member of the
Board of Councillors	ORGANIZATION	.

		His opinion of the people of
North Carolina	LOCATION	during his first years there was frankly expressed .

		• ' I wish I coold write rou something agreable of the country , or rather the present set of inhabitants , for the place itself is well enough were it peopled bj frugal , honest , industrious people , who would not sacrifice the general good of the province for the obtaining their own private ends , or would not be so stupid as to be led by the nose by those that would .

		Then I might say , with - out the spirit of prophecy , that this Prorinee would soon be one of the best in

		Mr.
Murray	PERSON	was a progressive and enterprising planter as well as trader ; and we read of rice crops , indigo , tar .

		The bricks for his new house were burnt by his laborers , and the lumber prepared in his own saw-mill .

		At one time he sent to

		His plan - tation , where he built a handsome house , was called Point Repose .

		His condition had steadily improved , until he was able to say , a few years before he finally left
North Carolina	LOCATION	: '' I am not out of humour with the Country as yoo imagine .

		I am perswaded I have my health better here than I could have any where else , and my Improve - ments are amusements to my taste no other place could afford .

		As to the people , they are neither better or worse in gross than those of other Countries : that I have not been a greater favourite with them is more mv own fault than theirs . ''

		They had friends and rel - atives in that city , and Mr.
Murray	PERSON	, who , on his first visit to
Boston	LOCATION	, had conceived a dislike for the place , now fonnd it prosperous , pleas - ant , and congenial .

		In politics the family always remained conservatively loyal to the government , partly through disposition , partly because of the many family ties binding them to
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, and partly through conviction .

		Mr.
Murray	PERSON	did , however , foresee possible union and severance in the future , bat be did not gaage the meaning of the demon - strations that were taking place in

		In regard to the Stamp Act .

		he writes : '' The Stamp Act , so far from being a hart to the
Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, which they pretend to be unable to bear , will be a necessary Spur to their Industry .

		The Difficulty will be to keep that Industry from being employed on articles that will interfere with * the

		He was not contented , but insisted upon bringing in his gun and dining with me ; this terrified the young folks , and they ran out of the house .

		I went in and endeavored to pacify him by every method in my power , but I found it was to no purpose .

		The
Business of City Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Professor
Fairlie	PERSON	may be said , without ex - aggeration , to have advanced municipal econ - omy to the status of an exact science : an achievement for which he was admirably fitted by his earlier studies for the
National Munici	ORGANIZATION	- pal League and various periodicals and official publications , following a thorough university course in administration .

		By drawing upon the results of his previous studies and many : other sources of information , he has made his work on '' Municipal Administration '' ency - clopedic in scope and treatment .

		The bulki - ness of the volume is by no means due to dif - fuseness of style ; the book is packed solidly full of facts , and facts many of which are not easily accessible elsewhere .

		A few technical points are treated with unnecessary detail , but in general the reader is more likely to wish for a fuller treatment than for further condensa - tion .

		The important question of the final dis - posal of sewage , for example , deserves more than a page and a half ; although even in that scant space Professor
Fairlie	PERSON	distinguishes the principal methods in use and gives a convenient checklist of the cities -LRB- except in
Australia	LOCATION	-RRB- where each method is employed .

		The accuracy of such a work as this is of course subject to an inevitable limitation aris - ing from frequent changes in municipal ad - ministration , as well as to the practical impos - sibility of making so comprehensive a work on a new science absolutely infallible in the first instance .

		At first thought it seems a lit - tle curious that our own
University of Cincin	ORGANIZATION	- nati should be omitted from a list of munici - pal colleges which embraces several European institutions , and that
Seattle	LOCATION	should be left out of an even longer list of cities maintaining employment bureaus ; but the fact of the ' matter probably is that it is easier to get com - plete information about European cities than about those of our own country .

		The list of state employment bureaus might have been made more complete , however , if state under - takings were to be enumerated at all , and the same may be said of state parks ; while an account of state fire insurance ought not to overlook the curious and interesting experience of
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		The statement that American cities have abandoned their attempts at vacant - lot cultivation seems a little too sweeping .

		While municipal ownership of street rsdlwajs has thus existed in
Great Britain	LOCATION	since
1870	DATE	, municipal operation was positively forbidden in the Tramways Aet of
1870	DATE	, and is onlj of recent development .

		The first exception was in
1882	DATE	, when the corporation of Hnddersfield was authorized to operate the local steam tramwajg , which had been abandoned by the operating company , provided no reasonable offer could be secured from another operating company to lease the lines ; and with some hesitation the experiment was beg ^ tm .

		The next instance of municipal operation occurred , not in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, but in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		When the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Bridge over the
East River	LOCATION	was opened , in
1883	DATE	, the cable road over it , one mile in length , waa from the start operated by the trustees or joint com - mittee representing the two municipalities of

Brooklyn	LOCATION	Bridge railways remained isolated examples , and did not mark the be - ginning of any movement toward municipal operation .

		It was not until
1893	DATE	that other examples appeared .

		In that year two British cities -LRB-
Plymouth	LOCATION	and Black - pool -RRB- received authority to operate their tramways .

		The year following ,
Leeds	ORGANIZATION	and
Glasgow	LOCATION	also began municipal operation .

		All of these instances were in the face of the Tramways Act of
1870	DATE	; and a standing order of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	was now adopted shutting ont any further bills authorizing municipal operation .

		In
1896	DATE	, however , this order was repealed ;

Dover	LOCATION	,

Bir	ORGANIZATION	- mingham and
Manchester	LOCATION	, have applied for authority and have declared their intention to work their lines on the expiration of the present leases .

		Barmen in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Prague	LOCATION	in
Bohemia	LOCATION	, and a few Swiss towns , also operate local street railroads ; but there is no such general movement in other countries as in
Great Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		Of the four main parts into which the book is divided , dealing respectively with municipal history , activities , finances , and organization , this review has dealt almost wholly with the second , because it is the part which most needed to be written , and which will prove of greatest value ; but the other divisions of the work are treated in due proportion to their relative importance .

		The historical part might be considered disproportionately long , except that it includes two or three chapters of what might be styled present-day history , scarcely distinguishable from Part II .

		There are some evidences of hasty writing in irreconcilable disagreements between verbs and their subjects ; but there are scarcely any defects , either of form or substance , which would be worth calling attention to but for the certainty that so useful a book will soon run into a second edition .

Persia	LOCATION	is playing a role of ever growing im - portance in
Central Asia	LOCATION	.

		The encroachment of
Russia	LOCATION	on the north , including their expul - sion of Persian ships from the
Caspian Sea	LOCATION	, has seriously limited the power of this ancient kingdom .

		The emulation , for a half-century , between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	for supremacy of influence in the court of
Persia	LOCATION	, has been i one of the most interesting diplomatic plays in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		She is now located between Rus -
sia	ORGANIZATION	's possessions and the
Persian Gulf	LOCATION	-- an outlet to the southern seas on which
Russia	LOCATION	has long cast a wishful eye .

		She is the back-door to
Afghanistan	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	, countries controlled by British influence and sovereignty .

		The right imperial authority in Persian territory could easily keep watch over the great and fertile Babylonian valley .

		An industrial and commercial Western nation would soon extract ' from the mountains and plains of
Persia	LOCATION	an , almost boundless wealth of mineral and agri - cultural products .

		Her 640,000 square miles of territory , embracing some of the choicest of mountains and valleys , in the hands of twentieth - j century enterprise , would soon prove to be one I of the most resourceful of central Asiatic countries .

		Major
Sykes	PERSON	, author of ' • Ten Thousand Miles in

		His journey begins by entrance into
Persia	LOCATION	from the north , by way of the Caspian Sea -- ceded to
Russia	LOCATION	by the treaty of Turkomanchai .

		His first trip was through the dangerous Tur - koman territory , thence through
Khorassan	LOCATION	to
Kerman	LOCATION	.

		Of this latter province and its city he gives us an elaborate description -- knowl - edge acquired through long residence and ex - tensive acquaintance .

		The magnificent moun - tains of this province are the salvation of its population .

		To those they retreat in the hot
summer	DATE	and from their melting snows they receive their supply of cool air and fresh water .

		Baluchistan must be the roughest , ruggedest , and most picturesque of countries , according to Major
Sykes	PERSON	.

		A
Baluchi	PERSON	proverb says : '' When the Almighty created the world ,
Balu	PERSON	- chistan was formed from the refuse material . ''

		Its mountains , rising to 13,000 feet , with an active volcano -LRB- Chehl-Tan -RRB- , and extensive ranges , give it a wild uninviting appearance except to adventurers .

		One of the interesting parts of the book is that which describes the Karun valley -- the site of ancient Elamite authority with its fortressed-power at
Susa	ORGANIZATION	.

		Modern conditions in that fruitful valley , -- of the only navigable river in
Persia	LOCATION	-- and its proximity to the maritime commerce of the
Persian Gulf	LOCATION	make it one of the most important sections for Per - sia 's prosperity .

		To one interested in ancient history the most fascinating chapter of the volume is that -LRB- XXVIII -RRB- which describes the journey from
Shiiaz	LOCATION	to
Isfahan	LOCATION	.

		In this the author describes that cradle of the great ancient Achsemenian kings , presenting some admirable illustrations of these majestic ruins as they appear to-day .

		Major
Sykes	PERSON	discusses in a very intelligent manner the commercial and political status of
Persia	LOCATION	in reference to the ambitious powers of to-day , plainly indicating that
Great Britain	LOCATION	is making no gains in this country .

		The familiar easy method of telling his story , and his abundant and beautiful illus - trations and good map of
Persia	LOCATION	, make Major
Sykes	PERSON	's volume one of the most important of those in its field .

		The experiences of Mr.
Wilfrid Sparroy	PERSON	, an English tutor at the court of the Sultan at
Isfahan	LOCATION	in
Persia	LOCATION	, are brimful of interest .

		The chapter on '' The Uses of the Veil '' is especially instructive as to the habits and customs of women in
Persia	LOCATION	, in contrast with those of their Western sisters .

		The concluding chapter , on '' The Cat on the Footstool '' -- the figure formed by the geographical form of
Persia	LOCATION	, -- is a spirited discussion of
Russia	LOCATION	's and
England	LOCATION	's influence at the court of the
Shah	PERSON	.

		The author severely scores the lethargy of English officials , both in
Persia	LOCATION	and in Lon - don , and points out that the continuation of the present policy will mean the further decline and final fall of
England	LOCATION	's advantages in
Persia	LOCATION	.

		The book is supplied with choice illustrations depicting scenes at court described by the author , and also some of the most picturesque views on his travels .

		A little more pains in securing facts regarding many points discussed might have greatly increased the value of the work to the student of the Orient .

		Here is a critical comparison , dated
1869	DATE	, the sanity of which will be better and better appreciated as the years pass . ''

		There was an absurd Article in my old Ath - enaeum comparing the relative merits of

A. T.	PERSON	, whom I judge of by hia earlier poems -LRB- up to 1842 -RRB- .

		In
Browning	PERSON	I could but see little but
Cockney Sublime	ORGANIZATION	,
Cockney Energy	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , and as you once very wittily said to me that
Mies Bronte	PERSON	was a • great Mistress of the Disagreeable , ' so .

		Cowell tells me that even at

Cambridge Browning	PERSON	is considered the deepest . '

		Bat ■ this also will pass away . '

		But not A. T. '' Here is an essentially just criticism of
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		• • With just a little less ambition of fine , or smart writing ,
Lowell	PERSON	might almost do for many books what Ste.
Beuve	PERSON	has left undone .

		He has more Humour ; but not nearly so much Delicacy of Perception , or Refinement of Style ; in which Ste.
Beuve	PERSON	seems to me at the head of all Critics . ' ''

		Finally , we may quote a few words of
FitiGerald	ORGANIZATION	's self-deprecatory allusion to his own work .

		In
1880	DATE	he writes of his own vog ^ e in the
United States	LOCATION	, humorously styling himself '' the great American Pote , '' and says : '' As to the Amer - icans you met , if I were ten years younger I should really be disquieted by such over-estimation as must make me ridiculous here . ''

		It was some ten years earlier that he had written to
Woolner	PERSON	of his own '' Persian things '' that '' they have their merits , and do very well to give to Friends , and to please a few Readers for the time , and then to subside -- things of Taste , not of Genius at all -- which , you know , is the one thing needful . ''

		Profe `` sor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	has writ - tm ` oMminlsmiii ^ ^ ^ many books larger than '' Com - monwealth or Empire '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		but none more weighty or more clearly the utter - ance of large scholarly experience and wise philo - sophical refiection .

		It is a book that thoughtful Americans will do well to heed , for upon their decision concerning the momentous questions which it raises the fame of our country , now hanging in the balance , will largely depend .

		Against our
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, he impressively urges , `` three forces , distinct but converged , are now arrayed .

		They are Plutocracy , Militarism , and Imperiahsm .

		The three instinctively conspire ; to the plutocrat Imperialism is politically congenial , while he feels that Militarism impregnates society with a spirit of conservatism , and may in case of a conflict of classes furnish a useful force of repression . ''

		Oat - lining the forces whereby popular government in our country has been steadily undermined of recent years , and the gradual growth of an unwritten Constitution which is fast coming to supplant the fundamental written instrument of our liberties , he pertinently says : '' If to any one such a forecast seems visionary , let him ask himself whether a few years ago he could have dreamed that the princi - ples of the Declaration of Independence would be discarded and almost derided ; that dominion over other races would be forcibly assumed ; and that American citizens would be heard passionately calling upon their Government to shoot down as rebels people struggling for their independence against a foreign yoke . ''

		It is indeed a melan - choly plight to which our national rake 's progress has brought as during the past four years , and the friendly dispassionate admonition of the political philosopher to '' look here , upon this picture , and on this '' does not exactly contribute to the self - esteem of men who are still capable of viewing recent developments in their true historical light . ''

		The Declaration of Independence , it is true , was a creation of the eighteenth century ; its abstract doctrine of human equality belongs to the polideal philosopy of that era .

		But it has living force when it says , as in effect it does , that man shall not exercise lordship over man .

		When the people of the
United States	LOCATION	, after recognizing the Fili - pinos as their allies , bought them with their land of
Spain	LOCATION	, as they would buy the contents of a cattle - ranch or a sheep-fold , and proceeded to shoot them down for refusing to be delivered to the purchaser , they surely broke away from the principles on which their own polity is built , and compromised the national character formed on respect for those principles . ''

		How much finer than the base ideal that has dominated oar political action of late is the ideal set forth in the following words : '' If the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	yearns for a grander part , a grander part may be found , not in partnership with aggressive power , but rather in morally upholding against aggression human independence and the rights of every member of the family of nations . ''

		This has hitherto been the part eonsist `` ntly played by as in the theatre of world-polities .

		Mast we now renounce it forever ?

		Let the closing words of this little book answer the question for the faint-hearted who need an answer . '

		• The sun of humanity is behind a cloud .

		The cloud will pass away and the sun will shine forth again .

		The substance of
Canon Bard	ORGANIZATION	^ ley ' 8 valuable '' English Surnames , '' now in its fifth edition , has been used for the introduction , and the entire work presents not only the most authentic but the only scholarly treatise on sur - names in the language .

		The method adopted has been based upon minute and extended research among ancient records in all parts of
England	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	, and the occurrence of family names in EmgUMk < aui W ^ Uk oriffins `` / 16 -LRB- -RCB- THE DIAL -LSB-

		Followed through several centuries in this manner , with a comparatively slight inquiry into the same names in the
United States	LOCATION	, founded upon the city directories of
New York	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and
Worcester	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, the lexicographer has been able to settle many disputed questions in the face of family traditions and prepossessions .

		The name ''
Howard	PERSON	, '' for instance , is traced to two distinct origins , one official , from '' hay ward , '' and the other from the Christian name '' Hereward . ''

		The at - tempt to connect '' Howard '' with '' hogward '' is made futile by proof that this official title becomes '' Hoggart '' in modern nomenclature .

		Too much praise can hardly be awarded these efforts of
Canon Bardsley	ORGANIZATION	to throw light upon one of the darkest of dark places in etymology , and the hope may be ex - pressed that some person or persons of equal fitness will perform a similar task for Irish and Scotch names on one hand , and those of continental European origin on the other , thus covering the entire field .

1868	DATE	, the circle Roxoiandsui .

		„ -LCB- admirers of
Edward Rowland Sill	ORGANIZATION	's poetic genius has slowly but steadily widened , until to-day the permanence of his literary reputa - tion seems assured .

		Notwithstanding this continued growth of interest ,
Sill	ORGANIZATION	's poetry has so far been accessible only in the four or five small volumes , issued at irregular intervals , in which it originally appeared .

		It is only now , more than fifteen years after the poet 's untimely death , that his work is brought together in a single volume .

		For the tar - diness of this good office , however , ample atone - ment is made by the manner in which it has at last been performed .

		Produced by the '' depart - ment of limited editions '' at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, and published by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the volume containing '' The Poems of
Edward Rowland	PERSON	Sill '' is one which , in beauty and per - fection of typography , would do honor to the work of any writer .

		The general form and workman - ship are characterized throughout by a dignified restraint singularly in keeping with the character of the verse .

		The text is printed upon hand-made paper of strong fibre and unglazed surface , from type of a simple modern face .

		No display or orna - mentation of any sort is used ; a frontispiece por - trait in photogravure , and a small woodcut on the title-page , constitute the only embellishment .

		A statement of the principal facts in the poet 's brief career is given as an introduction .

		The volume contains practically all of Sill 's published verse , together with several poems hitherto uncollected ; so that we are now given opportunity for the first time of surveying his poetical achievement as a whole .

		The result can not fail to increase our re - spect for the author and his work , and our regret that his career should have been cut short when it had only just begun .

		Brief as his career was , and incomplete as was bis work , it revealed qualities which distinguish poetry of the highest order , -- a finished and facile expression , dignity , simplicity , and sincerity , unflinching idealism , and true love of nature .

Greece	LOCATION	, has attracted less general attention than the clas - sical period ; yet without some knowledge of its chequered annals , one can not fully appreciate and enjoy a large part of the archseological and artistic treasures of the
Eternal City	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , the per - iod is full of a romance and poetry and tragedy of its own .

		The meteor-like course of
Hildebrand	PERSON	, the life and death of Arnold of
Brescia	LOCATION	, the mas - terful figure of the
Third Innocent	ORGANIZATION	, the melan - choly failure of the dreamer
Cola di Rienzo	ORGANIZATION	and his still more unfortunate disciple
Porcaro	PERSON	, the crimes of the
Sixth Alexander	ORGANIZATION	, and the pomps and pageants of
Leo X.	PERSON	, -- all these fall within this period .

		The story in the main is gloomy ; the feuds and fevers , the appalling crimes and stu - pendous criminals in high places , the want of prin - ciple in all classes , fill the larger spaces on the canvass .

		Still , with all its faults , the Roman life of the Middle Ages can not have been without its charm .

		The dreamy old ruins which fired the fancy of a
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	and a
Rienzi	LOCATION	must have looked more poetic in their deserted savageness than the trimly-kept excavations of to-day .

		It was a quaint fancy of the old Romans to spell the name of their city ,
Roma	LOCATION	, backward , and call it Amor -- Love .

		Even a modern , provided he fully enters into the spirit of its extraordinary and still unfinished career , gladly accepts this transposition .

		Whether ruled by
Kings	ORGANIZATION	, by a Republic , by Emperors , or by Popes , there is not a page of her history we can afford to miss , and each contributes to the charm which comes with the very utterance of the word Some .

		But while in such cases the emphasis is usually laid upon the two former of these offices , in his case it is to be placed rather upon the last of the three .

		Add to this a pronounced trend toward literature , shown by the publication of several volumes of verse besides numerous essays and reviews , and marked ability as an orator , both in and out of the pulpit , and it becomes evident that we have here an American of real influence .

		Bishop
Spalding	PERSON	's repatation as a scholar is abundantly sastained by the two pap > er8 which lead his book , on '' Religion '' and '' A ^ gnosticism '' re - spectively .

		It is hardly too much to say that in these he has given a history of philosophic thought not surpassed for thoroughness and succinctness in modem writing .

		These are followed by a more openly controversial chapter in the form of a reply to the late Robert 6 .

		IngersolL , entitled ' ■ God in the Constitution . ''

		The remaining essays are de - Toted to education and religion , closing with an impassioned and eloquent tribute to the Mother Church , '' The Victory of Love . ''

		Few books bet - ter worth attention have been lately pat forth , the author 's felicity of diction alone entitling these essays to consideration from those who appreciate literary style .

		Two late additions to the '' Medieval ^ iilS ^ Towns '' series -LRB- Dent-Macmillan -RRB- are ``
Cairo	LOCATION	'' by Dr.
Stanley Lane	PERSON	-
Poole	PERSON	, and '' Chartree '' by
Cecil Headlam	PERSON	.

		The most interesting things are always the unfamiliar ; what one goes to
Cairo	LOCATION	to see is the real
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	life in its
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	setting .

		No better guide to this strange country -- because no one has studied it longer or more intimately -- could be found than the Professor of Arabic in
Trinity Collie	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		Only from one who writes out of a full mind do we get a book written with such simplicity and sense of proportion .

		The European changes of the last twenty years are ignored as far as possible , the illustrations being chosen from the earlier period , and the text aiming to reproduce the associations that lend the city its deepest interest .

		-- In the vol - ume on
Chartres	LOCATION	, the main interest is a religious one ; the cathedral its chief glory , felt by everyone but by no one so well described as by Lowell : '' SUeot and gnj aa fanat-laspired cliff Left inlasd bj the oeeaa'a dow retreat . ''

		Naturally , the most interesting chapters to the reader are the ones dealing with this wonderful fane .

		Mr.

		The book brings vividly to mind the fact that , while the churches and other agencies for good are usually punctual in closing their doors and bidding good - night to the world soon after sunset , the agents of evil are just then beginning their propagandas , -- the old story of the strait and narrow way , and the broad path that leads to deatraetion .

Rome	LOCATION	in affairs of the spirit .

		From the dissipations of the great world and the little , the story wanders away , toward the end of the volume , to the coasts of
Bohemia	LOCATION	; and here the night life of modern civilization presents itself at its best . ''

		For
Bohemia	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Machray	PERSON	observes , '' is not the name of a country , or a place , or even of a ` quarter , ' but is that of a condition , a state of mind aod heart , the outward expression of a temperament which reveb in the joy of life . ''

Arthur Conan Doyle	PERSON	.

		That is , it em about as far on the side of the burghers as Sir
Arthur	PERSON	's does on the side of the British , both being written from a frankly declared point of view which makes them controversial narratives rather than sober recitals of fact .

		Mr.
Davitt	PERSON	, it will be re - membered , resigned his seat in
Parliament	LOCATION	upon the breaking out of war between the Republics and
Great Britain	LOCATION	, in order to go to the front -- with the burghers , of course .

		Daring his extended so - journ he became well acquainted with the leaders of the Dutch , and he has dedicated his work to the memory of General
Philip Botha	PERSON	.

		It may be said that this account of the war is more complete than any other now before the pablie , -- the information on the British side being aeeeasible to the world , while it is only through such an > experience as this that one can obtain the burghers ' side of a con - troversy so inflamed by race hatred and the horrors of war .

		Mr.
Davitt	PERSON	has used this knowledge to the utmost , setting down his facts with righteous indig - nation against the aggressor that makes his pages fairly bum .

		The whole narrative , long as it is , comes with a rush and vigor , an enthusiasm over the early successes of the republican arms , a pity for chivalry so often mistaken , and an inherited disbelief in the protestations of
Great Britain	LOCATION	which hold the attention , if not always the approval , of the reader .

		Numerous illustrations , reproductions of photographs , aid in the effectiveness of the story .

John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , is founded upon a short story pub - lished ten years ago , one of the few of her earlier tales that was not of tragical import .

		And even this , though a comedy of modern life in the full sense of the word , comes near to satire in its bringing together of two lovers ' long separated , one a French painter of the first distinction , and the other an Englishwoman ennobled by the mercenary marriage she had made when the artist , little more than a student then , was discarded .

		A love-match between two young people in whom these elders are interested , one on either side , brings up the earlier circumstance to both .

		Lady Harlekston persuades Carbooche to paint her portrait .

		This he does , in a spirit of revenge , only too truthfully .

		She revenges herself in turn by persuading him , through tender recollections artfully brought for - ward , to erase the lines which age and easy living have put in her face , and , this done , by turning upon him as one whom she had fooled .

		Carbouche has the painting destroyed , and the play might have been ended there , with a psychological tragedy of the sort Mrs.
Clifford	PERSON	has been so fond of .

		Bat a fourth act follows , in which the painter learns for the first time that the Lord Harlekston he has met is the stepson of the woman he had loved , and that she is a widow .

		The contents are , for the most part , extensions of mat - ters briefly treated in the '' Dictionary '' and have been published , with a few exceptions , in various learned periodicals , English ,
American	ORGANIZATION	, Italian , and French .

		Among the longer studies we may mention the follow - ing : ''
Dante	PERSON	and the
Lancelot Romance	PERSON	, '' '' Some Ob - ligations of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	to Albertus Magnus , '' `` Dante 's Latin Dictionary , '' and the review of Professor
Rajno	PERSON	's text of the '' De Vulgari Eloquentia . ''

		The majority of the articles are mere notes , but they represent an extraordinary amount of research , and are made fully accessible to the student by a comprehensive index .

		A new edition of the Rev.
Alexander Dyce	PERSON	's ''
Glos	PERSON	- sary to the Works of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Harold Littledale	PERSON	, has just been published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The chief task of the re - viser has been to alter the reference figures in such manner as to make them useful with other texts than that of Dyee .

		Although
Schmidt	PERSON	's `` Lexicon '' and
Bart	PERSON	- lett 's '' Concordance '' have both been published since the first appearance of this '' Glossary , '' it may fairly be said that they do not take its place .

		At the same time we have from
the Industrial Publication Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a new work of somewhat similiar scope , entitled `` The Shakes - peare Cyclopaedia and New Glossary , '' prepared by Mr.
John Phin	PERSON	, and furnished with an introduction by Professor
Dowden	PERSON	.

		It is a text for the use of high schools .

		The latest Bulletin of the
Bureau of American Eth	ORGANIZATION	- nology is a monograph upon '' Kathlamet Texts , '' pre - pared by Dr.

		This is the first issue of a new series having the Indian languages for their gen - eral subject .

		Messrs.
Eldredge & Brother	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of Professor
James Morgan Hart	PERSON	's `` The Essentials of Prose Composition , '' which is an excellent working text for high schools , based upon the teaching expe - rience of many years .

		A new '' Atlas of the Geography and History of the Ancient World , '' designed for school and college use , will be issued this month by Messrs.
Benj	PERSON	.


H. Sanborn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work consists of thirty-three carefully - printed maps , with a complete index .

		Professor
B. O. Pierce	PERSON	's '' Elements of the Theory of the Newtonian Potential Function , '' now published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a third edition , is enlarged to about three times the dimensions of the earlier editions , thus being substantially a new work .

		Although issued at the beginning of the
summer	DATE	season , the demand for Mr.
Montgomery Carmichael	PERSON	's delightful little volume , '' The Lady Poverty , '' has been such that the American publishers , Messrs. Ten - nant & Ward , have lately arranged for a second ship - ment of the book from
London	LOCATION	.

		The '' Portrait Catalogue '' of Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is so much more than a mere trade list that its appearance in a new and revised edition calls for a word of mention .

		A new style of typography has been adopted throughout , and a number of addi - tional portraits are now included . ''

		The Reference Catalogue of Current Literature '' for
1902	DATE	has been published by Messrs.
J. Wbitaker	PERSON	& Sons , and is distributed in this country from the office of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Publishers ' Weekly . ''

		This work , as all booksellers know , is made up of the trade catalogues of all the English publishers , bound up in two volumes rather thicker than they are long or
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 broad , and inpplied with an ezhaostive index .

		This iodez is of coarse the means br which the Tast mass of material is made arailable , and , id the present case , gives us nearly one hundred and forty thousand subject , title , and author references , which fill no less than eight hundred pages .

		Mr.
Theodore L. DeVinne	PERSON	, who has recently issued books on '' Plain Printing Types '' and '' Correct Com - position , '' will soon publish through the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	a volume on '' Title-Pages , '' designed to be an aid to printers and publishers , and also interesting to those who care for the making of fine books .


W. E. Chanuing	PERSON	's biography of
Thoreau	PERSON	has been so long out of print that the announcement of a new edition , embodying additional material left by
Channing	LOCATION	, is a welcome one .

		The volume will be supplied with an introduction , notes , and a full index by Mr.
F. B. San	PERSON	- bom , and will be issued in attractive typographical form by Mr.
Charlea	PERSON	# .

		Goodspeed of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		In response to the increasing demand for historical lit `` r `` tare ,
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce a scheme which they have long had under consideration , of a uniform series of reprints of standard historical novels .

		They expect the cooperation of an English house famous for its success with several series of books se - lected and made with extraordinary taste and discretion .

		The '' Summer Classes for the Study of English , '' under the direction of Mrs.
H.	PERSON	- A. .


Davidson	PERSON	and Prof.
S. C. Hart	PERSON	of
Wellesley College	LOCATION	, were held this year at
Delhi	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		The organization of this small special school is that of a club of persons drawn to - gether by similar purposes and tastes , and the courses of study offered were entirely within the field of English .

		For several days it was feared that Prof.v
Angelo Heilprin	PERSON	had been lost in tbe recent eruption of Mt. Pel ^ e , and the news that be is returning to this country with a large amount of fresh information means a dis - tinct addition to our scientific knowledge .

		He proposes embodying his experience and scientific deductions in a work DOW nearly complete , and to be published this fall by
J. B. Lippincott	PERSON	Company .

		The
FaU Ust of Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is the most important and attractive ever presented by this house , eviucing in both literary and mechanical features altogether new and progressive standards .

		The first books to appear will be Mr.
Will Payne	PERSON	's volume of short stories , `` On Fortune 's Road '' ; a translation of
Felix Dahn	PERSON	's '' A Captive of the Roman Eagles , '' by Miss
Mary J. Safford	PERSON	; '' In Argolis , '' an account of a Summer in
Greece	LOCATION	, by Mr.
George Hor	PERSON	- ton , beautifully printed at the Merrymonnt Press ; and two new volumes bv Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	, '' Musical PasteU '' and '' The SUndard Light Operas . ''

		During the
Autumn	DATE	five books will be issued by the '' department of special editions '' of
The Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most important of these , and also the most ambitious work yet undertaken by the Press , will be a reprint of the
Essays of Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	, in
Plorio	LOCATION	's trans - lation , edited by Mr.
George B. Ives	PERSON	.

		This edition will appear in three folio volumes , printed from a specially-designed font of type , and illustrated with frontispiece portraits , decorative headings and initials , engraved on wood .

		The other Fall issues will consist of Gabriel Nand ^ 's '' Instruction concerning Erecting of a Library , '' reprinted from the English translation of
1661	DATE	; tbe Anti-Slavery Papers of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	, now first collected ; a hitherto uDpablisbed '' Journal of a Tour in the
Netherlands	LOCATION	, '' from the pen of
Robert Southey	PERSON	; and a quarto reprint of Spenser 's '' Prothalamion '' and '' Epithalamion , '' with photogra - vures and a title-page vignette from drawings by Mr.

		The

Second Bank	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' treating at length both the monetary and political questions connected with that institution .

		In the series of preprints from the ''
University of Chicago Decennial Publications	ORGANIZATION	'' there will appear at once '' The Physical Characters of the Indians of
Southern Mexico	LOCATION	'' by Prof.
Frederick Starr	PERSON	, `` The Treatment of Nature in the Works of
Nikolaus Lenau	PERSON	'' by Prof.
Camillo von Klenze	PERSON	, and `` Concerning the Modern German Relatives ` Daa ' and ' Was ' in Clauses dependent upon Sabstantiviaed Clauses '' by Prof.
Starr Willard Cutting	PERSON	.

		The
Prew	PERSON	also announces a volume by Miss
Katharine Elizabeth Dopp	PERSON	on • ' Tbe Place of Indostry in
Elementary Eda	LOCATION	- cation . ''

		It is BO very many years ago that the poem of `` Fe '' - tos '' leaped into meteoric fame , winning the applant * of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and being likened to ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' that many persons must have been surprised to read of the author 's death only a few days ago .


Philip James Bailey	PERSON	was bom in
1816	DATE	, and has just died at the age of eighty - six . ''

		Festus '' was published in
1839	DATE	, and passed through many editions in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		To the present generation the poem is unknown except as a curious phenemenon in literary history .


William Allen Butler	PERSON	is another writer known chiefly by a single poem who has died this month .

		He was bom in
1825	DATE	, and was one of the foremost of
New York	LOCATION	lawyers .

		`` Nothing to Wear '' was published anonymously in
1857	DATE	, and was not acknowledged by the author nntO several years afterwards .

		The literary achievements of
Indiana	LOCATION	have been made the subject of a good many newspaper articles , which have had much to say abont certain popular but unimportant writers , and have nsually forgotten to mention the man to whom the state owes its chief lit - erary distinction .


Edward Eggleston	PERSON	made Indians famous at a time when literature was almost an on - known quantity west of the Alleghanies , and his death is a loss to the whole country .

		Bopn in
1837	DATE	, his early years were spent among rural surroundings , from which he was unconsciously absorbing the material that he afterwards used with such vivid effect in his novels .

		He was unable to get a college education , and entered the Methodist ministry at the age of nineteen .

		When about thirty years of age , he gave up ministerial for editorial work , and , a few years later removed to the
East	LOCATION	.

		With the exception of `` The Graysons , '' his | > opular novels were written during the seventies .

		The best known of them are '' The Hoosier Schoolmaster , ' * `` The End of the Worid , '' '' The Mystery of Metrop - olisville , '' `` The Circuit Rider , '' and '' Roxy . ''

		Daring the last twenty years of his life , his energies were almost wholly devoted to his works on American his - tory , for which he prepared himself by a long period of extensive and patient research .

		Besides his school books in this department , he wrote '' The Beginners of a Nation '' and '' The Transit of Civilization . ''

		He died on the third of this month at his country home on
Lake George	LOCATION	, where the greater part of his later years were spent .

		170 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, Announcements of FaliL Books .

		The Dial presents herewith its annual list of books announced for Fall and
Winter	DATE	publication .

		This list is , as usual , the first comprehensive and classified in - formation regarding the Fall books to be given the book-purchasing public .

		Entry is here made of over fourteen hundred titles , representing the output of fifty leading American publishers .

		The list has been pre - pared entirely from advance information secured espe - `` ially for this purpose .

		All the books entered are presumably new books -- new editions not being in - cluded unless having new form or matter ; and , with a few necessary exceptions , the list does not include Fall books already issued and entered in our regular List of New Books .

		The more important literary features of the list are commented upon in the leading editorial in the present BIOGRAPHY AND MEMOIRS .

		As shown bj his publications , and still more by the manuscript of proepe e t i Te work which I have had the faror of seeing ,
Archer B. Hulbert	PERSON	has entered a new field of American research and scholarship -- a field in which ethnologr , archsologr , and history blend in most enticing fashion .

		The ways trod by onr pioneer ancestors , by the Bed Men before them , and by beasts of the woodland and prairie still earlier , ought to have place in our knowledge ; they are gone from the maps aad are fading from memory .

		Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	is helping us to hold fast to onr rightful heritage . ''

		The plan strikes me as an admirable one , and I am snre the result will be useful to historical inves - tigators as well as to the general reader .

OSMO POLITANISM	PERSON	.

		The most casual observer of literary affairs can not have failed to notice the growth of the cosmopolitan spirit that has characterized both the reading and the writing of recent years .

		In every country the reading public looks as eagerly abroad as it looks around at home for new literary forms and tendencies , and the writing guild is everywhere quick to seize upon new motives and situations , whatever their origin .

		No literature of the present day is as self-contained as every literature was fifty or a hundred years ago , and we are constantly called upon to witness a confnsion of styles and ideals resulting from our generous modern outlook upon life .

		It is not merely that the commanding personalities of contemporary lit - erature attract widespread attention in other countries than their own , -- that has always in a measure been the case , -- but it is rather that writers of quite secondary importance , if pos - sessed of any distinctive qualities of thought or expression , now find translators in every country , and their voices penetrate to the re - mote parts of the earth .

		We are inclined to think that the share of
America	LOCATION	in this modern broadening of literary interest has been considerable .

		It may be for the reason that our own production has not thus far been as remarkable as we could wish , or it may be because of the variety of racial elements that have become blended in our society , that we have extended so cordial a wel - come to the books that have come to us from other nations .

		It is certainly true that from the days of
Emerson	LOCATION	's
Concord	LOCATION	with its at - mosphere of intellectual curiosity down to the days in which we now live the American atti - tude toward European literature -- not En - glish alone -- has been peculiarly receptive and has evinced an unusual catholicity of taste .

		We have sought for the best wherever it might be found , and our finer spirits , at least , lived in the light of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's definition of culture long before it was put into words .

		That this liberal outlook has had a stimu - lating reaction upon English taste may hardly be doubted .

		The work of such pioneers as 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	,
Ticknor	PERSON	and
Longfellow	PERSON	aroused many En - glishmen to the interesting possibilities that they were neglecting ; such counsel as that of
Emerson	LOCATION	encouraged them to broaden their view ; such work as the American translations of Goethe and
Dante	PERSON	provided them with a wholesome incentive to deal more seriously with the masterpieces of foreign literature .

		Coming down to more recent years , we may say that the names of Ibsen and Tolstoi be - came vitally significant in
America	LOCATION	before they did in
England	LOCATION	; we may notice that Amer - ican translations of Balzac and Tourguenieff and
Bjornson	PERSON	preceded the English ones , and we may recall the introduction of
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	to the English public by an American translator .

		These few items of the account may stand for the many others that might be adduced and serve to show that in this matter of cosmo - politanism the example of
America	LOCATION	has not been without its influence upon our kinsmen over-sea .

		In this binding of the nations by the ties of mutual sympathy and appreciation , this practice of give and take in the domain of the intellectual interests , there is undoubtedly much benefit to all concerned .

		To be able to assume temporarily the attitude of the out - sider is the best possible corrective for pro- vincialism , and the ideals that result from a nation 's own inner development need the test of comparison to assure their validity .

		Our modern commerce of thought is constantly invoking such comparisons , and the gain to both parties is obvious .

		The instinctive ideal either becomes a rational one , or it falls into decay through the discovery of its irrationality .

		It is not always pleasing to our self-esteem to suffer this disillusionment , but when we have once been made to realize that ours is not the better way -- that the Frenchman , or the Russian , or the Scandinavian , has pursued a worthier ideal than ours -- there is nothing for it but to accept the lesson and profit by the instruction .

		On the other hand , it may some - times happen that the comparison will leave us convinced that our own aim has been the finer , and that it is our function in this respect to teach and not to learn .

		We are then in the fortunate case of having grounds for the faith that is in us , and what was before an instinct is now an unshakable conviction .

		This problem has , however , another and possibly a deeper aspect which we are bound to take into consideration .

		To what extent are ideals absolute , and to what extent are they merely relative to seme particular people , or epoch , or stage in the social evolution of the race ?

		We know well enough that principles of human conduct , seemingly fundamental , have , in the course of history , undergone slow and subtle alterations of which the cumulative effect has amounted in time to a complete transformation .

		And if different ideals may properly hold sway in different historical periods , may they not properly hold sway at the same time among different peoples ?

		In other words , are we so very sure that what is best for Englishmen , even in their treatment of the ordinary human relations , must also be best for Frenchmen and Germans and Italians ?

		To argue that this must be the case because of the evident drawing together of the modern nations in a common cosmopolitan culture is evidently to beg the very question at issue .

		May it not rather be urged , and plausibly too , that each race or nation has its own peculiar genius , and that this genius will bring forth its finest fruits if left to develop in accordance with the principle of its own being ?

		So we see that the matter is not as simple as at first it appears to be .

		The names which denote the several historical peoples have un - doubtedly stood , throughout the centuries , for certain distinctive groups of characteristics .

		There would seem to be no little of the doc - trinaire spirit in measuring them all with the same tape , and judging them all by the same set of moral standards .

		Yet in this spirit the common run of mankind formulates its histor - ical judgments , as do also the professional writers of history , with few exceptions .

		A Greek or Boman practice is condemned out - right by reference to the standards of to-day instead of being dispassionately viewed in the light of the civilization which it helps to illus - trate .

		Similarly , although it must be admitted with far greater apparent justification , the modern moralist almost unconsciously takes the practice of his own people as the norm by which he estimates the virtues and the short - comings of all other peoples , instead of making , as he should do , a resolute effort to get into the moral consciousness of the race which he is studying , and thus view its problems as matters for sympathetic interpretation rather than for praise or disapproval .

		But we are wandering afield from our sub - ject , and must get back to the starting-point .

		The principle of the relativity of ideals above
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		set forth might be applied in the regions of law and government , of education and religion , and when we restrict its application to the region of literature , the limitation is more ap - parent than real .

		A recent writer upon
Ameri	PERSON	- can literature finds that the English Bible and the English common law have to be taken largely into consideration in accounting for it , and the literature of every people has a way of getting itself mixed up with most of the deeper human concerns .

		So in its more simplified form our question becomes this : Does the genius of a people reach its fullest and richest expression in a literature that is reasonably self-contained , or are still finer results to be reached by the cultivation of an openly re - ceptive attitude toward the contemporary lit - erature of other countries ?

		We have no notion of answering this question , but will remain content with having raised it , and with bring - ing forward a few of the larger lessons of lit - erary history that seem to have some bearing upon its settlement .

		The literature of the Greeks will stand for all time as the supreme example of a growth from within , of the multifold and marvellous efflorescence of the genius of a race .

		Here we find no admixture of foreign infinence worth mentioning , and yet we find all the chief forms of literary composition developed to a state of perfection that must ever remain oar despair .

		Themselves self-taught , the Greek writers have been the teachers of all civilized mankind since their day .

		We can surely find no cause for regret in the fact that they re - mained unacquainted with either Chinese sages or Hebrew prophets .

		The native sublimity of JEschylus at least equalled that of
Isaiah	LOCATION	, and the wisdom of
Socrates	LOCATION	and Plato surpassed that of Confucius .

		With the Bomans the case was greatly different .

		Before the Latin genius had the opportunity of self-realization , it fell under the spell of the Greek spirit , and assim - ilated what it might of an alien culture .

		The result was a hybrid literature which repre - sented the best of two races , and produced a series of fine models , yet which might con - ceivably have reached a still finer development had it been free to work out its native ideals .

		With this idle hypothesis we must dismiss a question that may never be answered .

		When the middle ages came into po nacoa ion of the classical inheritance , at first in frag - mentary and imperfectly appreciated forms , afterwards in the wealth of the whole treasure - house thrown open to the scholars of the Re - naissance , the influence was undoubtedly for good , and is writ large in the history of re - viving humanism .

		Although the modern lit - erature had made promising beginnings un - aided by the best classical examples , it can hardly be doubted that the stimulus of the classical revival was wholly fructifying and beneficent .

		Even at the full flood of Renais - sance enthusiasm , the European republic of letters was poor in numbers , and its cidzens needed just such a bond of unity as was afforded by their common delight in the rediscovered works of antiquity .

		It is true that some could find no better use for these works than to hold them as models for servile imitation , and it is also true that their infiuence prolonged the life of the Latin language and retarded the devel - opment of the various vernaculars of
Europe	LOCATION	, but , on the whole , the specific genius of Italian , or French , or English did not lack in the power of self-assertion , and gained little that was not good from the stimulating and steadying ex - ample of the classical masterpieces .

		After the great literatures of modern
Europe	LOCATION	had fairly entered upon their respective lines of special national development , they did not wholly lose the cosmopolitan character that resulted from their common allegiance to the empire of classical antiquity .

		Although their cosmopolitanism was not of the alert and com - prehensive type that is prevalent to-day .

		their interrelations and mutual reactions form an important part of modern literary history .

		No view of English literature can be called philo - sophical that does not reckon with the succes - sive streams of influences that flowed in upon it from
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	, respect - ively .

		The indebtedness of later Italian litera - ture to French example and the catholic atti - tude of modern German literature toward all that was best in the product of the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	are equally familiar illustrations of this thesis .

		French literature alone remained until the
eighteenth century	DATE	in a condition of comparative isolation from outside influences , and has , ever since the times of
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Voltaire	PERSON	and the author of '' De 1 ' Allemagne , '' preserved its indigenous characteristics and kept its own counsel more completely than the literature of any other modern nation .

		The singular position thus occupied until very recently by French literature has been for most French writers a matter of national pride .

		They seem to have taken for granted 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, that French letters could have nothing of seri - ous importance to learn from foreign example .

		While they have reluctantly admitted that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Goethe might have certain merits , and be good enough poets for barba - rians , they have held fast to the belief that consummate modern literary art was only to be found in the French language , and espe - cially in the masterpieces of the classical eighteenth century .

		In this comfortable be - lief they have been rudely shaken by the oc - currences of recent years , for the French pub - lic has lately shown an alarming tendency to follow after strange foreign gods , and , after having for many years repelled the invading hordes from the North , seems suddenly to have reversed its ancient attitude , now wel - coming the invaders with open arms and effu - sive cordiality .

		Thus the question of literary cosmopolitanism has become in
France	LOCATION	not merely a living one , but an acutely controver - sial one , and the occasion of much eloquent exhortation upon both sides .

		Among the recent writers who have dealt with this subject ,
M. Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	was one of the first in the field , and the way in which he disposed of the whole question was so in - geniously absurd that his discussion has re - mained memorable .

		Taking Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	and the other Scandinavians for his text , he argued that all their ideas were of French origin , and that Frenchmen would therefore do much better to read the books of their own fellow - countrymen ; that , in fact , their only reason for liking these foreigners was that they found in them the expression of French thought !

		Somewhat later
M. Rene Doumic	PERSON	elaborated a similar argument with respect to the Rus - sians , whose invasion followed close upon that of the Scandinavians .

		This writer , indeed , does not mince his words .

		He speaks of the '' undoubted immorality of cosmopolitanism '' and calls it `` the school of anarchy for many of the distinguished spirits of our time . ''

		It has its illuminati , its fanatics , and its con - vulsionists . ''

		Behold them in the attacks of their delirium , the Tolstoyans , the Ibsenians , the Nietzscheans -- but above all do not try to calm them . ''

		While other nations are culti - vating the national spirit ,
France	LOCATION	is in danger of bringing up '' generations of dupes . ''

		M. Doumic is really very much disturbed .

		As a representative of the other point of view the late
Joseph Texte	PERSON	is a typical figure .

		This young writer , whose untimely death two years ago at the age of thirty-five was a heavy loss to French criticism , was an enthusiastic champion of the cosmopolitan movement .

		To him it meant freedom from the bondage of the classical tradition and safety from the degen - eracy that results from inbreeding , in literature no less than in life .

		His formula for the na - tion as well as for the individual was rester soi-meme et pourtant s ` unir aux autres .

		He believed cosmopolitanism to be a necessary trait of every forceful intellect in the present age of thought , and foresaw the growth of a real solidarity among men through the agency of letters .

		This doctrine he preached and this he applied in his studies of comparative liter - ature , although remaining essentially conser - vative in temper , and insisting that the French people , no matter how far its new interests may take it afield , must not allow the heredi - tary qualities of its genius to become weakened .

		Whether this be a possible ideal or not the future alone can show .

		It is certainly an ideal toward which much of the best French thought is tending , in common with the advanced thought of all the other nations of literary importance .

		That the spirit of cosmopolitanism is des - tined to influence , if not to control , the future development of the leading literatures of the world is one of the clearest signs of the times .

		In its recent conquest of the French it has cap - tured the last outpost of the resistance offered in the name of national genius and racial unity .

		No people henceforth will be free to live unto itself in the forms and ideals of its literary ex - pression , or to contemn the works of the alien .

		Despite the occasional aberrations of taste and extravagances of enthusiasm that may accom - pany the new habit of looking abroad for the fresh inspiration or the fertilizing thought , the current now sets everywhere too strongly in the direction of intellectual free trade to be in danger of checks or reverses .

		For good or for evil -- and we need hardly say that we hold it for good -- the world is fast growing one in spirit , and this at a time when , as never before , the instinct of race is asserting itself as a force in the shaping of polities , and the arousing , among men of the same stock , of a common consciousness of their own distinctive char - acter .

		In a word , the formula of taste is being fulfilled before our very eyes in the combined literary , social , and political movement of the present day among the chief peoples of our modern world .

		* No straightforward account of a life devoted to noble ends can fail of being noteworthy and helpful .

		Dr.
Cuyler	PERSON	's recollections of a life that has been both long and broad are as uplifting as they are interesting .


Aurora	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, was his birthplace ,
Princeton	PERSON	gave him his education , both academic and theological , and
Brooklyn	LOCATION	has been the chief field of his pastoral labors .

		But no parochial boundaries or sectarian dividing lines limit his influence and repute as preacher and writer .

		Extensive travel and intercourse with many men have broadened and enriched his life , so that what he now o # fers us , in his modest little volume of reminiscences of an octogenarian , is the more valuable because of the still greater wealth it suggests as held in reserve .

		What most impresses us in Dr.
Cuyler	PERSON	is the admirable union of conservatism and pro- gressiveness .

		Distrustful of the '' new the - ology '' and the '' higher criticism , '' he yet braves the displeasure of the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Pres - bytery by ipviting a Quakeress to deliver a religious address from his pulpit -- and that , be it added , was thirty years ago .

		A letter written to him by the late President
Harrison	PERSON	shows our author to be as staunch an anti- imperialist as his correspondent .

		In matters literary , he says a wise word in praise of our past and in deprecation of that lessening devo - tion to the ideal that marks an era of exuber - ant material prosperity .

		An enthusiastic ad - vocate of temperance and a tireless laborer in its cause , he nevertheless would carry legisla - tive prohibition no further than what is known as local option . ''

		In theory , '' he says , '' I always have been , and am to-day , a legal sup - pressionist ; but the most vital remedy of all is to break up the demand for intoxicants , and to persuade people from wishing to buy and drink them .

		That goes to the root of the evil . ''

		Dr.
Cuyler	PERSON	first visited

		As he is one of the few now living who have seen and talked with

		appearance I was somewhat startled .

		Instead of a grave recluse in scholastic black , whom I expected to gee , I found an affable and lovable old man dressed in the roughest coat of blue with metal buttons , and checked trousers , more like a
New York	LOCATION	farmer than an English poet .

		His nose was very large , his forehead a lofty dome of thought , and his long white locks hung over his stooping shoulders ; his eyes presented a singu - lar , half closed appearance .

		We entered at once into a delightful conversation .

		He made many inquiries about Irving , Mrs.
Sigourney	PERSON	and our other American authors , and spoke , with g ^ at vehemence , in favor of an international copyright law .

		He said that at one time he had hoped to visit
America	LOCATION	, but the duties of a small ofQce which he held -LRB-
Distributer of Stamps	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and upon which he was partly dependent , prevented the undertaking . ''

		From his reminiscences of Dean Stanley we select the following , which has reference to the Dean 's visit to
America	LOCATION	in
1878	DATE	: '' When we entered the elevated railroad car ,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	exclaimed : ' This is like the chariots on the walls of Babylon . '

		With his keen interest in history he inquired when we reached the lower part of the Bowery , near the junction of
Chatham Square	LOCATION	: < Was it not here that
Nathan Hale	PERSON	, the martyr , was executed ? '

		and he showed then a more accurate knowledge of our local history than one
New Yorker	LOCATION	in ten thousand can boast I That was probably the exact locality , and
Dean Stanley	ORGANIZATION	had never been there before . ''

		With
Spurgeon	PERSON	he was on the friendliest of terms .

		`` Spurgeon 's power lay in a combination of half a dozen great qualities .

		He was the master of a vigorous Saxon English style , the style of
Cobbett	PERSON	and
Bunyan	PERSON	and the old English Bible .

		He possessed a most mar - velous memory -- it held the whole Bible in solution ; it retained all the valuable truth he had acquired during his immensely wide readings and it enabled him to rec - ognize any person whom he ever met before .

		Once , however , be met for the second time a Mr.
Patridge	PERSON	and called him ` Partridge . '

		Quick as a flash he said : < Pardon me , sir , I did not intend to make game of yon . ' ''


Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	's tribute to
Daniel Webster	PERSON	's commanding appearance is historic . ''

		That man , '' he declared , '' is a fraud ; for it is im - possible for anyone to be as great as he looks . ''

		Dr.
Cuyler	PERSON	is equally unrestrained in his ad - miration . ''

		In the days of my boyhood the most colossal figure , physically and intellectually , in American politics , was
Daniel Webster	PERSON	.

		I well remember when I first put eye npon him .

		It was when I was pursuing my studies in the
New York University Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	in prepara - tion for
Princeton College	ORGANIZATION	.

		I was strolling one day on the Battery , and met a friend who said to me : ' Yonder goes
Daniel I Webster	PERSON	; he has just landed from that man-of-war ; go and get a good look at him . '

		I hastened my steps and , as I came near him , I was as much awe - striken as if I had been gazing on
Bunker Hill Monu	ORGANIZATION	- ment .

		He was unquestionably the most majestic speci - men of manhood that ever trod this continent .

		Carlyle called him ■ The Great Norseman , ' and said that his 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, eyes were like great anthracite furnaces that needed blowing up .

		Coal heavers in
London	LOCATION	stopped to stare at him as he stalked by ... His complexion was a swarthy brown .

		He used to say that while his hand - some brother
Ezekiel	PERSON	was very fair , he ' had all the soot of the family in his face . '

		Such a mountain of a brow I have never seen before or since . ''

		A walk with
Whittier	LOCATION	is thus recalled : '' On the way I told him that not long before , wnen I quoted a verse of
Bryant	ORGANIZATION	's to
Horace Greeley	PERSON	, Mr.
Greeley	PERSON	replied : '
Bryant	PERSON	is all very well , but by far the greatest poet this country has produced is
John Greenleaf Whittier	PERSON	. ' '

		Did our friend
Horace	PERSON	say that ? '

		meekly inquired
Whittier	LOCATION	, and a smile of satisfaction flowed over bis
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	countenance .

		The man is not born yet who does not like an honest compliment , especially if it comes from a high quarter . ''

		One more citation .

		In the darkest period of the Civil War our autobiographer , in com - pany with his mother , called upon President Lincoln . ''

		We entered the room in which the Cabinet usually met -- and there , before the fire , stood the tall , gaunt form attired in a seedy frock-coat , with his long hair unkempt , and his thin face the very picture of distress . '

		How is Mrs.
Lincoln	PERSON	? '

		inquired my mother . '

		Oh , ' said the President , < I have not seen her since seven
o'clock this morning	TIME	; Tad , how is your mother ? ' '

		She is pretty well , ' replied the little fellow , who was coiled up then in an arm chair ... We spent but a few minutes with Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, and when we came out my mother exclaimed : < Oh , what a cruelty to keep that man here !

		Did you ever see such a sad face in your life ? ' ''

		In
1890	DATE	, after forty-four years in the min - istry , and at the close of a thirty-years pastorate at the
Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church	ORGANIZATION	of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, Dr.
Cuyler	PERSON	resigned his charge .

		He had built up the church to a membership of two thousand three hundred and thirty -- the third largest in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		A few closing words on the methods that led to such success as a preacher and pastor may not be out of place .

		Earnestness was with him the prime essential .

		His sermon , too , was always an outgrowth from his text ; his text was not a cap clapped on to a written discourse at the last minute . ''

		Preach my word '' he took in its literal sense . ''

		When a passage from the Holy Scripture , '' he says , `` has been planted as a root and well watered with prayer , the sermon should
spring	DATE	naturally from it . ''

		No time was spent by him in propping up the Cross ; it was all needed for pointing sinners to it . ''

		I never have wasted a single minute in defending God 's Word in my pulpit , '' he declares . ''

		God will take care of His Word if we ministers only take care to preach it . ''

		Dr.
Cuyler	PERSON	is in favor of the written sermon , though admitting that no hard and fast rule can be laid down to cover all cases .

		He says that '' Dr.
Chalmers	PERSON	read every line of his ser - mons with thrilling effect .

		So did Dr.
Charles Wadsworth	PERSON	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and so did
Phil	PERSON	- lips
Brooks	PERSON	in
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		Surely that was a curious kind of reading that poured in such a torrent of seemingly impromptu eloquence from
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	pulpit .

		But Dr.
Allen	PERSON	, in his recent life of
Bishop Brooks	PERSON	, describes him as writing out his sermons with the greatest care -- at least in his early career .

		Beecher , too , is cited by Dr.
Cuyler	PERSON	as one who has been mistakenly regarded as an extemporaneous preacher . ''

		He prepared most of his dis - courses carefully , and full one-half of many of them were written out . ''

		The minister should not dissipate his energies , says our author .

		His place is in his pulpit and in the homes of his parishioners ; general reform movements must not be allowed to engross his attention .

		As to the minister 's wife , her true place is in her home , as the mother of her family ; here is her sphere of highest usefulness .

		The book 's too frequent instances of care - less workmanship -LRB- largely printer 's errors , probably -RRB- call for critical disapprobation -- amid so much that is irreproachable .

		Perhaps the most annoying to the author will be the designation of his writings as lubrications ; but we laid down and Champs des Mars are almost as bad , and less easily attributable to the imp of the types .

		* The fall of

United States	LOCATION	; for the result of the famous movement of

		The oft-quoted state - ment of Choiseul , that he had ceded

		J THE DIAL 207 the western world .

		The American Revolntion was a direct result of the change in ownership of
North America	LOCATION	, and the attempt of the mother country to provide for the expenses of the war by securing revenue from the colonies , which , it felt , had been benefitted by the out - come of the war .

		led to the series of measures which culminated finally in the Declaration of Independence .

		This phase of American history has been emphasized so often by writers as to become familiar to everyone , but the history of those days when
New France	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	ex - isted side by side in
America	LOCATION	has not been so well known .

		Indeed , there has always been a tendency to hasten over this period and to sum - marize , in connection with the ending of
New France	LOCATION	, the whole history of the years between the founding of
Jamestown	LOCATION	and
1763	DATE	.

		It is an interesting thing to recall that
Champlain	LOCATION	, upon the St.
Lawrence	PERSON	and under the flag of
France	LOCATION	, Hudson on the river which bears his name and under the flag of
Holland	LOCATION	, and the
Jamestown	LOCATION	settlers under the English banner , were active at the same time ; the years
1607	DATE	,
1608	DATE	, and
1609	DATE	being the period when these three nations were contending for a foothold on American soil .

		It was the purpose of the late
John Fiske	PERSON	to complete his notable series of historical writings by a volume which should fit in between '' The Dutch and
Quaker Colonies	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	'' and `` The American Revolution . ''

		In connection with a description of the scope of the volume first named Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	wrote : '' It is mv purpose , in mv next book , to deal with the rise and fall of
New France	LOCATION	and the development of the English colonies as influenced bv the prolonged struggle with that troublesome and dangerous neigh - bonr .

		With this end in view , the history of New En - gland must be taken up where the earlier book dropped it , and the history of
New York	LOCATION	resumed at about the same time , while by degrees we shall find the histories of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and the colonies to the south of it swept into the main stream of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	history .

		That book will come down to the year
1765	DATE	, which witnessed the ringing out of the old and the ringing in of the new , -- the one with
Pontiac	LOCATION	's War , the other with the Stamp Act .

		I hope to have it ready in about two years from now . ''

		The much-regretted death of the author pre - vented him from giving to the present work that careful and final revision which marked his other writings previous to their publication .

		The subject-matter was largely formulated as lectures before the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	, and , in the case of one or two chapters , as lectures given in other parts of the country .

		Only the first two chapters of the book , cover - ing the early history of
New France	LOCATION	, from
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	to
Champlain	LOCATION	's accidental arousing of the enmity of the Iroquois , were definitely prepared for the press .

		The third chapter , continuing the hbtory of
New France	LOCATION	from
1610	DATE	to the time of Sir
Thomas Temple	PERSON	, was not completed by Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	, bat has been finished by another hand .

		The remaining chapters , while in the form of carefully pre - pared lectures , were not enriched by the abun - dant side-notes and annotations which have been features of Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's other historical writings .

		Here again another hand has at - tempted to supply some of the matter which the author himself might have added .

		But the reader misses in many places those skilful touches which have perfected so many of Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's rounded sentences .

		The description of the taking of
Louisburg	LOCATION	, for instance , or that of Braddoek `` s Defeat , or of the Fall of
Quebec	LOCATION	, had hardly reached final form .

		One feels too that the long chapter on '' Witchcraft in
Salem Village	LOCATION	, '' and the shorter one on '' The Great Awakening , '' the two making nearly a third of the text , occupy more space relatively than would have been the case had Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	lived to revise the work .

		Apart from this criticism , the chapters mentioned are very interesting , and show well the author 's characteristics as a thinker and writer .

		The title , ''
New France	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	, '' suggests a contemporaneous development in
America	LOCATION	of two distinct forces .

		In the work - ing out of the plan it was , of course , easier to describe the history of
New France	LOCATION	than that of
New England	LOCATION	.

		The former practically be - gan with
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	in
1524	DATE	, and ended with the Treaty of
1763	DATE	, -- a compact period of time .

		The impelling ideas of colonization , the char - acter of the population , the policies of the mother country , the misgovernment of the provinces , and the final catastrophe , are facts pretty clearly established .


New France	LOCATION	had its day and then passed from sight .

		In the case of
New England	LOCATION	the period is bat one part in the chain of events in the his - tory of the incipient L ^ nited States , and judg - ments of men and of events naturally differ from those formed in connection with a finished career .

		Considering this phase of the writing , the salient features of colonial history and the leading characters find satisfactory treatment .

		Due credit is given to the energetic Scotch - Irish and German pioneers for their notable achievements in pushing westward the sinuous 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, line of settlement , and the interplay of various felements in the struggle for the mastery of the continent is well set forth .

		Perhaps nowhere else is to be found in condensed and compact form the essential and the striking in the his - tory of the old French and Indian wars .

		While , therefore , the volume lacks much of that which it certainly would have contained had Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	been able to give to it the thoughtful care which he gave to the other books in the series , it will be hailed with much satisfaction by the thousands of his friends who have followed him with delight as he has re - counted the story of
America	LOCATION	's development .

		Bryce on thb Problems of Race . ''

		The recent Oxford lecture on `` The Eela - tions of the Advanced and
Backward Races of Mankind	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	, whom all Americans have come to know and esteem as the author of '' The
American Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, '' has already set the sociological world agog .

		Although Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	has brought forth little that is new as to the relations of diverse races , yet he has given perhaps the clearest and most comprehensive utterance on the subject of any authority of his eminence .

		The treatment , be - ing limited to the compass of a single lecture , is concise and thematic .

		One could wish that the author might yet find time to expand this definitely limited deliverance into a big book which alone is adequate to so big a subject .

		After briefly pointing out the historic con - tact of races , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	tells us that '' Our own time stands eminent and peculiar for this : that it marks the completion of a process by which all the races of the world have been affected , and all the backward ones placed in a more or less complete dependence upon the advanced . ''

		There is no undoing what has already been done .

		To the historic motives influencing race contact there have been added two new ones ,
viz.	LOCATION	, '' The desire of civilized producers of goods to secure savage or semi - civilized consumers by annexing regions they inhabit , and the rivalry of great civilized states . ''

		Our ears are so accustomed to moral cant and pious platitude , whenever a strong race would • The Relations op thb Advanced and

		exploit a weak one , that this frank and candid statement is indeed refreshing .

		Throughout the whole lecture one finds little or nothing placed to the credit of '' benevolent assimila - tion . '' ''

		The completion of this world-process is a specially great and fateful event , because it closes a page forever . ''

		This sentence is heavily fraught with significance for the future of civilization .

		When the world is placed under the dominance of two or three powerful na - tions , they will necessarily check or stop spon - taneity and independence of development in the backward and submerged breeds .

		These will scarcely be permitted to bring forth their peculiar contribution to the general sum of human culture .

		What will civilization then do for fresh blood and newness of life ?

		The possible outcome of race-contact is an - alyzed as -LRB- 1 -RRB- the extermination of the weaker element ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- absorption of the weaker by the stronger ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the commingling of the two ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- a continuance of separate and the independent racial types .

		It is strange that reference was not made to expulsion , some - times of the backward , sometimes of the ad - vanced race , which is not an unusual means of solution .

		The Jews were expelled from
Egypt	LOCATION	, the whites were driven from
Haiti	LOCATION	and SanDomingo .

		Indications are not wanting that the Anglo-Saxon element will be expelled from certain sections of the
Southern States	LOCATION	known as the '' Black Belt , '' , -- not , to be sure , vi et armis , but by the slow , glacial force of racial momentum .

		Extinction of the weaker race is usually preceded by expulsion from the midst of the stronger .

		The red Indian has been driven from the eastern portion of the
United States	LOCATION	, and the natives of the oceanic islands have first been pushed to the outer verge of their native territory before succeeding waves of Aryan aggression wiped them off the face of the earth .

		The process is a continuing one . ''

		Barbarism is not more pitiless than civiliza - tion , even where civilization may wish to spare . ''

		The red and the oceanic races have faded at the first breath of European civilization .

		To use the rather expressive language of Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	, -- they have been '' civilized stiff . ''

		But the black and the yellow races seem to possess a tenacity of persistence which does not yield to race attrition .

		The first question which one wishes to know about the contact of two races is the degree of natural antipathy existing between them .

		The author finds this most marked between the white and black races . ''

		I have been struck , ''

		THE DIAL 209 he says . ''

		by hearing men in the Rocky
Monn	PERSON	- tains , who would have concealed any infusion of Negro blood , mention that their mothers or grandmothers were Indians . ''

		Just how far this preference is due to color , or to other cir - cumstances , is not disclosed .

		The fact that the Indian has never been a slave , and that he is a rapidly vanishing quantity from the general equation , adds a glamor of romance to his race ; while the more numerous Negro , with his stubborn persistency of type , is aggravat - ingly real .

		Many of the
F. F. V.	PERSON	's of the Old Dominion are not ashamed to own a strain of the blood of Pocahontas ; but if the race of this Indian heroine was as numerous and as trouble - some as that of the African , her blood would doubtless be held in like disesteem .

		The evils of race conflict , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	con - siders inevitable . ''

		These troubles may be apprehended , whatever the form of govern - ment : for they spring out of the nature of things .

		They will become , in one sense at least , more accentuated the more that -LSB- the backward '' -RRB- race advances in intelligence and knowledge . ''

		This conclusion is sadly at varianoe with the opinion which relies upon education to solve the race-problem in the
United Sutes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	takes , on the whole , an unfavorable view of the effect of cross-breeding of wide apart ethnic types .

		Where the races are not assimilable , as in the
United States	LOCATION	, the author would minimize the evil of contact by giving to the backward race ' • all such private civil rights as it can use to its own benefit . ''

		But who is to be the judge ?

		No slaveholder would claim that he did less .

		It has been said by a wise man of recent times that no one is good enough to be intrusted with the liberty of an - other .

		Can one race ever be a fair and impar - tial judge of the feelings and aspirations of another , and of its ability to utilize civil priv - ileges ?

		Political privilege should not , it is affirmed , be based upon race and blood , but upon some fair test which applies alike to all , although it might exclude the bulk of the backward race .

		The subject of social relations is settled by Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	in a single sentence : '' Good feel - ings and good manners can not be imposed by a statute . ''

		Among the contingencies which may affect the future relations of the race are mentioned the advance in biological and med - ical knowledge , and in mechanical appliances , which may be expected to open up new regions to European residence .

		The intellectual and moral progress of the backward race is also fraught with great sig - nificance for the future . ''

		The difference be - tween them and the advanced races lies not so much in intelligence as in force of will and tenacity of purpose .

		How far these latter qualities can be developed with a developing intellect is still doubtful , for the future will bring new opportunities . ''

		The changes that may take place in the religious world are also supposed to have much determining influence npon the future relations of races .

		The author states that religious sanction is less strong than the bond of blood , although his argu - ments and citations persuade the reader to the opposite conclusion .

		When Jesus was chided for his seeming indifference toward his own kindred , he responded : `` Who is my mother and who are my brethren ?

		For whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven , the same is my brother and sister and mother . ''

		Religion can command or forbid the mixture of races , and this will be done , as the case of .

		Judaism on the one hand , and of Mohammedanism on the other , clearly show .

		The superiority of Mohammedanism to
Chris	PERSON	- tianity and of the Catholic to the Protestant sect , in their control over the rancour of race , is acknowledged .

		The author asks : '' Can one of these causes be that Christianity achieves less because it aims at more ? ''

		Then , answer - ing his own question , he adds : '' Christians , of course with many noble exceptions , have failed to rise to the level of the higher teach - ings , while Moslems have risen to the level of the lower . ''

		And yet the teaching of the two religions is identiciil as respects the treatment of those who are of the same household of faith .

		If one might so speak , it might be aptly said that in case of the Protestant , he has his re - ligion ; whereas in the case of the Catholic , and especially the Moslem , his religion has him .

		Therefore we may expect from the latter a closer adherence to the requirements of the colt . ''

		Conceive , '' suggests our author . ''

		what a difference it might make if Islam were , within two centuries , to disappear from the earth !

		** If we may be permitted to indulge the imagina - tion a little further , let us conceive what a dif - ference it might make if within that period some new
Martin Luther	PERSON	were to arise who should substitute for the ancient motto about the vital power of personal faith another bear - ing more directly upon the prevailing apostasy from the teaching of the great head of the church , to wit : '' There is neither Greek nor 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision ,
Barba	PERSON	- rian nor Scythian , bond nor free ; but
Christ	LOCATION	is all and in all . ''

		Suppose , also , that this reformer should be as potent and persuasive over the Christian world as was his Teutonic prototype .

		Can we not readily see what an effect such a propaganda might have upon the relations of the various peoples and tongues ?

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's final word leaves us balanced between hope and fear , with hope slightly in the ascendancy .

		`` It is a process which has now entered a critical phase , and we see before us long vistas in which there appear possibilities of an immense increase in the pro- ductive powers of earth and man , possibilities also of trouble and strife between races now being brought into closer and more general contact .

		As always , ele - ments of peril are balanced by elements of hope .

		The sentiment of race pride , the keenness of race rivalry , have been intensified .

		But the sense of a common humanity has grown stronger .

		When we think of the problems which are being raised by the contact of races , clouds seem to hang heavy on the horizon of the future ; yet light streams in when we remember that the spirit in which civilized states are preparing to meet those problems is higher and purer than it was , when , four centuries ago , the great outward movement of European peoples began .

		Some Musical Intimacies .

		* Out of an extended musical experience and much browsing in his own extensive musical library , Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	has written a series of little essays , ten in number , which might very well bear the title of '' Musical Intimacies , '' instead of the '' Musical Pastels '' chosen for it .

		One thinks of pastels as misty in outline , not fixed in material , and devoted to light and genial topics not wholly serious and yet never wholly whimsical ; and nothing could be further from describing the papers in this interesting book .

		Mr.
Upton	PERSON	is earnest and virile in both his choice of themes and his treatment of them .

		His pictures are drawn with a firmness and a freedom that suggest the charcoal sketch , rather than the pastel .

		And so thoroughly informed is he , and so clearly within his own chosen field of knowl - edge , that his book has more than ordinary promise of becoming a permanent contribu - tion to its class of literature .

		In style and treatment the volume is remin - iscent of Mr.
Upton	PERSON	's earlier work , '' Woman • Musical Pastels .

		By

Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurg & Co	ORGANIZATION	, in Music , '' but with the differences that a wider outlook and a broader subject , or series of subjects , permit .

		His choice is catholic , ranging down to the living present from the initial essay on '' Nero the Artist , '' in which the modern view that sees something more in the
Koman	PERSON	emperor than a summing up of all the iniquities finds full expression ; as when the story of
Nero	ORGANIZATION	's fiddling while
Rome	LOCATION	burned is commented on thus : '' If
Nero	PERSON	bad been musically inclined at such a time , he would have been the artist , and sung to the accom - paniment of his cithara some stirring psean , while stately palaces and temples of the gods were < in one red burial blent . '

		...
Nero	ORGANIZATION	's efforts to stay its -LSB- the fire 's -RSB- progress , to alleviate the distress caused by it , and to restore the waste places by building them up more splendidly than before , are of themselves suffi - cient to acquit him of the charge of incendiarism ; but , nevertheless , he will be held responsible through all coming ages for the burning of
Rome	LOCATION	, as well as for the added indecorum of fiddling on the top of his tower -- though there were no ` fiddles ' at that time , and though Nero antedated his tower by more than two centuries .

		But if
Nero	ORGANIZATION	sang the ' Ruin of Troy ' in the midst of the conflagration , it was his last public musical performance , and thus he literally ended his artistic career in a ' blaze of glory . ' ''

		A gossippy account of `` The Musical Small - Coals Man , ''
Thomas Britton	PERSON	-LRB- 1654-1714 -RRB- , follows ; and then we are given a sympathetic and liberal interpretation of the religious hold - ings of
Bach	LOCATION	,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	,
Haydn	ORGANIZATION	,
Mozart	PERSON	, and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, under the title of '' Music and Religion . ''

		Turning then to our own country , Mr.
Upton	PERSON	has more than a few pleasant things to say of `` The First American Composer , ''
William Billings	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	, who first '' de - clared American musical independence '' in '' The New England Psalm Singer '' in Octo - ber ,
1770	DATE	, his title-page containing the follow - ing invitation to the world : `` O , praise the Lord with one consent .

		And in this grand design Let
Britain	LOCATION	and the Colonies Unanimously jine . ''

		Mr.
Upton	PERSON	goes on to say : '' It is a far cry from the twentieth century back to the days of Billings , but there are still ears to be tickled and composers to tickle them .

		With all his love of sacred music and his apparent reverential feeling , he was not above paraphrasing a psalm now and then ; as , for instance , the 137th , ' By the rivers of
Babylon	LOCATION	, there we sat down . '

		When the British forces were camped at
Boston	LOCATION	and the Continentals at
Watertown	LOCATION	, he gave musical vent to his feelings with an astonishing production , beginning , < By the rivers of
Watertown	LOCATION	we sat down and wept when we remember thee , O

		of
France	LOCATION	, in the year
1600	DATE	, being the first public performance of any opera .

		It is char - acterized thus : '' It was a little band compared with those which accompany opera in the twentieth century .

		It was a modest array of singers compared with the tenors , baritones , bassos and prime donne of the troupes of to - day .

		The music was crude and harsh and monotonous as compared with the scores of the present time ; but the beginnings of all this twentieth century operatic magnificence were contained in the music to which
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and his ungracious queen listened on their wedding day , as the beginnings of the oak are con - tained in the acorn ; and though the full meaning of their great discovery may not have dawned upon
Peri	PERSON	,
Rinucciui	PERSON	, and their Florentine associates who had worked out the problem together at the
Palazzo Corsi	PERSON	, they knew they had created a new dramatic form in music .

		A little later ,
Monteverde	ORGANIZATION	, the Duke of
Mantua	LOCATION	's chapel-master , realized the possibilities latent in < Euridice , ' and proceeding upon the lines laid down by
Peri	ORGANIZATION	, still further developed the form ; but to
Jacopo Peri	PERSON	belongs the honor of the title , ' Father of the Opera . ' ''

		One of the most amusing chapters in the book is that headed with the
Virgil	PERSON	ian quota - tion ending ^ ^ Tanttene animis ca ^ lestibus tree ? ''

		and entitled '' Some Musical Controversies . ''

		It is finely inclusive , opening with the celebrated quarrel between the Italian and French expos - itors of the Gregorian chant in the days of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	, and coming down to
Wagner	PERSON	.

		One of the episodes has its scene in
London	LOCATION	, when the town was split between the followers of Cuzzoni and of
Bordoni	LOCATION	, rival prime donne .

		It was of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	, kept in the hottest of water by the disputatious rivals under his direction , that this classical incident is narrated : • `` Upon one occasion Cuzzoni refused to sing an aria in his '
Otho	PERSON	' because it did not suit her .

		The en - raged composer turned upon her and said : ' I know , madame , that you are a very devil ; but I will let you see that I am
Beelzebub	LOCATION	, the prince of the devils . '

		Suiting the action to the word , he seized her around the waist and threatened to throw her through the window if she did not sing it .

		Terrified at his rage , she consented , and made a great hit with the aria . ''

		The quarrels between LuUy and
Ramean	PERSON	and their respective adherents in
France	LOCATION	in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, of
Piccinni	ORGANIZATION	and
Gluck	PERSON	somewhat later , of
Mozart	PERSON	and
Rossini	PERSON	later still , and last of
Wagner	PERSON	with what was at first the world at large , are entertaining .

		Few have descended to the expedient by which the enemies of
Gluck	PERSON	gave a dinner with an overflow of wine to Mile .

		La Guerre , just be - fore she was to appear in the title role of one of his greatest compositions at its first pro- duction , -- leading a witty spectator to remark that '' She was not Iphigenia en Tauride , but
Iphigenia	LOCATION	en Champagne . ''

		Yet worse things were said , if not done , concerning
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, and the sentences about to be quoted should have a restraining effect upon too acrid critics : < * In
England	LOCATION	, where
Mendelssohn	PERSON	was an idol , the ' Athenaeum ' pronounced him -LSB-
Wagner	PERSON	-RSB- < a charlatan , ' and his music ` impious , profligate , and nauseating . '

		The ' Times ' spoke of him as a man whom ' it would be a scandal to compare with the men of reputation this country possesses , and whom the most ordinary ballad - writers would shame in the creation of melody , and of whose harmony no English harmonist could be found sufficiently without ears or education to pen such vile things . ' ''

		With the desultoriness which is not the least of the book 's many engaging qualities , Mr.
Upton	PERSON	takes his readers back to '' A Musical Royal Family , '' the one worthiest the name in history , and surprises more than one widely-read man with the announcement that it was made up of
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		of
England	LOCATION	,
Anne Boleyn	PERSON	his queen , and the three royal children ,
Edward	PERSON	, sixth of that name ,
Mary	PERSON	, and
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		All were accomplished musi - cians in a day which culminated , as we are reminded , with '' The reign of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, ... the Augustan era of music in
England	LOCATION	; and its glories have not been surpassed by those of any succeeding age . ''

		And what is rightly called '' a very pretty story '' is told of the Vir - gin Queen when she was still a virgin princess . ''

		During
Mary	PERSON	's reign she had little opportunity for amusement .

		She was sometimes suffered to walk in the palace garden at
Woodstock	LOCATION	.

		Upon one of these occasions she heard a milkmaid singing cheerily , and wished she were one , for ' her case is better and her life is merrier . '

		May not
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	have had this story in mind when writing
Henry the Sixth	ORGANIZATION	's battle soliloquy : '' ' O God !

		methinks it were a happy life , To be DO better than a homely swain ; To sit upon a bill , as I do now .

		Bullfinch and
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	, '' the names of the two songsters having been applied to two collections of ballads and their music , one British and the other American , affords the commentator an opportunity to give a little history of English balladry from the musical rather than the literary point of view , his own copy of `` The Bullfinch '' having been the property of

		Schlosser , a friend , says : ' A student of human na - ture could tell at a glance that he was in the presence of a genius .

Vienna	LOCATION	, on the other hand , says : < He is short and insignificant looking , with a red face .

		Mr.

Beethoven	PERSON	's beloved was the Countess Guic - ciardi , by saying , '' More recent investigations have established beyond much doubt that the -LSB- love -RSB- letters were addressed to the
Countess Teresa	ORGANIZATION	von Brunswick . ''

		The book is most suitably illustrated by re - productions of old plates , many of them por - traits of the celebrities mentioned ; and it is admirably printed on good paper , and fittingly bound .

		A
Bibliography of American Histort	ORGANIZATION	.

		* For ten years Mr.
George	PERSON	lies has been advocating , before the American Library As - sociation and elsewhere , a plan for a systematic appraisal of all literature by specialists in its various departments .

		The plan requires that competent critics shall provide for all avail - able books a sort of museum description , which shall indicate their strong and weak points and sum up their general value , in order that the librarian may have at hand a convenient guide to assist him in purchasing books and answer - • The Literature op

		ing questions and that the public may in their reading have some means of distinguishing the wheat from the chaff .

		Manifestly so comprehensive a plan can be executed only in sections .

		After some pre - * liminary experiments , Mr. lies made his first attempt to cover systematically a distinct field of literature by editing some five years ago '' An Annotated Bibliography of Fine Art '' prepared by Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry E. Krehbiel	PERSON	.

		Subsequently , in order to cover a larger field and reach a wider circle of readers , he very generously gave the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION
$ 10,000	MONEY	to meet the ex - pense of compiling a bibliography of American history .

		The general editorship of the work was undertaken without compensation by Mr.
J. N. Lamed	PERSON	of the
Buffalo Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Larned	PERSON	associated with himself some forty assistants , most of whom are well known as teachers or students in this particular field .

		The result of their labors is the recently - published '' Literature of
American History	ORGANIZATION	, '' which presents an annotated list of some four thousand titles and comes down to the year
1900	DATE	.

		In order to keep up with current lit - erature , it is intended to issue periodically supplements which shall cover all later publi - cations .

		In view of the multiplicity of books and the rapid growth of public libraries , there can be little question of the value of the plan .

		Where the doctors disagree , as they are bound to in many cases , one opinion may be more mis - leading than no opinion at all ; but notwith - standing this drawback , the advantages of the plan greatly outweigh the objections to it .

		Judgment of the work must therefore turn upon the success with which the plan has been executed .

		The problem of classification is for the most part well solved , but it was a mistake to group state histories by sections rather than by states .

		Certain books treating of sections as a whole had to be grouped together ; but it is confus - ing , in looking for the histories of one state , to find them mixed with the histories of a dozen others .

		The inequality of the annotations fur - nishes the most evident ground for criticism .

		Many of them are models of condensed and accurate statement , others are less satisfactory , while some are altogether inadequate .

		A con - siderable proportion consist of extracts from reviews in The Dial , The Nation , The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	,
The American Historical Review	ORGANIZATION	, and other similar sources ; these notes are

		THE DIAL 213 oommonlj ansatisfaetoiy , not throngh any fault of the reviews but because , by taking a part from the whole , the effect of the whole is lost .

		In the case of recent books it would have been well to have added an appropriate note containing references to various reviews , in order that the reader might compare con - flicting criticisms and form his own conclu - sions .

		Mr.
Lamed	PERSON	modestly admits that he is not a specialist in American history and that he lacks the qualifications requisite for the super - vision of bibliographical work in it .

		Under these circumstances , we would have expected him to assign each section to a competent Bpecialist in that section , in order that the notes might be made up in groups .

		To some extent this has been done , and always to ad - vantage .

		If the entire work had been more thoroughly organized in this way there would have been greater uniformity .

		As it is , the notes of most of the contributors are more or less scattered over the whole field , with a re - salting incongruity that would not have oc - curred under more systematic treatment .

		Take for example the page devoted to
John Brown	PERSON	: the notes are either written by different hands or drawn from reviews , so that there is uni - formity neither in the treatment nor in the point of view .

		The editor forestalls criticism in regard to selection and completeness by saying that the work is '' intended to be neither an exhaustive bibliography of American history , nor a mere selection of the best books in that department of literature ... The selective aim in its preparation has been to embrace the books of every character , good , bad , and indifferent , concerning which it seems important that readers of various classes should be told what their merit or demerit is . ''

		That there should be some omissions and some slips in so com - prehensive a work was unavoidable .

		For books of collected essays , like
Chamberlain	PERSON	's ''
John Adams	PERSON	, '' a table of contents should have been given .

		So useful an introduction as
Ruge	PERSON	's '' Entwickelung der Kartographie von Amer - ika , '' and so monumental a work as
Xorden	PERSON	- skiold 's '' Facsimile Atlas , '' should have been included .

		Reference is made to the abstract of Gen.
G. K. Warren	PERSON	's memoir in
Wheeler	DATE	's Survey , but not to the complete memoir in the
Pacific	LOCATION	Railroad Survey nor to the latter Survey .

		The reader is advised to compare
Reddaway	PERSON	's ''
Monroe	PERSON	Doctrine '' with De Beanmarchais , but the latter is not listed .


Watson	PERSON	's '' Adventures of a Blockade Runner '' suggests
Taylor	PERSON	's `` Running the Blockade '' which is important because its author was the principal organizer of the blockade-running fleet .

		Why Olmsted 's ``
Texas	LOCATION	'' and `` Back Country '' should not be given the same recog - nition as his '' Seaboard Slave States , '' or a single appraisal be given to the series , is not apparent .

		The '' Colonial Tracts '' reprinted from
Force	ORGANIZATION	's collection by Mr.
G. P. Hum	PERSON	- phrey , are listed as if edited by
Peter Force	ORGANIZATION	in person .

		There is some duplication : Lum - mis 's '' Spanish Pioneers '' and Bandelier 's '' Gilded Man '' are both twice listed and ap - praised .

		But notwithstanding some inequality and occasional inaccuracy , the work as a whole will be indispensable to librarians and useful to all teachers of American history .

		Booker Wathington on character building .

		Mr.
Booker T. Washington	PERSON	's new volume entitled '' Character Build - ing '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- is a collection of chapel addresses delivered by Mr.
Washington	PERSON	to the students of
Tuskegee Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		The subject - matter consists of a discussion of such homely vir - tues and duties as cheerfulness , helpfulness , sim - plicity , earnestness , cleanliness , and honesty , in some of their neglected applications to every-day life .

		An almost severe simplicity and directness of style gives an unsophisticated charm to these homely exhortations .

		There is no hint of affecta - tion or of pedantry .

		Though Mr.
Washington	PERSON	puts none of his criticisms of the negro in sugar-coated rhetoric , no taint of cynicism nor suggestion of con - scious superiority appears .

		If it be objected that his messages lack originality , it is enough to say that the principal of Tuskegee has here a higher motive than the desire to be original .

		He is striving to uplift his race . ''

		That is never too often repeated which is not sufficiently learned . ''

		Some readers may be surprised that these chapel addresses are not more directly religious .

		While it is true that the self-conscious type of Christian experience is not exploited , still it should be remembered that no one could fulfil the ideals so enthusiastically offered in this volume without becoming deeply religious .

		A sane optimism pervades every address .

		The negro is far enough from ideal manhood , but it is presented as something not beyond his possibilities .

		A noble character challenges strenuous endeavor .

		These helpful and cheering exhortations are incal - culably more valuable to the colored people than any pious pratings .

		The charm of Mr.
Washing	PERSON	- ton 's earlier work , `` Up from Slavery , '' is of course not to be found in the present volume .

		In that unique autobiography , prosaic maxims and hack - neyed precepts are illuminated by the author 's suc - cessful career ; and this interplay of personal expe - rience and homely precept gave a subtle charm to the autobiography which '' Character Building '' of course does not enjoy .

		But the same virtues reju - venated in '' Up from Slavery '' are in these ad - dresses rescued from dulness by a directness of speech and an aptness of illustration which ad - mirably suit their character and purpose .

		The volume is to be recommended to all those who desire to become better acquainted with the char - acter and methods of the principal of
Tuskegee	ORGANIZATION	, as well as to all those who are wise enough to seek new incentives in the building of character .

American Army Officer	ORGANIZATION	, his Studies , Discipline , and Amuse - ments , '' and a semi-official character is given it by a brief commendatory introduction by Colonel
Albert L. Mills	PERSON	,
U. S. A.	PERSON	, superintendent of the academy .

		The book is voluminously illustrated from photographs , and no better account of the actualities of life at West Point could have been devised .

		Two reflections come to the reader : First , the enormous amount of work , both physical
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 215 and mental , which their teachers get oat of the cadets ; and , gecondlv , the care taken at every step of their edacation to give them aristocratic , as dis - tingaished from democratic .

		ideal '' .

		In the former particolar , it would seem to be hard work and insistent compalsion , rather than any novelty or modernness of method , that produce such reealts ; in the latter , it appears that a majority of the cadeta are the sons of hamble parents , who are con - verted into '' officers and gentlemen '' in the course of four years -- no bad argument for democracy , after alL Now that the holiday-makers are all ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ * t home or returning , it is a time for open-air books .

		Surely we do not need such in
Spring	DATE	, for then our spirit leaps at the hint alone of sea or mountains ; nor in
summer	DATE	, for no one in the company of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	wants to read of Nature ; nor even in
winter	DATE	, for the pleasant chimney-corner is certainly warm and satisfying , -- and why jar upon good comfort ?

		No , the time to read such a book as • • The Winding Road '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is now .

		when the reading is touched with the charm of gentle melancholy .

		There are many who love the out-door world : Some are hunters or fishermen ; some , artists or scientists ; some , lovers ; some , idlers .

		But there are also the wanderers who love the great without-walls because of its freedom .

		They are not to be constrained , even by the bar - baric power of rod or gun ; nor do they love Nature either to imitate or know .

		They have simply the out-door feeling in them .

		Other things they often do , -- hunt , fish , love , paint , know , idle : all of these things they may do , but they would be what they are did they not .

		Such was
Jasper	PERSON	of our present tale ; and it was the wandering instinct that gave charm to his life with
Phenice	PERSON	, who left the farm to follow him , and that in the end gave tragedy .

		Miss
Godfrey	PERSON	's book is full of the gypsy spirit , full of charm for those who have but a little of such a hectic in the blood .

		We could certainly find some fault with it as a novel , -- but we shall not , for it is rather as a bit of the epic-cycle of the open road that we have read it , and as such all lovers of the winding way will find it worthy a place beside what would be the classics of the wanderers , if it were not too much of a bother to carry books , even good ones , when one has once left the town behind .

		BrititA raiilfrjf Those who are familiar with the , , '' , J , • > .

		opinion which most of the inhabi - et Ike land 0 / ScoU . '

		^ .

		tants of continental
Europe	LOCATION	have of the British as a whole will read with unholy joy Mr.
T. W. H. Crosland	PERSON	's indictment of the northern half of
Britain	LOCATION	contained in ' * The Unspeakable Scot '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		For he has prepared an indict - ment against the Scottish nation , living and dead , and all that
Scotland	LOCATION	holds dear in everything ex - cept religion , which most of those who do not like
England	ORGANIZATION	will regard as an attempt to shift a burden from her own shoulders upon those of the sister kingdom .

		Mr.
Crosland	PERSON	has convinced himself that the reason for the present domination of the Scotchman in imperial affairs is due to no positiTB merit on his part , but only to the preoccupation and lethargy of the real Englishman .

		If this were true , it must still appear that the worse the case is made for
Scotland	LOCATION	the more profound the reflection cast upon
England	LOCATION	.

		But the book is not one to be taken too seriously at any point .

		It succeeds in making out its case by irony at the expense of the enthusiasts , so far as it makes any case at all .

		The Scottish love for
Robert Burns	PERSON	, which is quite as extreme as the Englishman 's reverence for Shake - speare , is easily brought to ridicule by selecting some of the most obnoxious of Bums 's rhymes for quotation , -- much as Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	sought to moderate a too inclusive worship of Shakespeare by a similar device .

		Americans , accustomed through several generations to see foreigners of all sorts in positions of power , have lost the provincial attitude toward those of another nation which makes Mr.
Crosland	PERSON	's book possible .

		Perhaps '' parochial '' is even a better word than '' provincial '' here .

		Probably no one is better qualified T ^ '' f ^ '' m than Mr.
R. G. Thwaites	PERSON	to under - take a biography of Father Mar - quette , the Jesuit explorer of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		For after all is brought together that may be , we are almost absolutely dependent for oar knowledge on the '' Jesuit Relations , '' in editing which Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	has deserved so well of patriotic Ameri - cans concerned for the minutest details of their country 's history .

		However treated , the life of an early American missionary can not fail to be inter - esting ; and this biography has the advantage of all of its kind .

		Yet on the whole , aside from the explor - ing voyages on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and its tributaries , it is a simple , uneventful life , and considerable effort was necessary to fill out the 250 pages as - signed by the standard of '' Appletons ' Historic Lives Series , '' to which the volume belongs .

		This effort becomes quite obvious when the author , despite the paucity of knowledge regarding
Marquette	ORGANIZATION	's youth and family circumstances , recites the historical vicissitudes of his native city of
Laon	LOCATION	from the Roman times down .

		It is felt also in the large space given to imaginary details of voyages and the considerable extracts from accounts of general mis - sionary life .

		Subtract these , and what remains would not be much more in bulk than the biographies of
Sparks	LOCATION	and
Shea	LOCATION	.

		Nevertheless , it is worth while to have this life in the honest and simple relation of one who knows at least all that is worth knowing on the subject .

WiUiam Black	ORGANIZATION	with Sir
Wemyss Reid	PERSON	.

		The pleasant volume bearing simply the name ``
William Black	PERSON	, Novelist : A Biography '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a most interesting recital of a fortunate career , in which honest work and marked abilities won their full recc ^ nition during the writers own 216 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, lifetime , to leave an impression of mellowness and contentment rare in the annals of literature .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	had many friends -LRB- among whom his biog - rapher was one of the nearest -RRB- , and although be passed away just at the close of his fifty-seventh year , having been long an invalid , these made even his last hours far more happy than the best of some men 's entire lives .

		Naturally , writing about such a personality , so circumstanced , the present biographer had a congenial and pious task in hand ; and he has discharged it with full sympathy and understanding .

		Many letters of the novelist en - liven his pages , -- for Black was quite as much a master of correspondence as of fiction ; and these are supplemented by many delightful letters in return from the best-known men of his day .

		An excellent likeness of
Black	ORGANIZATION	serves for frontispiece , and a complete index rounds out a book which can be studied by the writers of the coming generation with pleasure and profit , while it serves to bring many delightful things to the minds of their elders .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		In one of the daintiest of volumes , published in this country by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, an unnamed editor has collected with taste and discrimination something like four score '' Songs of
England	LOCATION	's Glory . ''

		Most of the old favorites are here , and also a number of modern pieces less familiarly known , but deserving of places in such a collection .

		We regret the omission of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's ode on the defeat of the Armada , which is worth a hundred of the two Armada poems included , but perhaps copyright reasons stood in the way .

		Mr.
Horace White	PERSON	's '' Money and Banking , '' which was first published
seven years ago	DATE	, has been issued in a second edition by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Considerable alterations have been made in the text , which no longer needs to be as controversial as when '' free silver '' was an actual political menace to our institutions , and the work in its present form is expressly rearranged as a teaching manual , being provided for that purpose with summaries and lists of authorities .

		There are several new chapters , and the work is distinctly more valuable than it was in its earlier form .

		The student of Amer - ican monetary affairs can find no more interesting and competent guide to the subject than is offered by this admirable volume .

		Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	's musical handbooks have long been valued by the concert-goer and the lover of opera .

		They furnish in compact and reliable form just the in - formation needed by the average non-musical person who wants to know enough about the work to which he is listening to take an intelligent interest in the per - formance .

		The remarkable vogue of comic opera dur - ing recent years has prompted Mr.
Upton	PERSON	to add '' The Standard Light Operas '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- to his well-known series .

		Brief descriptions are given of about seventy works , ranging all the way down from '' Mignon '' to ''
King Dodo	PERSON	, '' and from the operas of
Bellini	PERSON	and
Donizetti	ORGANIZATION	to those of Mr.
Reginald de Koven	PERSON	and Mr.
Leslie Stuart	PERSON	.

		Offenbach and
Lecocq	PERSON	are here -LRB- would that we might hear them now and then ! -RRB-

		and
Auber	PERSON	and Supp ^ and
Wallace	PERSON	.

		The entire series of Gilbert and
Sullivan	PERSON	productions is also included .

		Notes .

		Dr.
Charles McMurry	PERSON	has prepared a '' Teacher 's Manual of Geography '' to accompany the series of geographical text-books of which , in conjunction with Professor
Tarr	PERSON	, he is the author .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are the publishers .

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published '' An English-German Conversation Book , '' the work of Pro- fessors
Gustav Kriiger	PERSON	and
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	.

		The subject-matter of the conversations is highly practical , relating largely to matters of travel and education . ''

		A
College Manual of Rhetoric	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
James Sears Baldwin	PERSON	, is a recent publication of Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the title indicates , the work is for advanced students , and is provided with abundant material for the exercise of the student mind in the various forms of analysis and composition .

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published , in their '' Riverside Literature Series , ''
Miss Florence Holbrook	PERSON	's dramatization of '' Hiawatha , '' an arrange - ment of the text for the use of school-children which ought to prove the basis for an instructive and inter - esting form of entertainment .

		There are pictures , mu - sical numbers , and full directions for the performance .

		The title and author of the new romance dealing with the careers of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, to be issued next month by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, are now defi - nitely announced .

		The book will be called '' The Con - quest : The True Story of Lenris and
Clark	PERSON	, '' and the author is Mrs.
Eva Emery Dye	PERSON	, well-known through her previous volume on ''
McLoughlin	PERSON	and Old Oregon . ''

		An important series of monographs on '' The His - toric Highways of
America	LOCATION	, '' prepared by Mr.
Archer Butler Hulbert	PERSON	, is announced by the
Arthur H. Clark Co.	PERSON	of
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		There will be sixteen volumes in all , dealing collectively with the history of
America	LOCATION	as por - trayed in the evolution of its highways of war , com - merce , and social expansion .

		The enterprise should fill an important and hitherto unoccupied place in American historical literature .

		Two more preprints from the
Decennial Publications of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	have reached our table .

		Like the issues previously noted , these monographs are included in the quarto series .

		They are '' The Treat - ment of Nature in the Works of
Nikolaus Lenau	PERSON	, '' by Professor
Camillo von Klenze	PERSON	, and '' The Physical Characteristics of the Indians of
Southern Mexico	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Frederick Starr	PERSON	.

		The latter work has many illustrations in the form of portrait representa - tions of the types described .

		Having completed five semi-annual volumes in its first form , `` The International Monthly , '' edited by Mr.
Frederick A. Richardson	PERSON	, now becomes `` The International Quarterly . ''

		The
September	DATE	issue , just published , presents a dignified appearance , with its 214 large pages , and its even dozen of elaborate essays , supplemented by Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	's quarterly chronicle of current affairs .

		Attractive as was the early form of this review , it seems to us that the new one is in better accord with the serious character of the articles that Mr.
Richardson	PERSON	, with the aid of his advisory board , has been securing from the very start of bis enterprise .

		More clearly than ever before , this periodical asserts its position as the most important organ of contemporary thought that we now have , and becomes more than ever indispensable to the general reader of cultivated interests .

		THE DIAL 238 tween the work of Zola and the work of
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		The Bougon-Macquart books embodied the idea of the '' Comedie Hamaine '' over again , but with all the differences that half a century -- and that century the nineteenth -- could make .

		Zola had studied his Balzac , but he had also studied his
Taine	PERSON	and his Flaubert ; moreover , he had become imbued with the scientific spirit , and did his work in an age that had created the science of sociology , and that had come to understand something of the workings of heredity .

		These considerations will serve to make the contrast clear , and we must supple - ment them by saying that the sombre genius of Zola had no element of humor in its com - position .

		This fact alone made a '' human tragedy '' out of what might otherwise have been another sort of '' human comedy . ''

		Finally , we must say that Zjla , in his eager - ness to present types , frequently forgot to make them human beings as well , and that the aim of his work throughout is not so much the creation of individual characters as it is the presentation of situations and tendencies and the struggle of contending forces .

		At its best , this purpose led him to heights of epic grand - eur , but he achieved his most impressive effects at the expense of that individual characteriza - tion which the artistic novelist should never permit to escape from his view .

		No sooner had Zola completed his score of volumes devoted to the Rougon-Macquart an - nals than he was at work upon the trilogy of '' Les Trois Villes . ''

		In this less ambitious but still reasonably colossal undertaking , Ro - man Catholicism is the subject of investiga - tion ; and is studied successively at
Lourdes	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		To quote from Professor
B. W. Wells	PERSON	, who has provided the present arti - cle with more than one suggestion , the central thought of the trilogy is '' that emotional mys - ticism is a morbid compound of passion and pettiness , pity and pathos , sure to be exploited by the spirit of ecclesiastical commercialism . ''

		The tendency of the work is strongly anti- Catholic , but by no means anti-religious .

		The determined foe of every form of supernatural religion , the sturdy champion of reason in its secular struggle with unreason ,
Zola	PERSON	is yet no shallow materialist or advocate of a hedonistic ethics , but rather a voice pleading for the spir - itual qualities of human nature with all the passion at his command .

		If he seems to speak too urgently in the name of science , it is be - cause science has for him a larger than the common meaning , and includes , among other things , the full recognition of those energies that manifest themselves in the religious life .

		To direct these energies into rational channels is his aim , not to impoverish the life of the soul by repressing them .

		In this endeavor , the Zeitgeist is his potent ally , and the future will remember with gratitude his work for the liberation of the spirit from the trammels of superstition .

		The last great work planned by the great writer whose shocking death has left us with such a sense of loss was the tetralogy of '' Le '' Quatre Evangiles . ''

		The four gospels of the new religion of humanity are to be f ruitf ulness , labor , truth , and justice .

		To each of these great themes a volume was to be devoted , and with this magnificent conception we come to that - complete preoccupation with large ideas which so distinguishes the work of his latest years .

		Formerly , the central idea of a novel was apt to become submerged beneath the flood of detail that his method of treatment made necessary ; at last he learned to keep the idea afloat , and to make his voluminous observations contrib - ute to its exaltation .

		Of the four works pro- jected , `` Feeondite '' and `` Travail '' have beeo published ; '' Verite '' has been practically completed , and '' Justice '' alone is left unem - bodied in what we had hoped might become the masterpiece among all his works .

		But perhaps the battle which he fought for justice in the arena of public life would have been held for a finer monument to that master - passion of great souls than the epic fiction which he wished to consecrate to the idea .

		At least three of Zola 's four gospels may be ac - cepted by all who take an impersonal interest in the welfare of mankind .

		In preaching the gospel of fruitfulness he seems to us to have been mistaken .

		There is no people in the old world among whom well-being is more widely diffused than among his countrymen , and the nearly stationary population of
France	LOCATION	ap - pears to be one of the chief reasons for this fortunate state .

		Politicians and statesmen with dreams of military glory may desire an increas - ing birth-rate , but the sober philosopher will rather look with envy upon a people who are free from the constant increase of the pres - sure of population upon the means of sub - sistence .

		But the gospels of labor and truth and justice are eternally true , and the effort of no man 's life could have a nobler consecration than that with which Zola sought to crown his own labors , and which he had so nearly achieved at the time of his sudden taking off .

		284 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, When a great writer has died , and we come to ask questions about his work , the final ques - tion must always be as to whether that work is destined to survive .

		For the writer who makes his appeal to the world in the terms of art something more than ideas are needed to secure immortality .

		If we grant all that may be claimed for Zola 's ideas by the most enthu - siastic of his followers , we are still confronted with the question of their expression .

		Now it must be allowed that Zola 's style is not , for the most part , distinguished .

		Three-fourths of his many thousands of pages are heavy , shapeless , and hopelessly inartistic .

		On the other hand , there are purple patches of composition that meet the reader 's eye , often when he least ex - pects them , and fairly startle him into admir - ation .

		It is for the sake of these , if for any - thing , that Zola 's novels will continue to be read .

		The bulk of his work is already dead ; it represents an impossible method and a dis - credited literary tendency .

		But there is enough ■ of it that rises above the author 's own theories to retain for him the attention of all who are • willing to be at some pains for their literary satisfactions .

		When the memory of the man himself shall have passed away , and when his books as a whole remain only as instructive documents for the history of nineteenth century sociology , we can not believe that there will not still be a few readers who , strictly for art 's sake , will feel that it is worth while to explore the wilderness of his work for its buried treas - ures .

		And in the history of modern fiction , the figure of
Emile Zola	PERSON	, because of his fame and influence while he lived , can not fail to oc - cupy a commanding position .

		Oxford , on the 8th inst. , observed a notable anni - versary -- the three hundredth year of the opening of the Bodleian Library , the first public library in
England	LOCATION	, if not in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The real event is anticipated , because it was not until
November 8 , 1602	DATE	, that the present foundation was thrown open to the public by the munifi - cence of Sir
Thomas Bodley	PERSON	, once lecturer in Greek and public orator .

		At his own expense he refitted the bare walls of the library of
Humfrey	LOCATION	, Duke of
Gloucester	LOCATION	, founded about
1450	DATE	, but allowed to be completely broken up and dispersed .

		Sir
Thomas	PERSON	spent a fortune upon his library .

		He also had the foresight to bargain with the
Company of Stationers	ORGANIZATION	, in exchange for a gift of plate worth # 30 , that a copy of every book entered at
Stationers	ORGANIZATION	'
Hall	PERSON	should go to the library .

		In time it came about that registry at
Stationers	ORGANIZATION	'
Hall	PERSON	was re - quired to secure copyright , so that
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, as well as the British Museum , and the public libraries at Cam - bridge ,
Edinburg	LOCATION	, and
Dublin	LOCATION	get a free copy of every book published in
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		The Bodleian Library contains 600,000 bound volumes .

		A View of All , the Russias .

		* The liberality of Mr.
Henry Norman	PERSON	's politi - cal views , and the fact that , though an English - man , he was educated in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, have enabled him to write a book on the Rus - sian people and
State	ORGANIZATION	which is likely to prove of peculiar interest to Americans .

		Mr.
Norman	PERSON	is , first of all , sympathetic with
Russia	LOCATION	, and be - lieves the present Czar to be a man of dominant influence in his own dominions , bureaucratic traditions to the contrary notwithstanding , and that immense autocratic power is exercised with a fine humanitarianism , and always for the good of the Russian commonwealth .

		He is accordingly disposed to exalt the present system of government as approximating the ideal of a beneficent despotism , and he certainly looks upon it as better calculated to serve the needs of the governed here than any other sys - tem imaginable .

		He finds good in the childlike disposition of the commonality , and in the per - fect accord existing between them and the heirarchy , down to the humblest village priest .

		Though by no means abstaining from sharp and occasionally severe adverse criticism , his tone is always kindly , and the work appears to have been written with full comprehension of the many complex problems which it involves .

		It is certainly based upon a very unusual per - sonal knowledge , including the results of many extended journeys over almost the entire extent of the enormous Russian territory , in which the author was at all times aided by the Russian officials in the acquirement of knowledge .

		As a result the work contains much matter of the first importance , and presents many views which are not commonly held .

		One reason , at least , why Mr.
Norman	PERSON	found so much charm in Russian society , using the word inclusively , may be found in such stories as the following : '' Russian life abounds in incidents which illustrate a personal sympathy between high and low existing in no other society .

		I read , for instance , that one day a miserably ragged man begged an alms at a railway station from a prosperous-looking passenger .

		At that moment a General -- and it must be remembered that in
Russia	LOCATION	a General is a very great personage -- with his pretty young wife came upon the platform . '

		THE DIAL .

		8S6 will kiss the
General	ORGANIZATION	's wife . '

		The beggar went straight to the lady , fell upon his knees , and told her of his plight .

		She listened , and then , getting her husband 's permission , held out her cheek for him to kiss .

		The
Novoe Vremja	PERSON	, which told the story , added truly that sach magnanimity could only occur in
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		There are of course , many elements besides that of magnanimity which are exotic in such a story , but it is pleasant to read nevertheless .

		This anecdote precedes a similar one in which the Czar is known to have complied with the aniversal custom at
Eastertide	ORGANIZATION	by saluting a common soldier on sentry duty who was the first to offer him the greeting of the day .

		It is with
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	and the two Mos - cows , old and new , that Mr.
Normans	PERSON	long narrative opens , and it does not close until a large part of the earth 's surface has been trav - ersed and practically all of it brought under discussion .

		Mr.
Norman	PERSON	went to see
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and assured him , to his hearer 's ex - pressed sorrow , that both socialism and the single-tax movement were not as active in
England	LOCATION	as formerly , and that so far as the latter is concerned ' • nothing was being done about it at all . ''

		This is a lapse , pardonable enough , in Mr.
Norman	PERSON	's wide acquaintance with public affairs .

		The truth is , rather , that practical socialism has assumed forms that have only recently been made the subject of inquiry , so threatening to public interests have they begun to appear ; while the underlying principles of the single-tax have made enormous strides toward practical realization , and are commanding more and more attention .

		This lapse apart , and an occasional failure to trans - literate Russian words uniformly , are , however , the only errors noticeable in the work , remark - able as it is in scope .

		In speaking of
Russia	LOCATION	's successful efforts to obliterate the autonomy of
Finland	LOCATION	, Mr. Nor - man , while admitting the unconstitutionality of this action , goes on to lay down the following argument in its defense : '' As a matter of plain fact , there is in human affaim of this kind no such thing as finality .

		Or rather , the only final thing is force majeure -- imperative national self-interest .

		Before that , all promises are air , and all treaties are black marks on white paper .

		I put this brutally -LRB- foreseeing the consequences -RRB- ; but there is no use in miueing words .

		Every student of history , politics , or diplomacy knows it to be the simple truth ; and every country , not
Russia	LOCATION	alone , affords examples in proof .

		Germany broke her promises to
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		France broke her promises about
Madagascar	LOCATION	.

		To eome nearer home ,
England	LOCATION	has repeatedly pledged herself to evacuate Egvpt , and the
United States	LOCATION	was solemnly pledged to grant complete indeptendence to
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		None of these pledges seems likely to be kept .

		... I do not defend the principle -- I state the fact .

		` Pity ' t is , ' t is true . ' ''

		While it is somewhat reassuring to have this question thus frankly put down as exemplify * ing '' the good old rule , the simple plan , '' rather than to call it , as some Americans have , '' the higher morality , '' it is far from reassur - ing t-o feel that Mr.
Norman	PERSON	can find any pal - liation whatever for an international crime by pleading other international crimes , or that nations are free to act at all times without ref - erence to higher ideals or the dictates of a common conscience .

		So brutal a policy is bound to react disastrously upon the subjects or citizens of the state practising it , as
Ameri	LOCATION	- cans are learning to their sorrow , and as
Great Britain	LOCATION	has just learned in a baptism of blood and tears .

		If history were less insistent in teaching the higher lesson that '' At whites , or short or long .

		May be diaoemed a wrong Dying as of self-slanghter , '' the lesson that greed , whether individual or national , carries its own punishment , and that the way which we find him here defending on '' practical '' grounds has been uniformly a way leading down into the dark , -- the author 's words would sound less specious and less vicious .

		The story of the march of Musoovy across the continent of
Asia	LOCATION	, familiar as it is , by this time , to English readers , gains new force when described by one who has seen its effects face to face .

		The story of the Russification of the
Caucasus	LOCATION	, of the principalities of central
Asia	LOCATION	, through the Trans - Caspian railway and its prolongation to the gates of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, and of the gain in civilization as a consequence , reads like a dream .

		This , to one who remem - bers the tales of travellers not yet yellowed by time , is an example : '' The train slackens speed on the second erening , draws up to a long platform full of brilliant nniforms whose wearers are escorting elegant ladies , while a band strikes up a gay tune , and your window stops ex - actly opposite the word '
Merv	PERSON	' over the central door - way .

		You can not quite believe it .

		But it is a fact .

		The whole oasis of
Merv	PERSON	, one of the most fertile spots in the world , is as Russian as
Riga	LOCATION	; and when yon sar '
Merv	PERSON	' in central
Asia	LOCATION	you mean a long , low , neat , stone railway station , lit by a score of bright lamps in a row , where the train changes engines , while in a busy tele - graph office a dozen operators sit before their clicking instruments . ''

		It is from this neighborhood , so we are in - formed , that
Russia	LOCATION	is obtaining a supply of cotton for her rapidly increasing spindles which are destined at no long interval to make her 236 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, manufacturers independent of the American product .

		The causes and effects of history are seldom more strikingly set forth than in a subsequent passage dealing with this same question as follows : '' The water-basin of this part of Trans-Caspia is in
Persia	LOCATION	, and the
Amir of Afghanistan	ORGANIZATION	controls , in the
River Murghab	LOCATION	, the water supply of the great Merv oasis and other districts .

		Therefore if these possessions of
Russia	LOCATION	are ever to regain their ancient wealth , when
Merv	PERSON	, for instance , was really ` Queen of the World , '
Russia	LOCATION	must rule in
Persia	LOCATION	and
Afghanistan	LOCATION	.

		North - ern
Persia	LOCATION	the province of
Khorassan	LOCATION	-- is probably at her mercy , to seize whenever an opportunity or an excuse presents itself , but
Afghanistan	LOCATION	is quite another matter , for the British fleet blocks the way thither .

		Thus the cotton crop of central
Asia	LOCATION	, and purchases for
Russia	LOCATION	on the markets of
Richmond	LOCATION	and New Or - leans , for it is
Russia	LOCATION	's desire to grow all her own cotton and buy none abroad , -- depend at last upon the number of ironclads that fly the cross of St.
George	PERSON	in the Channel and
Mediterranean	LOCATION	. ''

		There are several chapters of summing up , after the descriptions of the almost intermin - able journeys which have fallen to Mr. Nor - man 's lot ; a strongly written appreciation of
M. de Witte	PERSON	, the Russian minister of finance ; and the statement that there is everything to be gained and little to be lost by amity be - tween
Russia	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		The effect of the Sultan 's grant to Germans for building a railway to
Baghdad	LOCATION	is described as marking a new step in the political history of the world , and one almost ruinous to Russian aspirations in that direction .

		There is a word of wisdom about the relations of
Russia	LOCATION	and our own country which is worth remembering , -- though there will be little agreement among well - informed Americans that the instructions to the Russian fleet in
New York	LOCATION	harbor during the darkest days of the Civil War were '' apo - cryphal . ''

		But the rest , strangely though it sounds , is almost self-evident : '' There has been for long in the
United States	LOCATION	a belief that
Russia	LOCATION	is a genuine , sympathetic friend , moved by admiration for the American people and their institutions .

		This has grown up chiefly , 1 suppose , from the apocryphal narratives of the readiness of
Russia	LOCATION	to intervene on the side of right during the war of the Rebellion .

		Therefore the American people have fre - quently made public profession of their friendship for
Russia	LOCATION	, which
Russia	LOCATION	, needless to say , has cordially ac - cepted ; for who would refuse such a gift ?

		But the whole belief is a political soap-bubble .

		It is nothing but a bright film in the ether .


Russia	LOCATION	likes to appear a friend of the
United States	LOCATION	, because the effect of that is to postpone any cooperation of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	in world affairs , -- a contingency which
Russia	LOCATION	is not the only power to fear .

		But beyond this , she seldom thinks of the
United States	LOCATION	, except to admire and envy its vast prosperity ; among the official and reactionary class , to regard its institutions with profound disap - proval ; to anticipate the time when enough cotton will be grown in
Turkestan	LOCATION	to make it safe for her to put a prohibitive tax upon every American bale ; or to wish that the American billionaires would invest a few spare millions in government guaranteed 4 per cent , bonds of Russian railways ... Beyond these things ,
America	LOCATION	does not exist for
Russia	LOCATION	, except when a troublesome Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	puts a series of direct questions about
Manchuria	LOCATION	or the Open Door , and insists upon answers in writing .

		In fact ,
Russia	LOCATION	, with no ill-will at all , thinks about
America	LOCATION	precisely what a great religious autoc - racy must think about a huge secular democracy four thousand miles away .

		The rest is mere flag-wagging . ''

		There are scores of other interesting ques - tions raised in this comprehensive work which abundantly deserve reading in their context .

		Certainly the thoroughness with which the subject has been studied , and the illuminating character of the work , justify the delay in its appearance .

		The numerous maps and pictures , it is well to add , have been specially produced for their use here , and give the book much ad - ditional value .

		THE DIAL 23T ; altitude adjacent to the great thoroughfares cutting through the
Continental Divide	ORGANIZATION	in Col - orado .

		Afoot and alone , or with a companion having tastes like his own , he clambered up and down the towering masses of
Pike	ORGANIZATION	's Peak and Gray 's Peak , not to mention inferior em - inences which he trod with slow step and pier - cing vision , that no secret of the `` winged rarities '' might escape him .

		The history of these adventures and discoveries is related in vivid style and with gratifying fulness of detail .

		Mr.
Keyser	PERSON	's investigations began at Man - iton , where he found many of our common birds in abundance , and foremost among them the robin , which was preaching its gospel of cheer with unabated devotion .

		The first real stranger encountered was the western wood - pewee .

		Instead of the sweet arc of sound the eastern pewee describes , this bird of the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	emits a shrill scream that is more like a cry of anguish than a happy love-song .

		Where the species are superabundant , the author describes their morning concerts as positively distressing .

		In place of our gay
Baltimore	LOCATION	oriole ,
Bullock	PERSON	's oriole -LRB- an equally brilliant bird and a better singer -RRB- was plenti - ful .

		Our lovely rose-breasted grosbeak was replaced by the black-headed grosbeak ; our familiar tanager , in flaming scarlet , gave way to the
Louisiana	LOCATION	tanager , bedight in yellow plumes ; while our towhee bunting was repre - sented by the green-tailed bunting and wholly surpassed by him in power of vocalization .

		The song of the latter species , Mr.
Keyser	PERSON	t ^ lls OS , '' is wild and free , has the swing of all out - doors , and is not pitched to a minor key . ''

		At every turn he met some new bird which to see and hear excited fresh interest and delight .

		The upper part of the ascent of
Pike	PERSON	's Peak , dragging hours on into the
night	TIME	, had been to our author a painful , almost a tragical , expe - rience : yet a day spent with the rosy finches and the pipits , birds that range over the bald plateau that crowns the tremendous height , restored the vigor of the traveller , and he set out on the return tramp in a state of high ex - hilaration . ''

		As I began the desceDt , I whistled and sang , -- that is , I tried to .

		To be frauk , it was all noise and no music ; but I must have some way of giving expression to the uplifted emotions that filled my breast .

		Again and again I said to myself , ' I 'm so glad !

		I 'm so glad !

		I 'm so glad ! '

		It was gladness pure and simple , -- the dictionary has no other word to express it . ''

		The explorer was treated to other rare en - tertainments in his stealthy study of the birds .

		More than one graphic description of the aerial evolutions of different species tempts the re - viewer to stay for a quotation . ''

		The pipit , the horned lark , and

		sifting down out of the blue I canopy .

		How long be remained aloft in bis watcb - ' tower in the skies , I do not know ; for one can not well count minutes in such exciting circumstances ; but it ■ seemed a long time .

		By and by the call appeared to be coming nearer , and the little aeronaut swept down with a swiftness that made my blood tingle , and alighted on a rock as lightly as a snowflake . ''

		A favorite pastime with the broad-tailed hnmming-bird is to ''
Dart	PERSON	np in the air , and then down , almost striking a bush or a clump of grass at each descent , repeating this feat a number of times with a swiftness that the eye can scarcely follow .

		Having done this , be will swing up into the air so far that you can scarcely see him with the naked eye ; the next moment he will drop into view , poise in mid-air seventy-five or a hundred feet above your head , supporting himself by a swift motion of the wings , and simply hitching to right and left in short arcs , as if he were fixed on a pivot , some - times meanwhile whirling clear around .

		There he hangs on his invisible axis until you grow tired watching him , and then he darts to his favorite perch on a dead tree . ''

		Mr.
Keyser	PERSON	was fortunate in finding the nests of most of the species that came under his observation , but in every instance the sanctity of the little home was held inviolate .

Napoleon	PERSON	and the Peace of
Amiens	LOCATION	. ''

		No other incident in the career of
Napoleon	PERSON	has caused greater controversy than the sud - den rupture of the Treaty of
Amiens	LOCATION	, and the renewal of war between
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	after a brief and troubled experience of peace .

		It has been hitherto the generally accepted belief of English historians that the rupture of the Peace of
Amiens	LOCATION	was not a disappointment , but rather a satisfaction , to
Napoleon	LOCATION	; indeed , that the renewal of war was but the culmina - tion of a plan conceived , and in part matured , by the great commander himself .

		In regard to this important point , as to many others , it becomes necessary to reverse previous opinions in the new light brought to bear upon the events of that time by Mr.
J. H. Eose	PERSON	, in his recent scholarly life of Napoleon .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's work , the result of many years ' study among the records of the
British Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, presents and proves so many new facts , that theories of events and even periods in
Napoleon	LOCATION	's life must be wholly reconstructed .

		In the chapters on '' The Peace of
Amiens	LOCATION	'' and '' The Renewal of War , '' Mr.
Rose	PERSON	gives in detail an account of diplomatic events , some of them new , and offers a logical explanation of the causes resulting in the termination of peace .

		Thus it is shown by exact citations that
Cornwallis	PERSON	, the English negotiator , actually did concede more than the English government was prepared to yield , and did violate his instruc - tions , -- instructions which reached him be - fore , not after , the signing of the treaty , the usual statement to the contrary notwithstand - ing .

		Until now there has been no positive ver - ification of this fact , and it has rested solely upon a verbal statement by
Napoleon	PERSON	, made long after the occurrence itself .

		These ex - treme concessions were taken in
France	LOCATION	to indicate a suspicious generosity on the part of the British government , as Mr.
Rose	PERSON	shows by a quotation from a report by a semi-official secret agent in
Paris	LOCATION	, who wrote : '' I canuot get it into my head that the British min - istry has acted in good faith in subscribing to the pre - liminaries of peace , which , considering the respective positions of the parties , would be harmful to the En - glish people ... People are persuaded in
France	LOCATION	that the moderation of
England	LOCATION	is only a snare put in

		government , the author emphatically denies ; yet the first impression in
France	LOCATION	, that En - gland had yielded everything merely to gain a breathing spell in which to prepare for a re - newal of the struggle , inevitably rendered less secure the permanence of peace itself , for pop - ular distrust created an exaggerated tenderness for national honor , which was bound to react upon the French government .

		Napoleon him - self believed
England	LOCATION	to be honest , and power - less ; and thus believing , rapidly pushed his agressions upon the continent , drafted vast schemes of colonial expansion , and in diplo - matic notes to
Russia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	suggested a partition of the Turkish Empire , this last being but a step in the furtherance of his plans for a control of the land route to
India	LOCATION	.

		Hence , says Mr.
Rose	PERSON	, came
England	LOCATION	's determination to keep
Malta	LOCATION	, or to secure some equivalent sta - tion in the
Mediterannean	LOCATION	, which , it is sur - prising to learn , was Jlrst urged by
Russia	LOCATION	, whose government was alarmed at
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's plans of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	dominion .

		Indeed , the author cites the exact despatch in the foreign office showing that the retention of
Malta	LOCATION	had pre - viously been urged by the Russian government .

		A little later , it is true .

		Napoleon , by a clever and flattering appeal to
Alexander	PERSON	for friendly intervention , secured a Russian demand that
England	LOCATION	evacuate
Malta	LOCATION	.

		Napoleon , however , not being aware of the earlier Russian sug - gestion , and believing
England	LOCATION	friendless , and her administration weak , publicly committed himself by threats and inspired articles in the '' Moniteur '' to an insistence upon
England	LOCATION	's withdrawal from
Malta	LOCATION	.

		In this he went too far , for in reality he did not desire to renew war at the moment .

		But public sentiment in
France	LOCATION	, the popular tenderness for national honor , suspicious from the first of English sin - cerity , forced him to maintain the stand he had taken .

		Thus the all-powerful ruler of
France	LOCATION	was trapped , or rather trapped himself , into a war for which he was not prepared .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	supports this thesis with much documentary and diplomatic evidence , concluding `` I can - not agree ... that
Napoleon	PERSON	wanted war .

		I think he did not , until his navy was ready . ''

		From the historian 's point of view , it is in such incidents as the one just cited that Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's '' Life of Napoleon '' is chiefly valuable .

		He has added much to our knowledge of En - glish diplomatic action for the period , and incidentally has thereby suggested many rea - sonable hypotheses for hitherto clouded causes of action in
Napoleon	LOCATION	's career .

		But it would

		THE DIAL 289 be QDJast to the aathor to specify these merits alone .

		His work is naturally much couceraed with
Don	PERSON	- English sources , and in these he ex - hibits an unusual degree of scholarly care in selection .

		Moreover he has produced a dis - tinctly readable life , sane , yet full of admira - tion for the genius of his hero , scientific , yet entertaining .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's book is conspicuously given over to the examination of
Napoleon	PERSON	's public career , not lacking in analysis of his strong personality , but excluding much traditional gossip .

		While , however , the reader is spared many of the realistic , and sometimes unpleasant , details of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's private life and habits , he is shown the best , indeed the truest , side of his charac - ter .

		Yet the narrative does not suffer , the interest is maintained , and the book is brought to a conclusion without any resort to melo - dramatic effects to hold attention .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's
Bonaparte	PERSON	is one who '' Id bis temperament as in the circumstances of his time was destined for an extraordinary career ; a man who dared much , achieved much , and in bis fall still held the love of many peoples , yet whose fall was not due to the treachery of - politicians , or the failings of the French , but to his own character and the character of the age in which he lived . ''

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	has given us quite the best short life of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	in English .

		I.IGHT8 AND SHAD0 `` WS OF THE CIVIL WAR .

		* Replete with vivid recollections of battles and campaigns , and redolent of camp and field and bivouac , a little book now comes to relate to us , after the lapse of forty years , a succes - sion of episodes of the Civil War , `` as seen from the ranks . ''

		The writer was a boy soldier and musician in the 150th
New York Volun	LOCATION	- teers .

		Enlisting in the
fall of 1862	DATE	, as one of '' three hundred thousand more , '' he served to the close of the war , traversing about one half the extent of the Confederacy .

		His duties as a musician in camp and on parade , and as a stretcher-bearer in the battle-field , allowed him a broad and free view of the striking features of such an extended range of experiences .

		Evidently he saw with keen and quick eyes , and the scenes and sounds which were , to an inexperienced boy , full of novelty , impressed themselves indelibly upon a lively imagination and a retentive memory .

		His book is worthy * As Skbk fbom the Rakks .

		of more than a passing notice , for it is far from being the ordinary collection of campaign rem - iniscences .

		Written in an easy and vivacious style , it is remarkable for the fidelity with which the strangeness , to the youthful partic - ipant , of the situations and episodes which were daily occurring , is here reproduced .

		One who encountered similar experiences during a like service in the army of the Republic , in reading these pages is transported back to the days of his own adolescence , and here renews the sensations which thrilled his young soul while in camp or on the march .

		Mr.
Benton	PERSON	is a good raconteur and a ready word-painter ; and , fortunately for his readers , it is not the trite incidents of the war-time which have chiefly attracted his attention .

		One gets here a vivid picture of the
General	ORGANIZATION	whose manner of holding his cigar in his mouth told his observant followers whether his anticipations were of a quiet and peaceful camp , or of a hot battle ; and of the southern buz - zard , whose lazy , circling flight over the camp led the Yankee boys to imagine that '' He 's counting us '' ; and one again hears distinctly the familiar voice of the mule , whose trumpet tones were understood to sing out , `` Jo-o - Hooh-BT , ffook-er , Hook-er ! ''

		Mr.
Benton	PERSON	's fidelity of recollection is valu - able historically .

		He remembers and quotes correctly General
Sherman	PERSON	's condensed opinion of the harshness of war , a remark which has been so many times quoted in a profane form that many persons of the present generation have come to believe that such were in fact the words of
Sherman	LOCATION	.

		But Mr.
Benton	PERSON	states his epigram in the very words which were attributed to Sherman at the time the saying was first made current in
1863	DATE	: * ` War is cruelty ; you can not refine it . ''

		A conspicuous illustration is given by our author of the readiness of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	soldier to meet every emergency and fill every demand in society , government , or administration .

		The entry of
Sherman	PERSON	's army into
Savannah	LOCATION	, though anticipated , came at last with such suddenness as to drive out the working force of the '' Sa - vannah Republican '' between two issues of the newspaper .

		The men of the occupying army stepped in , set type from copy prepared by their comrades , ran the presses , and on the day of their entry into the city sent forth and dis - tributed the daily paper without the loss of a single issue .

		Mr.
Benton	PERSON	disclaims the attempt to write history .

		But the history of the Civil War , 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	; which the future is to furnish us , will be drawn largely from such sources of original and authentic information as this book ; and the freshness and animation of his style of compo - sition might well be employed in writing an account of the operations of the entire war , so full and complete that his readers would gladly class it as history .


James O. Pierce	PERSON	.

		Beasts , Birds , and Fishes .

		* In his most charming foreword to '' The
Kin	PERSON	- dred of the Wild '' Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	traces the genesis of the animal story of to-day from the engrossing part which it played in the drama of primitive man through the stages of fable , tale of adventure , animal anecdote , the purpose story as in '' Black Beauty , '' up to the frankly humanized tales of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		Its farther evolution has freed it from the human element and carried it into the field of animal psychology .

		`` Our chief writers of animal stories at the present day may be regarded as explorers of this unknown world , absorbed iu charting its topography .

		They work , indeed , upon a substantial foundation of known facts .

		They are minutely scrupulous as to their natural history , and assiduous contributors to that science .

		But above all they are diligent in their search for the mo - tive beneath the action .

		Their care is to catch the varying , illusive personalities which dwell back of the luminous brain windows of the dog , the horse , the deer , or wrap themselves in reserve behind the inscrutable eyes of all the cats , or sit aloof in the gaze of the hawk and the eagle .

		The animal story at its highest point of development is a psychological romance con - structed on a framework of natural science . ''

		Naturalists have no quarrel with the romances of animal psychology .

		They enjoy the stories as much , if not more , than do other folk .

		When , however , the romancers claim to be explorers in animal psychology and assiduous contributors to natural history the startled scientist scans in vain the unpaid pages of the chronicles of research in • The Kindred of the Wild .

		these fields for some revelation of their discoveries .

		The credulous public as well as the naturalist will have difficulty in separating the fabric of romance from the framework of facts in any contribution prepared to meet the demands and rewards of the popular animal story .

		Just as the historical play or novel rests on some knowledge of the times and places in which the drama or romance was enacted , so the animal story requires a background of facts drawn from science for its setting .

		The success of all three types of literature depends much less on their faith - ful portrayal of historical or scientific fact than on their form and action .

		The play and the novel are not history , nor is the animal story primarily ani - mal psychology .

		It is not the psychology of it but the simple romance or tragedy of it which makes it interesting to most readers .

		It would be unjust to Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	to impute to his tales any breath of suspicion that he has dis - torted the facts of science .

		Of all recent stories his carry to the skeptical the most conviction of scru - pulous faithfulness in detail of fact .

		It would be equally unfair to him not to recognize that his great success lies primarily not in this phase of the work , but in the technique of its presentation and in the tragedy or comedy which runs through his simple narrative .

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	should not throw dust in the eyes of his readers .

		The most of the stories combined in this volume have appeared in periodical literature prior to their collection here .

		They will bear rereading many times .

		In purity and delicacy of diction , in whole - someness and absence of the shadows of coarseness or brutality which have crept into some animal stories , and in lightness and freedom of action , Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	's animal stories are unsurpassed .

		A comprehensive and popular account of the food and game fishes of
America	LOCATION	within a compass permitting a moderate price has long been needed .

		The man who fishes , whether for sport or for the pan , and he whose piscatorial interests have only the gastronomic motive , will find in '' American Food and Game Fishes '' an authoritative and very com - plete treatise by whose use the proper designation , scientific or vernacular , may be found of all the American fish used as food or lured by the angler .

		President
Jordan	PERSON	, of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, and Dr.
B. W. Evermann	PERSON	, ichthyologist of the
United States Fish Commission	ORGANIZATION	, have condensed from their more extensive and more technical '' Fishes of Middle and
North America	LOCATION	, '' recently brought out by the
Smithsonian Institution	ORGANIZATION	, this popular work .

		The attractive colored plates contained in the volume have been reproduced by lithography .

		They are well supplemented by numerous photographs from life by Mr.
A. R. Dugmore	PERSON	, some of which excel the best productions of the artist in delineating the characteristic pose of the fish at rest or in action .

		The book contains brief scientific diagnoses of all the important fish , with keys for their determination

		Readers apon the
Pacific	LOCATION	- coast will feel that Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	has exercised andae restraint in giving bat brief descriptions of the famoQB leaping tuna of
Santa Catalina	LOCATION	and of the huge jewfish of sontbern waters , and in leaving to the nbiqaitoas railway advertisement all illostration of these interesting monsters of the deep .

		It is fitting that the initial volame of the '' Amer - ican Sportsman 's Library , '' edited by Mr.
Caspar Whitney	PERSON	, should deal with `` The Deer Family , '' that it should have as its anthors a group of men famous in the annals of sport in our forests , plains , and mountains , and that it should be dedicated to the ' ■ lover of the wild , free , lonely life of the wil - derness , and of the hardy pastimes known to the sojourners therein . '' ''

		Tbe chase of all these noble and beautiful mnimalf has ever possessed a pecaliar fascination for bold and hardy men , skilled in the use of arms and the manage - ment of the horse , and wcmted to feats of strength and endoranee . ''

		The first half of the volume , -- by Mr.
Theodore Rooserelt	PERSON	, -- deals with the mule-deer , the whitetail ^
Virginia	LOCATION	deer , the pronghorn antelope , and the wapiti .

		Their habits , present and past geographical distribution , and relative merits as objects of the chase , are fnlly set forth , and the methods parsned in tbeir quest are illustrated with many a personal anecdote of the hunt in the Bad Lands of the
Little Missouri	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
T. S. Van	PERSON	T > \ ke writes of the deer and elk of tbe
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , Mr.
D. G. Elliott	PERSON	of the cariboo of the far north , and Mr.
A. J. Stone	PERSON	contributes a well-worded discussion of the moose -- the most cunning of all the large animals of
North America	LOCATION	and the first prize of tbe American big-game hunter .

		The book is written primarily for the hunter , but the field naturalist and every lover of nature will priz.e the insight into the lives of the deer and his kin which may be gained here .

		The introduction , written by the first-named anthor , contains a stirring plea for the preservation of our forests and of the wild things that dwell therein for the benefit and enjoyment of tbe public , and for wise legislation toward that end and its strict enforcement .

		He trenchantly condemns the game batcher . ''

		Such a man is wholly obnoxioos ; and , indeed , so is any man who shoots for the purpose of establishing a record of the amooot of game killed .

		If he is worthy of tbe name of trae sportsman he will feel infinitely more satisfaction in a single saceessful shot which comes to crown the triumph of his hardihood and address in exploriog the wilds , and in the actual stalk , than be would in any amoant of shooting at creatures driven past him from artificially stocked covers .

		The best test of the worth of any sport is the demand that sport makes upon those qualities of mind and body which in their snm we call manliness . ''

		The author defends vigorously the solid advan - tages of big-game hunting from the standpoint of national character .

		It is an antidote to that soft - ening of fibre incident to the highly complex in - dustrialism of our life and the character of many of its enjoyments .

		Furthermore , the big-game banter -- humane , keen-eyed , strong-limbed , and stout - hearted -- should also be a field naturalist , an adept with the camera .

		This quest '' will tax his skill far more than hunting with the rifle , while the reealts in the long ran will give maeh g ^ reater saUs - faction . ''

		A somewhat different tone pervades tlie volame on '' Upland Game Birds '' by Mr.
Edwyn Sandys	PERSON	, in the same series .

		Here the point of view is that of tbe professional sportsman to whom the shooting of birds is a vocation rather than an avocation .

		The full bag is the criterion of sueeeaa , though the ethics of tbe sport seem to be sadly warped at times .

		Usefal wrinkles for eireamventing the sel - fish farmer and getting the advantage of your in - experienced comrade find a place in the work . ''

		Some men love to show their superior knowl - edge , and yoor comrade may nibble at yoor bait , and promptly illustrate the proper method of getting a bird oat of brush -- which is by jumping on the pile .

		He gets the bird out of the brnsh , but yon get the shot nine times out of ten . ''

		To the credit of the author he also states the other side of the question .

		■ ' Needless to say , by far the better way , in fact the only sportsmanlike way , is to insist upon a fair and sqoaie ifcaring of all hard work , rough beau , aod choice pontions ... Sharp practice is a deadly foe to sport ; yet it is astonishing how far some men will go in tbeir eagerness to make the heaviest bag . ''

		The author laughs at the sentimentalism of the good ladies who object to dove shooting , and sug - gests that it is easily overcome by a mess of doves or some columbine millinery .

		He underestimates the motives which have inspired the movement to preserve our beautiful mourning dove from the fate of the wild pigeon .

		The book deals with tbe part - ridge and grouse families , the ptarmigan and tur - keys , woodcock , plover , cranes , and the dove .

		Mr.
T. S. Van Dyke	PERSON	writes of the quail and grouse of the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		The book is well written in a breezy , easy-going style , with little formality in language or arrangement .

		It is interesting reading , but it leaves one with a better opinion of
Bob White	PERSON	than of some of his persecutors .

		It is a wholly different kind of sport that Mr.
Job	PERSON	pursues in his '' Among the Water Fowl . ''

		His hunting is with the camera and his bag a holder full of well-earned plates .

		His quest re - quires even more patience , skill , and risk than that of the more sanguinary banter , while his success brings pleasure to many others than himself .

		The 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, book reconnts his experiences and portrays ex - amples of his success in photographing water fowl in their native haunts , in flight and afloat and upon their nests .

		His field is a new one and his work unique .

		His experiences for many years among the lakes and marshes of western prairies and the almost inaccessible rocky islets of our northeastern shores form a tale of adventure quite as interesting as that which any wielder of a
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	might relate .

		The book is not a manual of aquatic birds , but presupposes some knowledge of grebes and terns , cormorants and petrels , and other winged folk .

		It combines the elements of a narrative of adventure and a contribution to natural history .

		Lovers of birds will bid the new sport Godspeed , and welcome this form of sportsman to their ranks .

		In the imposing portfolio of `` Nature Portraits '' Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have brought to - gether many of the choicest illustrations which have appeared in their well-known '' Nature Series '' and in other publications bearing their imprint .

		The text , obviously but a thread on which to hang the pictures , consists of five brief essays on pertinent aspects of nature-study , from the pen of Mr.
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	, editor of '' Country Life in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		In addition to a large number of half-tone engravings sprinkled throughout the text , there are fifteen detached plates especially adapted for framing .

		Several of these are direct photographic contact prints , and others are reproduced in photogravure and colors , forming together a series of great at - tractiveness and interest .

		The photogravure front - ispiece , from a photograph of deer taken by Mr.

		pathies by his innate refinement of character and the clean manliness of his living .

		He represents an ideal that was probably never realized , yet the separate touches by which he is drawn for us bear the visible stamp of truth .

		His story is a series of episodes that may be enjoyed independently of one another , although they are held in a sort of unity by his relations with the
New England	LOCATION	girl who comes to
Wyoming	LOCATION	to teach school , and who promptly develops into as satisfactory a heroine as one could wish for .

		She gives him books to read , and his frank comments upon them are both hu - morous and refreshing .

		There are other humorous features , notably that which describes the mixing up of a dozen babies by changing their clothes -- a prank not quite in keeping with the Virginian 's character , but nevertheless irresistibly amusing .

		In the course of his career he finds himself a member of a lynching party , and the author makes the usual sophistical defense of this wild form of justice . ''

		The Virginian '' is a man 's book , with not one touch of sickly sentiment , and must be regarded as a valuable human document because of the author 's intimate acquaintance with the scenes and types which it portrays .

		It is to the outskirts of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's country that we are taken by Mr.
Frank Lewis Nason	PERSON	, in a novel called '' To the End of the Trail . ''

		We mean this not so much in the geographical as in the romantic sense , for the scene is
Colorado	LOCATION	and not
California	LOCATION	, but the situations and the characters are of the kind with which
Harte	PERSON	has made us fa - miliar .

		Tough Nut , in particular , is a hero of the mining-camp who is worthy of a place in
Harte	PERSON	's gallery , and the
Big Swede	ORGANIZATION	is represented with just the combination of womanly attractiveness and cal - culating wickedness that
Harte	PERSON	would have delighted in portraying .

		The whole effect of the story is un - real and theatrical , but in this very artificiality is its fascination , a fact which again reminds us of the master whom Mr.
Nason	PERSON	has studied to such good purpose .

		Mr.
George McCutcheon	PERSON	, encouraged by his last year 's success with ''
Graustark	PERSON	, '' has produced a second novel and called it '' Castle Craneycrow . ''

		It is noticeably better than its predecessor , although it can hardly be described as a literary composition .

		24S in the nature of style and probability and the de - picting of possible human beings , and devotes him - self solely to the making of a plot and thederiging of a breathless succession of striking incidents .

		He has enough invention to make up , in part , for his lack of everything else in the novelist 's equipment , and we should not be surprised to find '' Castle Craneycrow '' among the most widely read of the season 's books .

		The stratum of readers which such a book attracts is immensely populous , although its praise is not exactly of the sort for which a serious novelist would care .

		Still another story of the Civil War with a Vir - ginian setting and Virginian types of character is given us in '' The Claybornes , '' by Mr.
William Sage	PERSON	.

		Here the special theme is of brother against brother , and we follow the fortunes of the two men as they fight upon their respective sides in the great internecine struggle .

		The operations around
Vicks	LOCATION	- bnrg and the final scenes at R'chmond and
Appo	PERSON	- mattox are the historical episodes upon which our attention is chiefly focussed .

		The story is a good example of careful but uninspired workmanship , essentially right in the placing of its sympathies , and having enough of sentimental interest to hold the att `` ntion of romantically-inclined readers .

		Dr.
James Ball Navlor	PERSON	is not exactly inspired by the genius of romantic fiction , but he contrives to tell a fairly readable story of the conventional sort . ''

		In the
Days of St. Clair	ORGANIZATION	, '' a story of the early settlers in the
Ohio Valley	LOCATION	, is carefully studied from the sources , and presents a moving picture of pioneer hardships and desperate Indian encounters .

		It has a noticeable melodramatic cast , and the vil - lain has all the familiar attributes of his type , whether displayed on or off the stage .

		The element of humor is supplied by a negro servant , but the writer would have been better advised had he re - sisted the temptation to be humorous . ''

		The Maidat-Arms . ''

		by Mr.
Robert W. Cham	PERSON	- bers , may almost be described as ' ■ Cardigan '' over again .

		The hero this time is a Southerner , the time is a year or two later , and Sir
William Johnson	PERSON	is dead , but otherwise the story is almost a replica of parts of the earlier one .

		Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	has shown good judgment in his choice of a model , for '' Car - digan '' is the strongest of his novels , but an author is hardly justified in repeating himself so closely .

		The story is admirable , romantic in feeling and in - cident , exciting in its complications , and satisfactory in its outcome .

		Mr.
Richard Bagot	PERSON	, in '' The Just and the Un - just , '' has turned from the field of Catholic contro - versy in fiction to the portrayal of secular English society .

		His novel contrasts two familiar types of women , the one who .

		while preserving the out - ward conventionalities , is morally corrupt to the core , and the one who remains essentially gen - erous and high-minded in spite of a deliberate lapse from virtuous living .

		The comparison is all in favor of the latter woman , and the author has done his best to enlist our sympathies and our admiration in her behalf .

		The situation thus described is no doubt possible , but it is certainly the exceptional case , and we can not help feeling that such a portrayal illus - trates the most insidious form of immorality in fic - tion .

		It is a favorite device of novelists to present this problem in this way , but it represents a reaction that has been carried too far .

		This particular novel is of the well-bred sort , written in the best of taste as far as the details are concerned , but clearly open to criticism on account of its main idea .

		Although for the most part a well-written book , there are now and then grammatical lapses of an astonishing sort , blunders that are obvioosly the result of an occa - sional moment of eareleasneas rather than of defec - tive educational equipment .

		A more hapless piece of fiction than '' Luck o ' Lassendale '' it is not often the lot of the reviewer to encounter .

		It is the work of the
Earl of Iddes	ORGANIZATION	- leigh , but even the name of a '' noble lord '' can not save so inane and dreary a story from speedy ob - livion .

		Those who read it will silently wonder how such a performance ever found its way into print , and proceed to forget all about it as quickly as pos - sible .

		How Sir
Francis Lassendale	PERSON	, wishing to en - large the fortune left him by his father 's death , plunged into stock speculation , became a company promoter , and speedily made ducks and drakes of all his property , is the story , if such it may be called , of this volume .

		There is throughout the book neither a character nor a scene that betokens the author 's possession of the novelist 's talent in its most rudimentary form . ''

		The Vultures '' is the latest , and in some re - spects the most successful , of Mr.
Henry Seton	PERSON	Mer - riman ' g novels .

		He seems to have carried about to its extreme limit his peculiar method of terse narrative , which strips away all surplusage , and requires the reader at every step to make his im - agination react upon the material offered , in order to supply what a less skilful novelist would write out at length .

		This method certainly compels strict attention to the business at hand , and when com - bined , as in the present instance , with a plot of remarkably ingenious construction , it produces the best sort of story of the merely entertaining sort .

		The scene is mainly in
Warsaw	LOCATION	, and the story has to do with the plotting of the irreconcilable Polish contingent It leads eventually , although in indi - rect fashion , to the historical assassination of the Ciar Liberator .

		It derives its title from the groups of diplomats who figure among the chief charac - ters , and who , scenting the coming disturbances , are brought together in
Warsaw	LOCATION	at the critical time .

		One of them , the attacM of the English Foreign OflBce , is the hero of the novel , and his love for the beautiful Polish Countess , the daughter of the arch-conspirator , affords the chief romantic interest of the book .

		Mr.
Merriman	PERSON	has the excellent habit of studying upon the spot the scenes of his novels , which enables him to do the descriptive parts with close truthfulness . ''

		The Way of a Man , '' by Mr.
Morley Robert *	PERSON	, 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, is a novel that turns out to be about the way of a woman for the naost part .

		She is the sort of woman whom most men would describe as typ - ically feminine in her conduct , while most women , bearing this ascription , would indignantly repudiate it on behalf of their sex .

		She is a very lively young English girl who yearns for experiences and gets them .

		She also yearns for a lover who can do things , and she gets him too , -- in the person of the revolu - tionary president of a two-penny Spanish - American republic .

		Meanwhile , the poor stockbroker 's clerk , whom she has fired with unholy ambitions , and dis - patched to
Central America	LOCATION	to perform deeds of daring for her sake , learns that his best achieve - ments make but a poor showing in contrast with those of a political brigand to the manner born .

		The story is of the liveliest interest , and the heroine is as charming as she is impulsive and irrational .

		Mr.
Alexander Glovatski	PERSON	, the Polish novelist whom Mr.
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	now introduces to the American public with a translation of '' The Pharaoh and the Priest , '' is already a veteran man of letters in his own country .

		His works of fiction occupy no less than seventeen volumes , most of which are devoted to modern Polish life , its char - acters , situations , and questions .

		The novel now translated offers the sole exception to this state - ment , being a historical study of the
Egypt	LOCATION	of three thousand years ago , under the rule of
Rameses XII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and XIII .

		We presume that Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	had good reasons for making this selection , but it is not usual to introduce a new author by means of the least typical of his works .

		Just how many of Mr.
Glo	PERSON	- vatski 's seventeen volumes are required to contain the present study we are not informed .

		The trans - lation is given us in a single thick volume of about seven hundred pages , and must comprise consider - ably more than three hundred thousand words .

		It is swollen to this colossal bulk by many repetitions , vast and arid tracts of erudition , passages from the Egyptian ritual , and whatever other matter the author was able to press into the service .

		It is well - nigh unreadable in other than a cursory fashion , yet it undoubtedly presents a vivid picture of a critical period in Egyptian history .

		The period is that of the decay of the empire under the last of the kings named Rameses , and the establishment of the new line of rulers with the accession of the priest Herhor .

		The main theme of the whole work is the desperate struggle of Rameses XIII .

		to over - come the encroachments of the priesthood , replenish the exhausted treasury , and restore the glories of the line of rulers of which he is the last representa - tive .

		How he fails through impulsiveness and lack of the subtlety needed to cope successfully with the devices of priestcraft , falling at length under the dagger of an assassin , is what this work brings us at its climax .

		It is a chaotic production , yet it has undeniable power in places , and exhibits undeniable learning throughout .

		It seems to us to accomplish more successfully than the novels of Ebers the diffi - cult task of presenting , not merely Egyptian scenes , customs , and historical episodes , but also Egyptian modes of thinking .

		We should say that this was its chief claim upon our consideration .

		Reports from
Continental	ORGANIZATION
Europe	LOCATION	have for some time past made much account of a great historical trilogy by the Russian writer Professor
Dimitri Merejkowski	PERSON	.

		The general theme of this work , as suggested by the title '' Christ and Antichrist , '' is the fundamental antagonism between the Pagan and Christian ideals , and the three several sections of the work focus our attention , respectively , upon the three figures of Julian the Apostate ,
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	, and
Peter	PERSON	the Great .

		The entire series has found an English translator in Mr.
Herbert Trench	PERSON	, and two of the three volumes have already been offered to the English-reading public .

		When the first volume , '' The Death of the Gods , '' came to our attention last year , we found it disappointing .

		It made a great display of erudition , and the char - acter of the emperor was finely conceived ; but the sum total of the effect was confusing , and the author seemed incapable of infusing with life the dry bones of his scholarship .

		The second volume of the series is now at hand , and is here styled '' The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci the Forerunner , '' although '' The Resurrection of the Gods '' is the author 's own chosen title .

		We have now no reason to with - hold the praise that we were ready to bestow , but could not , upon the earlier volume .

		Here , at least , is a work planned upon a generous scale , displaying vital power as well as scholarship , and deserving of an enthusiastic welcome .

		It is a work that com - pletely dwarfs the ordinary historical romance by the richness of its contents and the depth of its lit - erary and artistic sympathies .

		Essentially the book is a spiritualized biography of Leonardo during the last twenty-five years of his life .

		Whether it be the real Leonardo that the author has drawn for us no man may say .

		What may safely be said is that no previous portrait has been made that so impresses the reader with the stamp of truthfulness , or that so successfully creates the illusion that he is indeed in the presence of the great artist , the great thinker , and the great explorer of the mysteries of nature .

		The records of
Leonardo	LOCATION	's life , and the voluminous manuscripts that he left for posterity to decipher and set in order , have been minutely and lovingly explored by the author , and every characteristic touch or fragment that would seem to illuminate his complex personality has been deftly worked into the narrative .

		The result is a truly marvel - lous exposition of both the inner and the outer life of the man , an exposition that saddens us by the pathos of constantly thwarted effort , and uplifts as by the contemplation of a character that seems to have been absolutely free from the petty faults of ordinary humanity , absolutely noble in its motive and aspiration .

		More than this , the book is a sec - tion of the history of culture in one of the most pregnant epochs in the life of the human spirit .

		It embraces in its span -LRB- 1494-1519 -RRB- kings , popes , and tyrants ,

		THE DIAL .

		245 and
Raphael	PERSON	, the bonfire of vanities , the papal par - tition of the globe , and the French invasion of
Lonabardy	LOCATION	.

		The superstition of the age , its licen - tiousness in high places , the shame of its politics , and the glory of its art , all find places npon this richly-colored canvas .

		And all are brought into relations with the calm thinker -- dispassionate in the ordinary sense , yet the very incarnation of the passion of the intellect -- whose career gives unity to the historical picture , whose view of life is ever sub specie aetemitatis , and whose sublime specula - tions transcend the age that gives them birth .

		The Russian author has been most fortunate in his English translator .

		The work reads like an original production ; its style matches the elevation of its theme , and fits itself with peculiar flexibility to the varied interests and moods that the author 's treat - ment demands .

		We notice on the first page a slip in the use of the word `` corrosive '' where '' mordant '' is meant , and again , in the story of the papal parti - tion , the awards to
Spain	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	are given as the reverse of what they actually were .

		Briefs on Xew Books .

		A peep into topsyturvydom is offered ' ^ ^ j ^ ^ ^ us in Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	's latest volume of essayettes , '' The Defend - ant '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		But , curiously enough , it is this plain , prosaic old world of everyday life that is upside down ; we have been standing on our heads and never once suspecting it .

		The sixteen little chapters that demonstrate this are called ' * De - fences '' -- of nonsense , of ugly things , of slang , of useful -LSB- i.e. , useless -RSB- information , of penny-dreadfuls , of farce , of skeletons , of planets , and of other things which have hitherto been regarded as either need - ing no defense or unworthy of one .

		Amid much that is sane and suggestive , as well as piquant and delightful , these brief treatises contain other things that are merely odd and whimxical .

		Penny - dreadfuls are unduly lauded , and it is denied that their purple hues are productive of moral color - blindness in the juvenile reader .

		Slang is exalted to the level of poetry . ''

		All slang is metaphor , and all metaphor is poetry . ''

		But the cis -
Atlantic	LOCATION	reader will be pleased to find American slang held in high esteem .

		The
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	's remark , that after the Chinese War the Japanese had to use a shoe-horn in putting on their hats , is quoted as ■ ' a monument of the true nature of slang , which consists in get - ting further and further away from the original conception , in treating it more and more as an as - sumption .

		It is rather like the literary doctrine of the Symbolists . ''

		The closing chapter , `` A De - fence of Patriotism , '' is a witty assault on jingoism . ''

		My country , right or wrong , '' the author declares to be no less absurd and shocking than ' ■ My mother , drunk or sober . ''

		Again , '' Colonies are things to be proud of , but for a country to be only proud of its extremities is like a man being only proud of his legs . ''

		Mr.
Stanley Waterloo	PERSON	has edited ij ^ M ^ Mu '' The Story of a Strange Career , Being the Autobiography of a Crim - inal '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- ; and such disap -LSB- > ointment as the reader will unquestionably feel when he comes to the abrupt termination of the history , before the writer has turned criminal at all , is doubtless doe to the editor 's brief introduction and to the sub-title selected for the work .

		Thompson is the fictitious name assigned the antobiographer , and the editor has made few changes in his narrative beyond those needed to guard the personalities of the innocent .

		Going to sea with his father 's full consent when still a lad ,
Thompson	PERSON	was wrongfully arrested for mur - dering the captain of bis ship during his first voy - age .

		Being acquitted after a long stay in jail , he became a sailor of the irresponsible sort , working hard , enlisting in the British navy to escape an abominable merchant ship and deserting as soon as possible , marrying two women who proved to have husbands living and undivorced , and finally obtain - ing a commission in the navy of the
United States	LOCATION	at the outbreak of the war between the
States	LOCATION	, only to fall into Confederate hands and remain impris - oned until the war was nearly ended .

		There , two , the story ends , -- though Mr.
Waterloo	PERSON	assures his readers that the man 's life was henceforth passed in one or another of the
State	ORGANIZATION	penitentiaries .

		The book is as sincere as possible , and written with a sim - plicity and directness that deserve commendation ; but it would have been more interesting if something had been said of prison-life from the point of view of a man well-born and not uneducated .

		Under the tide `` The Theory of Pros - t/p ^ ^ ^ ' ^ ' perity '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Professor
Pat	PERSON	- ten , of the
University of Pennsyl	ORGANIZATION	- vania , has presented the familiar principles of Exsonomics in a novel manner , and has added many - new and unique phases of the science .

		The main features of the book are found in the extension of the scope of economic thought , making it far more subjective than is customary among the older economists , and in the elucidation of the prin - ciples of social well-being rather than of the ordi - nary principles of wealth-getting .

		The economic purpose is to show that the evils of poverty arise not from the lack of goods but from the misuse of goods .

		The author ptoints out distinctively that the old differences between '' landlord , '' '' manager , '' '' capitalist , '' and '' laborer '' are becoming obliter - ated , and that the terms '' rent , '' '' profit , '' '' inter - est , '' and `` wages '' cease to be clear demarcations of income .

		He treats economic society more as a single entity , without distinctive productive or dis - tributive classes ; but he is clear in defining the rights and duties and privileges of all people en - 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, gaged in the economic processes of life .

		His theory of property is , to a certain extent , a philosophy of right living .

		In the chapter entitled '' Work and Play , '' he approaches the great subjects of utility , cost , value , price , surplus , and wages in a novel way ; but the reader recognizes familiar forms clothed in new garments .

		Under '' Monopoly Ad - vantage , '' the author discusses market prices , their rise and fall , and the differential advantages of the rising of monopolistic power ; and the conclusion is reached that '' monopoly is a problem not of values but of prices . ''

		The second part of the book is de - voted to '' Income as Determined by Heredity . ''

		Here the author branches further away from the main principles of conventional economics , and en - ters the ideas of social well-being .

		In the last chapter , on '' Income as Modified by Economic Rights , '' he gives what he considers the source of rights , and then proceeds to analyze various cate - gories of rights , fiuch as '' Public or Market Rights , '' • ' Social Rights , '' and '' Rights of Leisure . ''

		In the discussion of the source of rights , the author fails to make himself clear as to the real origin of rights ; but he insists that '' It is not , therefore , from a theory of distribution that a solution of present dif - ficulties will come , but from a better formulation of the moral code and from a clearer perception of the common rights that new impulses and ideals evoke . ''

		In his discussion he makes economic rights something more than freedom of choice and justice , but appears to base them on the economic well-being of man .

		The book is thoughtful and suggestive , like all of Professor
Patten	PERSON	's writings .

		Having achieved a reputation as a Ah.umori , c. view humorist , Mr.

		Unfortunately , he himself seems not always or altogether certain whether he is serious or not ; and his new book , `` Uncle
Sam	PERSON	, Trustee '' -LRB-
Riggs Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is apparently named in that un - certain spirit .

		Unfortunately , too , Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	has here seen fit to make merry at the expense of those who are holding before the American people the ideals upon which the nation was founded , basing his rather sorry jests upon foundations so slight that the dignity of his work is seriously impaired .

		The volume is devoted to a showing of what the American occupation has been able to accomplish in the cities of
Santiago	LOCATION	and
Havana	LOCATION	, Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	assuming that in some way this is bearing out the national pledge , voluntarily given , to occupy the island for no purpose save that of pacification .

		By dint of laying stress on all the real good that was accomplished -- and of course there was a great deal of it -- and keeping silence in regard to all the harm done , Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	succeeds in proving that a beneficent despotism is the ideal government for practical results : a conclusion sufficiently obvious before , but one that sounds a little curious when elevated , as in this case , into an American ideal by Books of optimistic wisdom .

		an American .

		Perhaps it is best to remember that the author is , after all , a humorist .


Cuba	LOCATION	is to-day , if official reports are to be trusted , in a rather bad way through the cupidity of certain American in - terests .

		In the face of that sorry truth , it does not become any American to flaunt the national ensign in the face of the world as a complete reply to the strictures of idealists . ''

		Plain duty , '' pac & Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	, has been made a little less obvious by his writing here , and his attitude is to be regretted accordingly .

		Two little books by Mr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie	PERSON	, '' Works and Days '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and '' Parables of Life '' -LRB- The
Outlook Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , come to us with the gracefully phrased wisdom of a genial man of letters .

		The first is a collection of brief essays on every-day subjects , with which readers of `` The Outlook '' are familiar .

		Their fine note of serenity and cheerfulness will make the volume companion - able for those to whom the messages are not new , as well as to others .

		It is a book to be picked up at a chance moment , almost no contribution going beyond the length of half-a-dozen pages .

		-- The vol - ume entitled `` Parables of Life '' is more decidedly literary in method and manner , and there is in it more suggestion of artificiality .

		The parables are managed with the felicity and grace that we very properly expect of Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	, but they seem some ^ how a little cloying to the taste .

		Perhaps it is be - cause we are now rather unwilling to bother with anything but actualities themselves , and the thin disguise of a parable seems a useless sort of pretti - ness .

		There are eleven of these essays in all , cover - ing various phases of life from childhood to old age .

		They have a pleasant savor of good-sense and wisdom , and if they sometimes incline to preaching over-much , the preaching is good and wholesome .

		The volume , a product of the De
Vinne	PERSON	press , is a delight to the eye , with its wide margins and elegantly simple binding in brown cloth and paper .

		Nuremberg , ''
Albert Durer	PERSON	's and
Hans Sachs	PERSON	' City , '' was also from
1450	DATE	to
1549	DATE	the city of the Vis - chers , -- a family of bronze founders , who , in inter - preting the teaching of other and greater artists of other lands , impressed upon their work an original power and individuality of their own .

		They were then , and are still , called '' craftsmen . ''

		Were they living now , they would perhaps give the work of the foundry into the hands of others , devote their time and attention to the work of modelling and designing , and be known as sculptors .

		In the history of German art , their work represents the transition from the Gothic to the Renaissance style .

		The members of this renowned family were Her -
mann Vischer	PERSON	, his son
Peter	PERSON	, and
Peter	PERSON	's sons --
Hermann	PERSON	,
Peter	PERSON	, and
Hans	PERSON	.

		To emphasize the value of this book as a contribution to the series of '' Great Craftsmen . ''

		Buuimand Two interesting folk-tales relating Frmeh/otk-iaia to
Napoleon I.	PERSON	, translated into col - abmt
Sapoiem I. JoqQial	PERSON	English and furnished with a discriminating Introduction by Mr.
George Ken	PERSON	- nan , are published together in a volume by
The Outlook Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first tale , entitled `` Napo - leonder , '' is a Russian story , edited or put into lit - erary form by
Alexander Araphiteatrof	PERSON	of
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, and published in
December , 1901	DATE	, in the
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	'' Gazette . ''

		The other tale was written by Honor ^ de
Balzac	LOCATION	, and is supposed to be the story of
Napoleon	PERSON	told by one of his old soldiers to a group of French peasants .

		Doubtless the unprejudiced reader will be disposed to agree with Mr.
Kennan	PERSON	, that the Russian story is de - cidedly the better of the two .

		To quote from the Introduction , '' The French peasant regards
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon merely as a great leader and conqueror , created to be the father of soldiers , and aided , if not di - rectly sent , by God , to show forth the power and glory of
France	LOCATION	.

		The Russian peasant , more thoughtful by nature as well as less excitable and combative in temperament , admits that
Napoleon	PERSON	was sent on earth by God , but connects him with one of the deep problems of life by using him to show the divine nature of sympathy and pity , and the cruelty , immorality , and unreasonableness of aggressive war . ''

		But to those familiar with the beginning of the Book of Job and with the pro- logue to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' the apology for the seeming irreverence of the Russian story appears hardly necessary .

		The reading of these stories will in any case prove a pleasant diversion , and their comparison a profitable task .

		Mr.
Herbert W. Tompkins	PERSON	prefers ^ Ty . ' '' '

		• Sainte Terrer '' -- the '' holy-lander '' or pious pilgrim -- to sans terre -- homeless or without house -- as the proper origin of the verb '' to saunter . ''

		He declares that true sauntering is an art that may be cultivated , and he finds the highways and byways in
Hertfordshire	LOCATION	admirable for its cultivation .

		Mr.
Tompkins	PERSON	ob - serves everything as he lightly passes along , -- the characteristics of village architecture , little details in the churches that would escape the attention of most wayfarers , curious epitaphs in the church - yards or inscriptions on stone buildings , the tumuli of primitive man , barrows of Danish origin , relics of the Roman occupation , and the botany and natural history of each locality , -- and he writes of all of them in such manner that his reader sees them too , and takes also a keen delight in the see - ing .

		He knows , besides , a long list of names of English worthies who were either born in
Hert	LOCATION	- fordshire or at one time lived there , and the reader shares his interest as he passes through a village of which any of them were native or with which they were in any manner associated .

		The book is charmingly illustrated by Mr.
Frederic Gregg	PERSON	, who well knows the artistic and illustrative value of a line .

		Thus
Hertfordshire	LOCATION	furnishes materials for a valuable contribution to the charming '' High - ways and Byways Series '' -LRB-

		Daily life m '' ^ ^ ^ recent war between
Spain	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	left no such ani - PertugaL mosities behind it in either country as that the American globe-trotter might not find a hearty welcome in
Spain	LOCATION	, or desire to make up what might be deficient in his knowledge of the
Iberian Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		A book on
Spain	LOCATION	is therefore timely .

		To the series of `` Our European Neigh - bors '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- ,
Louis Higgin	PERSON	is enabled , by a residence of many years in
Spain	LOCATION	, to contribute a very readable and informing book on ' ■ Spanish Life in Town and Country . ''

		We are prevented from assuming the work to be written by a man , by the incidental mention of something that hap - ptened in the author 's girlhood .

		It is , however , written in an exceedingly pleasing style , and no phase of Spanish life is overlooked or neglected .


Portugal	LOCATION	, like and yet in many respects unlike
Spain	LOCATION	as it is , is deemed not important enough to warrant a separate volume , and two chapters on Portuguese life -- `` Land and People '' and `` Por - tuguese Institutions '' -- are added by Mr.

Erckmann	LOCATION	- Chatrian 's shorter stories , make up the Rev.
James B. Kenyon	PERSON	's second volume of prose sketches , which he has named '' Remembered Days '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The little poem that precedes these chapters forms not the least pleasing feature of the book , whose subsequent pages show a somewhat florid style clothing an amount of matt `` r that is not , and doubtless was not meant to be , stupendous .

		But aquiet humor , an observant eye , a poetic fancy , and a pure delight in country life , are the author 's precious possessions , and his book has something of the breezy freshness of the scenes that inspired it .

John	PERSON	, who was so tender-hearted toward all creation , vegetable as well as animal , that it hurt 248 THE DIAL .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Most text books of elementary English claim to be practical , but few of them really justify the claioi .

		One of the few is `` A Text - Book of Applied English Grammar '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
Edwin Herbert Lewis	PERSON	, whose previously-published school books in English have met with deserved favor .

		Here is a book that is practical in the best and fullest sense , and is calculated to make the subject really interesting -LRB- given a good teacher -RRB- to juvenile minds .

		There are great numbers of exercises , some of them happily based upon well - known pictures , and all skilfully devised to develop the immature reasoning powers of children .

		This book seems to us one of the best for its purpose that have ever been produced .

		The
George H. Ellis Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, publish a pamphlet entitled '' Secretary Root 's Record , '' or '' Marked Severities in the Philippine Warfare . ''

		It is a careful analysis , by two distinguished lawyers , Messrs.
Moor	PERSON	- field
Storey	PERSON	and
Julian Codman	PERSON	, of the utterances of the Secretary of War concerning the crimes committed by American soldiers in the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	.

		Every statement made is supported by convincing evidence , and the record as a whole convicts Mr.
Root	PERSON	of fre - quent misrepresentations , suppressions of the truth , and deliberate attempts to gloss over the use of torture in extracting confessions , and other atrocious practices .

		It is diflBcult to see how any effective reply can be made to this scathing denunciation .

		In preparing his '' Handbook of Best Readings '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Professor
S. H. Clark	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has contrived to run the gamut , from work suited to the commonest uses of the professional elocu - tionist up to the accepted classics of the language in both prose and verse .

		Coming from such a source , there should have been some practical acceptance of literary standards and a refusal to recognize sentimentality and mere fudge , and we are sorry to observe the sort of companionship which is here thrust upon the really good literature that makes up a considerable portion of the Tolnme .

		It is somewhat daring for anyone after Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	to prepare '' An Anthology of Victorian Poetry '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , yet this is what Sir
Mountstuart	PERSON	# .


Grant Duff	ORGANIZATION	has done .

		He apologizes for it by saying that it presents merely the personal equation of his own likings , which hardly needed to be said .

		When he goes further , and claims that all other anthologies do the same thing , he ignores the fact that there is such a thing as expert judgment of poetry , and that the best anthology must be the one that most completely keeps the compiler 's tastes in the background .

		We do not particularly care for the personal equation in such a work unless it is the equation of a remarkable personality , as in the case of
Emerson	LOCATION	's '' Parnassus . ''

		For the rest .

		Sir
Mountstuart	PERSON	has made up for us a volume of excellent reading , and his taste is usually in the line of good critical opinion .

		BRIEFER MENTION 248 NOTES 248 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 249 EMILE ZOLA .

		Had
Emile Zola	PERSON	died ten years ago , the verdict of criticism upon his work would have been substantially different from what it must be to-day .

		A false theory of art , applied to his material with amazing industry but per - verse ingenuity , would have been the formula for the summing up of his remarkable activity , and little could have been urged in behalf of his claims to literary immortality .

		He would have stood as an awful example of doctrinaire method and of the dangers of excessive photo - graphic realism .

		That he was a close observer of life could not have been denied , and that the accumulation of unimportant detail character - istic of his writing had a certain bludgeon-like power in its assault upon his readers would have been freely admitted ; but it would have been difficult to escape the conclusion that all this energy had been essentially misdirected , and that all the mass of the Rougon-Macquart chronicles had little of the penetrating and en - during quality that makes of literature in the true sense one of the most effective forces in the bands of men .

		To quote an epigram that was current a score of years ago , '' L'Assom - moir '' was assommant , simply that , unless we add it was also repulsive and disgusting to the finer sensibilities .

		Recent developments , we are bound to say , have made necessary a quite new estimate of
Zola	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		It is not merely his self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of truth and justice , 38 displayed in the celebrated affaire of a few years ago , that has attracted attention to as - pects of his character but dimly realized be - fore .

		That is what has chiefly impressed the multitude , but the careful reader of his recent work has come to understand that the outburst in question was symptomatic of a general broadening of his outlook , and to suspect the passionate idealism thus brought to the surface has been potential in his character all along , although for the most part sternly suppressed in the interest of what we have already styled a false theory of art .

		Rereading his earlier novels in the light of his later ones , as well as in the light of his public acts , we discover in them things that we never saw before , glimpses 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, of the larger aspects of truth that he so stu - diously sought to conceal , glints of sunlight struggling to make their way through the fog and suggestive of the glories beyond .

		From the position of the dispassionate scientific ob - server he has come to assume something of the position of the prophet , and his utterances have gained immensely in weight and authority .


Emile Zola	PERSON	was born in
Paris	LOCATION	in
1840	DATE	, the year also of
Daudet	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		In his blood there was a mingling of three strains , French , Ven - etian , and Greek .

		His boyhood years were spentmostly at
Aix	LOCATION	-LRB- the Plassans of his fiction -RRB- , but at the age of eighteen , the family fortunes having collapsed , he went back to the city of his birth .

		After a year or two more of school - ing which proved unsuccessful , owing to his pronounced dislike of the classics which were the staple of thelycee instruction , he was thrown upon his own resources .

		The following years were years of wretched poverty , and his literary apprenticeship was made under difficult condi - tions , much like those that attended the early struggles of Daudet to obtain a foothold as an author .

		He wrote poems , short stories , and newspaper articles , then the series of six early novels which ended with ``
Therese Raquin	PERSON	'' and ''
Madeleine Ferat	PERSON	. ''

		These books prepared the way for the famous Rougon-Macquart series to which he gave the
next quarter	DATE	- century of his life .

		This stupendous undertaking , in magnitude comparable only with '' La Comedie Humaine , '' was thought out in its general plan almost from the beginning , and the imaginary genealogy of the whole series was devised with the inception of the first volume .

		The author 's purpose was to do for the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	what Balzac had done for the Restoration period , to write the natural history of French society in all of its phases and developments .

		With this object in view , he imagined a family whose members iu several generations were to represent all the principal types of life and occupation -- their lives seemingly diverse , yet linked together by the mysterious tie of a common heredity , and illustrating in all of its manifestations an `` overweening appetite , that general modern impulse that snatches at enjoyment and inter - penetrates our whole social body . ''

		It was a magnificent scheme , and the completed series of volumes stands as one of the most magnifi - cent monuments of contemporary French liter - ature .

		When the undertaking was outlined , the author could not foresee that the Empire itself was tottering to a shameful end , and in its execution he thus became involved in grave chronological difficulties .

		His scheme had as - sumed a much longer term than the brief nine - teen years allotted by the fates for that ill - starred experiment in imperialism , and he pursued his course without attempting the re - construction that would have been required by a strict conformity to historical fact .

		The twenty volumes to which the series extended are of very uneven excellence , and have had varying fortunes .

		The earlier novels attracted no more than a moderate degree of attention , but with the publication of '' L'Assommoir '' the author burst into the full light of notoriety and of at least a qualified fame .

		The volumes that have received the most praise , besides the one just mentioned , are '' Germinal , '' a prose epic of the mine , '' La Debacle , '' a vivid pre - sentation of the War of
1870	DATE	, '' Le Reve , '' a masterpiece of mystical beauty , and '' La Faute de 1 ` Abbe Mouret , '' which is perhaps the most artistic of all the twenty .

		Among the compara - tive failures may be mentioned '' Le Ventre de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' '' Pot-Bouille , '' '' L'Argent , '' `` La Cou - quete de Plassans , '' and '' Dr.
Pascal	PERSON	, '' the final volume of the series .

		Nearly half of these twenty volumes deal with the most degraded aspects of life , and por - tray the various forms of vice and bestiality with an unsparing pen .

		When it came to the practice of his theory , he was unflinching , and the foulness of such books as '' La Terre '' and '' La Bete Humaine '' naturally gives much offense to the reader of artistic sensibilities .

		Whether Zola can be wholly acquitted of the charge of having deliberately and of set purpose pandered to the most depraved tastes of his readers is doubtful ; what is certain is that his great vogue in the eighties was due in no small measure to the most repulsive characteristics of his works .

		And yet -- strange contradic - tiou !

		-- he could follow up the vilest of his pages with such a revelation of tender and spiritual beauty as is given us in '' Le Reve , '' a book that has no suggestion of sensual stain , and transports us into the loftiest realm of the ideal .

		His own answer to the charge laid against him was , of course , that he depicted life as he found it , that he described nothing that he had not observed , that reticence must be a virtue unknown to the roman experimen - tal .

		That this is the supreme virtue in all great and enduring art is a lesson that he never learned .

		Some sort of comparison is inevitable be -

		THE DIAIi 249 limited edition of the Robiiiy ^ t , printed on handmade paper and on vellum , with decorative borders by Mr.
Louis B. Coley	PERSON	. ''

		The Fascination of
London	LOCATION	'' is the collective title of a series of small volumes published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are the joint work of the late
Walter Besant	PERSON	and Mr.
G. E. Mitton	PERSON	, and comprise four nambers , devoted respectively to
Chelsea	LOCATION	,
Westmins	PERSON	- ter , the
Strand District	ORGANIZATION	, and
Hampstead	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Sara A. Hubbard	PERSON	's '' Catch Words of Cheer , '' published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is in the form of a birthday book or diary , each day of the year having its cheering thought .

		Stevenson 's '' Man does not live by bread alone but also by catch words '' is the motto of this exceptionally dainty little volume .

		Readers of '' The Outlook '' have learned to have a kindly feeling for the '' Spectator '' whose weekly ob - servations have long constituted one of the interesting features of that journal .

		To such , and others , the volume called `` Seen by the Spectator , '' a reprint of selections just published by the
Outlook Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will be welcome .

		To their series of '' Little Histories of Art ''
Messrs. A. W. Elson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have added a monograph on '' Italian Painting '' by Prof.
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	.

		For those who wish an outline sketch of the subject , in the briefest form possible , nothing better could be found than this little essay .

		Five photogravure plates of ex - cellent quality supplement the text .

		Dr.
J. Lesslie Hall	PERSON	's translation , rhythmical and moderately alliterative , of ``
Judith	PERSON	,
Phoenix	LOCATION	, and Other Anglo-Saxon Poems '' -LRB- Silver -RRB- , continues the good work begun by him when he translated the `` Beowulf ''
several years ago	DATE	.

		The other poems are the '' Andreas '' legend , and the
Battles of Maiden	ORGANIZATION	and Brunanburk .

		There are brief introductions to the five works , and a few foot notes .

		Nothing in American history has had a more pro- found effect upon the future of the country than the expedition headed by
Meriwether Lewis	PERSON	and
William Clark	PERSON	, which left
St. Louis	LOCATION	in
1804	DATE	, passed up to the
Missouri	LOCATION	and over the mountains to the headwaters of the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and thence to the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , returning overland in
1806	DATE	.

		This magnificent conception of Pres - ident
Jefferson	PERSON	has been seized upon by Mrs.
Eva Emery Dye	PERSON	, of
Oregon	LOCATION	, as the backbone of a book to be pub - lished within a few weeks by
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the title of '' The Conquest . ''

		The narrative , however , begins with the active life of
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	, the explorer 's elder brother , during the war with the Indians provoked by
Lord Dunmore	ORGANIZATION	in
1774	DATE	to dis - tract the attention of the rebellious colonists of Vir - ginia , follows him through the fighting with the British and their savage allies in the revolutionary war along the western frontier , and does not end until
William Clark	PERSON	's death in
September , 1838	DATE	, after he had been at the head of Indian affairs of the nation for a full gen - eration .

		This covers the settlement of the
United States	LOCATION	from the tidewaters of the Old Dominion to the extreme northwestern corner of its boundaries , and enables Mrs.
Dye	PERSON	to bring into the scope of her work all the deeds of the nation for a period extending over sixty-seven of its most vital years .

		As a result the story has the sweep and swing of an epic poem , not all the battling before Troy and the wandering of Ulysses revealing figures more heroic or deeds of equal conse - quence to humanity .

		If we think of Thack - eray or
Bret Harte	PERSON	in perusing tliis little volume , it is only to reflect that they would , in all probability , have gladly taken him into their company ... why he could not have written all of the works of the authors he parodies it is difficult to see , for he seems invariably to get inside of them , to write as though with their hands and from their brains '' says the

		The

		BRIEFER MENTION 288 NOTES 288 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 290 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 290 THE GROWTH AND MISSION OF NA TUREPOETR Y. Among carrent phrases , few have received wider nse and more frequent distortion than the herald cry of Ronssean , '' Back to Natare . ''

		In its incep - tion a watchword of revolt against tyranny and ar - tifice , it has inspired the most sincere reforms and has clothed the most morbid sensationalism of the past centary .

		Despite occasional perversion , how - ever , the nineteenth centnry reinstated Natare as an inspiration to the noblest poetry , as an incentive to edacational vitality , as an agent to restore and interpret life in its elemental sanity .

		While we speak of
Natare	ORGANIZATION	stady and
Natare	ORGANIZATION	poetry as evi - dences of the advance of this age , we forget that , in tmth , we have receded to past ideals and re - stated them with the knowledge and broader spirit of oar own century .

		We have yet to surpass the
Natare	ORGANIZATION	revelations of beaaty and worship in the primitive literatures .

		If we have a scientific accu - racy , a logical interpretation of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's laws , have we achieved any purer insight , any loftier imagin - ation , than was attained by
Moses	PERSON	on the Midian hills , by
David	PERSON	in the Palestine pastures , or by Homer and
Mosehas	PERSON	on the shores of the .

		# gean ?

		We have yet to surpass the pastorals of
Virgil	PERSON	and Lacretias , the glowing visions of Celtic Ossian and Persian Omar , or the grand and fervid narratives of the Runic bards .

		These primitive poets foand Nature beautifnl and friendly ; more than that , she was a guide and a protector .

		They embodied their love and worship for her under symbols of their religion ; we do the same .

		One may dispute the accuracy of these early poetic fancies ; such criticism fails to nullify their poetic insight .

		They could not understand the scientific processes of growth , fermentation , and decay , -- laws explained by mere children to-day , -- yet they knew the value of Nature to humanity , they recognized her inspiration and worshipped her divinity .

		The facts which thousands of years have discovered are of great value , but they do not affect the real truth , the vital spirit of these pioneer Nature interpreters .

		For their superstition , we have instilled the spirit of research .

		It is a far call from our age to these pastorals of classic times ; there have been many tangential paths , hence the message '' Back to Nature . ''

		Con - fining oneself to English poetry , as example , one notes the survival of early ideals in the pastorals of Piers the
Plowman	PERSON	, and Chaucer ; then the grad - ual transference of interest from Natare to ha - 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, inanity , and the era of artificial standards and verbose , euphnistic form .

		Two poets ,
Spenser	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, retained their love of Nature and ad - herence to her simple , sincere teachings .

		The former confessed to a desire to revive the Vir - gilian spirit .

		The latter painted marvellous tints of sunshine and forest shade ; he used Nature as a background for his finest scenes .

		With a magical insight he seemed to prophesy our later spirit of scientific yet poetic interpretation , when his Jacques found '' ToDgnes in trees , books in the running brooks , Sermons in stones , and good in everything . ''

		Following these poets , who interpreted Nature in an age already becoming enslaved to form and fashion , there was the era of apathy and decadence , both in poetry of nature and of loftier life , from the later passing of Shakespeare to the advent of
Cowper	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		For a time .

		Nature was regarded not alone with indifference but even with disgust .


Dryden	PERSON	, Pope , and their associates , ex - tolled the city and deplored the hardships of trips into the country .

		In prose also was voiced this game sentiment of repugnance : the hills were irk - some , the streams were swollen , the ocean was wild and gloomy .

		With the exception of occasional lines in
Milton	LOCATION	's masterpieces .

		Nature seemed a tabooed theme for poetic usage .

		From such abnormal status there came a re - action , gradual and tentative for many decades .

		At first it was in the revival of Nature similes , not to celebrate the glories of scenery , but to afford more striking epithets for descriptions of town - life and simpering heroines of the drawing-room .

		One readily recalls the vacuous phrases , '' lithe as a willow , '' '' cheeks like a damask rose , '' and similar '' millinery adjectives . ''

		Nature , as either true illus - tration or incentive , was still unseen .

		In minor strains one notes the first revival of simple , true appreciation of Nature forms and rural beauty .

		Gay 's '' Shepherd 's Week '' contains a few rare in - tuitive lines on bird habits and country life .

		The '' Pastorals '' of
Ambrose Phillips	PERSON	are meagrely interlined with passages of Nature observation , though one still misses the note of comradeship .


Allan Ramsay	PERSON	was the pioneer poet in this revival of sympathy between Nature and man ; '' The Gentle Shepherd '' emanated from an observant mind and a sincere love of rural scenes .


Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, by concentration of theme and minute - ness of description , stimulated popular taste to a new observation of English woods and flowers .

		While his scenery is vivid and often effulgent , there is a lack of the emotional warmth noted in
Ramsay	LOCATION	, and soon to be fully vitalized in the poetry of Gray ,
Beattie	PERSON	, and
Burns	PERSON	.

		This spiritual awakening found expression in the poetry of
Lang	PERSON	- home ,
Burns	PERSON	,
Crabbe	LOCATION	; it reached its fruition in
Cowper	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Bryant	PERSON	, and
Whittier	LOCATION	.

		Over the tender and significant Nature poems of
Cowper	PERSON	, will ever linger his epigram , defiant to the artificers - of past verse , -- '' God made the country and man made the town . ''

		Nature had a personal message of healing for this poet in the tangled meshes of his life ; he realized and poetized her sane , restorative powers .

		Thus had the poets of the middle and later eighteenth century portrayed Nature as a sensuous delight , a mental inspiration , and a shrine for the soul 's worship and repose .

		Wordsworth embodied all these attributes .

		To him .

		Nature , in wildness or repose , inflamed the senses and the imagination , incited observation and thought , revealed the true meaning of creation and the divine .

		A type of the imaginative dullard of his time was ''
Peter Bell	PERSON	. ''

		This apathy he combatted with far more vigor than he deplored extreme scientific dissection .

		Eager to bring about harmony between the poet and th '' scientist ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	was the pioneer in express - ing this ideal unity , now far nearer its consum - mation ; '' If the time should ever come when what is now called science , thus familiarized to man , shall be ready to put on , as it were , a form of flesh and blood , the Poet will lend this divine spirit to aid the transfiguration , and will welcome the Being thus produced as a dear and genuine inmate of the household of man . ''

		Tennyson and
Browning	PERSON	, af - fected even more than were
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	by the scientific trend of thought , blended accuracy with tenderness , observation with passion .

		Emer - son revealed in American poetry the influence of converging science and poetry , often substituting the philosopher 's query for the poet 's fancy .

		In '' The Rhodora , '' however , with dauntless defiance to speculation and utilitarian theories , he has pro- duced a marvel of poetic charm .

		We apply the term Nature-poet without dis - crimination .

		In fact , after the revival of this in - spiration nearly all the Victorian poets of first rank , and the American writers in yet greater degree , used Nature freely in their `` poet 's cloth of gold . ''

		Tennyson found her beauteous changes a never - failing illustration for his lyrics and dramas of life . ''

		In Memoriam '' is tinctured by scenic stanzas , analogies or accompaniment to human mood .

		Swin - burne and
Morris	PERSON	, with less skill and diversity , have thus used Nature as illustration .

		Browning , in the major part of his poetry , does not commingle in loving relations man and the external world , either in its glory or its peace .

		There are exceptional passages , as the delicate song of the Msyne in ''
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		From Nature , as a rule , he gains solitary intellectual incentive .

		In ''
Pippa	PERSON	Passes '' and ''
Saul	PERSON	, '' however , the poet interprets human responsibility and sanity through the allegorical and descriptive messages of Nature .

		Few poets have had deeper fervor for solitary Na - ture , both broad and restricted , than Landor .

		Like
Keats	PERSON	, a devotee of classicism , he peopled woods and hills with messengers of Phcebus and Bacchus ,
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 eyen as the Engltsh nightingale is to
Keats	PERSON	'' `` lightwinged dryad of the trees . ''

		Oeeasionally in lAudor 's poems one meets a Ijrie , blending , in happy simile , Natare and heart-love : '' From Ton .

		lantlie , little tronbles pav Like little ripples down a sonny river ; Yoar pleasures
spring	DATE	like daisies in the graaa .

		Cat down , and np again as blithe as ever . ''

		The ancients gave Natare animate shapes , yet seldom hnman ; they made her sympathetic with man .

		often creative for him .

		Bat it remained for the nineteenth centary to endow Natnre with a goal , to apostrophize her as the highest conception of Life , Love , and Truth .

		Wordsworth infused both a mentality and a spirituality into the object of his worshipful companionship .

		Coleridge embodying his philosophy in his Nature poetry made the world the transcendental image of ourselves : '' Ah !

		from the sonl itself mast issne fortli A light , a glory , a fair laminoas clond Enveloping the
Earth	LOCATION	. ''

		Shelley 's poetry yet more personifies the elements with the spirit of life and love .

		His '' Skylark '' is .

		a '' blithe spirit , '' his '' West Wind '' a '' spirit fierce , -- impetuous one . ''

		Love , embodiment of
Natare	ORGANIZATION	and humanity , the ultimate sublime crea - tion , utters the magical finale of '' Prometheus Un - bound , '' -- '' And folds over the world its healing vings . ''

		While for purposes of classification one may divide the modern poet `` , in their treatment of Na - tare , into three classes -- those who worked by illas - tratioD , by incentive , and by interpretation , -- such distinctions are far from absolute .

		Tennyson and
Browning	PERSON	,
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	, are in the main types of illustrative poets ;
Byron	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and Lan - dor , poets of mental incentive or inspiration ;
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and Whit - tier are interpreters of human and divine laws through Natnre communion .

		There are , however , occasional poems by many of the modern exponents of this age of speculation , suggesting queries and yearning for their solution in
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's laws .

		In
Tennyson	LOCATION	's later work are many such hints ; for he was the most perfect creation of his age .

		When he plucks his '' Flower from the Crannied Wall , '' his cry is , '' Bnt if I oonld nnderstaad What jon are , root and all , and all i > all , I shotild know what God and maa ia . ''

		The current poets have interwoven Natnre in varied ways , -- especially as allurement to wearied city - pent souls , and as antidote to devitalizing com - mercialism and greed .

		Nature vistas , in vigor - oas and delicate outlines , are scattered throughout the poetry of
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	.


George Meredith	PERSON	,
William Henley	PERSON	, and
Alfred Austin	PERSON	.

		They give sensuous charm to the dramas of
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, and to the tense and virile odes of Kipling .

		Wil -
liam Watson	PERSON	, an avowed pupil of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, has proclaimed allegiance in deep sympathetic Natare worship .

		In American poetry there are yet more distinct stages of development and messages of joyanee and reverence in
Natare	LOCATION	communion .

		It is axiom - atic to recall the early prose , and the so-called poems , descriptive of the cold wild hills and foreata that seemed '' daunting terrible '' to the colonists in their primal search for shelter and harvest .

		With the conquest of the soil and relaxation of the Pur - itan revulsion against all objects of taste and joy , came an awakening of the observant and descrip - tive faculties , -- reflected in the pioneer Natare verses of
Philip Freneau	PERSON	and
Richard Alsop	PERSON	.

		After a series of crude yet sincere efforts at picto - rial vision , among sach forgotten poets as
Percival	PERSON	and
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, wherein awe is replaced by comradeship ,
Bryant	PERSON	, in
1817	DATE	, wrote * ' ` Tbanatoptsis '' and de - clared himself oar first true Natare poet .

		Like
Wordsworth	PERSON	, he combined illustrative portrayal with fervent incentive and broad interpretation .

		Emerson and
Whittier	LOCATION	also revealed this reflective and interpretative attitude .

		If the former often ac - centuated the philosophic strain , he never lost the poet 's charm .

		Whittier must ever suggest the simple and heartfelt bucolics of
Blake	PERSON	and
Burns	PERSON	.

		Less speculative but more trustful than his associates , he has poetized Nature in graphic and varied forms .

		Lowell , like
Tennyson	PERSON	, fonnd incentive to keen im - aginative and emotional pictures in woodland walk , brilliant flowers , or dashing ocean-spray .

		Long - fellow is especially the American poet of the sea and shore , and in these memories are fonnd some of his most perfect work .

		With a note of tme revelatory inspiration , he wrote , '' The heart of the great nniw Sends a thrilling polae through me . ''


Bayard Taylor	PERSON	is yet to receive due recognition as a poet .

		To him Nature gave rich fancies and strong interpretations of life and divine laws .

		The early '' Home Pastorals , '' the later sensuous pictures of the Orient , reveal the poet 's insight and joyous comradeship with widely-scattered Nature forms .

		In the rollicking music of '' Wind and Sea , '' as song to-day , do we not often forget the poetic beauty ?

		Buoyancy and grace coalesce in his poems .

		In occasional revulsion at
Whitman	ORGANIZATION	's baldness and scientific freedom , we may overlook two odes an - eqaalled in tenderness and
Natare	ORGANIZATION	interpretation -- the nocturne of the mocking-bird and the per - fume of the lilac .

		Southern skies and color most ever lure the poet 's senses .

		America has claim to no poet more deeply infused with
Natare	ORGANIZATION	communion than was
Lanier	PERSON	.

		He possessed even more than comradeship .

		His soul responded to personal affinity in the marshes , the robin , and the '' Friendly , sisterly , sweet-heart leaves . ''

		In later poetry , of whatever locality , there are few distinctive Nature versifiers .

		The exclusive - 274 THE DIAL -LRB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ness of theme has given place to broader suggestions of the conaplex incentives of the age .


Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Bryant	PERSON	are still the pervasive influences in Nature poetry .

		They were deeply imbued with the mission of such authorship , -- to educate the senses , incite the imagination and thought , and inspire the 80ul to worshipful interpretation of higher truths .

		Nature will reveal her lessons only to the responsive
Boal	PERSON	. ''

		Yea , what were mighty
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's self ?

		Her features could they win us , Unhelped by the poetic voice That hourly speaks within us ? ''

		The mission and the distinctive message of Nature poetry have been assimilated in many other themes of current verse .

		She utters her reproach , she offers her benison , to a restless civilization .

		The exquisite lyrics of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, the symphonic hymnal stanzas of Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	, the lyric pictures by
Richard Burton	PERSON	and Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	,
Miss Reeve	PERSON	and
Miss Guiney	PERSON	, the flower-songs of Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	and Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	, the bucolics of
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	, -- such are indicative of the variety and ef - fulgence of American Nature-lore .

		In the strange focalized genius of
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	are brilliant descriptive flashes , as in '' The Blue Jay '' : '' No brigadier throughout the year So civic as the jay .

		A neighbor and a warrior too .

		With shrill felicity . ''

		Among our younger American poets , nearly all of whom have written Nature verse of beauty , are three with significant motives .

		The sonnets of Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	are unique and revelatory of the artist-student of woods and shore .

		If the metrical form is occasionally difficult to maintain with ease , the mind-image is always lucid and stimulative .

		Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	is a poet of rare melodies .

		His excess of imagery seldom obscures the real simplicity and fervor of thought . ''

		The Walk '' which leads him to '' The Hills of Song , '' and more recently '' The Lure of the
Woodland	LOCATION	, '' have traces of floridity , but are matchless in music and joyance .

		From our fretting , rushing surface-impressions .

		Nature can lure us by the '' magicry '' and harmony portrayed by this poet .

		For the tabulated facts of Nature , her poetry supplies loving observation and recogni - tion of the vital truths , '' the verities of life . ''

		Na - ture to such a poet is not alone a picture but a loving comrade .

		To give counterpoise to the scien - tific analysis of the day , the poet trains imagination and soul for Nature-communion .

		Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	, one of our lyrists of elemental glories and concrete beauties , has well embodied the poet 's mission as interpreter of Nature : '' For him the
June	DATE	days never go , For him the roses ever blow , And bleakest hours that be Are loud with melody ; He looks , his eye in darkness sightful is ; He leans , his ear can hear the silences . ''

		A BOSWJELL .

		FOR
DUMAS	PERSON	.

		* `` Posterity for me begins at the frontier , '' said
Dumas	PERSON	.

		And it is only during the
last quarter	DATE	- century -- since the death of their writer -- that the imaginative pages of '' Monte Cristo '' and '' Les Trois Mousquetaires '' have made Amer - ica no inconsiderable part of that frontier .

		It has recently been pointed out that it is chiefly to Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	and
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	that the literary rehabilitation of
Dumas	PERSON	with the English-speaking public is to be credited ; the former having assured us that the adven - tures of the three musketeers belonged to a legi - timate sphere of French literature , while the latter voiced his admiration of the unstrained and wholesome morality of his '' Vicomte de Bragelonne . ''

		In his interesting narrative of the life and works of
Dumas	LOCATION	, Mr.
Arthur F. Davidson	PERSON	, a critical English student , has made good use of the voluminous
Dumas	PERSON	literature that pre - ceded him .

		The various French works con - cerning
Dumas	PERSON	have all confined themselves to some particular side of his talent or some par - ticular period of his life .

		Hence , the present volume is , from a biographical and literary standpoint , the first comprehensive and con - tinuous work , and fitly commemorates the cen - tenary of
Dumas	PERSON	's birth --
July 24 , 1902	DATE	.

		For some time the belief was current that
Dumas	PERSON	was born in
1803	DATE	.

		Says the present biogra - pher : '' By a singular inadvertence -- so persistent is error -- this was the date which originally appeared on the monument in the
Place Malesherbes	ORGANIZATION	, which has since been corrected .

		It is reasonable to attribute the origin of this mistake to the ambiguity of the Republican Cal - endar . '

		On the fifth day of Thermidor in the year X of the French Republic ' -- so runs the ar.le de naissance of
Dumas	PERSON	; and only on the supposition that the first year of the Republic began on
September 22 , 1793	DATE	, would X be
1803	DATE	.

		But , in fact , the first year was considered to end , not to begin , on
September 22 , 1793	DATE	, so that X would be
1802	DATE	. ''

		The first pronounced literary influence ex - perienced by
Dumas	PERSON	came from a meeting with
Adolph de Leuven	ORGANIZATION	, afterwards a prolific writer of vaudevilles and comic operas .

		An - other event bearing upon his career was a per - formance of tragedy called '' Hamlet , '' by an au - thor named Ducis .

		So the pla y-bill announced .

		• Alkxaitdrk Djjmas -LRB- pere -RRB- : His Life and his Works .

		By
Arthur F. Davidson	PERSON	,
M.A. Philadephia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippin	PERSON	-
cott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


1902	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 276 To Dumas the word '' tragedy '' saggested Cor - neille and
Racine	LOCATION	.

		He knew nothing of '' Ham - let , '' nor of Dacis ; still less that this was only an adaption from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in which the French playwright sought to smooth over the crndities of the original by certain doctorings in the approved '' classic '' style . ''

		The demon of poetry was now awakened in me , and would give me no rest , '' said
Dumas	PERSON	.

		Soon after , through a happy chance , he was introduced to that happy coterie of privileged beings who made the plays and the laws of the Theatre Franc ^ ais .

		As this event marked a starting-point in his remarkable career , it may not be amiss to lay aside for the moment Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	's biogra - phy and glance at the conditions then existing .

		The aberrations of the French dramatists arose principally from an egregious misconception of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, whom they ambitiously attempted to imitate and rival .

		His name , and those of
Schiller	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, were perpetually on their lips ; and yet the only development they aimed at was that of sensual propensities , -- although these are the lowest in the scale of themes for dramatic treatment , according to those great masters themselves .

		The old for - mal classic drama had fallen into decay and disrepute ; a new order of things was demanded by the innovating spirit of the time ?

		.

		Great models of other nations , indistinctly under - stood , seemed to form standards whereon their compositions might be moulded .

		Unsuited to French style and sentiment , the endeavor to imitate them led to productions of the most ano - malous character , wherein the stateliness of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the mysticism of the German , the impetuous frivolity and diseased imagination of
France	LOCATION	, were mingled in a heterogeneous compound .

		Wherever the influence of Shake - speare is felt it must be ultimately beneficial .

		Schiller 's ''
Wallenstein	PERSON	'' and Goethe 's '' Tor - quato Tasso '' sank into inferiority when com - pared with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the French public began to manifest the desire for a new dramatic form -- for a drama more in unison with and expressive of the spirit of the times --
Delavigne	PERSON	wrote his '' Vepres Siciliennes . ''

		It appeared in
1824	DATE	-LRB- when
Dumas	PERSON	was twenty - two years of age -RRB- , and the sentiments of liberty that abounded in it endeared it for a while to a fastidious public .

		It was the forerunner of a new school in French dramatic art . ''

		La Chasse et I ` Amour , '' a vaudeville in the Scribe fashion , marked
Dumas	PERSON	's debut as a dramatist .

		The piece was produced at once , -- illustrating , as
Dumas	PERSON	in a Pickwickian way observes , `` the mutability of human judgment . ''

		Other light works were produced in quick suc - cession .

		In
1827	DATE	a company of English actors , chief among whom was
Charles Kemble	PERSON	, visited
Paris	LOCATION	with a Shakespearian repertoire . ''

		From this hour , as never before , I had an idea what the theatre really was , '' says
Dumas	PERSON	. ''

		It was the first time I had seen on the stage real pas - sions animating men and women of flesh and blood . ''

		``
Henry III.	PERSON	, '' -- described as a faithful picture of the period intended to be repre - sented , -- was a notable success .

		It was appre - ciated the more for the reason that hitherto
Dumas	PERSON	had been notorious for the freedom with which he poached in German preserves ; while the talent displayed in dressing up his spoils , combined with his undoubted originality , had silenced his critics . ''

		Christine '' and `` Antony '' followed `` Henry III . ''

		These preceded their author 's short career of political life , summing up which his biographer says : '' It is easv enoagh to criticise him from the vantage - groond of secure indifference ; we do better to remem - ber bow hard it was in those ' incandescent ' dajs to avoid entanglements -LRB- witness , for example , all the ridiculoas tnrmoil raised in
1833	DATE	about the interesting condition of the
Dncbesse de Berry	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and to admit that if
Dumas	PERSON	sometimes made a fool of himself he did so in a numerous and not undistinguished company . ''

		Page after page is devoted by Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	to the other theatrical works of
Dumas	PERSON	.

		We are told how his ``
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	'' was written ; we are given descriptions and critical comments on '' Antony , '' ''
Richard Darling	PERSON	- ton , '' '' La Tour de Nesle , ''
Catherine Howard	PERSON	, '' ''
Don Juan de Marana	PERSON	, '' etc. , on down through the list .

		Then follow entertaining chapters of anecdote and reminiscence .

		As he approached middle age , the alert dramatist noticed with regret two tendencies of the times : the decline of supper parties as an institution , and the growing habit of smoking .

		He regarded nico - tine as a stupefying drug , -- the enemy of esprit .

		At repartee ,
Dumas	PERSON	was always able to hold his own .

		At the Fran ^ ais one evening , during the performance of a play by Soumet , a spectator was observed to be slumbering . ''

		Look , ' said
Dumas	PERSON	to the author of the play , who was sitting near him , `` you see the effect produced by your tragedy I '' But next evening , at the same theatre , it happened that the play was one of
Dumas	PERSON	's own , and it happened that a gentleman in the stalls was overpowered with sleep .

		Soumet , being present , noticed this ; and with infinite satisfaction , tapping
Dumas	PERSON	276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, on the shoulder , he said : '' Please notice , my dear
Dumas	PERSON	, that your plays can send people to sleep as well as mine . '' ''

		Not at all , '' was the ready reply ; '' that 's our friend of yester - day ; he has not woke up yet ! ''

		Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	points out that between
Scott	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	there are resemblances which al - ways strike the attention .

		Both , as boys , were what is scholastically called '' idle '' ; both be - gan life as apprentices to the legal profession ; each essayed a form of literature different from that in which he eventually found his widest popularity .

		Scott began with poetry ,
Dumas	PERSON	with drama ; but the chief title to fame for both was to be the historical novel .

		In each case German romanticism was a powerful influence ; and by a curious coincidence both
Scott	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	in early years exercised them - selves in a translation of the same work -- Burger 's ballad of ''
Lenore	PERSON	. ''

		Both authors , it may be added , made much money by their writings ; the one built his
Abbotsford	LOCATION	, the other his
Monte Cristo	ORGANIZATION	, -- and both fell into financial difficulties . ''

		The qualities of Scott , '' said
Dumas	PERSON	, '' are not dramatic qualities .

		Ad - mirable in the portrayal of manners , charac - ter , and costume , he is unable to depict pas - sions . '


Kenilworth	LOCATION	' is the only roman pas - sions that be wrote , and it is the only one that has attained great success in stage form ... My conviction was that
France	LOCATION	would be best suited by an equal fidelity in regard to man - ners and characters , combined with a more lively dialogue and more real passions . ''

		After reading the '' Waverley Novels , '' he cherished the idea of popularizing French history .

		In
Victor Hugo	PERSON	,
France	LOCATION	beheld the double character of genius : the light-hearted poet and the dismal humanitarian ; the lover of beauty for the sake of beauty , and the conscious ad - mirer -- not to say advocate -- of ugliness , of crime , of monsters .

		Balzac was survived by a feeble school of imitators , and
France	LOCATION	was sub - jected to a tainted course of licentious literature -- in which scandalous stories were covered over by a certain elegant varnish by describing the scenes as taking place in the drawing-rooms and boudoirs of high life .

		Michelet was looked upon as a professional historian .

		Merimee was too delicate for the general public , though his gems of art were prized by the connois - seurs .

		Such was the condition of things when
Dumas	PERSON	conceived the idea of writing novels of historical significance , as
Scott	PERSON	had done across the channel . ''

		Le
Chevalier	PERSON	d'Harmental '' was followed by '' Une Fille de Regent , '' '' La
Beine Margot	PERSON	, '' '' Le
Chevalier de Maison Rouge	ORGANIZATION	, '' ``
Joseph Balsamo	PERSON	, '' and so on .

		Says Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	: '' Human nature , as
Plato	ORGANIZATION	long ago observed , has been coined in very small pieces ; and the sorting of these , to form a just estimate of character , involved so much balancing and counterbalancing that it ends in being perplexing without being any the more infallible .

		For
Dumas	PERSON	it has to be said that whenever he touches history -- in novels , plays , or studies -- he has the true historical instinct ; without either faculty or inclination for the drudgery of analysis he somehow arrives at a synthesis quite as convincing as any that can be reached by the most minute methods . '' ''

		The Three Musketeers , '' -- the loyal com - radeship of these seventeenth-century gallants , their reckless fighting , their impetuous love - making , which typified to the French public certain characteristics identified with
France	LOCATION	in her greatest days , -- jumped into instant popularity .

		Speaking of '' The Count of Monte Cristo , '' written in collaboration with
Maquet	PERSON	and possibly
Fiorentino	PERSON	, Blaze de Bury says : ''
Dumas	PERSON	in a way collaborated with everyone ... From an anecdote he made a story , from a story he made a romance , from a romance he made a drama ; and he never let an idea go until he had extracted from it everything that it could yield him .

		Admit , as the critics will have it , his collaboration , plagiarism , imita - tion : he possessed himself what no one could give him ; and this we know because we have seen what his assist - ants did when they were working on their own account and separately from him . ''

		The present biographer has gone carefully through the long list of
Dumas	PERSON	's writings , de - scribing plots and analyzing motives .

		It would be superfluous to follow him minutely through the list ; suffice it to say that the work is that of a scholar , and one who has breathed the at - mosphere of
Dumas	PERSON	for many years .

		As the vogue of the historical novel began and ended , so far as
France	LOCATION	is concerned , with the author of '' Les
Trois Mousquetaires	PERSON	, '' his biographer is justified in adding that the influence of
Dumas	PERSON	has probably been the greatest in the sphere of the drama .

		Sardou considered him the best all-round homme de theatre of his century . ''

		Never , '' wrote a friend , `` were good humor , cordiality , and sympathy more plainly stamped on any face than on that of
Dumas	PERSON	. ''

		A vagrant by nature ,
Dumas	PERSON	was always on the move , and his movements were as swift as his repartee .

		It is said that when he left
Pjiris	PERSON	for the last time , he brought with him all his worldly wealth in the shape of a single gold-piece , which he solemnly deposited on the mantel-piece of his room at Puys .

		One day , toward the close of his eventful career , his eye wandered to this coin , which had remained un -

		It was his last jest .

		On
December 5 , 1870	DATE	, the end came in an apoplectic seizure .

		* When the edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, prepared under the editorship of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	and Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, was published about ten years ago , it seemed as if editorial and critical skill had exhausted the possibilities of the case , and that the works of the author were at last brought together in a form that would remain definitive .

		But we are compelled to admit , after a care - ful examination , that the existence of the new ■ ''
Virginia	LOCATION	'' edition , edited by Professor
James A. Harrison	PERSON	, is fully justified by the new matter which it offers , as well as by its corrections in the text of the matter already familiar .

		While we can not say that it supersedes the earlier edi - tion -- nothing could well supersede the critical and biographical work of the former editors -- it does provide a supplement to that edition which students of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	will henceforth find in - < -LSB- i8pensable .

		A precis of the new edition , based upon the editor 's statement , will make clear the reasons for the judgment above expressed .

		Quoting Foe 's own words , ' ^ I am naturally anxious that what I have written should circulate as I wrote H , if it circulate at all , '' the editor tells us that he became convinced almost from the start of the necessity of extracting '' a new and abao - lately authentic text from the magazines , per - iodicals , and books of tales and poems which
Poe	PERSON	himself had edited or to which he had contributed . ''

		In the application of this pro- - oednre each one of the tales and poems has been made the snbject of a special study of its various '' states , '' with the result that we have in most instances a very different text from that published by
Griswold	PERSON	.

		In two or three cases only , the
Griswold	PERSON	version has been reproduced for the simple reason that the original publi - cation was absolutely not to be found .

		foundations of the new edition are supplied bj
Poe	PERSON	's own copy of the '' Broadway Journal '' marked by himself , his own copy of '' The Raven and Other Poems '' -LRB- 1845 -RRB- , with the poet 's mar - ginal corrections -LRB- amounting , in the case of '' The Raven '' alone , to no l ^ s than thirty - seven changes -RRB- , his own copy of the '' Tales '' -LRB- 1845 -RRB- with similar corrections , his own copy of `` Eureka , '' also annotated by the author , and the original files of the '' Southern Literary Messenger '' and other periodicals to which Foe contributed from time to time .

		The work thus presented as
Poe	PERSON	wished it to be read is arranged in strictly chronological order , making it possible to study the evolution of his style , and his growth from the crudity of his earlier writings to the almost absolute perfection of his best later work .

		In dealing with the '' Literati '' papers ,
Griswold	PERSON	's sub - stitution of his own work for that of Foe in no less than five cases is exposed .

		The '' Margin - alia '' now includes some forty pages of matter that
Griswold	PERSON	suppressed , and the papers on autography and secret writing are now for the first time reprinted in full .

		There are variooB appendices -LRB- for Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has aimed to give us a Foe encyclopsedia rather than a mere new edition -RRB- , among which we notice an examin - ation of the Poe-Chivers controversy which makes it clear that
Chivers	PERSON	was the plagiarist , several contemporary reviews of
Poe	PERSON	, some new matter found among the
Griswold	PERSON	manuscripts , and a complete bibliography of all of Poe'i known writings .

		Finally , we have all of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's correspondence that the editors could find , in - cluding many letters to the poet as well as those written by him .

		Something like two - thirds of the contents of this volume of corres - pondence consists of matter which is new even to the special students of the poet .

		- This statement of the general results ac - complished by the painstaking industry of the editor must now be supplemented by an account of the consecutive volumes of the new edition .

		The first of the seventeen volumes is occupied with a biography of the most searching and painstaking sort .

		The appendix to this volume gives us the autobiographical memorandum prepared for
Griswold	ORGANIZATION	,
Griswold	ORGANIZATION	's famous -LRB- or infamous -RRB- '' Lndwig '' article on the death of the poet , and five additional articles and essays by
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Willis	PERSON	, and others .

		Next in order come five volumes of the tales .

		This section has for an introduction the eloquent essay of Mr.
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	on ''
Poe	PERSON	's Place in Literature , '' prepared as an address at the 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	,
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	upon the occasion of the
Poe	ORGANIZATION	celebration three years ago .

		Here , as elsewhere throughout the edition , the vari - ants of the different printed texts are minutely recorded in a body of notes .

		The single vol - ume of the poems has an elaborate critical in - troduction by Professor
Charles W. Kent	PERSON	, of which the most striking feature is a parallel drawn between
Poe	PERSON	and
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, a parallel that grows upon the reader the more he thinks of it .

		The appendix to this volume includes several poems that have been attributed to
Poe	PERSON	, and reduces to an absurdity the charge of plagiarism made in behalf of
Chivers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The tales and poems are followed by six volumes of literary criticism , of which nearly four consist of matter now for the first time re - printed .

		This fact alone would furnish ample justification for the new edition , were it in any way needed .

		Some of the notices may seem almost as unimportant as the forgotten books that they embalm , but there can be no serious question of the importance of making accessi - ble the entire output of our first professional critic of high rank .

		The fourteenth volume con - tains essays and miscellaneous writings , about one-fourth of the matter being new .

		Here we find in full the articles on secret writing , also `` The Philosophy of Composition , '' `` The Ra - tionale of Verse , '' and `` The Poetic Principle . ''

		The fifteenth volume gives us `` The Literati of
New York City	LOCATION	'' and the first reprint of the '' Autography '' papers , facsimiles and all .

		The editing of the '' Literati '' has had the singular result of proving that five of the papers hitherto included in editions of
Poe	PERSON	were not written by
Poe	PERSON	at all , but were substituted by
Griswold	PERSON	for
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's original articles .

		This is a particularly interesting revelation , because in the case of
Thomas Dunn	PERSON	English it shows that much of the malice of the attack was
Griswold 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		A more cowardly and contemptible act is probably not to be found in all the annals of editing .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has now restored
Poe	PERSON	's articles to their proper places , and printed
Griswold	PERSON	's per - versions in an appendix .

		The sixteenth volume gives us the fifteen papers called `` Marginalia , '' exactly reprinted from the magazines in which they appeared .

		Then comes the `` Eureka '' in full , with the notes made by the author in his own copy , and which he intended to embody in a second edition .

		This volume closes with a Poe bibliography , followed by a general index to the fifteen volumes of the works .

		Last of all , we have in the seventeenth volume the Poe cor - respondence , which represents one of the chief services done for us by Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	.

		Although many of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's letters have found a place in his various biographies , it yet remains true that many others are now for the first time printed , and that the letters have never before been col - lected into a volume of their own .

		The value of this volume is greatly enhanced by its inclusion in many cases of both sides of the correspond - ence , and by the addition of many letters writ - ten about
Poe	PERSON	by his friends and others .

		It should be said in closing this account , that each volume of the seventeen has a frontispiece illus - tration , and that the entire set is presented in a handy form that makes its use a pleasure , ^ whether for consultation or continuous reading .

		Development and Evolution .

		* A fractious critic of Professor
J. M. Bald	PERSON	- win 's latest work , '' Development and
Evolu	PERSON	- tion , '' might head his review '' The Circular Reaction , '' borrowing a favorite term of the author 's .

		The patient reader finds himself again and again confronted by the same argu - ments and the same definitions , and in chapter viii .

		the author actually quotes portions '' from an earlier page '' of the same work , equivalent when added together to about six pages !

		Fur - thermore , we are favored with long extracts from the writings of several authors , express - ing again the views set forth in the book .

		In his preface , Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	explains and defends this procedure at some length , and says , what is certainly true , that repetition has its pedagogical justification .

		Putting aside this peculiarity of the work , it may be said at once that there is much in it to interest any intelligent reader .

		No attempt is made to adopt a '' popular '' style of writing , or to enliven the pages with poor jokes ; but the facts and arguments are clearly put for - ward in language not too technical to be un - derstood .

		Also , as might be expected from Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	, the book represents orig - inal thought of a high order , and not a rehash of other people 's notions .

		In view of the large amount of second-rate scientific literature in - tended for general reading , it is worth while to point out these distinctions .

		The central idea of the book is that of '' Or - • Developmkkt and Evolution .

		1902 -RSB- THE DIAL 279 ganic Selection , '' whereby those individuals -LRB- plants , animals , or men -RRB- survive which ac - commodate themselves to their environment .

		In the simplest form of Natural Selection , cer - tain individuals survive because best fitted for their surroundings ; while others , possessing inherent weaknesses or defects , die or fail to leave offspring .

		For example , a bird or a rep - tile or an insect may survive because its color is such as to make it inconspicuous .

		Its nat - ural enemies , ever on the lookout for food , fail to detect its presence , while they detect and devour individuals less fortunately colored .

		Suppose , however , that the creature has the power of changing its color to suit its sur - roandings , as has the chameleon .

		It escapes jast as well as if it had originally been of the necessary color .

		Suppose , again , that it has no chameleon-like power , but has intelligence , so that , being green , it hides amongst green leaves ; or being brown , amongst the rocks .

		Again it escapes destruction .

		Suppose that , instead of hiding , it learns to fight , and defeats its ene - mies .

		The result is again the same .

		In short , many creatures survive through a process of accommodation to their surroundings , -- and this is '' Organic Selection . ''

		It has been difficult for evolutionists to ac - count for the origin of instinct or physical pe - caliarities which , in a slightly developed form , would not be of any apparent value .

		How can natural selection preserve that which is merely prophetic of a coming utility ?

		The explana - tion lies partly in the fact that such characters may be correlated with others which are useful at the time , but also very largely in '' Organic Selection , '' which preserves individuals capable of adaptive modifications .

		To take a simple instance , the native intelligence of man , under the conditions of civilized society , would by no means secure survival .

		Even a genius , if brought up in isolation and totally uneducated , would be a very poor sort of human being .

		Man , however , has immense powers of adapta - tion , and is able to supplement his original endowment by a process of learning which gives him command of the greater part of the earth .

		However , this acquired learning , like every other acquired character , apparently can not be inherited , and the new-born child has to learn as did his parents .

		It has been suggested that this fact would put a stop to progress , because the means of survival would not be transmitted .

		This , however , is not at all the case , for in every instance the acquired characters are built upon congenital ones .

		The foundations , as it were .

		are transmitted ; and the best strnctnres are those built on solid foundations .

		Who has not seen acquired characters collapse because of the lack of hereditary power ?

		and who has not seen the effects of an evil inheritance ?

		Hence , so far from modification being an impediment to progress through selection , it is the very thing which renders such progress possible , because it gives value to that which would otherwise be valueless .

		It is the parable of the talents over again : only those who put what they have to good use , whereby it is increased , are judged fit .

		It will be apparent , also , that the congenital acquirements , which in adult life are over - shadowed by those acquired , must be of extreme importance at an early and critical stage .

		A slight tendency or ability , at the proper mo - ment , may be worth as much as the highest powers later on .

		It is like the small capital with which many a merchant begins business : a trifling thing in itself , but how significant when considered in relation to subsequent events I Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	certainly does a service in calling attention to these things , and at the same time to the immense importance of mind in the evolution of higher types .

		He shows how the power to learn is in many cases better than the ability , through instinct , to do as was done before .

		Suppose that we coxdd inherit the thoughts and customs of our ancestors , in a biological as well as in a social sense ; what would be the result ?

		The people of
America	LOCATION	, for one thing , would still be firm believers in monarchy and slavery ; they would still believe the world to be flat , and the sun to go around the earth .

		It is well , indeed , that every gen - eration has to learn afresh .

		Yet , with all this , each generation receives abundantly from its predecessors of the fruits of learning .

		Through books and speech we have the social transmis - sion of that which can not be inherited .

		Note , however , this distinction : we choose what we will receive from the past ; the lower types , governed by instinct , have to take what comes , without choice .

		Thus , through the power of the mind , progress becomes increasingly rapid , all sorts of conditions being successfully met .

		It does not seem to the present writer that '' Organic Selection '' is quite a happy term , or that it should be contrasted with '' Natural Selection . ''

		Ail these forms of selection are included in the
Natural Selection of Darwin	ORGANIZATION	, though the emphasis may have been placed on one special type .

		I should prefer , then , to use 280 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, the term
Natural Selection	ORGANIZATION	in a very broad sense , and to call the restricted `` Natural Selection '' of Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	'' Direct Se - lection , '' while Organic Selection might be known as '' Indirect Selection . ''

		There are so many interesting ideas in the book that any limited review must fail to do it justice .

		The '' Theory of Genetic Modes '' is worth a special article , and can not be well dis - cussed in a few lines .

		The chapter on '' Se - lective Thinking '' is an important one .

		It is shown that intelligent attention can only be given to ideas or facts which can in some way be connected with our platform of thought of the time being .

		Thus , the adult rejects ab - surdities which do not seem at all incongruous to the child .

		The evolution of thought in the life of the individual is thus comparable to the `` volution of a series of types : at the beginning , several alternatives may be possible , but the highly-developed type has to follow along the path it has chosen , with no great deviation therefrom .

		Hence it may be that the music of the spheres is inaudible to us , and a little child may understand things which are hidden from the adult .

		And after all , the great secret of human superiority lies in the fact that we begin life as children , with the power to choose be - tween good and evil .

		We have thus taken upon ourselves the functions of the Creator .

		`` Travelling , you know , is a van - ity , '' he declares , with

		Fishermen and farmers he enjoyed , and com - munion with his books he found infinitely better than idle talk .

		So feminine a sensibility is rarely found united with so masculine an intelligence .

		The former , however , is perhaps the more strongly marked . ''

		Taste , '' he was fond of saying , '' ia the feminine of genius '' ; and to taste he laid some modest claim , but none whatever to gen - ius .

		A humorous sense of the ironies and per - versities of this life , of the tendency of all things to pass over into their opposites , is man - ifest on every page of his letters .

		His virtues had more power to put him to shame than his frailties .

		With the
Concord	LOCATION	sage , he stood in considerable awe of his good qualities .

		Like old Donne he held that '' he who knows his virtue 's name and place , hath none . ''

		To
Tennyson	PERSON	, poor and as yet unknown to fame , he writes : '' I have heard you sometimes say that you were bound by the want of such and such a sum , and I tow to the Lord that I could not have a greater pleasure than transferring it to you on such occasions ; I should not dare to say such a thing to a small man , but you are not a small man assuredly , and even if you do not make use of my o # Fer , you will not be offended , but put it to the right account .

		It is very difficult to persuade peo - ple in this world that one can part with a bank-note without a pang .

		It is one of the most simple things I hare ever done to talk thus to you , I believe ; but here is an end , and be charitable to me . ''

		To his friends no one could be more loyal .

		He never knew when to cast off an old acquaint - ance -- or article of dress .

		The tall hat that he wore tilted on the back of his head , and seldom removed in the daytime , except when he wanted a red handkerchief from its interior , was bat - tered and shabby .

		His impatience of sham finds manifold forms of expression .

		Leaves and whole sec - tions be ruthlessly tore out of his books when he thought them mere padding .

		His library was made up chiefly of fragments of authors .

		Only in the case of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and a few others would he tolerate a writer 's opera omnia .

		And yet he so cheerfully endured the dreary length of `` Clarissa , '' and the long-windedness of his favorite
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, that we find him reading the former for the fifth time twenty years before his death , and the latter was for decades his vade mecum .

		His letters abound in references to what
Carlyle	PERSON	called his '' innocent far-niente life . ''

		To
Frederic Tennyson	PERSON	he writes : `` 1 live on in a Tery seedy way , reading occasionally in books which every one else has gone through at school : and what I do read is just in the same way as ladies work : to pass the time away .

		For little remains in my head .

		I dare say you think it very absurd that an idle man like me should poke about here in the country , when I might be in

		But idleness is a test of virtue .

		The greater the idleness the greater the merit -LRB- in being virtuous -RRB- . ''

		And when at rare intervals he so far forsook his * ' idle ease '' as to appear , with modest anony - mity , in print , he immediately felt somewhat ashamed , as be said , of having allowed his lei - sure to drive him into print when so many much more capable people kept silent .

		`` I have not the strong inward call , '' he declares , '' nor cruel-sweet pangs of parturition , that prove the birth of anything bigger than a mouse . ''

		The world may well be thankful for '' that very young - lady - like partiality to writing to those that I love . ''

		The only regret is that all his letters could not have been preserved .

		One feels tempted to say hard things of
John Allen	PERSON	and
James Spedding	PERSON	for their heedless destruc - tion or loss of the letters they received from the
Laird of Littlegrange	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Chelsea sage bet - ter appreciated those kindly human messages ; indeed , he complained that they came not often enough .

		It is difficult to write about these let - ters without transcribing whole pages of them , so happily do they picture the quiet life of the recluse .

		`` I believe , '' he writes , '' I love poetry almost as much as ever : but then I have been suffered to dose all these years in the enjoy - ment of old childish habits and sympathies , without being called on to more active and seri - ous duties of life .

		I have not put away childish things , though a man . ''

		Again , `` I read very little : and get very desultory : but when winter comes again mast take to some dull study to keep from suicide , 1 suppose .

		The river , the sea , etc. , serve to divert one now . ''

		To admir - ers of his matchless translations -- his '' impa - dencies , '' as he called them , referring to their wide departures from the original -- the fol - lowing is of interest : '' I suppose very few people have ever taken snch pains in translation as I have : though certainly not to be literal .

		But at all cost , a thing must live : with a transfusion of one 's own worse life if one ca n't retain the original 's better .

		Better a live sparrow than a stuffed eagle . ''

		His hearty dislike of the `` ambition of fine writing '' finds frequent expression . ''

		Boccaccio 's humor in his country people , friars , scolds , etc. , is capital : as well , of course , as the easy grace and tenderness of other parts .

		One thinks that no one who had well read him and
Don Quixote	PERSON	wonld ever write with a strain again , as is the curse of nearly all modern literature .

		I know that ■ easy writing is d d hard reading . '

		Of course the man must be a man of genius to take his ease : but if he be , let him take it .

		I suppose that snch as

Milton	PERSON	, and my Daddy -LSB-

		The following , written forty-one years ago , is still timely : `` We should give up something before it is forced from us .

		Once more , I say , would we were a little , peaceful , nnambitions , trading nation , like -- the Dutchl '' Best of all
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's letters are those to
Fanny Kemble	ORGANIZATION	, perhaps because they are to a woman whose sympathetic nature calls forth the writer 's most intimate self-revealings .

		Here , too , the play of fancy is most unrestrained .

		His odd stringing together of ideas , each one suggesting the following , is often amusing .

		For example , he thus closes one letter : '' Also I beg leave to say that nothing in
Mowbray	PERSON	's letter set me off writing t ^ gain to Mrs.
Eemble	PERSON	, except her address , which I knew not till he gave it to me , and I remain her very humble obedient servant , The Laird of Littlegrange -- of which I enclose a side view done by a Woodbridge artisan for his own amusement .

		So that Mrs.
Kemble	PERSON	may be made acquainted with the ' habi - tat ' of the flower -- which is about to make an omelette for its
Sunday	DATE	dinner . ''

		Again and again he begs her to spare his eyes 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, and not cross her letters , and especially not to cover her address -LRB- when she gives it -RRB- with cross-writing .

		He reiterates his entreaty that she shall not feel in the least obliged to answer his letters .

		The amiable quarrel over these matters , and the amusing criminations and recriminations regarding illegible penmanship , appear to have gone on to the end , each party to the friendly bickering having pet habits and whims that positively refuse to listen to dicta - tion -- although we once find the lady spelling out her letter on a typewriter in a desperate attempt at clearness .

		Of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's published prose , aside from his letters , the short preface to '' Polonius '' is the most characteristic .

		Its brief paragraphs are packed full of the writer 's quaintly shrewd reflections .

		Of death he says one first realizes that he must die about the time he becomes con - scious of being a fool .

		The earlier '' Eu - phranor , '' with its occasional suggestion of '' fine writing , '' of which the author afterward found it guilty , shows us
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	in some - thing nearer a studied pose than he elsewhere exhibits .

		Of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	as a poet these haphazard notes have said nothing , because he has thus been chiefly treated by others .

		That he was a master of that other harmony of prose , de - serves also to be emphasized .

		Perhaps the prime excellence of his style is its scorn of lit - erary finery .

		Never chasing after the one elu - sive best word , he yet never seems at a loss for a fitting expression ; and while his English is of the best , the reader feels that it is just such English as
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	would use in familiar conversation .

		His modest estimate of his own verse finds expression in a letter to
Bernard Barton	PERSON	. ''

		I am a man of taste , of whom there are hundreds born every year : only that less easy circumstances than mine at present are compel them to one calling : that calling perhaps a mechanical one , which overlies all their other , and naturally perhaps more energetic im - pulses .

		As to an occasional copy of verses , there are few men who have leisure to read , and are possessed of any music in their souls , who are not capable of versi - fying on some ten or twelve occasions during their nat - ural lives : at a proper conjunction of the stars .

		There is no harm in taking advantage of such occasions . ''

		One item regarding the ^ ' Rubaij at . ''

		The first stanza originally appeared thus : `` Awake !

		for morning in the bowl of night Has flung the stone that puts the stars to flight ; And lo !

		the hunter of the
East	LOCATION	has caught The Sultan 's turret in a noose of light . ''

		Some sapient critic censured this as too literal a rendering of the Persian , whereas , as Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	has pointed out , it is a render - ing of neither the Persian nor any other lan - guage .

		The admirable quatrain we owe purely to
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , as if to fall in with the joke and humor his critic , he twice altered the lines , how much to their ultimate detriment the reader may see by turning to the poem as it is now printed .

		That
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	is coming to his own will re - joice his admirers .

		His coming to it is largely because he lays no claim to , nor even seems in any way burdened with a consciousness of , his desert .

		But we are like the gods : to him who scorns our charities our arms fly open wide .

		MOUALITY AND THE RELIGIOUS lilFE .

		* The problem of presenting to a popular audience certain fundamental facts of ethics has been solved by Professor
Palmer	PERSON	, in his work entitled '' The Field of Ethics , '' in a manner that is novel , and at the same time interesting and successful .

		The most important terms in the vocabulary of the science are deBned , and its leading phenomena described by passing in review the affinities and differences be - tween a historical law and a law of morality , between the latter and the law of the state , between beauty and goodness of character , and between the religious and the moral life .

		The greatest amount of space is naturally devoted to this last topic .

		Every act , it is declared , may be regarded in a finite and an infinite way .

		In so far as it is performed in order to realize the best in human life , it is moral ; in so far as it is done for the sake of its infinite implications -- for the love of God -- it is religious .

		Actions are often performed with only the former end in view ; on the other hand , expe - rience shows that '' a good many persons who are sincerely religious are not quite responsive to the demands of the moral code . ''

		But the life in which the finite and infinite are thus separated is pro- nounced mutilated and unsatisfying .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 28S theoretical analysis can resolve into distinguishable elements .

		The comprehensive treatise of Professor
Ladd	PERSON	on `` The Philosophy of Conduct '' will appeal to a different audience from that for which Professor
Palmer	PERSON	wrote his lectures .

		It addresses itself to the specialist , and aims to make an original contribution to the theory of ethics .

		Professor
Ladd	PERSON	does not believe that morality can be exhaustively defined as an instrument of human happiness .

		He sees that
Hume	PERSON	is in error when he writes : '' Utility is the aole source of that high regard paid to justice , fidel - ity , honor , allegiance , and chastity . ''

		This plus , how - ever , he is entirely unable to analyze ; and so the nature of morality is left in the end as unintelligible as at the beginning .

		Thereupon , as invariably hap - pens in such cases , recourse is had to a theological explanation .

		The unique and mysterious emotion of obligation appears as something directly implanted by God , and conscience as a si > ecially created chan - nel for the communication of the Divine WilL It is probable that this explanation will not satisfy the majority of moralists .

		There is a sense in which not merely the moral life , but the entire content of consciousness , will be admitted to be an emanation from the life of God .

		Few authorities , however , will agree that anything is gained by explaining any one of its elements , as instinct , memory , or conscience , by means of the creative fiat of Om - nipotence .

		If such a view be correct , little positive help toward the solution of the fundamental prob - lems of ethics will be found in Professor
Ladd	PERSON	's treatise .

		Its main value lies in certain detailed de - scriptions which demonstrate the breadth and com - plexity of the moral experience and call attention to facts that have not infrequently been overlooked .

		The author 's position on the relation of religious belief to morality is not easy to characterize in a few words .

		That such belief may .

		in a high degree , strengthen and steady the will to do right , is hardly open to serious doubt .

		The question which the mor - alist is called upon to answer is , rather , whether the moral life is possible without a religious foundation .

		From the main doctrine of Professor
Ladd	PERSON	's book it ought to follow that the appeals of duty are ad - dressed to elements common to all men , whatever may be their thonghte about the supersensible world .

		This , in fact , is explicitly asserted to be the case .

		But the admissions made on one page of the book are almost immediately qualified on another , until the writer 's real opinion becomes finally an enigma .

		This outer obscurity would seem to be the sign of an inner conflict whose contending forces are no mere creatures of logic , but rather the represen - tatives of powerful ideals , partially , but only par - tially , conscious of their incompatibility .

		After an interval of several years , the English translation of Part III .

		of Professor
Wundt	PERSON	' g '' Ethics '' has followed the translations of Parts I. and II .

		These latter were reviewed in The Diai. , Vol .

		25 .

		pp. 300-301 -LRB-
Nov. 1	DATE	.

		1898 -RRB- .

		Of most in - terest in the new volume is the author 's definition of morality .

		Right action , he holds , is action con - ducive to welfare ; the welfare , however , is not that of any individual , but that of the community .

		The community is here thought of , not as a mere name for certain persons living in social relations , -- it is an entity , composed indeed of such persons , but more permanent than they , and independent of any one of them as the body is independent of any one of its constituent cells .

		The ultimate grounds for Professor Wundt 's position can be found only by connecting his ethical inquiries with the results of hu speculations in metaphysics .

		Bat however bolstered up , the position remains decidedly paradoxical ; and in the sixteen years that have intervened since ita publication in the German edition of the '' Ethiea '' it seems to have obtained few adherents .

		ProfeMor
Wundt	ORGANIZATION	's view of the relation between religion and morality differs considerably from those above re - viewed .

		In Volume I. he shows in an interesting way that the majority of the forms of contemporary social life owe their origin to the religious ceremo - nies of our primitive ancestors .

		On the other hand , the objects of religious veneration are held to have had their source in the moral ideal itself . ''

		That which man early feels to be the content of his moral consciousness , his imagination represents as a world objective and yet permanently related to himself . ''

		The destruction of this world by eritieism is inerit - able , but obviously its annihilation can not destroy the forces that gave it birth .

		Not wholly devoid of religion , however , will be the morality of the future .

		The most important element of the religious con - sciousness is its outlook upon infinity .

		But the moral ideal presents before the race an endless task , the reduction of all individual wills to one great har - monious system .

		As this implication of right doing becomes increasingly clearer the religious attitude , thus defined , will become more and more habitual .

		Professor
Schuyler	PERSON	's '' Systems of Ethics '' is an introductory work dealing with the subject in ita theoretical , practical , and historical aspects .

		The influence of Sidgwick and
Janet	PERSON	seems to be most pervasive .

		In its comprehensiveness and catholicity the work repeats the note of the representative mod - ern treatises ; but its usefulness is marred by the author 's failure to formulate dearly the problems of his science and to distinguish properly between the various answers that have been given to them .

		The account of the ethical theories and the moral ideas of the Hebrews recently written by Professor
Lazarus	PERSON	, of
Berlin	LOCATION	, has now been made in part ac - cessible to English and American readers through the excellent translation of Miss
Henrietta Szold	PERSON	.

		Professor
Lazarus	PERSON	' work is unequal in value .

		The attempt to prove that the Hebrew writers had for - mulated the fundamental principles of the Kantian ethics must be pronounced unsuccessful .

		It is true that passages in the Old Testament can be cited which logically imply one or two -- but not more -- of these principles .

		But from this fact , as is shown by the history of Christian ethics , we can make no immediate inference to the theories actually held by 284 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	those who acknowledged its authority ; and other data are not supplied us .

		Indeed , the conclusion is almost irresistible , even on Professor
Lazarus	PERSON	' own showing , that the writers who gave to the world the Old Testament and the
Talmud	LOCATION	were innocent of any ethical theory whatever .

		On the other hand , the descriptions given of the moral ideals of the Hebrews is admirable .

		The most impressive fea - ture presented to the reader is the attitude taken toward the foreigner living in the land .

		The spirit in which he was treated , so far as law and Custom can regulate such matters , is faithfully exhibited in the words of the Levitical code : '' The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as a home - born among you , and thou shalt love him as thyself . ''

		Professor
Lazarus	PERSON	is entirely justified in asserting that in this respect Judaism '' occupies the most honorable place in ancient times . ''

		Professor
Ritchie	PERSON	's '' Studies in Political and Social Ethics '' deals with a number of problems that concern , in the main , the application of ethical theories to the conduct of social life .

		In a series of eight essays are discussed , among other topics , the principles of state interference with individual liberty , the truth of the dogma of the equality of human rights , the casuistry of war , the help to be gained from biology in the solution of social prob - lems , and the possibility of a moral life without religious belief .

		It will be seen that the subjects are much the same as those treated with pretentious ignorance in certain recent well-known books .

		It is to be hoped that the popularity they have succeeded in achieving will fall to the share of this modest vol - ume .

		For Professor
Ritchie	PERSON	knows whereof he speaks , and has things to say of which no student of social problems can afford to be ignorant .

		Prob - ably no elementary treatment of the subjects dis - cussed , comprehended within the covers of asingle book , could he recommended with equal confidence to the general reader .

		Clever literary parodies and burlesques .

		Among the many books of
Bret Harte	PERSON	not one is ^ lore strictly a source of perennial delight than the '' Condensed Novels '' that he wrote , following an example set by
Thackeray	PERSON	, early in his career .

		During the last years of his life , he set to working the vein once more , and we now have a posthumous second series of these happy burlesques -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which some of the literary fashions of a later day are effectually parodied .

		The names of his recent victims will readily be inferred from such titles as `` Rupert the Resembler , '' `` Golly and the Christian , '' ``
Dan	PERSON	' l Borem , '' and `` Stories Three . ''

		The first of these titles belongs to a production which is aloaost as good as the original , for
Bret Harte	PERSON	was some - thing of a story-writer himself , and was not likely to be content with parody pure and simple .

Dan	PERSON	' l with that exquisitely dry , though somewhat protracted humor which at once thrilled and bored bis acquaintances . ''

		Enjoyable as these `` Condensed Novels '' are made by their combination of story-telling with rollicking burlesque , it must be admitted that as a parodist strictly speaking , Mr.
Owen Seaman	PERSON	exhibits a finer art .

		His volume of '' Borrowed Plumes '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is not only fun , it is also delicate literary criticism .

		More than a score of the popular writers of the day are used as targets for the deadly arrows of his wit , and his aim is always true .

		Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's pseudo-archaism , for example , is thus deftly imi - tated : '' But for relief of the pent roads there waa devised a hollow mine-way , auch as coneys affect ; and engines , fitted thereto , to draw men through the midriff of earth , betwixt its crust and fiery omphalode .

		And it was named Le Tube k Deux Deniers ; for , fared they never so far , serf or margrave , dif - ference of price or person was there none . ''

		Here is Mr.

		Unspoiled of admiration , envy-proof .

Parson Watson	PERSON	: '' Great Muse !

		and can it be this godless isle Breeds any so impervious of pelt That they confound my chaste and

		Bat his determination was finally made daring the sam - mer after gradaation , and he entered the Bassey Institation -- virtually the agricnltural school of
Harvard	LOCATION	-- the following aatamn , only to leave it for the office of Mr.
Frederick Law Olmstead	PERSON	the next
April	DATE	.

		Here his life was varied hy study and work of various kinds , especially in the
Arnold Arboretum	LOCATION	, and by extended travel and observation in
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In
1886	DATE	he opened his own office in
Boston	LOCATION	, at a time when his profession was so little understood that he debated for a time whether he should call himself a landscape gardener or a landscape architect .

		The professional connota - tion of the latter phrase iueared its selection , and he soon secured a valuable clientage .

		Intimately con - cerned in the various steps which have been taken to give
Boston	LOCATION	so many beautiful glimpses into nature , he was made a member of the Olmstead firm early in
1893	DATE	.

		Never very strong , but with excellent gen - eral health , he saccambed to an attack of cerebro - spinal meningitis , then epidemic .

		on
March 24 , 1897	DATE	, leaving a widow and several children , and a large circle of devoted friends .

		The book which tells the simple and faithful story of this well-spent life is enriched with extracts from his jonrnals , letters , and public papers , and is not the least beaatifol of the many testimonials , all making for loveliness in life , which his profession has secured for his memory .

		It would almost seem as though two out of every three books on psycho - logical topics contributed more to the confusion than to the illumination of the prob - lems of mind .

		The one type of effort , represented in the present instance by Mr.
H. Jamyn Brooks	PERSON	's `` The Elements of Mind , being an Examination into the Nature of the
First Division	ORGANIZATION	of the Ele - mentary Substances of Life '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		suggests an author of moderate ability , over-impressed with the sense of his own originality , not conversant with or appreciative of the real status of the prob - lems which he boldly attacks , yet capable of holding and setting forth with some acumen an elaborate and painfully wrought argument .

		The other type , represented by Mr.
Albert B. Olston	PERSON	in `` Mind Power and Privileges '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		is the result of failure to appreciate in any clear-cut fashion the real gist or spirit of scientific investigation , and a consequent obf uscation of a popular topic -- the relation of the conscious to the sub-conscious activi - ties , and the possible utilization of the latter in the treatment of disease .

		The latter form of human document is now so widespread among us as to make relevant the query , whether and why this is a truly American form of intellectual failing .

		Both volumes reflect the danger of word-intoxication -- a sort of transformed and modernised type of schol - asticism in which superficiality takes the place of over-erudition , and boldness of venture of a tradi - tion-bound narrowness of outlook .

		When the can - didate for the post of psychological expounder to the public has profoundly realized the difference between explanations that really explain and those that go through a mimic performance of this pro- cess , clever enough to deceive the casual onlooker , he has gone a long way toward rendering his ser - vices of real value .

		Neither of the present authors has made sufficient progress along this straight and narrow path .

		The volumes are not wholly bad -LRB- few books are -RRB- , and that of Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	shows evidences of some grasp ; yet both suggest quite unmistakably the need of a psychological adviser to some of oar prominent publishers .

		Stuief 'M Mmry Considering the enormous amount of ^ • 9imi writing done by
Robert Southey	PERSON	, it '' ^ is not as astonishing as it might otherwise seem that a manuscript from his busy pen should remain nnpublisbed until now .

		But the '' Journal of a Tour to the Netherlands , '' just issued from the * ' limited edition '' department of Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin db Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has remarkable interest for a publication so long deferred .

		• ' A few weeks after the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, ''
Southey	PERSON	himself ex - plains , * ' my brother
Henry	PERSON	, who was just married , asked me to join him in a bridal excursion which he was about to make with his wife 's mother and sister .

		... They proposed to go by the way of
Ostend	LOCATION	to
Brussels	LOCATION	, visit the field of battle , ... and take
Antwerp	LOCATION	on their return .

		Tempted by this pro- posal ... and being moreover in some degree bound to celebrate the greatest victory in British history , I persuaded myself that if any person had a valid cause or pretext for visiting the field of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, it was the Poet Laureate . ''

		It can not be said that much came out of the journey in the way of poetry , but this simple and straightforward volume of prose is a worthy memorial of an occa - sion worth remembering .

		The manuscript remained in the hands of the
Southey	PERSON	family , after the poet 's death , until
1864	DATE	.

		when it was bought by a well - known antiquarian , and it is only now that it has come into a publisher 's hands .

		The resulting book is beautifully printed in the general style of

		To correct the errors and misstate - ments of many historical writers , and to set down correcUy and pre - serve unstained the truth of history , is the aim of a monograph entitled '' Colonel
John Gunby	PERSON	of the
Maryland	LOCATION	Line '' -LRB-
Robert Clarke Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- written by Mr.
A. A. Gunby	PERSON	of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, presumably a descendant of the snbjeet of his sketch .

		Colonel 286 THE DIAL LNov .

		1 ,
Gunby	PERSON	was an eminent officer in the war of the Revolution , whose services in the cause of Amer - ican liberty were unstinted , and whose worth as a patriot and a soldier has always been conceded .

		But the accidents of the critical battle of
Hobkirk	ORGANIZATION	's Hill , as set forth in the recitals and reports of General
Nathaniel Greene	PERSON	, have given rise to the aspersion that
Colonel Gunby	ORGANIZATION	's misconduct on that field , and the failure of his
Maryland	LOCATION	soldiers to sustain their previously fine reputation as fighters , caused the loss of that battle by the Americans .

		This version of the engagement has been perpet - uated by
Bancroft	LOCATION	, Senator Lodge , and Professor
Fiske	PERSON	, in their histories .

		But Mr.
Gunby	PERSON	brings against these historians the contrary evidence gath - ered by
Moultrie	LOCATION	, Colonel
Henry Lee	PERSON	, Judge
William Johnson	PERSON	, and Judge
Marshall	PERSON	, whose conclusions are in favor of the conduct of both Colonel
Gunby	PERSON	and his men , as gallant , skilful , and heroic .

		One unfor - tunate phase of this controversy is that all the critics of
Gunby	PERSON	are
Northern	ORGANIZATION	writers , and all of his champions are of the South .

		But the writer of this book certainly builds up a strong case in favor of both
Gunby	PERSON	and his soldiers , and he does this without bitterness or even harshness toward General
Greene	PERSON	, the author of the aspersions on
Gunby	PERSON	.

		The monograph ably illustrates a most interesting and crucial hour in the history of the Revolutionary War .

		The high character of the author 's patriotism is evidenced by his exaltation of the stage of action on which
Gunby	PERSON	appeared as '' the loftiest in the annals of the world . ''

		He seeks to illustrate '' the true significance of the War of Independence , '' and he correctly characterizes it as a battle '' for the recognition of the rights of man to self-government '' ; for such , in its last analysis , was the Revolutionary struggle .

		The good old word `` confession '' is certainly open to the charge of loss of seriousness in some of its recent manifestations .

		As used in Mr.
Phipson	PERSON	's '' Con - fessions of a Violinist '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , for example , the word has very little of the esoteric cast .

		The anecdotes of travel , family history , and concerts , which it is made to cover , -- one of them relating the discovery of a trap-door on a concert platform just in time to save the writer from precipitation , -- are thoroughly light-hearted ; while the comments on great violinists and the bits of imaginative story - telling which make up the rest of the little volume are neither personal nor penitential .

		The book might well have been called `` Apropos of the Vio - lin , '' since references to that instrument form the only thread of connection between these diverse subjects .

		Perhaps , however , the verdict should be '' Confessions in the second degree , '' since some grounds for repentance are discoverable in the spirit of the book , which is sub-conscious , rather than in the matter , which is prepense .

		An exquisite exam - ple of this spirit is the author 's reference to himself , quoted from a friend : '' / have just heard
Kvhdik	PERSON	, Con/estiom , muncal and olherwite .

		the new violinist , and I have often heard
Joachim	PERSON	; but many years ago there used to be an amateur , a Dr.
Phipson	PERSON	, who lived at
Putney	LOCATION	, who was better than either of them ! ''

		The italics are in the book .

		But , cavilling aside , the chapters on
Rameau	ORGANIZATION	,
Auber	PERSON	,
Wieniawski	PERSON	, Artot , and others , though not developed enough to be very valuable , are interesting , and give some matter that is new .

		And one of the stories , `` The ` Cello Player of Swartzfeld , '' is really delightful .

		Professor
Reinsch	PERSON	's work on `` Colo - Phase , of colonial ^ j ^ j Government '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- may disappoint those who depend upon the title alone as a promise of its contents .

		It is a collection of essays on phases of colonial expansion , and as such , lucid and entertaining , rather than a thorough and systematic treatment of the entire mat - ter involved .

		One section is devoted to the methods and motives of colonization ; and among the latter far too much credit is given to religious missionary zeal .

		This impression would be still stronger if the colonizations of ancient times were included in the survey .

		But even in modern times , more credit is due to commercial interest , governmental neces - sities , and the pressure for subsistence .

		Another section deals with certain forms of colonial govern - ment , containing a particularly interesting chapter on `` Spheres of Influence , '' which shows the author 's full understanding of modern world-politics , -- a chapter well worth reading by anyone interested in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	question .

		Part Three , though only a partial outline of present colonial administrative organizations , throws light on some of the troublous questions that now confront the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Those who undertake to change over-night the tra - ditions and customs and institutions of alien peoples might profitably read here the long list of failures in the attempt to '' make over '' oriental races .

		Merely by relating the lessons learned by the French and English in the far East at such a cost of blood and treasure .

		Professor
Reinsch	PERSON	has justified the publication of his book .

		There are typographical errors not a few ; and fault may be found with the space given to bibliography -- 40 pages in 386 -- in a popular work .

		In the list of great colonial governors , page 249 , the name of Sir
George Grey	PERSON	is missing .

		The constitution of the Judicial Com - mittee of the
Privy Council	ORGANIZATION	is criticized , pp. 360 -
51	DATE	, because it does not contain a member learned in Hindu law ; whereas in fact at least one of the members of this committee has always been a man of considerable legal and judicial experience in
India	LOCATION	.

		In his volume entitled '' The English Chronicle Play '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Pro- fessor
Felix E. Schelling	PERSON	, of the Uni - versity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, presents a study of the popular historical literature of the time of
Eliza	LOCATION	- beth .

		The dramatic being the most potent form of literary expression in that favored age , the
Chron	LOCATION	- icle Play was the crown of a deeply-rooted interest A study 0 / the English Chronicle Play ,
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 287 in luBtorie tradition .

		It `` extreme popularity dating the sixteenth century is ghown by Professor
Schell	PERSON	- ing 's list of over three hundred separat `` dramas on English historical subjects .

		They began with the tide of patriotism which united all
England	LOCATION	to re - pel the threatened inr & sion by
Spain	LOCATION	; they flour - ished famously under
Elizabeth	PERSON	, and lost their nar tional character under the un-English monarch
James I. With	PERSON	little of the learning of the schools upon it , and less of the exotic culture of
Italy	LOCATION	, the Chronicle Play was but slightly related to other varieties of the drama , while it was very closely afiUiated to the wealth of historical literature , in verse and prose , that was springing up about it .

		Its importance is realized when we note that over a third of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays are in this form , and that nowhere else is he seen to be so fully and so logically the product of his age .

		In
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's trilogy of Henry I `` V. and V. , the main stock of the Chronicle Play reached its height ; later , it passed beyond local and national limitations and strayed into regions of folk-lore and pseudo-history , becom - ing in '' Lear '' and '' Macbeth '' a world-drama of universal appeal .

		Finally , the romantic drama led the historical drama away from English topics to those of strange countries in which the fancy might wander and the playwright feel himself nntram - meled by the narrowing claims of consistency .

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	has done an important and original service in eliminating from the mingled elements of the English drama as a whole the his - tory of one particular type , which has been rather slighted by previous writers in order to give in more detail the Italian influences and the classical move - ment of the period .

		When the Reverend
Edward Griffin Porter	PERSON	, of
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, was gathering materials for a history of that town , to be read at the
Centennial Celebra	LOCATION	- tion of its famous Revolutionary battle , he entered into correepondence with the
Duke of Northumber	ORGANIZATION	- land , as a result of which he was invited to visit
Alnwick Castle	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		While a guest there , a certain alcove and shelf were pointed out to him ; after glancing over numerous books , he espied , in an ob - scure corner , what proved to be a tin box covered thickly with dust , and tied with a frayed blue rib - bon .

		In answer to inquiry , the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's librarian told him that the box contained letters , but he never remembered to have seen it opened .

		It was dusted and opened forthwith , disclosing a budget of faded and yellow letters , the veritable ones that
Earl Percy	PERSON	had written to his father , beginning at the moment of his landing in
Boston	LOCATION	, and ending at the time of his return to
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Porter	PERSON	had the satisfaction , with the permission of his host , of spending that day and the two succeeding ones copying these letters . ''

		The letters thus discovered , and others taken from the Reports of the
Royal Commission of Historical Manuscripts	ORGANIZATION	, or from the collections of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, have been
AUa ^ WarleUen	ORGANIZATION	.

		edited by Mr.
Charles Knowlee Bolton	PERSON	, and are now published in an attractive little book of eighty-eight pages , under the caption , '' Letters of
Hngh Earl Percy	PERSON	from
Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, 1774-1776 '' -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	:
Charles E. Goodspeed	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Together , they make a valuable addition to Revolutionary War literature .

		The several letters which tell of the re - treat from
Lexington	LOCATION	and of the battle of Banker Hill are the most interesting , perhaps , although nearly every one contains some item of interest or value .

		Ththei ^ ^ < * phase of American history has f !

		* ■ ■ ■ < ■ `` ever received more fascinating treat - ttafUwttmmt .

		ment than that to which
Francis Parkman	PERSON	devoted the best energies of his life .

		For reading at once instructive and delightful , it would be difficult to find anything better than the series of masterly volumes which describe the epic effort of
France	LOCATION	to gain and maintain a foothold in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		They have nearly every sort of his - torical interest , from the romantic to the philo - sophical , and no one who has read them regrets the time spent in their company .

		But they number twelve large volumes , and life is short .

		To provide the reader of scant leisure with some notion or foretaste of this wealth of picturesque material .

		Dr.
Pelham Exlgar	PERSON	has arranged the essentials of the whole history in a single volume which he calls `` The Struggle for a Continent '' -LRB- Little -RRB- .

		The work is a continuous history , in
Parkman	LOCATION	's own words -LRB- except for a few connecting links marked by in - clusion in brackets -RRB- , of the history of
New France	LOCATION	from the Huguenots in
Florida	LOCATION	to the fall of
Quebec	LOCATION	and the defeat of
Pontiac	LOCATION	It gives us the beet of Parkman in a series of about seventy-five short chapters , well furnished with portraits , maps , and other illustrative materiaL It is a most praise - worthy performance , and comes near to justifying the publishers ' claim that '' no book on American history has ever been published containing as much instruction and entertainment '' Especially for the school library is this volume indispensable , and it is within the reach of the smallest of such collections .

		SiMttrff lie Setting down in due order the pro-
Aiu	ORGANIZATION	amd Cr ^ flM gresmre steps taken in a most mod - '' • '' ■ ' ™ ' em industrial movement , Mr.
Oscar Lovell Triggs	PERSON	is both historian and sociologist in the handsome book entitled '' Chapters in the History of the Arts and
Crafte Movement	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		pub - lished by the
Bohemia Guild of the Industrial Art League of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the historical spirit Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	follows the trend of thought which , starting from
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Ruskin	PERSON	, reached practical and theoretical exposition in the person of
William Mor	PERSON	- ris , and is now working oat through Mr.
Ashbee	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	and the
Rockwood	LOCATION	shops in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Here the treatment is rather obvious , and little originality is to be looked for .

		But in the last of the chapters Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	does say something new , when he comments on '' The Development of Industrial Consciousness , '' and the one fault to be 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, found is the failure to take time and space to work the theme out fully and logically .

		Briefly stated , it is held that industrialism is passing through steps closely analogous to those that have attended the evolution of society in the political sense .

		Not long ago in a condition of industrial savagery , in which every man 's hand was against his neighbor and un - restricted competition was the only accepted law , human society on the industrial side seems passing into a condition of feudalism , and mankind may yet see a general working out of
Thomas Jeffer	PERSON	- son 's dictum in effect , -- '' Who controls a man 's subsistence , controls the man . ''

		But as feudalism led to constitutional monarchy and it in turn to dem - ocracy , so a similiar advance toward individual free - dom may be looked forward to in industrial life .

		Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	does not develop the idea that the in - creased tension and speed of modern life may ac - complish in decades what used to be the work of centuries ; but neither does he work out his central thought fully at any point , though it abundantly deserves a volume of its own .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
J. Potter Briscoe	PERSON	has made a collection of ''
Tudor	PERSON	and
Stuart Love Sougs	PERSON	, '' and the volume -LRB- one of the prettiest of the season -RRB- is published by Messrs. # .


P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selections begin with
Wyatt	PERSON	and
Surrey	LOCATION	, and run down well into the eighteenth century .

		Nearly fourscore poets are represented , mostly by one or two examples .


Herrick	PERSON	, with four lyrics , occupies a place by himself .

		Many of the old favorites are here , and many other songs less familiar to the average reader . ''

		The Works of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	'' and '' The Poetical Works of
Percy Bysshe Shelley	PERSON	'' are two new volumes in the series of thin paper editions imported by the Messrs.
Soribner	PERSON	.

		The precept of mullum in parvo is not often as well illustrated as in these dainty and com - panionable volumes .

		The
Bacon	PERSON	, in particular , is a treasure , including as it does all of the prose that any one but a specialist cares to read .

		From the same source we have , in the ''
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	Series , '' a two-volume reprint of Irving 's '' Sketch Book , '' also most attractive and profitable .

		Professor
Benjamin Terry	PERSON	has written , and Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	,
Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published , `` A History of
England	LOCATION	from the
Earliest Times	ORGANIZATION	to the Death of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	. ''

		It is a bulky volume of no less than eleven hundred pages , and the narrative is both easy and ani - mated .

		The work is comparable in size with the single volume histories of
Green	ORGANIZATION	and
Gardiner	PERSON	, and is well adapted for teaching purposes .

		We consider its gen - erous dimensions an advantage for that use , especially in high schools , for the average student , no matter how much he is urged , will rely chiefly upon the text that is in his own possession .

		This being the case , the more material offered him the better , and there is certainly no lack of material in Professor
Terry	PERSON	's volume .

		Con - stitutional and social developments occupy a large space in this work , which thus represents the best modern opinion in the teaching of the subject .

		It is the work of several hands , among the authors being Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	, Mr.
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	, and Mr.
Frederick Schwatka	PERSON	. ''

		A Book of Old English Ballads , '' edited by Mr.

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	import the fourth edition of
Baedeker	PERSON	's ''
Southern France	LOCATION	, '' which includes also the island of
Corsica	LOCATION	as well as
Geneva	LOCATION	and its neighbor - hood .

		There are no other such guide-books as these , as every traveller knows , and not the least of their merits is found in the frequency with which they are brought down to date by conscientious revisions .

		We noticed a few months ago the English-German section of the new edition of
Grieb	PERSON	's Dictionary , as pub - lished by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		The German-English section of the work is now at hand , a volume of twelve hundred pages of three columns each .

		Dr.
Arnold Schroer	PERSON	is the editor of this enlarged form of a work that has long been favorably known .

		In his very interesting preface , the editor discusses the underlying principles npon which the dictionary is based , and points out the difficulties that
spring	DATE	from the lack of a generally accepted standard of German pronunciation .

		Inciden - tally , he says a good word for the pronunciation cur - rent in
Berlin	LOCATION	, and for the language as spoken on the German stage .

		To the ''
Windsor	LOCATION	'' edition of the novels of
William Harrison Ainsworth	PERSON	, published by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	, there have been added two volumes of `` The Miser 's Daughter , '' two of ''
Crichton	PERSON	, '' and one of `` The Spend - thrift . ''

		These five new volumes complete the set of twenty , and bring the entire work of this good old - fashioned novelist once more within the easy reach of the public .

		Three more preprints from the '' Decennial Publica - tions of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	'' are at hand .

		They are , respectively , '' On Amorphous Sulphur , '' by Messrs.
Alexander Smith	PERSON	and
Willis B. Holmes	PERSON	; `` the Pro- consulate of
Julius Agricola	PERSON	, '' by Mr.

Alexander Mackenzie	PERSON	's `` Voyages from
Montreal	LOCATION	through the Continent of
North America	LOCATION	to the Frozen and
Pacific Oceans	LOCATION	in
1789	DATE	and
1793	DATE	. ''

		This work , which includes '' A General History of the Fur Trade from
Canada	LOCATION	to the North - West , '' is one of the classics of early American exploration , and its reissue in the present convenient form is a real boon . ''

		Little Masterpieces of Science , '' edited by Mr.
George	PERSON	lies , is a series of six small volumes just pub - lished by Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The titles of the several volumes are as follows : `` Mind , '' `` Explor - ers , '' `` The Naturalist , '' `` Skies and
Earth	LOCATION	, '' `` Health and Healing , '' and '' Invention and Discovery . ''

		Each volume contains eight or ten papers , often condensed from larger works , and mostly written by men of high aothority .

		The two substantial volumes of Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's '' History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Cen - tury '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- reappear in a third edition of this great work .

		The author has corrected the work in some respects , but admits that he has not given it the thor - oughgoing revision that he could have wished . ''

		I have discovered , '' he says , '' that it was written with an au - dacity or light heartedness which I no longer possess .

		I made blunders and I gave estimates of various books , corrections of which might be suggested by later read - ing and reflection .

		To make the book fully satisfactory even to myself would require the rewriting of a consid - erable part .

		But , in the first place , I am not sure that I should not spoil instead of improving ; and , in the second place , I am now quite unequal to a task which would demand much time and labor . ''

		`` English History Told by English Poets '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is a reader for school use , compiled by Miss
Katharine Lee Bates	PERSON	and Mrs.
Katharine Coman	PERSON	.

		It is quite as important to study the history of
England	LOCATION	in its noblest literature as it is to delve in its dusty chronicles , and we welcome this book as a reaction against the tendency which seeks to make original in - vestigators of our boys and girls of tender age .

		Here are some four hundred pages of good poetry , chrono - logically arranged , and supplied with what few notes 290 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, are needful .

		Nearly a fourth of the matter comes from the chronicle plays of
Shakespeare ; Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	is also largely drawn upon .

		These dramatic excerpts , with a plentiful support of lyrics and ballads , provide the young student of history with an adjunct to his work that can not fail to prove helpful and inspiring .

		UREEFER MENTION 338 NOTES .

		338 LIST OF N `` EW BOOKS 339 A NOBLE ENTERPRISE .

		We read occasionally of some weary million - aire , oppressed by the responsibilities of his wealth , whose chief desire is to play the park of the good steward , but whose imagination is painfully barren of ideas .

		He wishes to be helpful to his own and the succeeding genera - tions , he occupies an ethically sound position in regarding his possessions as held in trust for the public , but he can think of nothing less hackneyed than the endowment of a school , a lilH * ary , or a hospital .

		These are excellent purposes , every one of them , and such founda - tions can hardly be multiplied in excess of the public need , but they are far from exhausting the possibilities of philanthropic endeavor .

		The man who devises a new outlet for philanthropy becomes a public benefactor in a double sense , for , while making his contribution to humanity , be at the same time enlarges the horizon of his class and discloses new aspects of human help - fulness .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's recent activities have given some notion of the wide range of the good that may be wrought by a mind that has some fertility of suggestion , and the brilliant conception of the late
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	may almost be said to have projected a new idea into the philanthropic field .

		New ideas of this sort , or ideas that hav '' even the touch of novelty , are not so common that we can afford to pass by the most modest of them .

		The subject of the present article is an idea of Mr.
Edwin Ginn	PERSON	, the well-known publisher of educational books , an idea which is perhaps as nearly novel as we have any right to expect , and to which its sponsor proposes to give practical effect as far as may be done by the application of a considerable share of both his time and his fortune .

		The idea is that of promoting an extensive educational propaganda in the interests of the world 's peace , of arousing in the consciousness of the serious-minded por - tion of the public some sense of the enormous folly of national armaments and of the war - fare which they necessarily tend to provoke . ''

		Deeply impressed , ' '' says Mr.
Ginn	PERSON	, '' by onr obligations as Americans at this juncture in onr history , I have felt that the most effec - tive influence against the military spirit would 816 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, be the wide circulation among our people of the best international books , condemning the methods of force and inculcating the methods of reason in the settlement of all the rivalries and differences between nations . ''

		What Mr.
Ginn	PERSON	proposes is , in brief , the organization of a society under some such name as '' The
International Union	ORGANIZATION	, '' having for its purpose the promotion of the cause of peace and international disarmament .

		As a first step toward such an organization , he has enlisted the services of that zealous worker in many good causes , Mr.
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	, under whose editorial supervision a series of publications will be undertaken .

		The literature of the peace movement is already considerable , but much good work may be done by making this liter - ature more generally accessible .

		The initial publication of the series is a translation of the late
Jean de Bloch	PERSON	's epoch-making work on '' The Future of War '' -- not the complete work in its formidable array of volumes , but the single-volume summary of the whole .

		This book is now offered to the public at the price of
fifty cents	MONEY	a copy , which is about the cost of production , and it is expected that funds will be forthcoming for its free circulation among those to whom even this moderate price may prove an obstacle .

		The next publication will be a volume containing the three great peace ora - tions of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	-- '' The True Grand - eur of Nations , '' `` The War System of Nations , '' and `` The Duel between
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		Among other peace classics that may soon see the light in popular form are
Penn	LOCATION	's '' Plan for the Peace of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' and
Kant	PERSON	's `` Eternal Peace . ''

		We would suggest on our own account as particularly suitable for this purpose a vol - ume of selections from the writings of
John Ruskin	PERSON	and a cheap English edition of
Frau von Suttner	PERSON	's famous novel , '' Die Waffen Nieder . ''

		This series of publications may be counted upon to exert a widely beneficient in - fluence , and no other missionary enterprise can be half as important as that of bringing the light of such books into the dark places of the world of statecraft .

		Mr.
Mead	PERSON	's prospectus of the undertaking is introduced by the following eloquent appeal : '' The experiences of
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	during the last five years have been such as to force home in all sober and thoughtful circles the inquiry how really desirable international ends may be and ought to be achieved .

		The
Hague Convention and Tribunal	ORGANIZATION	, es - tablished in this very time , are a beacon to the nations .

		Every good citizen of every land is called upon to reen - force the sentiment which called them into being , and to hasten the time when the
International Tribunal	ORGANIZATION	shall fulfill for a united world the office which our
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	has for a century so beneficently fulfilled for the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Is it not the duty of our country to be the leader of the nations in this work of universal organ - ization , disarmament and peace ?

		Let the < Americani - zation of the world , ' of which men at home and abroad are now talking so much , find its chief and real character and distinction in the spread throughout the world of the highest ideals of good government and good educa - tion , the lending of the helpful hand , and love and justice between man and man .

		Let us jealously hold the repub - lic up to the level of its best ideals , and let us keep our children in the schools and our families in their homes alive to those ideals and to their duties in behalf of peace and order and the rights and welfare of mankind . ''

		Here is an educational ideal for which no Amer - ican need blush , a declaration of principles standing in the sharpest of contrasts with those by which the Republic has been so grievously led astray during its recent access of emotional insanity on the subject of warfare .

		Having quoted Mr.
Mead	PERSON	in the abstract , let us now quote him in the concrete .

		Speaking at the
Mohawk Arbitration Conference	ORGANIZATION	of
last May	DATE	, he used the following striking illustration : '' There is no subject on which our people are more at sea than on this of patriotism .

		I saw the other day a picture which was one of the most mournful I ever saw , but one of the most natural , -- mournful precisely because so natural .

		It was a picture which bore the title , ' A Lesson in Patriotism , ' -- and the picture was of an old man in his shirt-sleeves showing a boy a gun .

		Now I say that was the most natural picture in the world and the most natural title ; but it is the precise measure of our civilization -- or of our barbarism .

		The fact is that the general public has got no further yet in this whole question of patriotism than that the gun is the natural symbol of it .

		All honor to the gun when it is used in its place , -- I am not the kind of man to apologize for
Lexington	LOCATION	or Bunker Hill ; but so long as the boys and girls of this country grow up with the notion that the gun and the soldier are the only proper symbols of patriotism , then we are yet , I say , in the age of barbarism . ''

		Mr.
Mead	PERSON	rightly says that '' the schools must be captured for peace . ''

		How much this means will be fully appreciated only by those who know by experience the vainglorious and mournful stuff that is still foisted upon our school children in the name of patriotism .

		The thoughtful teacher looks forward with ap - prehension if not with terror to the occasional memorial exercise that is supposed to inculcate the lesson of patriotism in the school , for he knows that the performance will at its best be merely perfunctory , and at its worst may be subversive of all the finer ethical standards -- that it is likely to substitute emotion for rea - son , to do lip-service to ideas that have their proper content carefully concealed , and to en - courage that fatal complacency which lies at the
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 317 root of most of the evils of our national life .

		Yes , there is work to be done in the schools , but not of the kind that is now being done ; and there is work to be done in the homes , bat not of the kind that is wrought by news - paper editorials and the reports of political leaders : and , above all , there is work to be done in the hearts of men without regard to the delicate sensibilities that take offence at the least suggestion of what , with amusing inac - curacy , is commonly styled pessimism .

		And the wide circulation of what the really great thinkers of the world have said about the folly of warfare is one of the most effective means of making that folly apparent .

		Perhaps the time is more nearly ripe for the advent of the gospel of peace than surface indications would lead us to imagine .

		It is true that there have been needless wars in our own times , and that the most distressingly wanton of them all has been waged by our own dear country , but there has been no mortal struggle between two great powers since the Second Empire of the French went down in shame more than thirty years ago .

		And the nightmare vision of such a struggle seems to be less of an obsession upon the
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean consciousness than it was a few years ago .

		The grimly suggestive phrase attributed to
Bismarck	LOCATION	-- saigner a hlanc -- as indi - cating
Germany	LOCATION	's future treatment of her enemies should occasion arise , foreshadowed a possibility that the European chancelleries have grown less and less willing to face .

		And now we have the plain unsentimental argument of
M. de Bloch	PERSON	, happily fortified at almost every point by the experience of the English in
South Africa	LOCATION	, to the effect that the next war between two powers of the first class will prove a stale mate and force them both into bankruptcy .

		On the whole , it seems to us that the advocates of peace and disarmament have hit upon some - thing very like the psychological moment for a revivified endeavor in behalf of their most sacred cause .

		It was something like half a century ago that
Horace Mann	PERSON	wrote these words : '' If a thousandth part of what has been expended in war and preparing its mighty engines had been devoted to the development of reason and the diffusion of Christian principles , nothing would have been known for centuries past of its ter - rors , its sufferings , its impoverishment , and its demoralization , but what was learned from history . ''

		The fact that nineteen centuries of Christianity have failed to bring about even so imperfect an approximation to the Christian ideal as the mere cessation of warfare among civ - ilized peoples is certainly discouraging enough , and at times plunges the strongest of souls into the mood of bitter indignation that has been voiced by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	and Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, Such moods are even salutary if they are but temporary , if they may be dispelled by some ringing sursum corda of the nobler self .

		Per - haps , after all , it may be reserved for the
twentieth century	DATE	to do what the preceding centuries have failed to do .

		We , at least , who live in the youth of a century that may be hopeful because it is young , will do well to keep still in view the vision of the sages , and to believe that , if reason ever comes to triumph in the affairs of men , the glory of its victory will be , not to the `` too quick despairers , '' but to those who '' Marched breast forward , Never doubted eloads would break , Never dreamed , tbongh rigbt were worsted , wron ^ would trinispb , Held we fall to rise , are baffled to fight better .

		Sleep to wake . ''

		THE LOST ART OF BLANK VERSE .

		In oDe of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's letters , he makes an entha - siastic mention of
Keata	LOCATION	; and then goes on to say : '' Bat Ke & ts 's blank verse is bad . ''

		This is enough to make one stare .

		Tennyson 's own blank verse is admirable for the purpose to which he best puts it -- the composition of idylls , of little pictures com - plete in themselves .

		It winds like a brook among meadows and copses , dallying with its own beauty , and so delighted with the images it reflects that it is loth to leave them and harry on .

		Bat
Keats	PERSON	's blank verse -- the verse of `` Hyperion '' -- has a large - ness , vividness , swiftness , stride , that fit it for epic uses .

		It has not discarded all saperflaoas beauty and become mere sinewy strength , like Shakespeare 's later verse ; nor is it crusted and overloaded with ornament and pomp , like
Milton	PERSON	's greatest lines .

		It combines simplicity with sensaousne ^ s , and is , I should say , the best model of English narrative poetry .

		Blank verse is largely a thing of the past .

		It is an instrument of speech iotellectaal and spiritnal , and has shared in the decline of intellectual and spir - itual things .

		The immense tangle of later lyric growths has choked out the monarchs of the forest of poetry .

		Lyric poetry , even of the most intricate kind , is really simpler in form , easier of apprehen - sion , more obvious .

		The difiference between good blank verse and most lyric measures is the differ - ence between violin playing and a brass band .

		° ° Then blov the trumpet , sound the fife ; To all the aensnal world proclaim One crowded hour of glorioni life Is worth SB age without a name . ''

		918 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, How quick is the appeal of that to the ear !

		how instant the answer in the heart !

		But take `` As when upon a tranced
summer	DATE	night Those green-robed senators of ancient woods .

		Tall oaks , branch charmed by the earnest stars , Dream , and so dream all night without a stir , Save from some gradual solitary gust .

		Which comes upon the silence and dies off As if the ebbing air bad but one wave . ''

		That is a matter for reverie , for profound study .

		Its music rises and swells and branches into dis - tinct strains , and loses itself in the distance , or is multiplied with reduplicated echo .

		It only sur - renders its whole beauty to the finest ear .

		But lyric poetry is for everybody .

		It is , in a way , gross and palpable .

		It has all its sign-posts set out to assure the most inattentive that he is reading poetry .

		Measured motion and ordered repetition form the basis of every metrical scheme that has hitherto been invented .

		One or the other , or both , must be present in any speech that assumes to be verse .

		Greek and Latin poetry include both ; but their chief characteristic is the repetition of long and `` hort syllables in regular successions .

		Modern poetry being entirely accentual , has lost this gift of quantity .

		It is not that we do not have syllables which differ in the time required for their utterance , but that in most cases it makes little odds how we use them .

		We can substitute long for short , or short for long , without altering the flow of the verse .

		That this disregard of quantity has resulted in a loss of fixity and sculpturesque character in poetry , is certain .

		Probably every modern language has tried to substitute something in its place .

		Rhyme is a general substitute .

		The Scandinavian Sta - breim , which repeats an alliteration three times in each verse , and the Spanish Asonante , which dis - tinguishes and binds the lines together by many repetitions of a final vowel , are other inventions .

		The old Irish Dyevvie verse is the most intricate and curious attempt to get order and fixity into verse .

		To appearance , it is hardly metrical at all ; but in its correspondences and replications of consonantal and vowel sounds , it is one of the most remarkable instruments of speech ever fashioned , and , to ears familiar with it , probably one of the most harmo - nious .

		In English , the csesural verse of Pope was an attempt at classic symmetry .

		More interesting still , the verse of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Christabel	PERSON	, '' with its four regular beats , was really an effort in the same direction .

		It must be admitted that English blank verse , starting with alack of quantity , and then discarding rhyme , discarding regularity of alliteration , discard - ing sequences of long and short lines , discarding beat of syllables , has almost stripped itself of poetry 's in - heritance of symmetry .

		Its only legal hold on form is the slight stress or halt at the end of the tenth syl - lable .

		But that is enough .

		It gives to blank verse a security of law , a limit which prevents it from being ungovernable .

		There is , indeed , no immutable edict dictating ten syllables as a necessity , and poets like
Blake	PERSON	and Whitman have lengthened their lines and still preserved a metrical pace .

		But their irregular - ities in the use of their metre prevent the pleasure of recognizable restraint .

		The attempt to ignore the separation of lines in blank verse , and to read it , as it is claimed , naturally , is a barbarism .

		Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	fought against this heresy all their lives at the
Weimar	LOCATION	theatre , but it comes back again and again to plague us on the stage .

		To read blank verse thus is to turn it into prose .

		And the prose of writers like
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	, De Qaincey , and
Ruskin	PERSON	has many of the qualities and much of the art of poetry .

		But it has no rhythm , -- for rhythm can not exist without the regular and marked re - currence of movement and pause .

		DeQuincey named the style of prose in which he excelled '' periodic prose . ''

		But periodicity is exactly what it does not possess .

		It draws no magic circle about it in which to perform its miracles .

		It is amorphous -- without form or organic life .

		What , then , are the advantages of blank verse ?

		They are freedom and fluidity within limits .

		Lyric verse is formal .

		It is a park where `` grove nods to grove , -- each alley has its brother . ''

		Lyric verse is like a sedimentary formation with its stratas in parallel and regular bands .

		Blank verse is the same formation seized upon by igneous action and the stratas twisted , contorted , plicated almost out of recognizance .

		The popularity of lyric verse is due to the fact that it is easy for the eye and ear to catch its symmetries of arrangement ; but the trained mind will prefer to follow out the hints and glimpses by which law reveals itself in blank verse .

		It may he laid down as a rule that blank verse , to be good , must include all the characteristics of the other forms of poetry I have mentioned .

		It must be strewn with alliterations , assonances , and sequences of vowel sounds .

		But it must hold all these in solution , -- they must not be obvious and obtrusive .

		They must give us pleasure without our knowing why ; the airy beings must do their spiriting without our seeing them .

		There is probably no line or group of lines in
Milton	LOCATION	's epic without a domin - ant alliteration or a vowelled concert . ''

		Of man 's first disobedience , and the fruit Of that forbidden tree , '' -- etc. .

		English heroic verse , written in enjambments , -- in paragraphs , that is , rather than couplets , -- has much of the ease and fluidity of blank verse .

		Bat the halt at the end of every line is too marked .

		It is like riding on a race-course with a barred fence at every tenth stride .

		The rhymed poem which most successfully copies the freedom of blank verse is
Milton	LOCATION	's '' Lycidas . ''

		Here the rhymes are in a measure hidden by their irregularity , and still more by their frequency ; for it is a law of verse that the oftener a rhyme is repeated the less obvious it be - comes .

		Of course , in making these comparisons it is mainly iambic verse of which I am thinking .

		Spondaic and anapaestic rhythms are brilliant ex - otics .

		They have little real root in the language .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 319 Their movement is not the nataral movement of the English tongae .

		To speak without book , I shoald say that nine-tenths of the lyric poetry in Palgrave 's '' Golden Treasury '' is what we call iambic verse .

		I would say also that I am now dealing only with the technique of poetry , leaving out of view entirely its soul of thoughts and garb of phrase .

		The one solid distinction between poetry and prose is metre -- measured motion .

		There is no reason why prose should not have all the other poetic qualities ; and it often does .

		Possibly the movement of poetry helps its writer to attain that frenzy which Plato demands of the poet , -- as the whirling of the Sibyl was supposed to produce inspiration .

		In practice , this m ust be the case ; for in every language the most heightened thought and quickened phrase are to be found in verse .

		Blank verse is oar great English instrument of sounding speech .

		It has been found equally fitted for dramatic , epic , and reflective poetry .

		Marlowe fashioned the instrument first , and gave it a capacity for fiery energy and crashing volume of sound .

		But he left it somewhat monotonous and over-keyed .

		Shakespeare took it , and broke up
Marlowe	PERSON	's mighty line , and gave it every variety of note , ran over the whole gamut of cadence .

		In his verse the caesura flies from syllable to syllable as the foam leaps from crest to crest , and beckons the waves to follow in pliant but irresistible change .

		Consider the differ - ence between this word of Coriolanus : '' When , like an eagle in a dove-cote , I Flattered their Volsces in
Cortoli	LOCATION	, '' where the whirling sweep of the first nine syllables suddenly checks itself at the tenth , and then , poised there a moment , actually vibrates as the sense de - mands ; consider the difference between this and the slow pulsing syllables and ebbing echoes of Prospero 's great speech : '' Oar revels now are ended ; these onr actors , Aa I foretold joa , are all spirits , and Hare melted into air , into thin air . ''

		After the molten speech of
Marlowe	ORGANIZATION	, and Shake - speare 's living rhythms , there was nothing for Mil - ton to do but to make blank verse architectural -- to build it up into magnificent edifices of symmet - rical art .

		It may be said to have solidified in his hands ; and the business of later poets has been to try to bring back to it the play and changeableness of life .

		Wordsworth in his best verse imparted to it a spiritual transparency , almost transfiguration ; and there is a nameless necromancy in
Shelley	LOCATION	's '' Alastor . ''

		But
Keats	PERSON	alone was a spirit vivid and real enough to renew its former potency .

		Beside '' Hyperion '' I would place Landor 's '' Grebir '' and Home 's ''
Orion	ORGANIZATION	'' as the best examples of modern blank verse .

		Arnold 's two studies are noble in theme and treatment , but he had not the metrical ease and mastery for this most difiBcult form of poetry ; and
Tennyson	PERSON	's blank verse is so mannered , and so full of mere prettiness .

		that I for one would never rank it with the work of the masters .

		A
Century	ORGANIZATION	's Retrospect . ''

		It is a little carioas that the author of the well-kDown watchword which tells us , among other things , to look forward and not back , should himself be so given to the retrospective and reminiscent , and so inclined to regret that the present generation has eyes only for the future .

		Yet nobody can feel in the least dis - posed to censure this seeming inconsistency , since to it we owe more than one most enjoy - able volume of memoirs .

		Whatever the value of '' Memories of a Hun - dred Years '' as a contribution to nineteenth - century history , it is as a human document that the book chiefly appeals to the reader ; the writer 's own personality lends it its peculiar interest and charm .

		Therefore the reviewer prefers to treat it by no means as formal history , or even as autobiography , but rather as the note - book of one who has touched life at countless points , but who is too engrossed in good works to spare time for a very full , careful , or con - nected account of bis manifold experiences .

		That these memories cover not merely a hun - dred years , but go back almost half a century further , to
Braddock	PERSON	's defeat , would cause nat - ural surprise if the explanation did not at once suggest itself that the remembering is done in large part by proxy .

		Thus almost the entire first volume deals with events that occurred either before the author was born , or before he was of an age to have any memories of his own .

		His remembrance , however , reaches back al - most to the cradle -- to
Lafayette	LOCATION	's visit in
1825	DATE	, when the three-years-old boy was held up at the window to see the French patriot pass .

		Even before that time , and so early that he can - not now recall the circumstances , he had learned to read , probably at the dame school to which he was sent at his own clamorous request before the age of three .

		At twelve years of age he ap - peared in print in his father 's ''
Boston Adver	PERSON	- tiser , '' and from that time on wrote more and more for the press .

		That he went to the Latin school and to
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	was in the usual order for a
Boston	LOCATION	lad of good family .

		His reporting at
Cambridge	LOCATION	at six o'clock in the

		320 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, ludiorously with the modest high-school curri - culum of the Harvard of that time .

		Refusing to '' harass '' his readers with many autobiographical details , Dr.
Hale	PERSON	affords us only fleeting glimpses of himself in the storm - and-stress period of early manhood and in the busy years of a crowded career of public use - fulness .

		Some of these glimpses can best be given here in his own words , in such brief ex - tracts as space will permit .

		Emerson 's cousin
George	PERSON	had read some of his college prepara - tory Greek with Mr.
Hale	PERSON	-LRB- who served a short apprenticeship at teaching in the
Latin School	LOCATION	-RRB- , and had gratified his tutor by attaining high rank in his class at
Harvard	LOCATION	.

		Speaking of the
Junior Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	, in which
George	PERSON	had the first part , the author says : '' After the whole was over , and as the assembly broke up , I crossed the chapel that I might speak to
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, who stood alone , as it happened , under the gallery .

		I introduced myself to him , and I said I wanted to congratulate him on the success of his cousin .

		He said : ` Yes , I did not know I had so fine a young cousin .

		And now , if something will fall out amiss , -- if he should be unpopular with his class , or if his father should fail , or if some other misfortune can befall him , -- all will be well . '

		I was indignant with what I called the cynicism of his speech .

		I thought it the afiectation of the new philosopher who felt that he must say some - thing out of the way of common congratulation .

		But I learned afterward , what he had learned then , that ■ good is a good master , but bad is a better . '

		And I do not doubt now that the remark , which seemed cynical , was most affectionate . ''

		The
Hale	PERSON	and the
Webster	PERSON	families were intimate .

		On young Mr.
Hale	PERSON	's first visit to
Washington	LOCATION	he called on Mr.
Webster	PERSON	, who was then
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He recounts this experience , even at his own expense . ''

		I have never forgotten the ease and simplicity with which , at dinner , he kept the conversation on such things as would interest a person who had just before been en - gaged in teaching .

		He went back to speak of his old days as a schoolmaster , when , once or twice , my father had taken his place .

		I had spoken of my interest in botany , and he began talking about Linnseus 's letters , with which he was quite familiar , and from which he cited curious things .

		I , alas !

		had never seen Linn.neus 's letters .

		Then because I had been a master in the
Latin School	LOCATION	, he brought the couversatiou round to
Thirlwall	ORGANIZATION	's ' History of
Greece	LOCATION	, ' which he had read with interest .

		Alas !

		I had never read
Thirlwall	ORGANIZATION	's ' History of
Greece	LOCATION	. '

		I do not think that there was the least wish to over - power a youngster in this ; it was merely the ease with which he adapted himself to the man whom he was meeting . ''

		An amusing
Webster	PERSON	anecdote , not one of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's personal recollections , but well au - thenticated , is given by him .

		Young
Edward Everett Webster	PERSON	, with whom the author was intimate in school and college , was taken when a child by his mother to hear one of his father 's speeches .

		They sat in the gallery .

		In the course of his address Mr.
Webster	PERSON	cried out , in his most vigorous way , '' Will any man dare say '' -- when his infant son , impressed with the folly of any such supposed case of audacity in contradicting his father , promptly responded from the gallery , '' No , pa ! ''

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's admiration for
Webster	PERSON	goes so far as to make him regard Mr.
McCall	PERSON	's
Dart	PERSON	- mouth address as a justification of the seven th - of-March speech .

		He further tells us with great emphasis that though he saw
Webster	PERSON	in the last twenty-six years of the latter 's life '' thousands of times , '' and read '' thousands of letters '' from him , and visited the family he knows not how often , he never had a dream or thought that the great statesman cared any - thing for alcoholic stimulants .

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's father , also , who survived
Webster	PERSON	twelve years , `` heard such stories as these with perfect disgust and indignation . ''

		Such testimony is not lightly to be put aside .

		Yet in marked contrast with it are the reminiscences of another octogenarian , who is no less ardent in his ad - miration . ''

		I once saw him , '' says Dr.
Cuyler	PERSON	in his recent book , '' when his imperial brain was raked with the chain-shot of alcohol .

		The sight moved me to tears , and made me hate more than ever the accursed drink that , like death , is no ` respecter of persons . ' ''

		Young Mr.
Hale	PERSON	enjoyed the warm friend - ship of his distinguished uncle ,
Edward Ever	PERSON	- ett .

		Of his valuable reminiscences of this accomplished man , there is here room for but one .

		`` He said to me one day in the
spring of 1846	DATE	that it was already long enough , since his return from
Europe	LOCATION	, for him to satisfy himself that the stately ora - tion of twenty years before was for America a thing of the past .

		He advised me as a young man to accustom myself to speak to large or small audiences without a manuscript before me , to accept the more colloquial habit , which I think he would have called the ' habit of the stump . ' ''

		`` About the same time , '' the author adds in a footnote , ''
Orville Dewey	PERSON	told me how to do it .

		I think it was he who told me always to speak in public ' whenever any one was fool enough to ask me . ' ''

		Among the anecdotes given at second hand , the following about General
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	is characteristic : '' The daughter of a
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Senator told me that in her younger life she went with her father to one of the regulation dinners at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		General .

		Jackson himself took her out to the dinner-table .

		There was some talk about the light of the table , and the
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 321 General said to her , ' The chanticleer does not burn well . '

		She was so determined that she shoald not mis - understand him that she pretended not to hear him and asked him what he said .

		To which his distinct reply was , ' The chanticleer does not burn well . ' ''

		These are merely a few crumbs from the feast that awaits the reader who is not so ill - advised as to content himself with such scanty nibbles .

		That Dr.
Hale	PERSON	everywhere shows the courage of his convictions , not to say also of his prejudices , is a matter of course .

		His vigorous optimism finds no use for certain `` pes - simistic
New York	LOCATION	weeklies . ''

		To his staunch Republicanism
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	'' fills the place in history which a fussy and foolish nurse fills in the biography of a man like
Franklin	PERSON	, or
Washington	LOCATION	, or
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, or
Julius Caesar	PERSON	. ''

		His sturdy common sense speaks out in that * ' disgust for the mechanism of the public schools '' which he says he takes occasion to express upon all suitable opportunities .

		Three months ' time is enough , in his opinion , to de - vote to college preparatory Greek , for such as really wish to master it .

		The dulness of the new school of history comes in for a word of censure in his defense of his old friend Ban - croft . '

		* According to me , '' he declares , '' you misrbt as well write with white ink on white paper as write anything in a language so dull that nobody wants to read it . ''

		He speaks of his iron memory , and indeed it is a most wonderful memory .

		But as rules are proved by their exceptions , perhaps he will permit the reviewer to heighten the effect of these marvels of recollection by placing in con - trast with them one or two apparent lapses .

		Referring to
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	, from which his father ,
Nathan Hale	PERSON	, was graduated in
1804	DATE	, he says , '' Dr.
Tyler	PERSON	, the historian of the
College	ORGANIZATION	, speaks of the

		Dr.
William Seymour Tyler	PERSON	is well known as the historian of
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Is there a Dr.
Tyler	PERSON	, historian of
Williams	ORGANIZATION	?


Calvin Durfee	PERSON	, in his history of
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	, describes the years immediately preceding
1804	DATE	as singularly pros - perous , and quotes in corroboration passages from President
Fitch	PERSON	's letters of 1801-1804 .

		The dark days of the college fell in
1819	DATE	, when it came within a little of being trans - planted to
Northampton	LOCATION	.

		Defending
Lowell	PERSON	from the foolish charge of indolence , Dr.
Hale	PERSON	writes , '' In his after life he speaks somewhere of his working fifteen hours a day , when at the same time editor of the
North American Review	ORGANIZATION	and of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		Is there not a mistake here ?

		Un - less there is a surprising unanimity of error in the records ,
Lowell	PERSON	's own letters included , he held the editorship of the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' from
1857	DATE	to
1862	DATE	, and with Professor
Norton	PERSON	the joint editorship of the '' North American Review '' from
1863	DATE	to
1872	DATE	.

		Possibly the simultaneity of office in our author 's mind was that of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professorship and the magazine edi - torship .

		One more petty criticism , and we have done .

		Every one has heard of the committee-man who , when invited to address the school he was visiting , edified the young people before him with a lecture on the importance of `` kerect pronounceation . ''

		Emphasizing the value of a good education , especially in English , Dr.
Hale	PERSON	writes -- or at least we read in his printed page : '' And no matter who the kings asked to meet them ,
John Adams	PERSON	meant that the sons and daughters of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	should be able to hold their own in conversation ... that they should speak English and understand English as well as any man in any place . ''

		The re - viewer , it is hoped , will be pardoned for taking note of what in any other connection would not have offered so irresistible a temptation .

		Besides , who knows whether some middle-man , -- amanuensis , compositor , or proof-reader , -- may not really be responsible for this slight de - parture from
Lindley Murray	PERSON	?

		Some new matter , both in text and footnotes , and in portraits , illustrations , and facsimiles , appears to have been added to the original chapters since their appearance in the '' Out - look . ''

		But the great excellence of the book , and at the same time its great defect , lies in its suggestion of rich hoards of material un - used for lack of space .

		Many phases of the writer 's abounding personality , many of his in - numerable forms of beneficent activity , receive no illustration whatever , so that in closing these volumes one is almost as ready to quarrel with the author because of what he has omitted , as to thank him for what he has included .

		But as to matter included , most readers will regret that so much space has been devoted to pre - natal recollections , so to speak , at the expense of later and to them more interesting matters .

		The excision of twenty pages on
Philip Nolan	PERSON	, the
Texas	LOCATION	adventurer of
1801	DATE	, would not have caused poignant grief .

		So , too , for Fulton and his steamboat we might well have been referred to the encyclopaedia , and treated instead to a dozen pages describing , let us say , the fortunes of the lat `` lamented '' Old and New , '' or the 822 THE DIAL , -LSB-

		But enough of this , or some one will be moved to retort , in
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	's familiar words : '' It is a secret well known to the professors of the art and mystery of criticism , to insist upon what they do not find in a man 's works , and to pass over in silence what they do . ''

		`` Varieties oe Religious Experience .

		* The value of a book to its reader depends upon what he can get out of it .

		To some , the volume now reviewed will appear as a brutal treatment of sacred things by a man who does not know what religion means .

		To others , it will seem an absurdly solemn discussion of matters which are foolish at the best , and often idiotic .

		To the present writer it seems a work of genius , admirable alike for the thoughts ex - pressed and the manner of their expression .

		The book does not concern itself with relig - ious institutions , nor with theologies ; but with the religious feelings and impulses of individ - uals .

		In these latter are found the true origin of religion , that inward and spiritual grace of which the churches are at best a secondary out - come .

		Professor
James	PERSON	quotes at length the autobiographical records of numerous religious persons , belonging to various sects ; and of others not professedly religious , whose expe - riences are considered similar in kind .

		The number and fulness of these quotations may weary some readers , but anyone who will read them through will be convinced of the essential similarity of almost all the cases , notwithstand - ing wide differences in detail .

		This similarity depends upon the consciousness of communion or unity with a spiritual being of a higher type , -- in ordinary language , with God .

		In order to get the clearest possible insight into the phenomena , the instances chosen for study are mostly those of the more extreme sort : those which modern science would usually class as psychopathological .

		Professor
James	PERSON	urges that this should not deter us from re - garding them seriously .

		In the first place , the origin of spiritual experiences may be what you please ; but this does not affect their impor - tance and significance for us .

		much for the development of mankind , no med - ical materialism can rob them of their value .

		Even those who would class men of genius with the mentally deficient would not propose to dispense with the works of genius .

		Again , one sort of '' origin '' does not necessarily preclude another .

		If a man is '' converted '' because of a certain psychopathological condition , it does not follow that that condition may not have been the very thing which permitted the influx of some external spiritual force .

		Glass is said to be red when it transmits red light ; but who would be so absurd as to affirm that red light is solely caused -- or , in fact , caused at all -- by red glass ?

		The narrow materialist , who thinks he has explained religious experiences by refer - ring them to certain changes in the brain , is no more scientific than he who should consider red light a property of glass , ignoring the existence of the sun .

		Very interesting is the discussion of the '' once-born '' and '' twice-born '' types of man - kind .

		The '' once-born '' are those happy indi - viduals who are so simply constituted that they have no internal struggle , no sense of the bad - ness of things .

		They seem to sing a perpetual song to God , a psalm of gladness for the beauty of the world and the harmony they feel with it .

		Evil they repudiate and ignore .

		They are like those animals which flourish by the choice of suitable environment , avoiding instead of overcoming their enemies .

		Physically speak - ing , such persons may lead active militant lives , but they simply do not know what spirit - ual evil is .

		In recent years , this mental attitude , described by Professor James as '' Healthy - mindedness , '' has been specially cultivated by a sect .

		The doctrines of '' Christian Science , '' apparently increasing in popularity , depend upon the assumption that evil may be evaded by ignoring it .

		It is even held that physical evils may to some extent be thus overcome ; and Professor
James	PERSON	believes that there is sufficient proof to confirm this view .

		Indeed , orthodox medical men have long been aware of the value of '' suggestion '' as a therapeutic agent .

		The '' twice-born '' are those who have to struggle with evil in order to overcome it .

		They are those whose personality is complex , with antagonistic elements .

		Only after a prolonged conflict are they permitted to enter the haven of peace , by the triumph of the higher elements of their character ; or , as it seems to them , by the direct influx of the Holy Ghost .

		Such per - sons have come too closely in contact with evil

		32S ever to forget its existence .

		To the '' once - born '' they appear morbid , while to them the former seem shallowness itself .

		In considering the phenomena of conversion , whereby the '' second birth '' occurs , it is remarked that it is very commonly sadden , but nevertheless per - manent .

		As the author says , it is like the sud - den crystalizing out of a salt in a saturated solution , upon the addition of a solid object .

		Psychologically , Professor
James	PERSON	explains this by suggesting that in reality a change has been going on in the subconscious regions of the mind , until it reaches a point when the equi - librium is disturbed , so to speak , and a new and stable position is assumed .

		It is impossible here to give all the reasons for this opinion ; but the reader of the book , if not unduly biased , will probably find them convincing .

		One inter - esting fact is that the change often occurs after the individual has given up the struggle ; that is , after the ordinary mental faculties have become exhausted .

		Then , it seems , the subcon - scious self is able to assert itself and take pos - session of the field .

		In minor matters , such as the attempt to recollect a name , the same sort of thing may occur .

		The present writer has long known his indebtedness to the inspirations of leisure moments , and has long been con - vinced that the restless life is a relatively stupid one .

		It is probable that our crowded school curricula do irretrievable harm by not permit - ting time for those restful mental periods wherein the subconscious self tells the things that it has learned .

		So much for the psychological theory ; it remains to be asked , to what is the subconscious self indebted for the things it knows ?

		Obvi - ously , it is often indebted to the world of our ordinary knowledge , just as is our ordinary consciousness .

		I suppose everyone has had the experience of remembering something which was not consciously noticed originally ; which was seen out of the corner of the mind , so to speak , and did not come into the field of clear vision .

		Nevertheless , religious converts are convinced that t -RCB- itir knowledge did not come in this way , but was received from a higher spiritual source .

		Professor
James	PERSON	holds that this can not be definitely affirmed , from an out - sider 's point of view , but is to be classed as an '' over - belief . ''

		In an eloquent passage -LRB- p. 519 -RRB- , the author thus states his personal '' over-belief '' : `` What the more characteristicallj divine facts are , apart from the actual inflow of energr in the faith-state and the prajer-state , I know not .

		But the over-belief on which I am ready to make my personal ventore i > that they exist The whole drift of my edaMtkw goe '' to persuade me that the world of onr pi uwat -LRB- JuaauMiu ness is onlv one out of many worlds of consdousness thai exist , and that those other worlds must contain experi - ences which have a meaning for our life also ; and that although , in the main , their experienoes and those of this world keep discrete , yet the two become continnoas at certain points , and higher energies filter in .

		By being faithful in my poor measure to this over-belief , I seem to myself to keep more sane and true .

		I can , of course , put myself into the sectarian scientist 's atti - tude , and imagine vividly that the world of sensations and of scientific laws and objects may be all .

		But whenever I do this , I hear that inward monitor , of whiefa
W. K. Clifford	PERSON	once wrote , whispering the word ` bosh ! '

		Humbug is humbug , even though it bear the scientifie name ; and the total expression of human experience , as I view it objectively , invincibly urges me beyond the narrow ` scientific ' bounds .

		Assuredly , the real world is of a different temperament , -- more intricately built than physical science allows .

		So my objective and mv subjective conscience both hold me to the over - belief which I express .

		Who knows whether the faith - fulness of individuals here below to their own poor over-beliefs may not actually help God in torn to be more effectively faithful to his own greater tasks ? ''

		With this wholly inadequate notice we must leave what seems to the reviewer one of the great books of our time .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		The
Deax of Amkricax Lettkks	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Some forty years ago
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	wished to introduce to the
Boston	LOCATION	world of let - ters a young man who had followed his poems from
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		He therefore made a dinner for him at
Parker	ORGANIZATION	's at which the other guests were
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	and Mr.
James T. Fields	PERSON	.

		`` Well ,
James	PERSON	, '' said the autocrat , '' this is something like the apostolic succession : this is the laying on of hands . ''

		He was right , for Mr.
Howells	PERSON	not only succeeded
Lowell	PERSON	a '' editor of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' bn * in other and lar - ger ways .

		- ^ I have several times -LRB- in somewhat academic fashion perhaps -RRB- considered Irving and
Lowell	PERSON	as the representative men of letters of their times .

		Each was undoubtedly the chief man of letters of his day -LRB- if we can regard the man of letters as something a little different from poet , novelist , historian , or any other specific kind of author -RRB- , and each was typical of the lit - erary spirit of his time .

		324 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, the second .

		I can think of no one more prop - erly representative of the later phases of our national literary life than Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		It is not as being necessarily the greatest genius of his time , that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is entitled to this distinction .

		Neither Irving nor
Lowell	PERSON	was exactly the greatest genius of his time .

		Measurements of genius are misleading and dangerous : only in cases of immense preemi - nence can we be quite sure of our reckonings .

		But putting such dangerous questions aside , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, like
Irving and Lowell	PERSON	, is for other reasons more a representative man than any of his contemporaries .

		For one thing he is more a master in his profession than any - body else : he understands the whole range of letters more thoroughly .

		Irving and
Lowell	PERSON	were also masters of easy power in a broad range of letters , but I am not sure that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	does not surpass them .

		Not merely fiction is his field , the natural and necessary mode of expression of our day , but poetry , criticism , essay , drama , as well .

		Like Gold - smith , there are few veins that he has not worked , and wherever he has worked he has brought forth gold .

		But further also , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is representa - tive of his time ; he is entirely in the spirit of it .

		It is true that of late years , everyone sees that the spirit of the time , so far as letters is concerned , is changing ; but however that may be , the
last third of the century	DATE	will historically be the time of the influence of realism in fiction and the drama , a movement in which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	was our chief leader .

		And however technical principles of realism may have changed or may be changing , there can be little doubt that the increased seriousness which it brought , the more pervading consciousness of the neces - sary close relation between literature and life , the feeling that literature should in some meas - ure and with varying means interpret life , this , the necessary feeling of the realist , will not pass away as readily as the formulas of local color and states of soul .

		And in that respect , too , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is a great represen - tative figure .

		We may therefore look at his last collection of essays and studies with singular interest .

		It is not to be regarded as a suitor for favor : it must be looked upon rather as the record of a fact .

		We may like it or not , according to our taste : doubtless , there is little of the future in it , more of the past ; but we naturally find in it a claim on the attention of everyone who likes to feel that he understands the movements and tendencies in the culture of his day .

		The different papers that make up the book were probably not written with especial refer - ence to each other .

		They did , on the other hand , have always the inspiration of a common feeling , and this feeling is so characteristic of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	that it makes the book more notable -LRB- as well as more charming -RRB- than it would be without .

		He speaks of it in '' A Word of Explanation . ''

		Doubtless all that is there said has been otherwise said already by him - self , or by others under the same feelings as himself .

		But I will own that a word or two makes clearer to me than it was , the spirit in which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has worked , -- perhaps the prevailing spirit of that influence of which he was our chief spokesman .

		He writes : '' I have never been able to see much difference be - tween what seemed to me Literature and what seemed to me Life ... Unless the thing seen reveals to me an intrinsic poetry , and puts on phrases that clothe it pleas - ingly to the imagination , I do not much care for it ; but if it will do this , I do not mind how poor or common or squalid it shows at first glance ; it challenges my curiosity and keeps my sympathy . '' ''

		The union of Literature and Life , '' he after - ward says , '' is the rainbow in the sky for me ; and I have seldom seen a sky without some bit of rainbow in it . ''

		This , it seems to me , makes one understand the realist position better .

		How different it is from the view of another man who unfortu - nately did not live to enjoy many years of the admiration and love that we feel for Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		Stevenson would never have said that .

		He saw lovely things in Life and in Liter - ature , but the sky for him was surely often without the rainbow , and he was often forced to recall some lovely rainbow he had seen before , or imagine a lovely one that he would see .

		As to which way is the best way to the pot of gold at the foot may be doubtful .

		Intrinsically the papers of this collection have their specific interest in subject as well as in handling .

		Perhaps a half are of those impressions of travel , wherein Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is so much at home , though geographically the traveller has often strayed no farther than the
New England	LOCATION	coast .

		Some of them are more destructively critical papers .

		And a good many are practically professional , if informal , opin - ions and ideas , not exactly on literature or on life , but on literary life , -- a matter on which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is as well informed as anyone .

		These have for me more interest than the

		The Scotch and Irish in
America	LOCATION	.

		* The
Scotch-Irish Society of America	ORGANIZATION	was formed at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, in
1889	DATE	, in connection with a congress assembled at the suggestion of Mr.
Thomas T. Wright	PERSON	of
Florida	LOCATION	, to organize for the perpetuation of the achievements and the preservation of the history of the Scotch-Irish race in
America	LOCATION	.

		The society aroused a great deal of enthusiasm and held successful annual meetings in several different cities .

		On these occasions papers were presented and addresses were made which dis - cussed various phases of our country 's history as illustrating the position taken by Scotch - Irish Americans .

		The papers were subsequently published in nine volumes , and much good material for history was thus gathered .

		The papers presented were not uniform in merit , some of them being congratulatory and boast - ful in tone , with much looseness of statement ; others were carefully prepared and filled with matter of historic value .

		But two things were clearly evident as a result of these meetings , -- first , that the enthusiastic Scotch-Irish were disposed to make rash claims for their race representatives ; and , second , that American historians bad not paid enongh attention to the part played in our early colonial life by the Scotch-Irish , Huguenot , and other non - English elements of our always cosmopolitan population .

		The last twenty years have witnessed a sur - prising interest in American colonial history .

		This has resulted in a great output of books , dealing with every possible phase of colonial life , military , political , economic , and social .

		All sorts of societies have published records and papers , and neglected heroes and forgotten facts have been dragged to light out of many a nook and corner .

Charles A. Hanna	PERSON	was to be the his - torian of the Scotch-Irish in

Hanna	PERSON	's labors is distinctly dis - appointing . ''

		The Scotch-Irish , '' or as the secondary title reads , '' The Scot in
North Britain	LOCATION	,
North Ireland	LOCATION	, and
North America	LOCATION	, '' is not a history : it is an aggregation of ma - terials .

		The running title is `` The Sootch - Irish Families of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		but five hundred of the six hundred pages in the first volume are taken up with Scotch history and Scotch char - acteristics , leading up very gradually to the migration from Ulster to
America	LOCATION	.

		Five-sixths of the second volume , likewise , are given up to appendices containing a surprising amount of material , thousands of names being presented in all sorts of lists connected with Scotch and Scotch-American history , all of these collec - tions evidencing a vast amount of labor of love .

		The special chapters bearing particularly upon the Scotch-Irish in
America	LOCATION	are illogical in arrangement , and are marred by the boastful tendency already mentioned .

		There are some valuable features , such as a map with descrip - tive notes showing the location of the
Scoteh	PERSON	- Irish settlements ; and twenty pages of bibliog - raphy give some notion of the literature to be examined by one who would make himself thoroughly familiar with the subject of Scotch influence on American life .

		It is only fair to Mr.
Hanna	PERSON	to say that he himself recognizes his own failure to make a history , and to ac - cord to him the justness of his claim to have gathered into his two handsome volumes valu - able materials , not otherwise easy of examin - ation , without which no one could write a history of this race .

		The name ' `` Scotch-Irish '' is an American - ism , used to describe those sons of
Scotland	LOCATION	who found homes in the north of
Ireland	LOCATION	and thence migT-ated to
America	LOCATION	.

		Thev were not truly Irish , but Scotch , and were not particu - larly affected in race traits by their stay in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		In '' The Immigration of the Irish Quakers into
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Albert Cook	PERSON	326 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	^
Myers	PERSON	takes early occasion to state that the '' Irish '' Quakers were really English , they too having tarried only temporarily in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		In a volume of nearly five hundred pages of attractive typography and illustration he tells the tale of Irish Quaker immigration into
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania during the years 16b2 to
1750	DATE	.

		After a summary sketch of the rise of Quakerism in
England	LOCATION	and its transplantation into
Ireland	LOCATION	, the inducements to American migration are described , and the course of such migration marked out .

		The real addition to American race history comes in the designation of the places settled by these Irish Quakers , and in the collection of facts showing their character - istics and the varied features of their social life .

		One-half of the volume is given up to accounts of prominent Irish Friends and to genealogical matter , many hundreds of names being catalogued which show what an incre - ment of population
America	LOCATION	received from this particular element .

		Ten pages of bibliography of printed and manuscript sources are supplied , and an index of thirty pages completes a most pleasing specimen of book-making .

		There are tens of thousands of descendants of these Irish Quakers scattered throughout the
Union	ORGANIZATION	who will find in this volume the story of their im - migrant ancestors .

		It is a real contribution to American race history , and a valuable addi - tion to the literature of colonial life .

		She does not seem to know just what she wants , but she abhors the thought of a commonplace existence .

		Having married a sensible but somewhat stolid man of basiness , she discovers that life has grown dull .

		Her existence is simply bourgeois and she would like to make it bohemian .

		When children appear , her husband very properly decides that the city is no place in which to rear them , and , taking it for granted that she will un - derstand so plain a matter , purchases a charming suburban home for his family .

		But life in a suburb means nothing more to her than the daily round of unpleasant duties and the penance of neighborhood gossip .

		She has absolutely no inner resources , and is miserable .

		She longs for the excitements of an artificial society , and even envies the lot of the girl - hood friend who is living in
Paris	LOCATION	as an artist 's mistress .

		Her husband is much too good for her , although , being human , he once so far forgets himself as to swear in her presence .

		The outcome of this situation is not .

		however , what the seasoned reader of novels expects .

		Instead of breaking away in revolt , the wife slowly becomes subdued to her en - vironment , and we are left with the impression that she is the victim of tragic circumstance .

		At last , this is the impression that the author intends to leave , for his story is based upon a morbid concep - tion of human rights and duties .

		He clearly exp > ect8 us to sympathize with the woman , whereas a sane view of the whole situation would rather prove provocative of sympathy for the husband , and of exasperation with the wife .

		The book as a whole is amateurish in design and crude in execution ; it is the product of a narrow and unbalanced view of life , which ignores the great principle of reaping as we have sown , and has no other ideal than that of mere hedonism .

		Mr.
Booth Tarkington	PERSON	's novel of the Mexican War period tells a love-story in terms of delicate old-fashioned sentiment .

		The scene is somewhere in the
Ohio	LOCATION	valley .

		Southern
Ohio	LOCATION	or
Indiana	LOCATION	-- and the characters are studied with sympathy .

		The scheme of the novel is extremely artificial , and is based upon a perfectly impossible complication .

		There is only one Vanrevel in fact , but the heroine gets the notion that the name belongs to his friend and law partner Crailey Gray .

		Throughout the book sbe supposes each of these gentlemen to be the other , which leads to much silent suffering on the part of Vanrevel , and to the tragic bat deserved death of Gray .

		The hero is altogether too qaizotie in his devotion to the friend who encourages the deception for his own selfish purposes .

		Even when Gray 's contemptible duplicity comes to light .

		Van - revel 's one thought is to shield his friend and con - tinue to suffer the consequences of the fatal misun - derstanding .

		It is all cleared up at the end , of course , and the hero starts for
Mexico	LOCATION	with the knowledge that he has won the love of the heroine .

		Her brute of a father is particularly unconvincing , and there is a trick of artificiality about several of the other characters ; but the story is prettily told , and its tension is relieved by an occasional touch of comedy .

		The final conquest for civiliuttion of the
Ohio Valley	ORGANIZATION	has offered several recent writers of historical fiction an attractive theme .

		Mr.
Altsheler	PERSON	's novel is probably the best treatment that the subject has thus far received , but it is possible to say a very good word for '' The Heritage , '' just published by Mr.
Burton Egbert Stevenson	PERSON	.

		This story begins in
Virginia	LOCATION	in Revolutionary days , daring the boy - hood of the hero .

		He grows up just in time to be fired with enthasiasm for the pioneer movement toward the
Ohio	LOCATION	, and becomes an actor in the strug - gle that leads , through the defeat of
Harmer	PERSON	and
St. Clair	ORGANIZATION	, to the final victory of
Wayne	LOCATION	.

		The story has a good deal of Indian fighting , excellently told , and a vein of sentimental romance that affords a pleasant relief to its sterner episodes .

		In • • The Holland Wolves . ''

		by Mr.
J. Breckin	PERSON	- ridge
Ellis	PERSON	, we go back to the days of Spanish per - secution in
the Netherlands	LOCATION	and the inspiration of ■ ' Beggar '' patriotism .

		The noble figure of Egmont and the sinister figure of
Alva	PERSON	occupy the centre of the stage as far as the characters of actual history are concerned , but the main interest of the romance is private and sentimental .

		There are some well - drawn figures of Dutchmen , and a rather stunning heroine in the person of a maiden -LRB- supposedly Spanish -RRB- who in male attire accompanies her puta - tive father to the wars .

		The hero is a wandering French Huguenot , a happy-go-lucky individual who is peculiarly susceptible to feminine charms , but hardly of the stuff that goes to the making of really acceptable heroes .

		The story is stilted in manner and far from satisfactory in construction .

		Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	's latest novel , '' The Desert and the Sown , '' takes us once more to the far Western re - gion which she knows so intimately , and of which she makes such admirable use as a setting for her stories .

		It is as a setting only , and for the pro- vision of color and atmosphere , since she never subordinates human interest to anything else .

		In this case , the interest attaches to a singular sitaa - tion indeed .

		The daughter of a wealthy farmer on the
Hudson	LOCATION	has eloped with one of her father 's men , a gentle , devoted , but inefficient creature .

		Disowned by her family , they have settled in the far West , and there , after some years of hardship , her husband has disappeared one stormy night .

		328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, leaving it to be inferred that he has perished from exposure .

		When the story opens many years after - wards , the supposed widow , long in possession of the family wealth , and the mother of two grown-up children , is on a visit to a western military post .

		Her son is betrothed to the daughter of the com - mandant , and the wedding is soon to occur .

		He goes off for a few weeks with a camping party , and great peril overtakes them in the mountains .

		One of the guides is disabled , and the rest of the party , grown panic-stricken , seek their own safety by abandoning the guide to his fate .

		Paul alone , not being made of cowardly stuff , remains with the sick man .

		Days of fever and semi-starvation follow , and the guide , in his delirium , reveals the fact that be is
Paul	PERSON	's father , and that his early desertion of his wife had resulted from the conviction that she would be better free .

		Paul has a hard struggle with himself before his better self triumph ?

		, and he is prepared to admit the new-found relationship .

		After they have been found by the rescuing party , the same problem is offered to bis mother , but she hardens her heart , and shows no sign of recogni - tion .

		The father , too proud to betray himself to the injury of wife and children , disappears as soon as his strength is restored , and the remainder of the book is devoted to
Paul	PERSON	's passionate quest for his rediscovery .

		The scene finally takes us to the old manor-house on the
Hudson	LOCATION	, and there the old vagrant , who has crawled to his boyhood home to die , is again confronted by his wife , who at last overcomes the pride and self-repression of a life - time , and reveals her secret .

		This story is told with marked power and subtlety of analysis ; its outlines are made severe and almost harsh through restraint in the use of rhetorical or picturesque ornament , but the effect is deeply impressive .

		Another story of the West , the scene being Ne - braska , is the work of Miss
Elizabeth Higgins	PERSON	.

		It is called '' Out of the West , '' and has nothing of the art or insight displayed by Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	's novel , yet it contrives to be fairly interesting by virtue of its qualities of fresh observation , and faithfulness in matters of detail .

		It is the work of an amateur , and has many of those loose ends that the amateur never knows what to do with .

		Characters that promise well are introduced only to be dropped , and situations are left only half-developed .

		The latter part of the book takes us to
Washington	LOCATION	-LRB- the hero having become a Congressman -RRB- , and consti - tutes the weakest part of the novel .

		The writer seems to be a sort of Populist , and her book will find favor among the discontented .

		Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	seems to delight in absurd titles for her stories , and '' Love and the Soul Hunters '' is but the last of a long series of similar indiscretions of nomenclature .

		It is strange that a writer whose style is so refined , and even distinguished , as hers , should not be able to find simpler and more natural names for her books .

		The present performance takes us into very fine society indeed .

		A queen dowager and a prince -LRB- temporarily dispossessed -RRB- are con - spicuous among the characters , and are placed in a setting wherein we mingle upon familiar terms with figures from la haute finance and the British nobil - ity , an American millionaire , and the former favor - ite of an emperor , known to the stage as
La Belle Valentine	ORGANIZATION	.

		The prince is the hero , and he has for secretary an astute middle-aged German named Felshammer .

		Both prince and secretary seek the love of a certain young woman , and , the former being successful , the latter lies in ambush and shoots his master .

		Since the wound does not prove fatal , the secretary thinks he may as well tell his master all about it . ''

		Do you expect to try it again ? ''

		asks the prince . ''

		No , '' replies the secretary . ''

		Then I forgive you , but I would rather not see yon any more . ''

		We have read this novel with a certain degree of pleasure , for it has a well-constructed plot and is written in a style that few contemporary novelists can equal .

		But it is too much of an exotic to seem a genuine portrayal of human life , and its appeal is rather to an artificial than to a natural taste .

		The strongly marked Tendenz of `` The Blood - Tax '' will probably frighten some readers away from a very readable book .

		Miss
Gerard	PERSON	knows the German military world of which she writes , and although her literary art is small , she has inter - esting matter and makes its expression convincing .

		The story is of an Englishman of affairs , who ac - cepts a post in a barracks town in
Germany	LOCATION	for the purpose of studying the military system on the spot .

		He believes that
England	LOCATION	's salvation lies in con - scription , and wishes to fortify himself for the propagation of this idea by a first hand observation of militarism in its chief
Continental	ORGANIZATION	stronghold .

		Brought face to face with the German system , he perceives the evil concomitants which had escaped him at a distance , and returns home to advocate , not conscription , but a plan of education upon the military basis , calling for occasional periods of training , but not for the sacrifice of one or more years on the part of the individual .

		The plot of the story is based upon a complication so artificial that to any but German readers imbued with the false ideal of military honor it seems fairly incredible .

		The hero is a German dragoon who is disgraced and forced to resign his commission because when struck by a ruflSan in the dark he does not catch his assailant in time to administer the salutary correc - tion of a sword-thrust .

		The fellow is arrested by a policeman before the officer reaches the spot , and thus the opportunity of clearing his tarnished honor is forever lost .

		It sounds like a story from bur - lesque opera , but is sadly true to German military conditions .

		Every one of the officer 's friends and associates agrees that resignation is the only course open to him to avoid the scandal of a dismissal in disgrace , and even the heroine weakens and gives him up -- although we are led to suppose that she loves him passionately -- when he comes to her for consolation , bat in civilian dress .

		It seems that the uniform rather than the man was what she had
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		329 eared for all the time .

		Od '' och a heroine sympa - thy would be wasted , and she shall have none of onrs .

		This object lesson in the inward meaning of militarism is not lost upon the English observer , who leaves
Germany	LOCATION	quite cured of the notion that his own country should receive the German gospel .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	's '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	ander the Sea '' ia one of the author 's most fantastic imaginings .

		As once before , he Ukes us to the remote
Pacific	LOCATION	, and we are made to contemplate a strange island fast - ness , the home of a gang of wreckers , whose captain has wooed and won a fair English maiden and brought her to this inaccessible spot She does not know the horrors of the life before her until it is too late to turn back .

		How she is eventually res - cued by a faithful sailor friend of her early days is the snbsUnce of the narrative .

		The story gets iu name from a curious subterranean or submarine re - treat to which the islanders repair when certain dangerous miasms make the air of the island pois - onous .

		The author does not balk at the wildest improbabilities , but he is sufficiently practiced in his art to keep them from seeming wholly incredi - ble , at least for the moment .

		From this romance to the romance of an actual mermaid the transition is natural , and a mermaid is the heroine of - The Sea Lady , '' which is the title of the latest contrivance of Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		The mermaid is a charming creature of her kind , who wearies of a watery life , and determines to seek the society of humankind .

		So she bobs up one day in the midst of a bathing party , pretending to be a maiden in distress attacked by the cramps .

		This , considering her character , is a decidedly '' fishy '' story , but it serves its purpose .

		She is duly rescued , and only after she has been taken ashore by her new friends is the discovery made of her distinctive anatomy .

		Her rescuers are kind - hearted , and accede to her request to be allowed to live with them .

		She poses as an invalid , and is taken about in a chair , so arrayed as to conceal the distinctive mark of her race .

		Since the upper half of her is a beautiful young woman with golden hair , and since she is both intelligent and well read , she enjoys a pronounced social success .

		Her siren charms presently captivate the rising statesman who serves for a hero , and she lures him away from the serious young woman to whom he is betrothed .

		At last , he follows her to the sea , and together they plunge into the unknown .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	carries off these difficult situations with his customary inge - nuity , and makes a story that is readable , if not exactly convincing .

		There is a good deal of quiet humor in the book , especially in its delineation of the serious young woman -LRB- who wants to be like one of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's heroines -RRB- , and its ac - eonnt of the way in which mermaids are supplied with the reading matter which keeps them informed about the ways of the upper world .

		NOTES ON NOVELS .

		Mr.
Will Payne	PERSON	was one of the first American writers to see the romantic possibilities of the modern world of commerce and fiQance , and in his literary work be has kept himself pretty clearly within that field .

		The col - leetioD of novelettes and short stories which make up his volume , '' On Fortone 's Road '' -LRB- MeClarg -RRB- , deal with banking , various forms of specalation in prodnoe aad stocks , with sordid commercial politics , and with manufacturing and labor unions .

		Into each is woven skilfully the deeper human interest of the affections , and all betrav an intimate acquaintance with the details of the business involved .

		One , '' The Little Lame Boy , '' is especially tender and graceful , disclosing the suc - cessful man of affairs at the moment when he finds himself fairly shut out from the inner life of his wife and child , an unintentional but inevitable retribation for his own engrossment in his profession .

		Photo - graphic in its fidelity to city life to-day , Mr.
Payne	PERSON	's work is literary in its snggestiveness and reserve .

Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The titular hero is an Englishman in the service of Ismail the last Khedive , and bis trusted ad - viser because he is poor but honest and an inveterate teller of troth and interpreter of European sentiment .

		Though small of stature and almost gfirlish in appear - ance ,
Donovan	PERSON	is a mighty man of valor and resonrceful as a fox , extricating himself and his friends from the most hopeless of dilemmas .

		The volume closes with several tales of
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	in Egyptian campaign - ing , Sir Gilbert greatly daring in depicting an Irishman in the ranks who is certain to provoke comparisons with the immortal
Terence Mulvaoey	PERSON	.

		Episodic in its char - acter , the book is still one to be read , for information hardly less than for pleasure .

		Several years ago Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	wrote a short storv in which be painted a character , the son of a race of soldiers , who showed himself a coward in being afraid of cowardice , though at heart one of the bravest of the brave .

		It was a situation so striking and so vividly told that it must always linger in the memory of its readers .

		Now Mr.
Mason	PERSON	has expanded this brief tale into a romance of fonr hundred pages , which he names '' The Four Feathers '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- .

		The result is an inter - esting experiment in literary technique , and one which is in the main snoeessful .

		Here the hero resigns from the service just as his command is ordered to the front .

		Three of his brother officers detect the device , which was none too subtle at best .

		Returning to the girl to whom he is betrothed , the poor fellow receives a box containing three white feathers and the cards of bis soldier companions .

		The girl breaks the engagement to marrv , and adds the fourth feather .

		The rest of the book describes the exhibitions of calm and collected courage by which the lost estate and self-respect are restored , and has in addition a well-developed love story entwined with the one already mentioned .

		`` The Diary of a Saint '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an unusual book , old-fashioned in its manner of telling the story through the device of a day-by-day journal , and highly idealized in the sonl of the good woman who writes it .

		She is liberal in her views concerning dogmatic religion , and is therefore held in reproach by many of her neighbors .

		But as suffering comes to these neigh - bors she plnckily helps them to bear their burdens , 880 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, taking almost more than she should in adopting the orphaned child of an unfortunate mother whom she nurses .

		She appears at the beginning of the diary as engaged to a young man who had her dead father 's entire approval ; but she voluntarily breaks the engage - ment when another woman 's claims intervene .

		Much suffering came to her in the cumulative manner which is characteristic of suffering at times , but she finds strength to bear it all .

		The book is one of the best that Mr.
Arlo Bates	PERSON	has written , showing an unex - pected knowledge of other than his customary fields .

		In '' Doctor Bryson '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Mr.
Frank H. Spearman	PERSON	has depicted the career of a modern oculist , quite at the head of his profession in the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		He falls in love with a wife whose selfish husband abandoned her , long before the story opens , when her father 's failure deprived her of the wealth he had mar - ried her for .

		This lady 's little daughter has suffered a serious accident to one of her eyes , and it is through this circumstance that the man and woman come to - gether , though they are boarding in the same establish - ment .

		Necessarily , diseases of the eye occupy a fore - most place in the detail of the book , though it can not be said that the profession of the oculist is any more prominent here than the profession of the soldier in stories of war or of the professional trickster in picar - esque romance .

		The story indeed is a faithful picture of a really important factor in modern life which has remained without fictional celebration until now .

		It is a complete change from Mr.
Spearman	PERSON	's earlier tales of adventure in the railway service , and , though longer and better sustained than these , it is not their equal in treatment or interest .

		Miss
Louise Forsslund	PERSON	has written a striking book in `` The Ship of Dreams '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , a story of the de - generate descendants of an aristocratic
Long Island	LOCATION	family , colonial in its origin .

		The sin of the heir to a great estate follows him and his descendants through life , carrying its terrible consequences into the life of a beautiful young girl , of gentle nature in spite of sordid and forbidding surroundings .

		The theme is worked out in elaborate detail , the characters are numerous and well defined , the scenes unusual and with an exotic flavor in spite of the locality , and the book as a whole striking and indicative of power .

		Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	reaches down to the very bottom of the human heart in bis collection of short stories , dealing with the aborigines of
Alaska	LOCATION	, entitled '' The Children of the Frost '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Most of these tales are written without reference to the white race , exhibiting the native tribes in the full possession of their own lands and lives .

		Mr.
London	LOCATION	is able to ana - lyze savage motives and methods , and the great primal forces swaying mankind stand bare but not repellent in his presentation .

		The other stories have to do with the coming of '' civilization , '' and here the author 's sym - pathy for the weaker men and women who are driven to the wall is quite the finest thing in the book , just as its inexorableness is the harshest .

		It is an unusual field that this young western writer has made his own , and his discoveries are of value .

		The
Baroness von Hutten	PERSON	has for the principal figure in `` Our Lady of the Beeches '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a young American woman , married to an Hungarian noble with whose manner of life she is not in full accord .

		A letter written to an American essayist and man of science leads to a correspondence in which both parties conceal their identities .

		It chances that the man has a guide in the
Maine	LOCATION	woods who , as he discovers , is husband to the noblewoman 's old nurse , and through this means the two are brought into contact under romantic and uncon - ventional conditions .

		Love is declared -- and there the story ends .

		It is idyllic and replete with delicate senti - ment , varied by an intimate knowlege of the relations of the sexes and a wide acquaintance with the world .

		The book is unusual in many particulars , and full of literary flavor .

		The crude modernity which has flavored so mnch of Miss
Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler	PERSON	's work is lacking to a degree in her `` Fuel of Fire '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In its stead is used an ancient superstition foretelling the downfall of a family the history of which goes back to mediaeval times .

		The story is entirely of the present day , except for the brief prologue , which declares that
Baxendale Hall	ORGANIZATION	must be burned down thrice .

		Two - thirds of the prediction have been fulfilled at the open - ing of the story , which turns largely on the various suspicions attaching to the person who is supposed to have burnt it down -- but on almost the last page , it turns out to be no person at all .

		There is a love story , wholly free from morbidity , running through the book .

		Mrs.
Helen Choate	PERSON	Prince has written many novels which have displayed her mastery of English , but none of them shows the grasp upon human affairs of her latest , `` The Strongest Master '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It is the story of a living soul that sought redemption .

		The hero , a young man with everything in life before him , is expelled from
Harvard	LOCATION	for gambling , just as he is about to get his degree .

		He realizes to the full what a mistake his life has been , and sets his face toward reformation .

		Obtaining a situation in a factory , he comes to intimacy with a labor leader , a sentimentalist and idealist , as so many are .

		Not himself alone , but the entire world , comes into his plans for regeneration , and he suffers vicariously with the unfortunate and un - happy .

		Love comes to him then , and with it a clearer insight into actualities .

		With no abatement of his idealism , he finds a way to happiness and restoration to his father 's affections at once .

		The book is an excellent one , and Mrs. Prince 's own comprehension of the broader democracy of life not the least encouraging element in it .

		The Very Reverend

Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , utilizes the navy for no more des - perate purpose than color and atmosphere .

		A little less than half of the finely-illustrated volume is given up to the novel from which it takes its name , a story in which the hero is a naval officer , the heroine the granddaughter of a naval officer , and most of the other characters con - nected with the sea .

		The story is well conceived , and told with a vividness which leaves little to be desired .

		The book shows an inti - mate knowledge of local political affairs and methods , contains many characters which stand out as types , and exhibits painstaking workmanship and no small literary ability .

		With a mind mellowed by recollection , he con - ceives for her a mild , middle-aged affection , which he endeavois to convert into a real passion by consulting the books in his library .

		It would be manifestly unfair to both author and reader to anticipate the story fur - ther , so much pleasure is certain to result from its per - usal .

		Really , the only fault to be found with the book is its brevity .

		Miss
Eleanor Gates	PERSON	's '' The Biography of a Prairie Girl '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a pleasant bit of realism , rem - iniscent in its point of view of some recent Scotch romances .

		An .

		` American family in the
Dakotas	LOCATION	, made up of three brothers and a sister , passes through all sorts of difficulties , tragic and trivial , only to triumph over them with fine courage and persistency .

		The nat - ural scenery about them is fully realized by the little heroine , and she fiads her pleasure in this and in her desultory studies .

		Miss Gates is fortunate in inter - preting these things to her readers , who will rise from the book with an increased respect for the men and women now wresting the living of the world from its soil at the cost of isolation and spiritual hardship .

		This is a real western novel , and the absence of so-called '' love interest '' makes it all the better reading .

		Were it not for the incredulity that must follow upon a forced acceptance of the idea that convicts who have served out their terms are entitled to fnll reinstatement in modem society , '' The Things That Are Caesar 's '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , by Mr.
Reginald Wright Rauffman	PERSON	, would be an excellent book .

		In this case it is a bishop of the Anglican Church who finds occupation for his nephew after the latter 's release from the penitentiary .

		As the facts of his former life become known , the ex-convict is of course thrown back upon his criminal pursuits , if he is to make a living at all .

		That he is strong enough to resist crime in the face of starvation , that he finds a former prison-mate his only friend , and that a good woman should not withold her love because of his early career , combine to give the book real interest .

		The basic problem remains unsolved , as it must , but the story is a great improvement in every respect upon ''

		In `` The Lady of the Barge '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,

W. W. Jacobs	PERSON	returns to an earlier manner with a succession of stories of coasting craft , delightfully naive and humorous , in nearly all of which a woman or two sacceeds in placing the men with whom she is asso - ciated in laughable predicaments .

		One or two of the tales deal with sailors on the high seas , and three at least have the element of horror and mystery and crime predominant .

		All are very brief , wholly episodic , and all interesting .

		As in former collections of his tales , Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	avoids the element of pathos to a marked degree .

		But the foibles of humankind are dealt with gently in every case , and the laughter is always with - out rancor .

		Mr.

J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In its stead will be found something of the nni - Tcrsality of the modem Jew , and his ability to retain his elaborate ceremonial and rabbinical learning under circumstances the most adverse .

		It is evident from phrases in the book , as well as from the frontispiece to the volume , that the scene of Mr.

		A military engineer in the days when gunpowder was first finding general use in
Europe	LOCATION	is brought before a mixed tri - bunal , military and ecclesiastical , and the crime of betraying military secrets brought home to him .

		He pleads nothing in extenuation , but makes open confes - sion of the fact that he has committed every other known crime besides , violating the commands of church and state with entire impartiality .

		The lay member of the tribunal shows a somewhat unholy interest in the adventures which brought this result about , and , though the man is under condemnation to death , permits his execution to be deferred for the purpose of allowing him to disclose his methods of infraction of the moral and civil law .

		A careful study of a portion of the struggle be - tween the States gives him command of the scene and the participants down to the most minute details .

		To this , in order to enable the reader to follow both sides of the contest , is added a confusion of identities .

		In the first book it was a man with double identity ; in the latest it is a pair of unwitting twins , one federal and one confederate , who contribute to the complications , even up to the daring point of a marriage through error .

		There is a simplicity about Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's narrative , an absence of sophistication , which is appealing to those jaded with psychological complexities ; and with the exception of a single chapter there is a real advance in literary skill and manner of expression . ''

		When Love Is Young '' was a book which caught the transient affections of childhood so successfully that one could have been pardoned for believing a repe - tition of the same feat impossible .

		But Mr.

Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It deals with the elders of a family and the children also , as seen with a boy 's eyes .

		There are eight tales , -- or chapters , as they might have been called , -- and in every one of them the small boy 's point of view is set forth with a charming accuracy , enabling the oldest of fogies to re - new his own youth .

		The humor is real , deepening into tears at times , -- and that not always when sorrow comes to the happy little family .

		A mock trial is arranged for , and the attendance of the entire
Jackson	PERSON	family secured .

		The objections of the old grandmother that the same sort of conduct among whites leads to no interference , and the wife 's plea that if she is satisfied -- and she is -- she sees no reason why the rest of the world should not be , bring about an acquittal .

		Few recent books have in them so much of genuine human nature as this .

		The short stories which
Miss Josephine Dodge	ORGANIZATION	Das - kam has brought together in a volume bearing the title of the initial tale , '' Whom the Gods Destroyed '' -LRB-

Herr Peter Rosegger	PERSON	's third novel , which appears in English under the title , `` The Earth and the Fullness Thereof : A Romance of Modern
Styria	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putuam -RRB- .

		The hero is a young man who has turned newspaper writer after his service in the Austrian army , until , disgusted with city life , he undertakes to earn a livelihood in the country .

		After many rebuffs , the recounting of which is redolent of humor , he secures a position on a peasant 's farm , and becomes the head servant .

		There is a pretty girl in the family , the win - ning of whom takes more time than the city man had at first supposed .

		The style of the book , like its subject-matter , differs greatly from
Herr Rosegger	PERSON	's other novels as they are known in
America	LOCATION	, being lighter and more hopeful in tone and exhibiting a deeper knowledge of city life .

		There is much more humor , too , though it is of the Teutonic order .

		The impres - sion left is one of great good nature and peace with all the world .

		By taking the beginning of Babylonian greatness rather than its ending , Mr.
Josiah M. Ward	PERSON	has given his '' Come with Me into Babylon '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- not only distinction of theme , but has left himself quite free from the claims of supernaturalism ' inherent in the scriptural narrative of the fall of that great city .

		Historically , his hero is
Nebuchadnezzar	LOCATION	, not yet elevated to the throne , but bearing a foremost part in bringing
Nineveh	LOCATION	to the ground with the assistance of the Medes , Per - sians , and other allies .

		It is the prince of one of these Asiatic tribes who is most in the reader 's eye , however , and a strong and heroic figure has been made of him .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has a full comprehension of the extent to which the peoples of
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	were priest-ridden in the period he has chosen for celebration , and he has made excellent use of the great banking bouse of
Egibi	LOCATION	, and of the Jews who were already in
Babylon	LOCATION	.

		The very absence of authentic history has given him a latitude , which has been wisely used , and the book is uniformly interesting .

		Miss
Alice Woods	PERSON	is both author and illustrator of `` Edges '' -LRB-
Bowen-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a romance of the
New England	LOCATION	coast and of the studios of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The former locality serves to introduce two art students of different sexes , and with them a well-drawn little Yankee urchin who obtains the reader 's heart through his quaint natur - alness .

		After the two painters have thoroughly wrapped themselves up in one another , the heroine goes to the French capital , and increases her lover 's interest by a number of charming letters which eke out the narrative .

		At last he follows her , and the inevitable happens .

		There is a full flavor of the better sort of bohemian life everywhere in the book .

		The illustrations are clever ; but the tone of the paper used in the volume , a pallid yellow , is far from prepossessing .

		Mr.
Julian Ralph	PERSON	has written many better books than '' The Millionairess '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is a sequel to his '' An Angel in a Web , '' and like most sequels , a dis - appointment .

		The two books have the same heroine , but whereas in the former story she was coming into her great fortune , in the latter she is learning how to use it .

		A large part of the book is devoted to a dem - onstration of the differences between the '' smart set , '' which appears to be nearly everthing it ought not to be , and the smaller social circle of picked men and women who have succeeded in literature and the other arts or have achieved a name for actually doing some - thing in the world .

		Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	is certainly capable of better things .

		Deteetive stories , since they invariably deal with the fundamental passions of hnman nature , possess an in - terest not always proportionate to their literary worth .

		A ease in point is Mr.
E. W. Hornung	PERSON	's '' The Shadow of the Rope '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , where the murder of an elderly miser is followed by a series of daring attempts to rob bis heirs of the jewels of which bis wealth largely consisted .

		To complicate the problem there is a oon - fnsioD of indentities and a direction of suspicion toward an innocent person , who serves as the hero of the ro - mance , the heiress of the miser being the heroine .

		It is only just to say that the story is interesting to a de - gree , and quite as good of its kiod as any detective story recently written .

		With his pseudo-historical romance of '' The Climax '' -LRB-
C. M Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Charles Felton Pidgin	PERSON	has car - ried nearly to the point of absurdity the fashion set by Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	in '' The Conqueror . ''

		The earlier - chapters read , indeed , as if Mr.
Pidgin	PERSON	intended his book as an antidote to Mrs.
Atberton	PERSON	's panegyric of
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	, though Mr.
Pidgin	PERSON	attacks
Jeffer	PERSON	- son quite as strongly as does Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	.

		His hero is
Aaron Burr	PERSON	, erected to the statnre of a demi-god .

		The actualities are left after a few pages , and the story strikes oat into the conjectural .

		Burr is elected president of the
United States	LOCATION	; he conquers
Mexico	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	,
South America	LOCATION	, and leaves the stars and stripes waving over the entire continent .

		By wise legislation be brings the people of this vast territory into peace and plenty , and passes away as the crowning figure of all human history .

		Mr.
Pidgin	PERSON	's literary powers are too limited to bring - conviction to his readers , and the book is really one for the curious .

		There is a return to a day almost forgotten in politer letters in Mrs.
Augusta Evans Wilson	PERSON	's '' A Speckled Bird '' -LRB-
Dillingham	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Little has been learned and nothing forgotten , apparently , by Mrs.
Wilson	PERSON	since the production of `` St. Elmo '' -- and that was in
1866	DATE	.

		The new book is crowded with detail and episode , -- enough , almost , for six books as they are written nowa - days .

		There is the same use of the abstruse knowledge to be gleaned from popular encyclopedias .

		The men are of astonishing taxe and learning and dtaiaeter , either very good or very bad .

		The women are paragons of their sex , and the victims of circumstances which give them an insistent apfteal to sentiment .

		Mrs.
Wilson	PERSON	was a pioneer in the demand for the higher education of women , and her latest heroine is a college graduate accordingly .

		The story turns on the love this girl bears to her father , a plausible and inevitable scoundrel who began his downward career as a carpetbagger .

		The one novelty in the book is a labor agitator , who is so - cialist and anarchist in one .

		Unquestionably `` A Speckled Bird '' will be widely read , and that by those to whom books in a later manner make no appeal whatever - Miss Le Feurre 's stories have always an insistent strain of evangelical Christianity running through them , and her latest , '' A Daughter of the Sea '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , is no exception .

		The scene is laid upon a rocky shore in
England	LOCATION	, where a young girl grows up as free as the winds and waves about her .

		Her companions , fisher - folk by occupation , are wreckers whenever opportunity offers , and it is the heroine 's self-imposed duty to bring these people to a realization of the claims of humanity .

		The girl has a guardian who appears in the book chiefly for the purpose of marrying her in all her innocence to one who is little more than an acquaintance , thoagfa a man of cultivation and letters .

		Single-handed , witb - oat her husband 's knowledge , she undertakes the work of warning vessels away from the threatening coast , and her reward comes at the close of the book .

		A clergyman plays an imptortant part in laying the way for the change effected in the fishers ' minds and souls , and his crowu of glory is given him in another manner .

		The book is interesting and out of the ordinary .

		It is the Dorsetshire of
William Barnes	PERSON	which one meets in '' The Manor Farm '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Mrs.
Francis BlundeU	PERSON	-- ''
M. E. Francis	PERSON	. ''

		Quotations from
Barnes	ORGANIZATION	's poems in the dialect of the countryside head every chapter .

		An estate held for several generations by a family of yeomen has been divided in days gone by and is now held by two cousins .

		One has a son , the other a daughter ; and , naturally enough , the two are affianced to one another while yet in infancy .

		And , no less naturally , the boy and girl , growing up in the closest intimacy , rebel against the decree they had no share in making .

		The young man earries his revolt to the point of leaving home , a eta a tad by a sudden in - fatuation for a pretty but calculating schoolmistress from a neighboring town .

		After he has left home and suffered disinheritance in consequence , her reason for listening to his suit is gone , and he comes forth sadly disillusioned .

		The rest of the argument may safely be left to the reader 's imagination .

		It is a pleasant little tale , the dialect not being too recondite for Amerieaa readers , and the pastoral picture being clearly drawn .

		Life is still worth living in rural
England	LOCATION	, as this story proves .

		Mrs.
Kate Upson CUrk	PERSON	, the author of '' White But - terflies , '' has written another idyllic story of semi-rural life , calling it '' Up the Witch Brook Road '' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The scene is laid somewhere in the in - terior of the country at a period before the civil war .

		Two young Bostonians come into the region prospecting for gold , with little chance of finding it .

		They intro - duce an agreeable flutter in a dore-cote of young women , -- the aunts or cousins once removed of the little giri who tells the story .

		What seems to be a murder throws the little community into a state of prime excitement , wherein the prejudice of the rustic against the city man seems to threaten the very lives of the men from
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The spirit of the book , in spite of this and of another tragedy recorded , is simple , sweet , and serene , and serves to convey an accurate picture of a distant day .

		Villains eome to the front in Mr.
S. Levett-Yeats	PERSON	's later romances , and `` The Lord Protector '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- is qoite without a hero except as
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	may be supposed to occupy the centre of tbe stage .

		And it is a thorough-going rascal , a deceiver of women and a traitor to any cause , who serves as the protagonist here .

		His unfaithfulness leads to his complete undoing , and if ever an evil doer had poetical justice meted out to him it is this one .

		There is the same vividness of con - ception and interesting historical detail that have marked the earlier work of this author , and the scriptural lan - guage in the months of the followers of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	adds an element rarely found in stories of the sword - and-cloak order .

		Mr.

		834 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Having written an interesting drama , Mr.
Opie	PERSON	Read has turned it into a book not so interesting , calling it still `` The Starbucks '' -LRB-
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The reduction to fiction form of a play that has been acted is certain to give the narrative a quality that makes against litera - ture of the better sort , and it is rather as a souvenir of the play than as a work in itself that the volume is valuable .

		The story is concerned with the mountaineers of
Tennessee	LOCATION	, among whom a city woman and her nephew take refuge against the more intense life of civilization .

		The
Starbuck	PERSON	family shelters them , and a double romance springs up between the aunt and preacher son , and the nephew and pretty daughter .

		There is a great deal of the sort of sentiment that ap - peals to the play-going public in the story , and there is a great deal too much dialogue , -- inherited faults from the original dramatization .

		Yet Mr.
Read	PERSON	is so familiar with his ground , and the characters are so well differ - entiated , that the story is entirely readable .

		In `` Wolfville Nights '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , another book of the sort that Mr.
Alfred Lewis	PERSON	has identified himself with in recent years , there is no apparent diminution of unusual incident , though the scene and characters are those which have already done service in three or four previously-published volumes .

		These
Wolfville	LOCATION	stories , however , since they depict a frontier cattle town in days which have gone for ever , are typical of so much in our shifting civilization that we can hardly have too much of them from one who has lived the life he describes .

		The dialect itself , a wonderful admixture of uncouth phrasing and nervous idiom , is well worth preserving .

		The most original part of the new volume is the ex - tended dedication to Colonel
William Greene Sterrett	PERSON	, who has been assigned so prominent a place in all the annals of
Wolfville	LOCATION	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		It 18 nearly thirty years since the ^ ^ SnlJT
Chevalier D'Arneth	PERSON	, director of the Imperial archives of
Austria	LOCATION	, pub - lished the Correspondance secrete entre
Marie ThSrhse	PERSON	et le comte de Mercy - Argenteau .

		From these letters Miss
Lillian C. Smythe	PERSON	has selected passages for translation and commeDt , and has put the whole into two Tolumes aggregating 700 pages , under the title '' The Guardian of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	'' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		Even those unacquainted with the letters in their original form will be able to discover from these selections that the correspondence is indis - pensable for the study of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	's devel - opment .

		Unhappily , the commentator has not made the wisest use of her opportunity .

		It is impossible to edit such letters without some knowledge of the condition of
France	LOCATION	during the eighteenth century beyond that which may be gained from an uncrit - ical familiarity with the memoirs of the period .

		As the author 's comments are thrown into the form of a narrative this defect becomes more glaring .

		For example , she speaks of the abolition of the old parlia - ments by Maupeou as '' the first grapple between the people and the despotism of royalty . ''

		Whatever this attempted reform may have been , it was not that .

		She further declares that the edict of
1781	DATE	, requir - ing all candidates for lieutenancies in the army to show four generations of nobility on the father 's side , '' spread despair and furious resentment in the middle classes of
France	LOCATION	, and flung them back into the serfdom of the peasantry , '' -- a fate which , to say the least , is ill-described , since very few of the peasants were serfs .

		She also becomes eloquent over the legendary ^ acie de famine .

		In her references to
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		she heaps up adjectives expressive of loathing .

		In one passage she calls him `` an im - becile -- a waddling , blinking , corpulent , bungling , incapable imbecile , defective in body , deficient in mind , with the low receding forehead of an idiot , and a monstrous chin , that measured the third of his face . ''

		In spite of this outburst , she reproduces -LRB- opposite page 378 -RRB- a `` magnificent '' portrait of
Louis	LOCATION	, presented to Mercy - Argenteau in
1776	DATE	.

		This is certainly the most flattering portrait of the king in existence , and represents him as a handsome , rather slender man .

		The author 's ptyle shows a headlong liveliness mistaken for esprit .

		She con - stantly throws in French phrases easily translatable , which fail in their present form to add the desired piquancy to the expression of thought .

		Notwith - standing these defects , it is possible by a judicious use of the selections to form some impression of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	's character between
1770	DATE	and
1778	DATE	.

		It is rather exceptional in present - plTcautJ .

		day scholarship to read in the pre - face of a book such as Professor
Dunning	PERSON	's '' Political Theories , Ancient and Mod em '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- words so modest as the following r '' If the successive transformations through which the political consciousness of men has passed from early antiquity to modern times are rendered in any degree more intelligible , or even if any sugges - tion is given through which another pen may here - after render them more intelligible , this volume will not have been issued in vain . ''

		This seems almost too unassuming an attitude for a writer who must have undertaken a work of that character not as a diversion , but with a definite ambition of supplying a want and enriching our knowledge .

		Perhaps this attitude is inspired by an examination of the pro- found and masterly work of
Gierke	PERSON	lately translated into English , which of course can not help influ - encing the reader 's opinion of Professor
Dunning	PERSON	's treatment of the same period .

		Be this as it may , his book is throughout agreeably unassuming in tone ; the author nowhere thrusts forward his learn - ing to be admired , -- indeed , he can hardly be said to express an opinion with a personal note in it .

		but gravely and dispassionately follows up his subject from
Plato	LOCATION	to
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	.

		The discussion of po - litical theories is in each case preceded by a sketch of the political history of the period , and of the prevailing form of government from whose practices the philosophers drew their experience of politics in general .

		These sketches appear to us the least sat - isfactory parts of the book .

		THE DIAL 835 and
Rome	LOCATION	they are enperflnoas , and contain nothing bat what is alread j known ; and in the case of medisTal political history , the review is hardly comprehenBiTe enongh .

		It is not merely with the empire and the papacy , the two phases of original power , that a discnssion of this kind onght to be concerned , bat also with the delegated power which meant feudal rule and was eqaivalent to more than half the power in the state .

		An eqaally important phase was city self-gOTernment .

		If , instead of confining himself so entirely to the philosophical digressions of the schoolmen , with their composite of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and Church-law , the author had nndertaken to extract the workable and equally potent theories of government presented in the laws and customs , the result for Uie medieval period might have been less halting and indefinite .

		The ecclesiastical writers , although excellently equipped for presenting the ideas of the Church on universal government , had altogether too vast and vague a conception of rule to enlighten us upon what was in reality the theory of mediaeval politics .

		On the other hand , the author 's own treatment of these questions is original , and may help to dispel from the student 's mind the current opinion , entertained too long , that the Middle Age was unpolitical .

		In - deed , the period of legislation and written consti - totions was not yet come ; but the making of const !

		- ' tations was nevertheless an every-day practice .

		The book manifests extensive reading , and presents results with great clearness ; not a word is wasted , everything serves its proper purpose of giving in - formation and instruction .

		Tit anmllife .

		That the romantic and the realistic have long since joined hands in
America	LOCATION	, has been shown by abun - dant evidence ; and new proof is furnished by Mr.
R. G. Thwaites	PERSON	, in his recent biography of the great hunter of
Kentucky	LOCATION	,
Daniel Boone	PERSON	, issued as one of the series of `` Life Histories '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		This remarkable career is here traced graphic - ally from beginning to end .

		The restlessness of the habitual woodsman made
Boone	PERSON	continuously a pioneer , and four several times he abandoned a settled neighborhood for a new and farther advanced position on the very frontier of civilization ; for he always found the settlements '' too crowded . ''

		and he ever required , as he once declared , '' more elbow - room . ''

		even when making his last remove , at the age of sixty-five .

		Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's portraiture of the forest huntsman , Indian warrior , frontier settler , border surveyor , military commander , and Western statesman , gives a vivid idea of the characteristics of this pioneer in many States .

		While
Boone	PERSON	was never a great man nor a brilliant leader , and was always unsuccessful in his personal speculations , yet he was an excellent and a picturesque example of those sturdy yeomen whose work it was to de - velop the greatness of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley .

		His contributions to that work , and the elements of rugged strength which made him successful as a • / • fTMl pioneer and have endeared his memory to the stren - noas youth of every generation since his own , are made clearly manifest in this volume .

		The `` short and simple annals '' of the advance-guard of our Western settlements are here seen to be of the staff from which romance is woven , and to be , indeed , essentially and intrinsically romantic .

		Those who have followed with interest the fortunes of '' Alice of Old Vincennes '' and her comi -RRB- eers , in march , raid , and battle , and through adventure , captare , and hardship , to final triumph , may find idl the romance of the novelist duplicated in this recital of the cold facts of one life , spent in the very fields and forests , and along the same frontier occupied by the novelist 's story , and in the company , too , of the very characters of oar frontier history who were made to live and act in the pages of that stir - ring romance .

		Yet it was once lamented that there was so little of the romantic in
America	LOCATION	.

		The completion of Professor Bald - win 's ' • Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology '' is itself a notable event .

		The work was began five years ago ; the first toI - ame appeared a year ago , and was reviewed in The Dial of
October 16 , 1901	DATE	; the third volume will be devoted to Bibliographies , and is in a measure a separate work .

		All that was said of the first vol - ume applies with increased emphasis to the work as a whole .

		It is a distinct achievement to have car - ried through so successfully an undertaking of this kind ; and while the work is international in char - acter , it can fairly be set down as a highly creditable testimonial to the philosophers and psychologists of
America	LOCATION	.

		It testifies at once to the very great importance which is attached to these subjects in modern thought , and to the characteristically prom - inent position that these studies occupy in the Amer - ican intellectual life .

		It seems likely that the various needs of the various persons who will go to this dic - tionary for help , will be reasonably satisfied .

		The encyclop '' dic features of the work are decidedly to be commended ; and on the whole those articles are most valuable that have been presented with sufficient deUil to give some taste of the spirit of inquiry that has been instrumental in formulating the results set down .

		Had all the articles been treated with the ful - ness accorded to those on Logic , the work would have extended to double its present size ; while the treat - ment of the
Oriental Philosophies	ORGANIZATION	is out of all pro- portion to that of any other topic whatever .

		Like - wise it is true that on several important matters the dictionary is no more adequate than one not devoted to the special disciplines which it covers .

		Such failures of proportion are inevitable when so many minds contribute to so complex a task ; and the editor has , in the main , reduced them to a min - imum .

		He has likewise been more than liberal in the treatment accorded to such topics as Telepathy and
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	; many will conclude that such hospitality is in a measure misplaced , not per se , but in the consequences that are apt to ensue 836 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, therefrom .

		Bat a criticism that is itself sane and generoas will have little to excuse and much to ap - plaud in the assignments of parts and the manner of their execution .

		The author , who was himself of the honorable procession of eminent citizens , knew his subjects well , participated in a very large part of the events worth narrating in a town history , and may well say to his readers , ''

		The kindly gossip of such a townsman will of course appeal , first of all , to the inhabitants of that particular part of the modern
Boston	LOCATION	, and their immediate friends and relatives .

		But the list of names of those who are the subjects of these reminiscences will bespeak for Mr.

		The work is to fill two volumes , and the first of them , extending to the close of the eighteenth century , is now at hand .

		While we can hardly agree with the editor in thinking that Rus - sian is soon destined to take an important place in the American educational curriculum , we are sure that he has done us a valuable service in supplying this generous representation of the literature of his country , for English translations from the Russian have thus far been few in number -LRB- except for the novelists -RRB- and poor in quality , and the his - tory of Russian literature from the earliest times down to the last century is practically a sealed book to most of our readers .

		Pushkin we know , and
Gogol	PERSON	, and their successors , but concerning Russian literature more than a hundred years old the gen - eral public has practically no fund of information .

		A name of two in the present volume -- Lomonosov or Derzhavin -- may awaken some association , but most of the names mentioned are absolutely un - known .

		In his introductory pages .

		Professor
Wiener	PERSON	gives us a conspectus of existing English translation and criticism , and a meagre showing it makes .

		After a sketch of the history of Russian literature , in thirty or forty pages , he begins his proper task with a translation of the treaty with the Greeks made in 911 .

		Legal documents , ecclesiastical writings and chronicles are chiefly characteristic of the first sec - tion of the work , although we find here also a few songs and the striking epic of `` The Word of Igor 's Armament . ''

		Then follows a section of folklore , including folksongs and fables , and then a section devoted to the writers of the eighteenth century .

		Most of the translations have been made expressly for this work , although the editor has not hesitated to draw upon the material offered by earlier trans - lators .

		His debt is thus considerable to Sir
John Bo	PERSON	wring -LRB- although the Derzhavin '' Ode to God '' is given in a less familiar but more literal version -RRB- , and to the remarkable work of Mrs.
Edward Robin	PERSON	- son -LRB- '' Talvi '' -RRB- which '' is authoritative even now in many departments that have not been overthrown by later investigations . ''

		We shall await with much interest the concluding volume of this work , which will deal with the fairly familiar writers and books of the nineteenth century .

		Literary
Europe	LOCATION	The eighth volume in point of pub - in the age lication , and the ninth in the serial of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	.

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's `` Periods of European Literature '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- has just appeared .

		It is entitled '' The Mid-Eighteenth Century , '' and is the work of Mr.
J. H. Millar	PERSON	.

		The period is exactly that of the literary career of Vol - taire , who is naturally the most conspicuous figure among the many dealt with .

		The exigencies of the series to which this book belongs have made it bet - ter to exclude from the volume such English writers as Swift and Pope , who belong to the Augustan Age , as well as
Lessing	PERSON	, who will be considered in a later volume dealing with the great age of German liter - ature .

		Even
Rousseau	PERSON	and Diderot are here con - sidered only in part , their later work being reserved for final judgment in the history of '' The Romantic Revolt . ''

		The literatures of
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	make up nine-tenths of the contents of the present volume .

		The opening two chapters are devoted to
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Montesquieu	LOCATION	, and the group of ''
Encyclo	PERSON	- psBdia writers '' ; then follows a chapter on English philosophy ; then five further chapters concerning both French and English works in the five depart -

Wieland	LOCATION	,
Ewald	PERSON	,
Swedenborg	PERSON	,
Goldoni	LOCATION	, and Metastasio , to mention only a few names .

		Mr.
Millar	PERSON	has performed his task in a workmanlike manner , and combined with scholarlj aeqaaintanee with his subject an attractive style .

		When a volume of theatrical renii - niscences from the pen of
Clara Morris	ORGANIZATION	is announced , we look for - ward to its publication with pleasurable anticipations based upon the author 's exceptional qualifications for her task .

		The volume of her ' • Stage Confi - dences '' -LRB-
Lothrop Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains many choice bits , with little of that unnecessary padding frequently resorted to in similar volumes to fill space .

		In short , it is a characteristically frank and racy book .

		Opening with a chapter dedicated to the '' stage-struck '' girl , warning her of obstAcles and hindrances with the candor of one who has known them all , the author talks with humor , point , and charm of the mysterious and alluring life be - hind the footlights : she gives us peeps at the shams and deceptions of the stage , and in a peculiarly open manner strips it of its false glitter .

		The most in - teresting portions of the book are made up of the little stories of the actress ' own career which show how truly the most dramatic scenes in plays reflect the happenings of actual life .

		The interspersed illustrations are exceedingly life-like , and a number are valuable as portraits of a by-gone generation of men and women of more or less talent and dis - tinction .

		Vtter a '' d rikyOa ' '' Chapters on Greek Metri c '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- al On ^ ner -RRB- , by Professor
Thomas	PERSON	D wight nd BufHtk .

		Goodell , is not the least important of the `` Yale Bicentennial Publications , '' contain - ing as it does an inquiry into the entire question raised by Hellenic scansion , being informed not only with classical erudition but with full modern know - ledge upon a difficult subject .

		After a brief state - ment of the '' Scope and Method '' of the book Pro- fessor
Goodell	PERSON	passes at once to the longest paper of the five that make up its contents , the title of it indicating sufficiently the ancient -LRB- and modern -RRB- con - troversy between • • Rhythmicns or Metricus ? ''

		The works of commentators and grammarians have been ransacked to shed contemporaneous light on the discussion , with a judicial summing up in favor of the rhythtnicu .

		and a warning that the metrvei are not to be neglected for the good there is in them .

		Much more general is the inquiry into the problems of ** Rhythm and Language . ''

		which fol - lows , involving English poetry and the general question of quantity , and containing a discriminat - ing though brief criticism of the work of
Sidney Lianier	PERSON	.

		which should be read by all who are dis - posed to settle metrical controversies by setting down a few Procrustean rules .

		From this to '' Rhythm in Greek '' is an inevitable step , and an eminently sane conclusion is reached , which sees no difficulty in correlating accent and quantity , while discriminating between verses spK > ken and verses sang .

		The remaining chapters , on '' Foot , Ictus , ` Cyclic ' Feet '' and - Compound and Mixed Me - ters , '' are more technical and equally sound .

Oriel	ORGANIZATION	has an interesting history , running back to its foundation by
Adam de Brome	PERSON	, in the service of
Edward II.	LOCATION	, in the year
1326	DATE	.

		Names of significance in all of

John Keble	PERSON	.


John Henry Newman	PERSON	,
Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	,
Joseph Blanco White	PERSON	,
James Anthony Froude	PERSON	,
Arthur Hugh Clough	PERSON	,
Mark Pattison	PERSON	, and
Thomas Hughes	PERSON	, may be mentioned among those of the
last century	DATE	, with many more equally well known .

		Oriel feUowships have always been highly prized , and many men have been attracted by them from the other colleges .

		Mr.
Rannie	PERSON	's account is interesting , and follows the events of history closely , while it is inclusive enough to devote a chapter to the athletics of the college .

		Photographs of both the exteriors and interiors of the buildings aid in leaving that indefinable impression of cultivation and tradition which must continue to be the despair of many American institutions of learning for some gen - erations .

Reverend H. D. Rawnsley	PERSON	has mrmmMermt alwsys identified himself with a re - Ue SMfiui uu ^ ^ ^ ^ already famous in the annals of English literature , and this identification is now carried another step by his '' Rambler 's Note-Book at the English likkes '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Eighteen brief papers make np the contents of the present volume .

		Few of the papers are concerned directly with the poetic memories that cluster about the famous region , but all have a literary flavor and are animated by the love of nature from which the poets of a long generation ago took their inspiration .

		They cover a variety of interests , from the com - memoration of local customs to the local observance of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	's diamond jubilee , from otter - hunting to the finding of neolithic implements ; and they contain many fine descriptions of the scenery of the lovely countryside .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` A Statistical Study of Dlinois High Schools '' by Mr.
Frederick Gordon Bonser	PERSON	, is a pamphlet publica - tion of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		The statisties -LRB- given in tables and diagrams , besides being analysed -RRB- cover snch subjects as length of course , curricolam , and teach - ing force .

		They represent returns from 297 out of the 8B8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, 311 high schools in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Unfortunately , the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools , the most important of all , do not seem to be included .

		Since no list of schools is given , we base this statement upon internal evidence , and it is proved by the reports upon the subjects of Spanish , economics , and mechanical drawing .

		Nothing is said to account for this extraordinary omission , which seri - ously vitiates the study .

		We could wish that attention had also been given to the financial side of the subject .

		Figures which might be used to show the contrast be - tween
Illinois	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, for example , would have been very instructive .

		Miss
Agnes M. Gierke	PERSON	's '' A
Popular History of Astronomy	ORGANIZATION	during the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB-
Maomil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- has reached a fourth edition -LRB- which it well de - serves -RRB- , and in its latest form for the first time covers the full century of the title .

		The text has been enlarged and revised throughout .

		It is a book of fascinating interest , owing in part to the author 's skilful treatment of the subject , and also in no small measure to the fact that astronomy is a science susceptible beyond most others of popularization without loss of educational value .

		The work makes a substantial volume of nearly five hundred pages , with illustrations .

		Mr.
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	has had much ex - perience in the making of anthologies , and we are con - sequently prepared to find in bis `` Treasury of Humorous Poetry , '' just published by
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a judiciously chosen selection of entertaining pieces .

		His aim has been to include `` only extracts that are strictly amusing to modern readers , '' which results in a book that makes no pretence of illustrating the historical development of English humor in verse .

		He takes the terra humor very broadly , however , and his volume in - cludes many pieces that are serious as well as humorous .

		Including the notes , the book contains over four hundred pages , and considerably more than a hundred authors are represented . ''

		The
Teaching of Chemistry and Physics	ORGANIZATION	in the
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- ondary School , '' by Professors
Alexander Smith	PERSON	and
Edwin H. Hall	PERSON	, is a new volume in the '' American Teachers ' Series '' of Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a work of great value , both for its discussion of methods and for its practical sections .

		We note , among other matters , that it strongly discountenances the ex - traordinary heresy -LRB- that seemed to be gaining a certain credence a few years ago -RRB- which would begin the teach - ing of chemistry before its necessary physical founda - tions had been laid . ''

		Whether chemistry or physics should come first is thus seen to be an idle question .

		Physics musl come first . ''

		This is the conclusion of the argument , and there are no conceivable rational grounds upon which it may be reversed .

		Mr.

1270	DATE	, has been translated into English by Miss
Mary Sloan	PERSON	, and provided with notes and revisions by Professor
George Burton Adams	PERSON	.

		It is intended for school use , and comes from the press of
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The `` New Wayside Edition '' of `` The Complete Works of
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	, '' published by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, presents the greatest of American men of letters in comparatively inexpensive form .

		There are thirteen volumes in the set , printed from the old plates , and on rather thin paper , but neat and attractive in appearance .

		Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, believing that there is a reading public as well as a music-loving public for the libretti of the Gilbert and
Sullivan	PERSON	operas , have ven - tured to publish the text of `` Patience ; or , Bunthorne 's Bride '' in a neat volume .

		The experiment deserves encouragement , and enough readers should be found to justify further texts of this sort .

		The
Johns Hopkins Press	ORGANIZATION	has issued a volume con - taining the various addresses made at
Baltimore	LOCATION	last
February	DATE	upon the occasion of the quarter-centennial of the

		Much matter of more than ephem - eral interest is included within these covers , and the book must occupy a place iu every educational collection .

		Mr.
G. Mantellini	PERSON	has translated , and
Messrs. Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	have published , `` The Dead City , '' by

		This is a timely publication in view of the present visit of
Signora Duse	PERSON	to our shores for the express purpose of making us acquainted with this work and its fellows .

		It will enable many an auditor to make a brave show of understanding the performance of the play .

		THE DIAL 339 '' Labberton 's
Universal History	ORGANIZATION	, '' as now published by
Messrs. Silver	ORGANIZATION	,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the latest revision of a work that has , in its earlier forms , done good edu - cational service for the past score of years .

		It is still an atlas , although no longer called so , and the maps are still its most important feature , although the text is far more extensive than in the earlier editions .

		The unusually interesting issue of '' The Sewanee Beview '' for
October	DATE	signalizes the completion of the tenth volume of that quarterly publication .

		The interest attaches to the articles that make up the body of the issue , and also to the editorial retrospect of Professor
John Bell Henneman	PERSON	, the efBcient successor of Professor Trent in the conduct of the review .

		The ``
Sewanee	LOCATION	'' does not have one-tenth of the readers that it deserves .

		It is the only magazine we have that takes literature for its chief subject and takes it seriously .

		The others give us pictures , and gossip , and literary superficialities , and get the circulation .

		What this gives us instead may best be judged by an inspection of the classified general index to the ten volumes that is appended to the present issue .

		It presents a record to be proud of , and all the more so because of the discouragements under which its very genuine success has been achieved .

		We have several times mentioned , with commenda - tions , the series of special limited editions which
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have issued from their River - side Press .

		The latest , as well as the most ambitions and extensive , undertaking of the Press is a reprint of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's Essays , in three folio volumes , the first of which is now near completion .

		Two hundred and fifty copies only will be sold to subscribers , at 3120 .

		for the set .

		The prospectus and sample pages of this work in - dicate that it will be one of the great achievements of American book-making .

		The type is of a special cut , and , like the illustrations , borders , initials , and decora - tions , is modeled on the best early French designs .

		All the mechanical and artistic features of the work are under the supervision of Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	, whose taste and craftsmanship have appeared in the best productions of the Riverside Press ; while the engraving of por - traits is by Mr.
Lamont Brown	PERSON	, and of the initials and borders by Mr.
H. F. W. Lyonns	PERSON	and Miss
Caroline A. Powell	PERSON	.

		The text , in English , is based on the famous
Florio	PERSON	translation , and there will be ample notes and a bibliog ^ phy by Mr.
George B. Ives	PERSON	.

		Other features of this edition , which can not be noted here , will con - tribute to its literary and mechanical perfection , and to making it one of the grandest of recent prizes for the book-lover and collector .

		Of the three giants of the North -- Count Tolstoy , Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, and
Herr Bjbrnson	PERSON	-- two have for several years enjoyed the septuagen - arian distinction , and the third is about to achieve that dignity .

		On the eighth of the present month , it will have been exactly seventy years since
Bjomstjeme Bjomson	PERSON	was born in the Norwegian hamlet of Kvikne -- bom into the simple conditions that characterize the household life of the country pastor , yet des - tined to become one of the greatest men of his time , and to stand in the eyes of Norwegians everywhere as the typical representative of their race .

		The shoulders that to-day so stur - dily bear their weight of years have supported many good causes during the past half-century , for they are the shoulders of one who has not been content to produce literature alone , but who '' was ever a fighter '' as well as a poet .

		All honor to the man who to-day adds to the glory of the singer and the creative artist the other glory of many stout battles waged for 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, truth and righteousness in the political , intel lectual , and ethical arena .

		Although no less widely known than his great fellow-countryman and friendly rival , Dr.
Ib	ORGANIZATION	- sen , the subject of the present study has of late years proved less attractive as a theme for cos - mopolitan discussion .

		The questions which he has raised have not had quite the poignant vi - tality , or have not borne quite so directly upon the interests of the moment , as have those raised by Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	; the name of the latter has , in consequence , more frequently engaged the pen of the journalist .

		But this fact seems to represent only a passing phase of critical activity .

		That the future will redress the bal - ance of public interest is hardly to be doubted .


Herr Bjornson	PERSON	enjoyed many years of cosmo - politan fame before the name of his older contemporary had awakened other than faint echoes abroad , and , although as a dramatist alone his merits may be weighed -LRB- and perhaps found wanting -RRB- in comparison with those of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, it must be remembered that the fame of the great novelist is also his , and , added to that , the distinction of being supreme among the lyrists of his nation .


Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's work was introduced to the English public by
Mary Howitt	PERSON	, who in
1858	DATE	-LRB- the year after its original publication -RRB- made a free translation of ''
Synnbve Solbakken	PERSON	, '' and published it in
England	LOCATION	, with a changed title , and without mention of the author 's name .

		It was not long , however , before the name also became known , when translations of the other peasant idyls were made during the following few years .

		But in spite of this early introduc - tion to English readers ,
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	has not fared very well at the hands of translators , and the English public still has a very inadequate and one-sided idea of his work .

		Most people continue to think of him as the author of the simple stories by which he first became known to us , and few realize in what manifold other directions his activities have been developed .

		His lyrical genius must forever remain un - known to those who can not read his language , for song is always untranslatable , but there is no reason why his work in fiction and the drama , in all its phases , should not become the possession of all English readers .

		Most of the fiction has , as we believe , been translated into English , but the two great productions of his later years have not been included in either of the two uniform collections , and their transla - tions have appeared in so furtive a fashion that few readers are aware of their existence .

		These two modern novels , '' There Are Flags in City and Harbor '' -LRB- called '' The Heritage of the Kurts '' in its English version -RRB- , and '' In God 's Ways , '' are among the most important produc - tions of modern
Continental	ORGANIZATION	fiction .

		The sec - ond of them , in particular , is a moving picture of life which is equal if not superior to the best work of
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, having the same quali - ties of simple sincerity and truthfulness com - bined with an even finer literary art .

		The dramatic work of
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	can hardly be said to be known to our public at all , although it might be set in the balance with the work of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	with some doubt as to the direction in which the scale would tip . ''

		Sigurd Slembe '' alone , the greatest of the earlier works , exists in a volume uniform with American translation of the tales ; of the other plays , early and late , some four or five have been put forward sporadically , and are prac - tically inaccessible .

		The first part of `` Over JEjvne '' recently produced upon the English stage with such impressive beauty by Mrs.
Patrick Campbell	PERSON	, may be had in a version called ''
Paster	PERSON	Sang , '' and the last of the plays , '' Laboremus , '' may be found in a recent issue of '' The Fortnightly Review . ''

		Those who ran - sack the files of '' Poet-lore '' may find therein a translation of '' A Glove , '' and we also re - member to have come aCrdss ' obscurely pub - lished translations of `` The Newly - Wedded Pair '' and of ``
Mary Stuart	PERSON	in -
Scotland	LOCATION	. ''

		But `` The King , '' and several other master - pieces of
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's second period , have never , as far as we know , been put into En - glish .

		Surely , the man who must rank among the half dozen greatest writers living at the beginning of the twentieth century has de - served something better than this haphazard sort of translation .

		It will be realized from the foregoing re - marks that to be familiar with ''
Arne	PERSON	'' and '' The Fisher Maiden , '' and to have a vivid re - collection of '' Beyond Human Power '' as pre - sented on the stage by Mrs.
Campbell	PERSON	is to be very far from knowing the colossal and sym - pathetic figure who for over forty years has stood at the head of Scandinavian literature .

		At the very least , one must know in addition such works as ''
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	, '' '' The King , '' and '' In God 's Ways . ''

		And one should also know ,
Jbesides Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's principal books , something of his manifold activities as poli - tician and orator , as social theorist and apostle of liberal thought .

		And in all these aspects of his career it must be remembered that he ex -

		What Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	says upon this subject has often been quoted , bat may be quoted once more as a fitting close to these remarks . ''

		To name the name of
Bjornson	PERSON	is like hoisting the Norwegian flag .

		In his merits and his faults , his genius and his weakness , he is as distinctly national as
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	or
Schiller	PERSON	.

		Free-spoken as a , man , laconic as an artist , touchily patriotic , and at the same time vividly conscious of his na - tion 's narrow-mindedness , its spiritual poverty and needs -- a consciousness that has impelled him to Scandinavism , Teutonism .

		cosmopoli - tanism , -- this peculiar mingling of qualities is 80 typically national that
Bjornson	PERSON	in his own person comprehends the nation . ''

		And now , apon the occasion of his seventieth birthday , with the plaudits of the nation that proudly claims him for her own , there are mingled the plaudits of the whole cosmopolitan world of let - ters , won and = ridaiy deserved by the sheer force of the genius that makes him to-day among the foremost spokesmen of humankind .

		THE CUB RENT NEGLECT OF POETS ¥ .

		While we properly choose to think of poetry as Bomething more than a marketable commodity , and do not , under the best conditions , expect it to gain a wide circle of immediate castomers , we can hardly look upon the unmarketableneu of current Amer - ican verse without wonder .

		It is true , of course , that the fact holds good with regard to other forma of teUes lettres .

		The creative essay of the old dis - ernnre type , and the modern logical easay in liter - ary criticism , are in their purer form almost equally impertinent to the conscious needs even of the bet - ter public But this is less difficult to understand ; for poetry , we must think , is capable of more direct appeal to our primary impulses , and should there - fore be avoided with less ease , no matter how in - different to the idea of poetry we may be .

		In its simplest aspect of ' • emotional rhythmic utterance , '' it continues , as Professor
Gnmmere	PERSON	has pointed out , to g ^ in some reward in the newspaper and on the vaudeville stage .

		But the audience thus appealed to is not the audience of which we can expect support for any one of the fine arts ; and it is of poetry in its character of fine art , and of its present neglect by the limited audience upon which it might seem , in that character , to possess some claim .

		Uiat I am here s -LCB- > eakiDg .

		How far is this charge of indifference justified by the facts ?

		Surely , one reflects , a good many volumes of verse , -- as many as thirty or forty in
America	LOCATION	alone , -- are published every year ; and the publisher , with all his failings , does not throw away money .

		Upon what terms does he make him - self responsible for these books ?

		Very seldom , it should be said at once , apoa the terms which would govern the publication of an average novel , say .

		The publisher rarely pays the whole cost , and when he does , unless the verse possesses some catch - penny quality , hardly looks for a profit .

		Usually the expense is shared , the larger part falling upon the author .

		Not infrequently the author pays the whole cost , simply receiving the advantage of the im - print of some respectable publishing-house .

		Among a certain class of publishers , too , it is a matter of policy to get out a new book of verse now and then .

		Poetry is an item which ought not to be entirely absent from the list of forthcoming books ; and the publisher is willing to pay the piper rather than have it supposed that nobody is piping .

		It is not a very high-priced form of advertising , -- or , to be charitable , not an over-strenuous act of piety .

		An edition of two or three hundred copies of the ordinary book of verse is quite likely to glut the market ; and the expense of the plates is not great Not long ago a volume of verse was put forth by a well-known house , and received with un - usual favor by the critics and the public .

		In the course of six months or so a new edition was an - Boaneed with some trumpeting .

		One had visions of aabstantial returns to the lucky poet as well as the glory of a wide audience for his work , and might have been surprised to learn that the first edition consisted of seven hundred copies .

		That was a rare success .

		Under these conditions , it is not sur - prising that there is now an increasing tendency on the part of verse-writers of refinement to have their work privately printed .

		A hundred copies can be pretty cheaply produced , and readily taken care of by the old-fashioned method of subscription .

		That was a thrifty method ; if one 's bantling is to be cast into the waters , it is certainly more discreet to fur - nish a life-belt .

		But the principle is vicious , after alL If poetry is a fine art , there is no apparent reason why the poetic product should not ' `` exploit '' itself upon even terms with any other fine-art prod - uct ; and say what we will about the independence of the artist , we can not feel that he gains in dignity by assuming the methods of the amateur .

		When the poet has once fairly admitted that his product is unmerchantable , and has declined to put it to the test , he has cast suspicion upon its value .

		No work of art gains by fond handling ; it must take its chances in the open field .

		The chances will of course be against its achiev - ing a success of the first order .

		We may think of poetry in the highest sense as a product the quality of which approaches an absolute standard .

		But poetry of this quality must in the nature of things be extremely rare ; while every age has produced a quantum of verse to which , though it lacks that supreme excellence , we can not sensibly deny the title of poetry .

		There is , in fact , a broader aspect of poetic achievement which does not leave us quite so free to deal in extremes of judgment .

		From this point of view , ' ■ Shakespeare or nothing '' must 886 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, cease to be the f ormnla by which we can dispose of the problem of contemporary verse .

		Believing with
Aristotle	PERSON	that poetry is one of the imitative or cre - ative arts whose end is pleasure , we mast also be - lieve that this pleasure must be capable of marked variations in degree if not in kind .

		We do not de - mand that every painting or statue should be a masterpiece in order to gain our approbation .

		If the current product in any art is seen to be treated with indifference by any people or age , the obvious inference would be that the product is inferior , or that the public taste is degenerate , or both .

		An - other inference , somewhat less obvious , but , I think , especially worthy of consideration in forming a judgment of our own attitude toward poetry , would be that such indifference indicates a general misap - prehension of the significance of this patient and little rewarded pursuit of poetry which we know to be always going on .

		Not only as a means for ex - pressing spontaneous emotion -LRB- and of coarse it must always be that -RRB- , but as a fine art , poetry continues to appeal to a small but steadfast element in our society which the comic papers laugh at and the sober authorities condescend to .

		Let me say here that I take no more interest in the pursuit of poetry for art 's sake than for the sake of sociologry .

		The ambling sentiment of the popular poet and the precious phrasing of the high-voiced literary poet are equally beside the mark .

		Neither sincerity nor prettiness can by themselves compass poetic beauty ; the partial , the trite , the finicking , are as fatal in poetry as in sculpture or painting .

		One may fancy an advantage to minor work in those arts from the comparative inaccessibility of the great masterpieces .

		That would not hold true of music ; but there , as in painting , beauty makes its appeal through one of the outer senses , while poetry , how - ever perfect its form , bestows its full loveliness only apon the inward ear , as sculpture communicates its fall perfection only to the inward eye .

		The painter and the composer of no more than ordinary powers are often able by simple manipulations to impress effects confusingly suggestive of greatness , upon an audience whose mood is commonly of sensuous susceptibility rather than of pure and intelligent sympathy .

		The luxury of this mood partly accounts for the immense and increasing encouragement given by
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	to a department of fine art in which they have actually achieved far less of moment than in poetry .

		English poetry as a whole is as far superior to German poetry as English music is inferior to German music .

		The analogy between poetry and the sister arts must not be pushed too far .

		The real barrier which intervenes is suggested by the fact that we can hardly imagine the profitableness of establishing national or private schools of the poetic art .

		At the same time it is a little indolent of us to lie back upon the theory that poets are born , not made .

		The poet must be born with the aptitude , yes ; but then the aptitude must be developed .

		He does not need the viva voce method ; of necessity , the library will be his class-room and the high-way his studio .

		Poets are not born equal , and their work , if it is to endure , must be the outcome of hard discipline and a settled philosophy of life , as well as of the mys - terious glow and vigor of fancy which we call in - spiration .

		There is little use in plaintive talk about the public .

		People who could conceivably take a live interest in poetry as a fine art must be few .

		But there are a good many millions of us in
America	LOCATION	; and there are , after all reservations have been made , an uncertain number of thousands who really possess and take pleasure in cultivating a sense , rudimen - tary at least , for artistic value .

		They like , or wish to like , good paintings , good music , good sculpture and architecture ; and they feel a sort of responsi - bility for the support of those arts .

		I am wishing to inquire here if a similar sense of interest and re - sponsibility in our immediate poetic product may not be in the future both proper and cultivable .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		PROFESSOR
LADD	PERSON	'S '' PHILOSOPHY OP CONDUCT . ''

		-LRB- To the
Editor of Thb Diai	ORGANIZATION	.

		. -RRB-

		It would doubtless be unreasonable to expect that so elaborate a work as my `` Philosophy of Conduct '' should receive adequate treatment in so brief a notice as your journal chose to give , in your issue of
Nov. 1	DATE	last .

		But no critical notice of any book , however brief such notice may be , can be absolved from the obligation to state the main positions of the book it criticises , in an intelligible and truthful manner .

		This the reviewer in The Dial utterly failed to do .

		And since the book treats of Morality , my interest in its positions and in their fair presentation is something more and higher than a selfish personal interest .

		I therefore ask your permission in few words to state to your readers what those positions are .

		In this book I have aimed to show , and I think that I have conclusively shown , the truth of the following three propositions : First , the study of man 's ethical opinions and of his actual conduct , when pursued merely by the empirical method , leaves all the fundamental problems of ethics in darkness and confusion .

		As re - spects its side of feeling , man 's moral consciousness , when viewed from the psychological and the evolution - ary points of view , appears in irreconcilable conflict .

		As respects judgment and thought , it is found always involved in confusion .

		Man 's conceptions of the sanc - tions , the fitting rewards , and ideals of conduct can neither be explained nor defended solely on the basis of his past or present experience .

		To state and , by a prolonged investigation of the facts , to prove this posi - tion is the merit of a work on ethics ; if , as I hold the case to be , tho facts , and not the author , must be held responsible for the failure of empiricism to clear up the subject .

		Second : When we inquire , with a broad understand - ing of human nature and a wide and sympathetic sur - vey of man 's moral development , What is the nature of this ideal of conduct , whose sanctions seem to man im - perative , but whose image changes with all the changes
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 in tbe caltare and social environment of the iodiyidnal ?

		The answer can be given by philosophy .

		It is not merely , or chiefly , an ideal of comfortable living , or of 80-calied happiness , whether for the individual or for the race .

		Neither is it the ideal of perfect conformity to an impersonal , but so-called moral law .

		It is rather the ideal of an individual , functioning as a person in an environment of other persons , i. e. , in a social organism .

		Here again , if this ideal can be only somewhat vaguely described , or imperfectly sketched , this , too , is not the fault of the author .

		It is the excellence of tbe ideal , which is ever in the state of evolution -- rising , expand - ing , and alluring man onward .

		Who shall describe with hard and finished outlines , the ideal person in social relations , under the existing conditions of man 's total environment ?

		But , third , the origin , the nature , the sanctions , the effectiveness , of this ideal , and especially the history of its unfolding in the spirit of the race , call for an explanation which lies beyond the anthropological or social point of new .

		This explanation must be found where the best of the race have always been inclined to find it , -- viz. , in the postulate of that
Ethical Spirit	ORGANIZATION	as the Ground of the world and of hnmanity , whom faith calls God .

		In one word , just as I have shown , with tbe most faithful regard for facts and the strictest application of scientific method , in my two preceding books , `` Phil - osophy of Knowledge '' and `` A Theory of Reality , '' that God is the Ground of all we know in science , so I have shown in '' The Philosophy of Conduct , '' that God is the Ground of all we approve and strive to attain in conduct .

		Respectful consideration shall always be shown by me to any critic who , with a small fraction of the same regard for facts and for the scientific method , challenges these views .

		But for a critic who , like tbe writer of the notice in The Dial , makes no semblance of any effort even truthfully to present the views he criticizes , but promptly retreats to the cheap and antiquated appeal to the odium , anti-theologicum , what respectful consideration can any one be asked to hare ?

		-LSB- If a reviewer writing for a jonrnal of literary criticism should attempt to state , in a single article , the main positions of six treatises on ethics , he would lay upon tbe readers of tbe joarnal a burden which no editor , however compliant , would permit him to impose .

		All that can be demanded of such a re - viewer , therefore , is that whatever material he gelects for presentation shall be described with a scrupulous regard for truth .

		How far I succeeded in my endeavor to follow this principle in my notice of Professor
Ladd	PERSON	's • • Philosophy of Conduct '' ' is a subject I can hardly discuss in these columns for want of the requisite space .

		It seems , however , the less necessary because nothing in the author 's own statement of his position , as given above , con - tradicts in the slightest degree my interpretation of his views .

		My criticism of Professor
Ladd	PERSON	's con - clusions was not intended to be an argued discussion of their truth .

		It was simply a brief and therefore dogmatically formulated statement of the judgment which a conscientious study of the book had left in my mind .

		A XOTEWORTHY AFTERMATH .

		* Either as lectures , after-dinner addresses , or magazine articles , most if not all of the brief studies by the late
John Fiske	PERSON	, now collected in two stout octavos by his widow and executrix , have already been presented to the pnblic .

		The repeated delivery of the greater number of them before intelligent audiences in all parts of the country has insured them a finish and symmetry too often lacking in a collection of posthumous miscellanies .

		This , too , may ac - count for a certain tendency to colloquialism , now and then apparent , more suitable to the spoken address than to the printed essay .

		Not that one would have it otherwise , however ; for such idiosyncrasies of a gifted author who was so suddenly and so recently taken from as , are things to be treasured .

		For example , when he chooses , in the midst of a grave historical dis - cussion , to reinforce his argument with a line from '' Pinafore , '' or to enliven his page with a stanza from '' lolantbe , '' the reader is pleas - antly reminded of the writer 's fondness for and proficiency in music .

		The nine chapters of the first volume , as Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	's introductory note tells us , were to have been incorporated in a larger work , '' A History of the American People , '' had the au - thor lived to execute the plan .

		They are ar - ranged in chronological order , from Governor
Hutchinson	PERSON	to
Daniel Webster	PERSON	.

		But being special studies , biographical and political , they want the historical perspective that would doubtless have characterized the completed work .

		That they are all intensely interesting follows as a necessity from their authorship .

		The enthusiasm with which the writer throws himself into his subject can not but carry the reader along with him , a willing captive .

		The much-maligned
Thomas Hutchinson	PERSON	becomes a hero and a martyr .

		The weak and shifty
Charles Lee	PERSON	figures as too despicable a charac - ter even to gain admittance to the company of those consigned to eternal torment .

		888 THE DIAL -LSB- Dec , 1 , fore or since could have done .

		Even
Webster	PERSON	's `` seventh of
March	DATE	'' speech is warmly de - fended .

		The plea is the one almost invariably ■ used by his biographers , -- that no other atti - tude was possible for a statesman whose gov - erning motive was the preservation of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a certain sense
Webster	PERSON	's course was defensible , because from his point of view it was the only one open .

		But after all is said , he who excuses accuses ; and it must ever be cause for regret that no higher motive prevailed that day than expediency .

		A bit of new and apparently trustworthy testimony is brought forward , in the chapter on ''
Charles Lee	PERSON	, the Soldier of Fortune , '' to settle the vexed question as to the language used by
Washington	LOCATION	at
Monmouth	LOCATION	toward his faithless lieutenant .

		By a Virginian who heard the story from Major
Jacob Morton	PERSON	of Cum - berland County , who himself witnessed the whole occurrence , it is emphatically denied that anything worthy to be called profanity was in - dulged in on that occasion .

		Major
Mortou	PERSON	's reported account of the event is too good to mutilate by imperfect quotat ` on .

		He says : '' I will tell you how it was .

		Our troops were march - ing rapidly , expecting soon to be engaged with the British ; the day was very hot , the road heavy with sand , our men fatigued by the march .

		I was then a sergeant in my company and had frequently to face about in order to keep my platoon aligned on the march , -- my - self walking backwards .

		While doing so , I saw General
Washington	LOCATION	coming from the rear of our column , riding very rapidly along the right flank of the column ; and as he came nearer , my attention was fixed upon him with wonder and astonishment , for he was evidently under strong emotion and excitement .

		I never saw such a countenance before .

		It was like a thunder-cloud before the Hash of lightning .

		Just as he reached the flank of my platoon he reined up his horse a little , and raising his right hand high above his head , he cried out with a loud voice , ` My God !

		General
Lee	PERSON	, what are you about ? '

		Until that moment I had not known that General
Lee	PERSON	was near ; but on turning my head a little to the left -LRB- still stepping backward on the march -RRB- I found that General
Lee	PERSON	had ridden from the head of our column along our right flank and was only a few yards distant , in front of General
Washington	LOCATION	.

		In answer to
General Washington	ORGANIZATION	's excited exclamation , ' My God I General
Lee	PERSON	, what are you about ? '

		General Lee began to make some explanation ; but General
Washington	LOCATION	impatiently interrupted him , and with his hand still raised high above his head , waving it angrily , exclaimed , ' Go to the rear , sir , ' spurred his horse , and rode lapidly forward .

		The whole thing occurred as quickly as I can tell it to you . ''

		The second volume embraces themes of va - ried interest .

		The '' Reminiscences of Huxley '' show the author in his most genial mood .

		In the chapter on Huxley occurs , among other good stories , the following version of the '' Soapy Sam '' incident , which will serve to relieve the tedium of this review .

		The author received the account from his friend
Youmans	PERSON	.

		< ■ It was at the meeting of the
British Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in 18C0 , soon after the publication of Dar - win 's epoch-making book , and while people in general were wagging their heads at it , that the subject came up for discussion before a fashionable and hostile au - dience .


Samuel Wilberforce	PERSON	, the plausible and self - complacent Bishop of
Oxford	LOCATION	, commonly known as ' Soapy Sam , ' launched out in a rash speech , conspicu - ous for its ignorant misstatements , and highly seasoned with appeals to the prejudices of the audience , upon whose lack of intelligence the speaker relied .

		Near him sat Huxley , already eminent as a man of science , and known to look favorably upon Darwinism , but more or less youthful withal , only five-and-thirty , so that the bishop anticipated sport in badgering him .

		At the close of his speech he suddenly turned upon Huxley and begged to be informed if the learned gentleman was really willing to be regarded as the descendant of a monkey .

		Eager self-confidence had blinded the bishop to the tactical blunder in thus coarsely inviting a retort .

		Huxley was instantly upon his feet with a speech de - molishing the bishop 's card-house of mistakes ; and at the close he observed that since a question of personal preference bad been very improperly brought into the discussion of scientific theory , he felt free to confess that if the alternatives were descent , on the one hand , from a respectable monkey , or on the other from a bishop of the English Church who could stoop to such misrepresentations and sophisms as the audience had lately listened to , he should declare in favor of the monkey ! ''

		The author hastens to add that this surely can - not have been what
Huxley	PERSON	said or how he said it .

		But from the fact that he was loudly ap - plauded , and that in the ensuing excitement one lady fainted and had to be carried out , it is safe to infer that the scientist gave the church - man a Roland for his Oliver .

		However , to the credit of our human nature be it added , the bishop carried away no bitterness from this en - counter , but was ever afterward most courteous to his castigator .

		The title-page of the first volume bears the favorite motto of the tireless student and worker , the same that he had inscribed over the hearth in his library , -- the monkish injunction , '' Study as if for Life Eternal , live prepared to die tomorrow . ''

Morris	PERSON	mannerisms of the Gt -RRB- l - den type , of jammed lines and close spacing , Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	has produced a letter-press that is at once beaatifnl to look at , and restful to read .

		Surely if any book ever deserved to be brought out in sumptuous style , it is II Cor - legiano .

		Apart from the trecentisti , it is a question whether any book of any Italian writer has been printed more times , or en - joyed a more enduring popularity , than '' The Courtier . ''

		Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	's edition is the fourth # Ds : lish translation , and the one bun - dred and forty-fourth impression of this cele - brated book .

		It contains a list of former editions , which is a valuable and complete bib - liography as far as it is now known ; but it is worth while to note that the list does not in - clude a second Spanish translation , mentioned by
Giuseppe Rigutini	PERSON	in his Florentine edition -LRB- 18 !

		i9 -RRB- , nor a possible Russian translation re - ferred to by
Lodovico Corio	PERSON	-LRB-
Milan	LOCATION	edition , 1890 -RRB- .

		First printed in
1628	DATE	, II Cortegiano began its world career with the translation of the Spanish poet ,
Bosesa	LOCATION	; translations into French , German , Latin and English rapidly followed , and of the one hundred and three editions that appeared before the death of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, forty-six , or almost one-half , were in foreign languages , -- a truly remark - able showing .

		Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	's translation takes rank at once beside the first one , and that is high praise , for the Elizabethan translation , made in
1561	DATE	, remains to this day a most readable and interesting book .

		Sir
Thomas Hoby	PERSON	, the first English translator , was an '' Italianated '' Englishman , a little later than the Earl of Sur - rey and Sir
Thomas Wyatt	PERSON	, and a little earlier than Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	, who best of English - nien embodied the ideal of ■ ' The Courtier . ''

		He was ,
Roger Ascham	PERSON	says , '' very expert in knowledge of divers tongues , '' he had been an Italian traveller , and he died
Elizabeth	PERSON	's am - bassador to
France	LOCATION	.

		In Hoby 's time the translator was not con - fronted with Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	's problem , how best to reader an old classic .

		The Elizabethans had a vigorous English , just rising into conscious - ness , and they were blessed with unlimited confidence in themselves .

		These conditions , added to great intellectual curiosity and much sympathy , result in a picturesque directness of 890 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, touch which is a common characteristic of the Elizabethan translators from the Italian .

		Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	meets the difficulty of a changed point of view and expanded English most cleverly .

		His translation of
Castiglione	PERSON	's Italian is clear , fluent , and graceful ; not archaic English , nor yet the English of the market-place .

		It has a certain reserve , a certain stateliness , befit - ting the book and the subject .

		We miss in the nineteenth-century English the homely strength of such phrases of Sir
Thomas Hoby	PERSON	's as '' to slepe in a whole skynne , '' '' pecke of troubles , '' '' not a farthynge left to blesse him - self e '' -LSB- with -RSB- , but Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	's very modern '' stand to win '' -LRB- p. 101 -RRB- for venire del fare is accurate almost to intuition .

		Perfectly correct , but not so good , is `` foresight -LSB- ^ la prudenzia ' -RSB- which consists in a certain judgment in choos - ing well '' -LRB- p. 258 -RRB- , and '' whoever knows how to command is always obeyed '' -LRB- p. 265 -RRB- .

		The Elizabethan English packs the thought here .

		`` Wisdome , '' says Hoby , `` consisteth in a cer - tain judgment to choose well , '' while '' He that can commaunde is alwayes obeyed '' is fairly im - perative .

		By a curious oversight , Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	has omitted to mention anywhere the original Italian text from which he translated .

		But his notes show it to have been the scholarly edition of
Vittorio Cian	PERSON	-LRB-
Florence	LOCATION	, 1894 -RRB- , with an oc - casional reading from other texts , notably that of the very correctly printed Aldine folio of
1545	DATE	.

		One of these Aldine accuracies removes a stumbling-block from the pathway of most of the Italian editors ; it is '' una licentia Brae - ciesca , '' in the lively scene at the close of the second evening 's conversation , when `` at a sig - nal from my lady Duchess , many of the ladies rose to their feet , and all ran laughing towards my lord
Gaspar	PERSON	, as if to shower blows upon him . ''

		Braccesque leave is leave with blows , from the name of a violent soldier ,
Braccio Fortebracci	PERSON	. ''

		The best book that ever was written upon good breeding , II Cortegiano , by
Castiglione	PERSON	, grew up at the little Court of
Urbino	LOCATION	, and you should read it , '' says Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	to
Boswell	PERSON	.

		It is neither here nor there that Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	had probably never read Jl Cortegiano him - self , for it is not a book on good breeding , not a courtesy-book at all .

		With this correc - tion , the dictum holds good .

		II Cortegiano is absolutely the best book on manners that has ever been written .

		The Italians of the
Renais	PERSON	- sance boldly aimed at perfection ; and that
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- tiglione himself felt that in all human sort he had attained it in his book , the noble sentence at the close of his Dedicatory Letter to the Bishop of
Viseu	LOCATION	shows .

		`` And if ray censors be not satisfied with the com - mon verdict of opinion , let them rest content with that of time , which in the end reveals the hidden defects of everything , and being father of truth and judge without passion , ever passes on men 's writings just sentence of life or death . ''

		If one were asked wherein consists the per - fection of II Cortegiano , the answer might be , that it is one of those books , not too numerous in any age or language , in which the style suits the subject .

		It is a large subject , a subject of infinite variety , -- the education of a gentle - man , -- treated in a broad , philosophical , em - inently human way .

		Somewhat also of the unique excellence of II Cortegiano results from the fact that it is the work of a life , prac - tically the '' sole heir of the author 's invention . ''

		Whatever
Castiglione	PERSON	had known and expe - rienced and thought and felt , he set down , refined and philosophized , in his book .

		Ac - cording to his own statement , the book was just twenty years in the making ; it came to the light at last a few months only before his death .


Baldassare Castiglione	PERSON	was a man of noble birth ; he had been a soldier , winning his spurs in the defeat of his family , the Gonzaghe , by the Great Captain , at
Garigliano	LOCATION	; he was a distinguished diplomat , one of the earliest ex - amples of the diplomatist as man of letters ; he had travelled widely and knew the best people everywhere .

		When he died , as Apos - tolic
Nuncio of Pope Clement VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		to
Charles v.	PERSON	, the Emperor is reported to have said , '' I tell you one of the finest gentlemen in the world is dead . ''

		The interlocutors of the four evenings ' conversations were all included in the circle of the author 's friends and acquaint - ances , and all of them were personages .

		Nor are they brought together fortuitously , for the purposes of the dialogue .


Castiglione	PERSON	had actually known them at '' the little Court of
Urbino	LOCATION	, '' either as fellow-members of that courtly society , or as guests of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	and Duchess or
Urbino	LOCATION	.

		Their names read like a roll of honor of the late Italian Renaissance : Giuliano de ' Medici , called the
Magnifico	PERSON	, son of Lorenzo de ' Medici and brother to Pope
Leo X. ; Ottaviano Fregoso	PERSON	, Doge of
Genoa	LOCATION	; Count Lodovico of
Canossa	LOCATION	;
Cardinals Bembo	PERSON	and
Bibbiena	LOCATION	;
Giovan Cristoforo Romano	PERSON	: the author 's kinswoman ,
Elizabetta Gonzaga	LOCATION	, Duchess of
Urbino	LOCATION	; and the witty Lady
Emilia Pia	ORGANIZATION	, Countess of
Montefeltro	PERSON	, and descendant of the poet Boiardo .

		As a record of manners , II Cortegiano may
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 391 be said to sam up the Renaissance , at the same time that it anticipates the best ideals of mod - ern times .

		As is well known , it is a mixed type of manners that
Castiglione	PERSON	describes , in that the education of letters of the Renaissance is engrafted upon the military discipline of feudal times .

		The Courtier is chi valric , learned , gentle , aesthetic .


Castiglione	PERSON	's classical train - ing , his wide experience , his philosophical bent , together with an almost perfect openness of mind , perhaps the finest trait of the Italians of the Renaissance , combine to give his book a character that is at once universal and curiously modern .

		U Cortegiano is full of wise thoughts , -- `` fine things said unintentionally , '' as
Keats	PERSON	said of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets . ''

		War is bad in itself '' has been most vigorously said by one of the greatest soldiers of our own time .

		`` I have known very few men of merit who did not love and honor women . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	tells OS that when he went to call on
Lowell	LOCATION	, shortly before undertaking the Venetian consulate , the poet gave him two charges in parting , `` to open his mouth when he began to speak Italian , and to think well of women .

		He said our race spoke its own tongue with its teeth shut , and so failed to master the languages that wanted freer utterance .

		As to women , he said there were unworthy ones , but a good woman was the best thing in the world , and a man was always the better for honoring women . ''

		Nowhere is the modernity of H Cortegiano more striking than in
Castiglione	PERSON	's conception of the power and range and beneficence of the womanly influence in the world .

		The Court lady is the subject of the third evening 's con - versation , conducted by the
Magnifieo	PERSON	as the avowed defender of woman .

		He fashions her so liberally , imagining such a bright , sweet , brave creature , possessing `` the knowledge of all things in the world , '' '' together with the virtues that so seldom times are seen in men , '' that one of the gentlemen wonders why he will not have women to rule cities , to make laws , and to lead armies , while men stand spinning in the kitchen .

		The Magnifieo replies , smiling , '' Perhaps this too were not amiss .

		Do yon not know that
Plato	PERSON	, who indeed was not very friendly to women , giveth them the overseeing of cities ? ''

		The literary form oill Cortegiano , the social dialogue , in which women take part on equal terms with men , is a natural develop - ment of the ideas of the Renaissance on the position of women .

		It is conversation as a fine art . ''

		Conversation , '' ' says
Guazzo	PERSON	, in Xa Civil Convergatione , '' is the beginning and the end of all knowledge . ''

		II Cortegiano is but the best of a series of similar books on social ethics whose one purpose was to promote friendly re - lations between men and women , for the better - ment of both .

		If women were to converse with men as equals , it followed logically that they must be as well educated as men .

		The concfu - sion of the conversation on the Court lady , in which all agree , is that she deserved well to be esteemed the Courtier 's equal .

		It is admitted that she has a right to exist for herself .

		Nature made her a woman , with powers to be devel - oped , a mind to cultivate , and work in the world to do , which , by the grace of
Grod	PERSON	, may or may not be tUtf cc `` ' c fio -LRB- all church and children -RRB- .

		All this sounds very modem .

		But
Castiglione	PERSON	came just at the end of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, and some of his men friends were still devoted to that singular idea of domestic hap - piness which locked the wife in with her dul - ness , while the husband went abroad '' for to see , and eke for to be seen , '' as the rebellious Wife of Bath puts it .

		The mediaeval and mod - em strike sharp on each other in the discus - sion of love .

		When the
Magnifieo	PERSON	expresses the opinion that love is proper for unmarried women only ,
Messer Federico Fregoso	PERSON	thinks him '' austere , '' while
Roberto da Bari	PERSON	jeers at the '' rusticity '' of wives loving their own hus - bands .

		The women that
Castiglione	PERSON	knew , and knew well , were
Yittoria Colonna	PERSON	,
Emilia Pia	ORGANIZATION	,
Fleonora of Aragon , Duchess of Ferrara	ORGANIZATION	, and their set .

		Friendship on equal terms with women like these , all as able as they were bril - liant , must have shaped his ideas of women , the most liberal that is to be found in any literature before
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's women .

		Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	, who is everywhere a sympathetic translator , describes
Eleonora of Aragon	PERSON	as a woman of '' rare merit , manly courage , and en - lightened culture . ''

		She was the mother of two daughters ,
Beatrice d'Este	PERSON	, Duchess of
Milan	LOCATION	, at whose Court
Castiglione	PERSON	was educated ; and of
Isabella d'Este	LOCATION	, Marchioness of
Mantua	LOCATION	, perhaps the most interesting woman of the Re - naissance .

		Isabella d'Este 's portrait , after
Titian	ORGANIZATION	, is the most brilliant of the many beautiful pictures which enrich Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	's translation of
/ / Cortegiano	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a veritable triumph of process printing , but Mr.
Bierstadt	PERSON	surpasses even this in his frontispiece print of the Louvre portrait of
Castiglione	LOCATION	, by
Raphael	PERSON	.

		The tech - nique of this print is well nigh perfect , com - bining as it does the accuracy and clearness of a good photograph , with the brilliance and 892 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, softness of tone of a mezzotint .

		A striking portrait , opposite page 149 , from the
National Gallery of Buda-Pesth	ORGANIZATION	, is that which for years has passed as a portrait , by
Raphael	PERSON	, of the
Ferrarese	PERSON	poet ,
Antonio Tebaldeo	PERSON	, but which
Morelli	PERSON	and
Berenson	PERSON	agree in identifying as a portrait of Raphael himself by
Sebastiano Luciani	PERSON	'' del Piombo . ''

		It represents a hand - some young man , of twenty-six or twenty-seven years , nobly serious in look , and richly dressed in black .

		It is the most masculine portrait of
Raphael	PERSON	.

		It is impossible to close a review of Mr. Op - dycke 's book without saying that the best of it is neither the quality of his translation nor its exquisite setting , but just the spirit of it all .

		Surely it is not insignificant that here and now a graduate of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	should have produced a book like this , a book that addresses itself not to the commercial sense , not to ideas of civic duty or moral enthusiasm , not even to instruc - tion or entertainment .

		Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	asks us to contemplate higher social ideals ; his appeal is to the charm and grace of life .

		The
Greatest of Wood-Engravers	ORGANIZATION	.

		* That engraving on wood seems likely to be - come , like line engraving on steel , almost a lost art , is but the natural consequence of the invention and perfecting of the various pro- cesses of photo-mechanical reproduction .

		There are many reasons why this should be so .

		It is not only that the meclaanical processes are both actually and relatively cheap .

		The gain in lit - eral fidelity is indisputable ; there is no tedious waiting for the tardy engraver ; there is no in - trusion of his personality into the result .

		These considerations are commercially effective , and of more weight with both publishers and public than realization of the shortcomings of the pro- cess print .

		The blurring of some qualities and over-accentuation of others in the mechanical reproduction , the inevitable omission of that in - tangible vivifying something , which , for want of a better name , may be called the soul of the work , is commonly overlooked .

		And with the improvement of photography by which more accurate rendering of tone values is secured , there is much reason to fear that the day of the wood engraver is almost at an end .

Old Engush Masters	ORGANIZATION	.

		Engraved by
Timothy Cole	PERSON	.

		With historical notes by
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	; and comments by the engraver .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the end is not quite yet , however , for the greatest of all wood engravers has not yet laid down his tools .

		Mr.
Timothy Cole	PERSON	's series of wood engravings after the old masters of paint - ing may without exaggeration be said to repre - sent the crowning achievement of the art .

		This is high praise , but not more than is deserved .

		Professor
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	does not put it too strongly when he says that the series '' can - not be regarded as other than monumental . ''

		The high standard set in the '' Old Italian Masters '' and '' Old Dutch and Flemish Mas - ters '' is fully maintained in Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's new collection of eight and forty examples of the `` Old English Masters . ''

		In cutting the blocks for these , Mr.
Cole	PERSON	was constantly occupied for nearly seven years .

		Many of the plates have appeared in the '' Century Magazine , '' but in their present form they gain much from heavier paper and more careful printing .

		In the technique of his craft Mr.
Cole	PERSON	is ab - solutely unsurpassed .

		His method is in strict accordance with the best traditions of the art .

		Always and everywhere he uses the pure white line and stipple around which such animated controversies have arisen between advocates of different styles of engraving .

		How wide , how almost infinitely varied , are the possibilities of this white line , is nowhere better shown than in Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's masterly use of it .

		In his hands it becomes vibrant , instinct with life ; yet firm , clear , and restful .

		As in all craftsmanship of the highest order , there is here no trace of in - decision .

		The handling is free , strong , and di - rect , but without any trace of hardness .

		It is this combination of strength with softness and delicacy , of breadth , dignity , and subtlety , that reveals in Mr.
Cole	PERSON	not the mere translator of other men 's work , but the artist of consummate ability .

		Yet as a translator and interpreter of the individual qualities of the painters whose works he has reproduced he has also achieved a high degree of success .

		It is difficult to say whether , in such an example as the '' De - tail from
Hogarth	PERSON	's Marriage a la Mode , '' we should most admire the exquisite nicety with which the quality of the painting , the char - acter and expression of the several figures , and , in particular , the atmosphere -- the en - veloppe -- of the original have been placed before us , or the wonderful technique by which this result is accomplished .

		The achievement is the more remarkable when the narrow range of the tone values in this picture are taken into consideration .

		A line or a dot misplaced , made a hair 's breadth too large , or taken in the wrong
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 393 direction , would have been fatal to the result .

		The direction in which the lines made by the graver shall run is , indeed , one of the most important questions which the engraver has to decide .

		It is trne that it is largely determined by the perspective of the planes in which the surfaces lie .

		But that is not all that needs to be taken into account .

		Some of the things that have to be considered , and how skilfully Mr.
Cole	PERSON	has met the varied problems presented , may be seen by noting the different ways in which he has treated the faces in the portraits reproduced .

		How essentially unlike in char - acter are the rhythmic and sinuous lines with which be has placed before us the lovely face of the ''
Parson	PERSON	's Daughter '' by
Romney	ORGANIZATION	.

		and the white lines crossing each other so as to leave little rectangular dots at the intersections , which he has employed in the engraving -LRB- one of the finest in the series -RRB- of Sir
Henry Rae	PERSON	- burn 's portrait of Mrs.
Scott Moncrieff	PERSON	!

		How different also is his treatment of the faces in the engravings after
Reynolds	PERSON	's portrait of Lord
Heathfield	PERSON	,
Hopner	ORGANIZATION	's portrait of
William Pitt	PERSON	, and
Raeburn	PERSON	's presentation of the massive fea - tures of
Lord Newton 1 Equally	ORGANIZATION	worthy of study are the lines adopted to render the tex - tures of the different fabrics depicted , and the consummate skill with which both quality of surface and tonal truth have been secured .

		A detailed description of all the engravings in the volume , or even of the more important among them , could hardly be profitable for readers not having the book in hand .

		Mention must , however , be made of the superb render - ing of
Gainsborough	PERSON	's portrait of the Honor - able Mrs.
Graham	PERSON	.

		When the richness of its textures , the mellowness of its tones , the luminous quality of the high lights , more espe - cially in the face and hands , the velvety soft - ness of the blacks , the subtle gradations , and the life and spirit which pervade it , are con - sidered , the hopeless inadequacy of even the most successful photographic reproduction be - comes apparent by comparison .

		The limitations of the wood engraver 's art , even in the hands of one so accomplished as Mr.
Cole	PERSON	, are best seen in his landscape and marine subjects , though such masterpieces as the engravings after Constables ''
Hampstead Heath	PERSON	'' and
Cotman	PERSON	's '' Fishing Boats off
Yarmouth	LOCATION	'' may seem to negative this conclu - sion .

		Some of the difficulties to be surmounted are indicated in the note which Mr.
Cole	PERSON	con - tributes to his engravings after Constable .

		`` I engraved the picture of the ` Hay
Wain	PERSON	' in as bold a manner as I could oommaod , because I wanted each line to print np as fat and fnll as possible , as I felt by this means I might arrive at something analc ^ os to the rich and unetnons coloring characteristic of the original .

		Much that was in the original had , of course , to be sacrificed -- all its surface , in fact , and a new sur - face substituted -LRB- which however , happens in all engrav - ing -RRB- .

		Whole legions of details are ruthlessly swept away , and characteristic lines and stipplea Boiig ; lit out or invented to supply their places .

		Thus , for instance , the foreground of the ` Hay
Wain	PERSON	' is composed of pebbles and stones ; but in the small reduction of the engraving these eame down so minute it would have necessitated such microscopic work that printing would have been impossible , and the larger fact of the vigor of effect and color could not have been secured .

		So it was throughout the picture .

		And thus it is with all art : sacrifice is the rule .

		Constable perceived this , and did not therefore paint the skin but the spirit of nature . ''

		It is not alone for Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's engravings that this volume of '' Old English Masters '' ' is noteworthy .

		The notes on his work that the engraver contributes are of great value , and Professor
Van Dyke	PERSON	's essays on the several painters represented are charming in their Incidity , and strikingly just in their apprecia - tions and criticisms .

		In fact , whether the book be considered as a collection of superb engrav - ings valuable either for their intrinsic merit as such or as representative of the best paintings by the best English artists from about
1750	DATE	to
1850	DATE	, or as a review of English art during that period , it would be difficult to commend it more highly than it deserves .

		All worthy also is the enlightened encouragement which has made this noble series of engravings possible .

		If the art of wood engraving is to be kept out of the category of the things that were , it is to the publishers of Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's work that most of the credit belongs .

		If such a purpose on the part of the author be fairly assumed -- there is no preface indi - cating any plan and the volumes must speak for themselves -- then it is safe to say that this History will be much better appreciated by those who have read widely about American men and measures , who are more or less familiar with details , and therefore are better equipped to enjoy a philosophical analysis and review , than by those who will turn to it for first in - formation about
America	LOCATION	.

		In other words one can not help feeling that the reader who is un - acquainted with the details of wars and presi - dential administrations , party problems and personal prejudices , will find the History a disappointment , after the pleasure of examining the pictures is past .

		By the former class , on the other hand , the five volumes will be studied with much satisfaction , giving as they do approved modern judgment of the great questions and great men of Amer - ican origin , the scholarly character of the author lending weight to his carefully-worded sentences .

		The last portion , covering the years from
1866 to 1900	DATE	, will not be accepted by every reader with the same grace accorded the earlier narration ; but even sharp differences of opinion regarding estimates of measures and men of our own time , will not prevent general recognition of the success of the author 's at - tempt to review the work of the four centuries in judicial language and lofty tone .

		The most striking first impression from an examination of the work is that the illustra - tions are remarkable , both for variety and un - varying excellence .

		They embrace represent - ative selections from almost every possible source .

		There are pictures of persons , con - temporary prints , idealized scenes .

		There are facsimiles of documents and signatures , repro - ductions of the title-pages of famous books and pamphlets , or of rare campaign posters and tickets .

		There are views of the homes of many leaders , and pictures showing the prog - ress of invention .

		There are excellent maps and interesting plans , all these making a great collection of nearly eight hundred illustrations , scattered unevenly throughout the volumes and combining to give powerful aid to the nar - ration .

		Some of the pictures are far out of relationship to the immediate text , and two of them might well have been omitted , since the American people do not care to perpetuate the memory of features or names of those who as - sassinate presidents .

		It is unfortunate that the title '' Cumberland Gap near Wheeling Vir - ginia '' should be used in one case -LRB- III , 241 -RRB- , an error closely associated with a statement -LRB- III , 246 -RRB- that the national road was built through the Cumberland Gap to the
Ohio	LOCATION	, when long usage has attached that geographi - cal designation to an opening in the mountains a good ways south of Wheeling and the course of the
Cumberland	LOCATION	road .

		A second impression , and a strong one too , is that there is a lack of proportion in the His - tory .

		There are five volumes , averaging three hundred and fifty pages , with
1689	DATE	,
1781	DATE	,
1829	DATE	,
1866	DATE	, and
1900	DATE	as terminal points .

		Of the eighteen hundred and forty-eight pages eight hundred and nineteen are taken up with the story of colonial times .

		One hundred and six pages -LRB- fifty-six of text and fifty of pictures -RRB- are used to describe the Revolutionary War ; while the Civil War is passed in fifty-four pages , sixteen of these being given to illustra - tions .

		The Mexican War is finished in three pages .

		In the vista of years the operations of the
Ku Klux Klan	ORGANIZATION	in Reconstruction times surely will not seem of commanding impor - tance , and yet they are accorded three and a half pages , -- the amount of text space taken to discuss the
Jay Treaty of 1794	DATE	,
Burr	PERSON	's Con - spiracy ,
Decatur	LOCATION	's achievements in the Medi - terranean , and the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise , all together .

		The
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	is described in fewer words than is
Bryan	PERSON	's free silver campaign .

		The Trent affair , and the military movement culminating at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	in what has been called one of the world 's decisive battles , are each given half a page , while the disturbance created by Sitting Bull commands as much space as these two together .

		And yet it must be said , that while the average reader will notice the scant treatment accorded certain events in their chronological sequence , the one who forgets details and seeks the philosophical analysis of history , the logical relationship of cause and effect , will find elsewhere in some chapter of summary review the points omitted in their natural order .

		The earlier part of the narration seems most matured .

		There is a charm of style which is irresistible , the illustrations are very helpful , and it is doubtful whether there exists another so interesting account of the '' swarming of the English '' and the gradual approach of these
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL S95 English to the Revolution of
1776	DATE	.

		The later part discusses topics of our own times upon ■ which the minds of men are yet divided .

		The four million ei ^ ht hundred thousand voters who favored Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	in
1884	DATE	will hardly be satbfied with the treatment accorded him as compared with that of the one who .

		although elected , was credited with but sixty-two thou - sand more of the popular vote .

		The almost constant condemnation of the Republican party of a whole generation , and the evident leaning toward the Democratic policies and leaders , notably Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	, will not be relished by others , even by those who will accept as prob - ably correct the judgments on Reconstruction measures of the Republican radicals .

		It is ex - tremely difficult to be absolutely unbiased upon those themes associated with the actions and motives of men now living : and yet whatever the reader 's personal view may be , the pages devoted to later American history will be found extremely interesting and suggestive .

		In all likelihood the chapters which deal with the Jacksonian period will be considered the best of all .

		The dominating presence of masterful men is felt , and one catches the spirit of the times from the flowing sentences whose graeefnl words paint speaking pwrtraits .

		Some - thins of the charm of the stvle is shown in this characterization of
Daniel Webster	PERSON	: '' Mr.
Harne	PERSON	's sentences rode high , upon rhetoric tlutt sought often an adrentiirous flight ; Mr.
Webster	PERSON	used words as if he niea.nt only to clarify and strengthen the thonghts he touched and cared uothing for cadence or ornament .

		And vet be spread them in ranks so fair diat they caught and held the eye like a pageant .

		Beaoty came upon them as they mored as if out of the mere passion of the thought rather than by the deagn of the orator .

		And he himself gave to the eye , as he stood , in his own person the same image of elean-ent strength , beautifal only by reason of its perfect action , so square was he , massive , and indomitable , and with a bead and faee whose mass , whose ealm breadth above the deep-set sinmbrons eyes , seemed the fittest passible throne for the powers he displayed . ''

		But the beauty of the imagery does not give strength to the account of the Jacksonian era ; it is rather the apparent justness of the judg - ments .

		Taking a dozen topics of the middle period and examining the treatment of each , the reader feels that the decision of history in the light of modern criticism is here rightly recorded .

		The story of the reign of
King Andrew	LOCATION	is splendidly told : the difference be - tween the democracy of
Jefferson	PERSON	and that of
Jackson	PERSON	is clearly set forth ; the certain catas - trophe is strikingly described : and the survi - vals of the wreck are plainly marked for per - manent mementoes of a personal regime .

		If only
Jackson	PERSON	had been scored unmercifully for the results of his career , the account would be perfect , but even now one seems to hesitate to blame him for actions which in any other man would lead to severest criticism .

		Many other portions of the History might be mentioned in particular , --
Jackson	PERSON	's view of the court , his view of the constitution , the explanation of his attitude toward South Car - olina , the discussion of the effect of slavery upon the South , the splendid chapter reviewing the
Southern Confederacy	LOCATION	, -- bat enough has been said .

		Here are five volumes by a clear - headed student of American affairs which are suggestive and interesting , filled with striking sentences , and convincing in their thoughtful declarations .

		They make a notable addition to that variety of the literature of American his - tory already rich in the contributions of writers like
McMaster	PERSON	and

		*
Browning	PERSON	has been the chosen theme of lit - erary critics for more than a decade , and already a bibliography upon the subject coven scores of pages .

		No volume has presented a more comprehensive or more exhaustive study of the poet and artist than the recent series of essays by Mr.
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	, published in tiieir totality as '' The Poetry of
Robert Browning	PERSON	. ''

		Uniform in binding and form with Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's earlier volume on ''
Tenny	PERSON	- son , his Art and Relation to Modem Life , '' this later analytic study contains many com - parative illustrations from the methods and works of the two great Victorian poets .

		In the opening chapter of fifty pages , the salient re - semblances and diverse traits of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Browning	PERSON	are carefully summarized .

		If one finds here , in the main , reiteration of former scattered comparisons , tribute is merited for the potent emphasis of similitude and differ - ence .

		With logical force , Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	has outlined the growth of criticism , of analytic method , of impressionist effects , of historical and religious research , -- factors largely re - sponsible for the wide-spread study of

Dec. 1	DATE	, strange , intense poems , Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	finds mir - rored the discords and the eventual harmony of latter-day intellectualism . ''

		These complex and iiitercleaving conditions of thought and passion into which society had grown
Browning	PERSON	represented from almost the beginning of his .

		work .

		When society became conscious of them -- there it found him .

		And , amazed , it said , ' Here is a man who forty years ago lived in the midst of our present life and wrote about it . '

		They saw the wild , loud complexity of their world expressed in his verse ; and yet more dimly conscious , to their consolation , that he was aware of a central peace where the noise was quieted and the tangle unravelled . ''

		Ascribing to Tennyson the greater lauda - tion as pure artist , because of his simpler hu - man sentiments and his more pellucid form .

		Browning represents to the critic that broad , non-partisan vision , both in background and motive , v?hich appeals to modern thought .

		With detailed analysis and illustration Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	considers the chronological develop - ment of
Browning	PERSON	's essential qualities as poet .

		His '' Treatment of Nature '' is contrasted with the imaginative methods of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, Words - worth , and
Byron	PERSON	.

		Three periods characterize his relation to Nature as poetic material , -- the earlier works wherein Nature and hu - manity were interwoven ; the poems following `` The Ring and the Book , '' where absorption in human problems largely eliminated Nature - communion ; and the later partial return to primal inspiration from the correlated love for
Nature	ORGANIZATION	and mankind , as in the swan-song , `` Asolando . ''


Browning	PERSON	's `` Theory of Human Life '' follows as sequence from the earlier chapters .

		From '' Pauline '' and ''
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	'' to '' Abt Vog - ler '' and `` Pisgah-Sights '' are embodied the same dauntless creed : life is for service ; lim - itations and failures are only gradations in attainment ; aspiration is divine . ''

		And what is that I hunger for but God ? '' ''

		Sordello '' is considered , its obscurity con - ceded , its motive and analogies studied .

		A chapter of luminous analysis is devoted to `` The Ring and the Book , '' which is allotted '' the central place in
Browning	PERSON	's development as a poet . ''

		In a general survey of the dramas , both as intellectual masterpieces and dramaturgic failures , from '' Strafford '' to ''
Colombe	ORGANIZATION	's Birthday , '' the critic is just in estimate and comparison .

		Tennyson , no less than
Browning	PERSON	, aspired and failed in this phase of art . ''

		Neither
Tennyson	PERSON	nor
Browning	PERSON	had dra - matic genius , -- that is , the power to conceive , build , coordinate , and finish a drama .

		But they thought they had , and we must pardon them for trying their hand . ''

		The poems of
Browning	PERSON	which treat of love are divided into personal , -- those sacred to the memory of his wife , like '' One Word More '' and '' Prospiee , '' -- and impersonal , ex - ampled in '' Love among the Ruins , '' '' Con - fessions , '' and their associates .

		Despite the subtle and complex soul-problems in
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's most typical work , Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	has culled passages of simple , tender emotions , of joyance , sportiveness , pity , of romantic passions as well as the more intense impulses of lust , hatred , and revenge .


Browning	PERSON	's women form a vivid gallery of varied personalities .

		The chapters entitled '' Womanhood in Browning '' abound in keen , strong characterizations .

		In the au - thor 's judgment , -- '' Among the women whom
Browning	PERSON	made ,
Balaustion	PERSON	is the crown .

		So vivid is her presentation that she seems with us in our daily life .

		And she also fills the histori - cal imagination . ''

		Thisexaltatiou of Balaustion above
Pompilia	LOCATION	,
Colombe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Guendolen	PERSON	, the wonted heroines of
Browning	PERSON	's poetry , is ear - nestly argued in the critic 's idealizing insight and his delight in her Grecian womanhood .

		Preserving to the end the chronological method of examination , the later chapters survey
Browning	PERSON	's last poems , his firm grasp on the noblest ideals of life , his broad , unbiassed trend .

		If there are occasional lapses in form , and an excess of minor illustration , the concluding sum - mary of
Browning	PERSON	's traits as a poet can not be surpassed in insight and vigor . ''

		Creative and therefore joyful , receptive and there - fore thoughtful , at one with humanity and therefore loving ; aspiring to God and believing in God , and therefore steeped to the tips in radiant Hope ; at one with the past , passionate with the present , and possess - ing by faith an endless and glorious future , -- this was a life lived on the top of the wave , and moving with its motion from youth to manhood , from manhood to old age .

		When the first volume of the revised edition of `` Chambers 's Cyclopiedia of English Literature '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- was published we reviewed the work at some length .

		The second volume is now at hand , and cov - ers , roughly speaking , the eighteenth century .

		We say roughly , because the volume begins with
Locke	PERSON	, New - ton , the Burnets , and others whom we commonly think of as writers of the seventeenth century , and includes at the other end a number of people who lived and worked on into the thirties and forties of the nineteenth cen - tury .

Austin Dobson	PERSON	, and there are special es - says in considerable number by Messrs.

		That the life of
Madame de Pompadoar	ORGANIZATION	was worth writing may be a qaestion , bat that Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	has written it exceedingly well is in - dispotably a fact .

		Likewise he has almost silenced criticism upon his choice of a sabjeet by showing that , if
Madame de Pompadour	ORGANIZATION	was the mistress of Louis XV. , she was also mistress of
France	LOCATION	, quite as clever as she was beaatifoL , ambitious for many things besides the smiles of her royal lover , and at her worst excusable as the pitiful result of a de - bauched and degrading enTironment .

		The book opens with an account of the scandalous plot of
Louis	PERSON	' courtiers to enliven the dully virtuous life of the puppet king by implanting in him a taste for wine , cards , and nUsaUiances .

		Then follow , by way of introduction to the account of
Madame de Pom	ORGANIZATION	- padour 's own brilliant career , short sketches of the troubled reigns of the frivolous court beauties who preceded her .

		But it was no grande dame who was to hold the destinies of
France	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	in the hollow of her band ; instead a petite bourgeoite with a loud-voiced , drnnken father , and a shameless mother who , when
Autoinette	PERSON	was nine years old , informed her that she was too pretty to be wasted -LRB- m anyone but a king .

		Madame de Pompadour once described her life as `` like that of a Christian , a perpetual combat . ''

		The obstacles to her becoming the king 's favorite seemed well nigh insurmount - able , but her wit and beauty triumphed over them .

		Then , from the day of her installation at
Versailles	LOCATION	until her deaih.it was war unending with `` ambitious ministers , envious women , and scheming Jesuits '' ; and all the while , if she would hold her place in the fickle heart of the king , she must `` remain fresh , beautiful , and lightrhearted , as if she had not a care in the world beyond the shape of a coiffure or the fit of a gown . ''

		Madame de Pompadour , however , as - pired to much more than a suite at
Versailles	LOCATION	.

		She wished to be , and she was , a great political power .

		`` She made and unmade ministers , she selected am - bassadors , she appointed generals , she conferred pen - sions and places . '' ''

		It is to
Madame de Pompadour	ORGANIZATION	that we owe everything , '' said
Kaunitz	PERSON	.

		the Austrian envoy , referring to the alliance with
Maria Theresa	PERSON	; and as the Austrian alliance meant
France	LOCATION	's entry into the Seven Years ' War , the responsibility for all its rninous disasters is , at least indirectly , to be charged to her account .

		But outside of politics her influence upon public affairs was undoubtedly benef - icent .


France	LOCATION	rests her debtor for the porcelain manufactory at
Sevres	ORGANIZATION	and in large measure for the
Ecole Militaire	ORGANIZATION	, while French artists and men of letters found in her a generous and discrim - inating patron .

		It is this generally ignored phase of
Madame de Pompadour	ORGANIZATION	's character and career that Mr.
Williams	PERSON	wishes to bring into due prom - inence in his account of her life .

		He has sought neither to excuse nor to condemn , but merely to present her life in unbiassed portrayal , making up his record from contemporary sources as many and as diverse as possible .

		Madame de Pompadour is always the central figure of the chronicle , but
Louis	PERSON	and his ministers , the queen ,
Maria Theresa	PERSON	,
Fred	PERSON	- erick of
Prussia	LOCATION	, and a host of others , stand out vividly from the background .

		Mechanically , the volume is one of the most beautiful of the season , being printed on the best of paper , with wide mar - gins , and illastrated with sixteen superb photo - gravures from portraits of the royal family , the Pompadour herself , her allies , and her rivals .

		Every part of
Scotland	LOCATION	is Seott-land '' says Mr.
W. S. Crockett	PERSON	in his preface to '' The Scott Coun - try '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; but he adds that the Border -- the vale of the Tweed -- is par excellenee the home - land of '' the Mighty Minstrel . ''

		To show that the
Border	ORGANIZATION	made Seott what he was , as truly as
Scott	PERSON	made the romance of the Border a power in litera - ture , -- to weave the legend of the one into the life of him who interpreted that legend in his own matchless fashion and who loved the
Border	ORGANIZATION	scenery only less than he did its historic and poetic asso - ciations , -- is the delightful task Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	un - dertakes .

		Himself Border-born and bred , and a loving and thorough student of Scottish legend and literature .

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	combines scholarly accuracy and attention to detail with vivid appreciation of Seott and the country that
Scott	PERSON	loved .

		The lame child 's visit to his grandfather 's farm , the boy 's school-life at
Kelso	PERSON	, the sheriff 's first Border home at
Ashesiiel	LOCATION	, the Making of
Abbotsford	LOCATION	, Memories of Melrose and the
Marmion	PERSON	country , -- all these topics , and much besides , are dealt with compre - hensively but not diffusely , and in such a way as to make the most of the geographical and biographical interests involved . ''

		The Scott Country '' contains one hundred and sixty-two illustrations , made from sketches and photographs , and picturing all sorts of places that the antravelled reader longs to see and the traveller loves to recall .

		It is a pity that the very attractive cover design , a pattern in Scotch thistles , should be spoiled by the strikingly inhar - monious red background .

		To true lovers of
Scott	PERSON	and of literary biography , '' The Scott Country '' will serve merely as a de - lightful introduction to a holiday edition , in five volumes , of the classic Life of Scott by Lock - hart .

		It is strange that this monumental biography , second only to
Boewell	ORGANIZATION	's
Johnson	PERSON	, while it has often been reprinted since its original publication in
1837	DATE	, has never before been adequately edited .

		It has been the aim of the present publishers -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifi9in & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to fill in the '' necessary silences '' of the biographer , himself so nearly a eontemfK > rary of Sir
Walter	PERSON	, from the material furnished by the memoirs , reminiscences , magazine articles , reviews , and prefatory sketches , which , particularly within the last twenty years , have added so much to our knowledge of
Scott	PERSON	and of his friends and acquaint - ance .

		The editorial work of this edition has been done by Miss
Susan M. Francis	PERSON	, whose intimate 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, knowledge of the
Scott	PERSON	literature and painstaking use of its resources amply justify the confidence placed in her .

		The integrity of the original work is preserved by bracketing all the editorial notes and dating such of
Lockhart	PERSON	's as were written for the
1839	DATE	and
1845	DATE	issues and for the condensation prepared by him in
1848	DATE	.

		Constant use has been made of Mr.
David Douglas	PERSON	's editions of
Scott	PERSON	's journal and letters .

		Much of the annotation bears upon associates of
Scott	LOCATION	, well known to
Lockhart	PERSON	's contemporaries , but now faded from public con - sciousness ; and a sketch of
Lockhart	PERSON	's life stands before his preface .

		Qaite as noteworthy as the scholarly annotation are the excellence of the typog - raphy , the fitness of the plain green binding , and the beauty of the photogravures .

		One feels , also , that justice has at last been done to the serious intention and happy achievement of
Lockhart	LOCATION	.

		In these days of made-to-order biography , it is well to be reminded occasionally that the true biographer is born , not made , and that erudite industry over the records is a poor substitute for real acquaint - ance with the man portrayed .

		This very complete , scholarly , and beautifully embellished revision of a great model can not but be warmly welcomed , espe - cially by those seeking a gift-book of the more ster - ling and substantial sort that always finds accept - ance with readers of taste and culture .

		Among the wealth of new nature-studies , it is well that the forerunner of them all in this country ,
Thoreau	PERSON	's ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' is not forgotten .

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who in
1897	DATE	issued a two-volume holiday edition of the work , this year offer practically the same book , with only such changes as were necessary to bring it into a single volume .

		Lovers of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	will find it hard to re - sist the charm of this sumptuous edition .

		The book-making is perfect in every detail .

		The thirty photogravures , made from photographs and printed on Japanese vellum , are revelations of what soft - ness and beauty can be secured by that process .

		Without following the lines of the text , they illus - trate all phases of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's life , -- bis homes and haunts , his friends and himself .

		The best , perhaps , are a portrait of
Alcott	LOCATION	, one of Thoreau in
1855	DATE	, a view of the old
Marlborough	LOCATION	road , and the Wal - den pictures .

		No brief notice can do the book justice ; it is that rare thing , a wholly satisfactory edition of a favorite classic .

		Those of Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	's readers who remember with pleasure the illustrated edition of '' A
Child of Nature	ORGANIZATION	, '' will now welcome '' Under the Trees '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with decorations by the same artist , Mr.
Charles L. Hinton	PERSON	.

		Be - sides several full-page photogravures , there is a series of twelve border designs , colored in delicate green and repeated through the pages of the book .

		Mr.
Hinton	PERSON	's conception of nature is Greek .

		Nymphs and satyrs wander through the meadows or rest by the brook-sides , shepherds pipe dreamily under the trees , and frisky little Bacchantes gather grapes for their banqueting .

		In this way has the artist chosen to emphasize Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's sense of the personality of nature , his quest for the mystic soul behind the gorgeous trappings , which is perhaps the key-note of his nature-study .

		A nature book of an absolutely different type is Mr.
William J. Long	PERSON	's '' School of the Woods '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Long	PERSON	's interest is not , like Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's , in the moving principle behind the out - door world , nor in viewing nature as a reflection of himself ; but in the wood and field-folk them - selves , and in their lives as individuals .

		Mr.
Long	PERSON	is probably our foremost animal psychologist ; and his method and material are all his own .

		The make - up of his book suggests Mr.
Seton-Thompson	PERSON	's work , and the quaint Indian names used for the animals a method of
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	.

		But these resem - blances are superficial ; Mr.
Long	PERSON	enters the field with ideas and methods of his own .

		One novel suggestion running through most of the stories , and determining the title of the book , is that in animal as in human life education is the great controlling force .

		Instinct , Mr.
Long	PERSON	says , is like heredity : without training it amounts to nothing ; and he supports his theory by showing how , to a careful observer , '' the
summer	DATE	wilderness is just one vast school-house , '' full of wild mothers teaching the secret of success in life to their little ones .

		Mr.
Long	PERSON	is a keen observer , a clear expositor , and a delightful story-teller , certain to please both the children and their elders .

		The illustrations are by Mr.
Charles Copeland	PERSON	, who has made , besides the full-page drawings , some two hundred marginal sketches , fascinating in themselves and aptly illus - trative of the text .

		The book makes a real addi - tion to animal lore and literature .

		A new volume in the `` British Artists Series '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is Lord
Ronald Sutherland Gower	PERSON	's account of '' Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, his Life and Art . ''

		Lord
Gower	PERSON	's style is sometimes clumsy , but his intimate knowledge of his subject and his skilful choice of detail incline the reader to pardon an occasional lapse into obscurity .

		He appreciates Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's towering humanity , as well as his matchless art ; so that painter and layman alike can read his book with pleasure .

		To the biograph - ical account are appended supplementary chapters upon Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's writings , the engravers of his works , and important sales and exhibitions of his paintings .

		As is true of all the volumes of this series , a chief feature of this volume is its profuse and beautiful illustrations .

		These consist of repro - ductions of ninety of Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's pictures , many of them having been photographed for the first time especially for Lord
Gower	PERSON	's book .

		There are two especially beautiful plates in photogravure .

		It is a pity that the proof-reader should have failed to note so obvious an error as that on page 10 .

		THE DIAL 399 eminent an example of good book-making .

		That
Fra Angelieo	ORGANIZATION	's familiar angeU , -- '' celestial dolU , flat as paper , stuck fast to their gold frames , '' -- are not onlr nnworthy of the homage paid them , but are not even representatiTe of
Fra Angelico	LOCATION	, who '' was primarily an artist , an artist who hap - pened to be a saint , * ' is , in brief , Mr.
Doaglaa	PERSON	's thesis .

		That his information is sound , his reasoning cogent , and his presentation striking and attractive , is proved by the demand for another edition of the monograph .

		With its many excellent reproductions of the painter 's works , a complete index to his paintings and drawings , and a bibliography , it makes not only an attractive holiday book , but a really valuable addition to art criticism .

		Another painter to be honored this season with a sumptuously illustrated volume is
Jean Francis Millet	PERSON	.

		His life was partly written by his dear friend
Alfred Sensier	PERSON	, after whose death it was completed and published in
1881	DATE	.

		This book is now out of print .

		The only English translation was much abridged ; and since it was made , more of
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's letters and many interesting ptersonal reminiscences of him have been published .

		In Mrs.
Julia Cartwrigbt	PERSON	's new ■ * Life and Letters of Mil - let '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- ^ n effort has been made to ntilite all previous resources , and thus to give to English readers a complete and interesting biography of the great peasant painter .

		Much of the story is told in
Millet	LOCATION	's own words , -- in letters , or in recollections written for
Sensier	ORGANIZATION	's use .

		The strong graphic style of his paintings also distinguishes
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's writings ; so that one feels the largely epistolary biography to be the right form here .

		The treatment is en - tirely narrative , with the smallest possible amount of art criticism .

		It is the spirit of the paintings , not their technique , that appeals to the author , -- the humanity of the artist rather than his genius with the brush .

		His gallant up-hill fight against the rigid classicism that debased and narrowed the art of his time , his determination to starve rather than be known as a '' painter of naked women , '' his masterly idealization of the prosaic theme of dull , grinding toil .

		-- these are the things that seem to his biographer best worth considering ; and so , no doubt , would Millet have looked at the matter .

		Bat while there is very little analysis of his art .

		the story of its evolution , from the graceful little pastels of nymphs and cherubs that would sell , to the unconventional peasants that would not , is told vividly and sympathetically .

		As biography , the book is successful in that it evolves a personality ; as art history , its value is greatly enhanced by the frontispiece portrait and the nine reproductions in photogravure of
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		There is open to every biographer a choice be - tween the subjective and the objective emphasis .

		The former may be nearer to '' the thing-in-itself , '' and will inevitably be more intimate , more minute , and probably more exhaustive .

		But the objective presentation has also its value , showing briefly , ac - curately , and sympathetically , as it does in its beet examples , the man among his fellows , as he ap - pears to his friends and acquaintance , who have scant attention to bestow on him save only what the power of his personality and the measure of his achievements wrest from them .

		So .

		thoaeh Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	's admirable biography of
William Morris	PERSON	is perhaps the final word upon the personal life of its subject , there is a place also for Miss
Elisabeth L. Gary	PERSON	's ■ ■
William Morris	PERSON	, Poet , Craftsman , Social - ist '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		This is the objective account of the artist , tracing in general outline , no less vivid beeaaea leea detailed , his busy , many-sided career .

		The book ia boand uniformly with the same author 's previous volumes on
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, and the
Bossettis	PERSON	, and is profusely illustrated with photo - gravure portraits , and reproductions of wall paper and tapestry designs , of furniture and other pro- ducts turned oat by the firm of
Morris & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and of Kelmseott types , press-marks , and specimen pages .

		Morris 's various activities are treated in separate chapters , but the unity in the remarkable diversity of his interests is shown , and the steps in his de - velopment from craftsman to socialist made clear .

		Miss
Cary	PERSON	's special fitness for the work she is do - ing lies in her ability to select from among masses of detail what will best evoke a personality for the general reader .

		She never loses her sense of pro- portion nor fails in easy manipulation of her mater - ials .

		If she is least interesting when she writes of
Morris	PERSON	the poet , perhaps that is only beeaose poetry was
Morris	PERSON	's least interesting mode of expression .

		The thirty-two reproductions of American mas - terpieces contained in the new illustrated edition of Mr.
Charles H. Caffin	PERSON	's * ' American Masters of Painting '' -LRB- Donbleday -RRB- serve a two-fold purpose , showing pictorially what our art has achieved in its brief course and explicating Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	's references for those of his readers who have no other means of checking his estimates .

		Apart from the vital interest of their subject matter , Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	's eaaaya are charming bits of criticism .

		His style is clear , concise , and direct , yet intensely suggestive , and packed with allusions that indicate real mastership of the subject .

		His ** appreciations '' are not im - pressionisdc , bat are firmly based upon keen analysis of the distinctive qualities of each painter ; and these qaalities in turn are accoanted for as the joint pro- duet of the man and the artistic affinities he has foand for himself in this country or , more often , abroad .

		These essays , thirteen in number , are the first ade - quate attempt to set forth the present standing of American art , as it has been lifted by such men as
Inness	PERSON	.


Whistler	LOCATION	,
Sargent	LOCATION	.

		Abbey ,
Tryon	PERSON	.

		Winslow Homer , and La Farge .

		The last essay in the vol - ume is in the nature of a retrospect , having for its subject
Gilbert Stuart	PERSON	, the first of ■ ■ American Mas - ters of Painting . ''

		In two volumes , prettily bound in blue and gold and boxed together , comes Miss
Clara E. Laughlin	PERSON	's `` Stories of Authors ' Loves '' -LRB- Lippincof -RRB- .

		Inter - est in the love-affairs of literary men and women is undeniable , at least among feminine readers , and .

		400 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, so Miss Laaghlin thinks , quite legitimate .

		For have not they created onr traditions and ideals of romance , and is not the desire natural which seeks to know how they realized these ideals ?

		Is not a `` hoarded happiness a talent in a napkin , '' and a failure a danger signal ?

		So Miss
Laughlin	PERSON	justifies herself , though it is doubtful if she needs any justi - fication , since she is not exploiting new material but merely giving to the old a new emphasis .

		She tells her little romances pleasantly and sympathetically , extenuating rather than sitting in judgment , aiming for truth both to fact and spirit , making only rare lapses into anything approaching sentimentality .

		The materials treated are drawn from sources as diverse as the lives of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
Thoreau	PERSON	, of
Keats	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		Each ro - mance is so related as to call up much else in the author 's career , and thus proportion is preserved .

		The portraits and views used as illustrations are well selected , and beautifully reproduced in photo - gravure and duogravure .

		Ten years ago , when Miss
Alice M. Bacon	PERSON	brought out her book on `` Japanese Girls and Women , '' she touched upon a phase of life in the land of the chrysanthemum that had been wholly ne & ; lected by previous writers .

		So thoroughly did she do her work that it has since stood almost without a rival ; and the new illustrated edition of the book -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , revised to fit the changed conditions of to-day , needs no justification .

		The principal change in the text is the addition of two chapters , one upon house - hold customs , the other a survey and analysis of the astonishing progress made by the Japanese women within the last ten years .

		But in every chapter there are revisions and additions , chronicling such matters as the coming of the baby carriage , the de - cline of the etiquette lesson in the interest of higher education -- including gymnastics , -- and the liter - ary club , the opening to women of all sorts of new occupations , and their elevation by means of legisla - tion and in public opinion ; hinting , in short , at the rapid modernizing and Westernizing of feminine
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations made for this edition by
Keishu Takenouchi	PERSON	, one of the foremost illustrators of
Japan	LOCATION	, and including outline drawings and colored plates , are altogether charming .

		Being also , as
Miss Bacon	LOCATION	assures us , absolutely true to the facts , they serve to add vividness and reality to the text .

		The dainty Japanese cover design lends a finishing touch to a very attractive book . ''

		The American Diary of a Japanese Girl '' -LRB-
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an amusing account , in journal form , of its author 's six months ' visit to '' Amerikey , '' under the chaperonage of an indulgent uncle .

		The work is sufficiently extravagant , and at the same time sufficiently clever , to be either an excellent American forgery or a genuine experience .

		In either case it is interesting .

		The author , who styles herself '' Miss Morning Glory , '' spent inost of her time in
California	LOCATION	, paying but a flying visit to
Chicago	LOCATION	, which she stigmatizes as the smoky `` City of Man , '' and barely reached
New York	LOCATION	when she decided to court further novelty by mask - ing for a month as a house-servant .

		At this point her journal abruptly closes with the promise of a later installment entitled '' The Diary of a Parlour Maid . ''

		An odd mixture of na'ivetS and affectation , of vanity and sentimentality , of sprightly satire and quiet humor , makes up the book .

		It is daintily illustrated by a Japanese artist -- or at least an artist with a Japanese name , -- who has drawn '' Miss Morning Glory '' in all sorts of novel and interesting situations .

		The cover , with its Japanese design and its edging of yellow straw , is striking and appropriate .

		One of the most delightful holiday books of a season or two ago was the edition of Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	's `` The Golden Age , '' with illustrations by Mr.
Maxfield Parrish	PERSON	.

		A happier combination of author and illustrator could hardly have been hit upon , and Mr.
Grahame	PERSON	's classic sketches of child - life took a new interest through Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	's im - aginative interpretations .

		Even more delightful is the companion volume now issued containing the same author 's '' Dream Days '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Here Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	's drawings are reproduced in photo - gravure , instead of the half-tone process used in the earlier book , and as a result we are able to view the artist 's work very nearly as it appears in the orig - inal , with all its minute refinement of detail and delicate contrasts of light and shade .

		In addition to the ten photogravures in the text , Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	has also drawn , in his own inimitable way , the title - page , cover-design , tail-pieces , and end-papers for the book .

		It is hardly necessary to speak here of Mr.
Grahame	PERSON	's text .

		His two books hold a place apart in the literature of childhood , and we can well envy the reader who has yet to make their acquaintance .


Goldsmith	PERSON	's `` The Deserted Village '' has been brought out by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	in a sumptuous holiday edition , with an introduction by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, followed by
Goldsmith	PERSON	's own quaint dedication to Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, and more than thirty full-page illustrations by Mr.
Edwin A. Abbey	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's introduction is a delicate and sympathetic analysis of the real and ideal elements in the poem , and is written in his happiest critical vein .

		Mr.
Abbey	PERSON	's drawings , which are of course the feature of the edition , are imaginative , pictur - esque , and charming in themselves , like all his illus - trative work , and really interpretative of the text .

		They are filled with the same quiet beauty and pathos , are lighted by the same stray gleams of humor , and marked by the same spirit of bygone days and rural scenes , that give '' The Deserted Village '' its peculiar fldvor .

		The stories of about fifty '' Historic Houses of
New Jersey	LOCATION	'' are interestingly related by Mr.
W. Jay Mills	PERSON	in a handsome volume published by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a book that enthusi - astic Colonial Dames and Sons and Daughters of the Revolution will gloat over , particularly if they be also sons and daughters of
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 401 that the int `` reet of the sketches is limited and lo - cal , for the landmarks of New Jersej are the land - marks of the nation .

		History , family tradition , anecdote , gossip , letters , and local records , hare all been ransacked to call np the brilliant past of the little state and make it live before the reader .

		Every effort has been pat forth to secare accuracy and completeness , as well as vividness , in this new field of research ; and the resalt is a series of brief , clear , and very significant aecoants of the historic associations and famous inhabitants of a few of
New Jersey	LOCATION	's old homes .

		About twenty photogravures from drawings , photographs , and rare old prints , add materially to the interest of the book .

		Mrs.
Sarah K. Bolton	PERSON	's brief biographical sketches of '' Famous Artists '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		first pub - lished in
1890	DATE	.

		is now re-issued in holiday form , with a portrait of each painter and four or five ex - amples of bis work .

		The author 's point of view is neither scientific nor critical .

		She aims merely to relate in compact form the main events of each artist 's life in such a way as to emphasize bis lof ^ purpose and noble achievements .

		Industry , reso - lution , ambition , enthusiasm , fidelity in all the relations of life , are brought forward in each biog - raphy as the means by which poverty , jealous com - peers , and unreasonable patrons were vanquished and success attained .

		The artists discussed are
Michael	PERSON	' Angelo .

		Da Vioci ,
Raphael	PERSON	.

		Titian .

		Ma - rillo ,
Rubens	PERSON	,
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	,
Reynolds	PERSON	,
Landseer	PERSON	, and
Turner	ORGANIZATION	.

		Similar in scope to the foregoing book , and pub - lished by the same firm , is the two-volume work on `` Famous Composers , '' by Mr.
Nathan H. Dole	PERSON	.

		Like Mrs.
Bolton	PERSON	's book , also , this work was first issued about ten years ago .

		The present edition is beautifully bound and contains a portrait of each composer considered in the text , together with nu - merous other full-page illustrations .

		The biograph - ical sketches , twenty in number , are complete , accu - rate , and entertaining .

		Though they will of course be found of greatest interest by music-lovers , they are also adapted to the comprehension of the mere layman who wishes to know at least the main facts in the lives of the world 's great musicians .

		The list of composers considered extends from
Palestrina	LOCATION	to
Wagner	PERSON	.

		Max
Mailer	PERSON	's charming and popular old-world idyl called • • Memories '' is given an artistic setting in the holiday edition issued this year by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Besides a decorated initial at the beginning of each chapter , there are eight full-page lUu ` trations from charcoal drawings by Miss Blanche O ' ^ tertag .

		These combine with the wide margins , beautiful typography , and unique cover design , to make a book both quaint and dainty , as befits the classic little romance .

		The translation , which first appeared in
1888	DATE	.

		is the work of Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	.

		He has caught quite as well as Miss 0 '' tertag the quiet , contemplative spirit of this `` prose poem '' and the graceful simplicity of its language , which his English faithfully repro - duces .

		Interesting as showing an unexpected phase of
Max Mailer	PERSON	's many-sided activity , illustrating , too .

		in its style , the canon of unaeademic simplicity which he never tired of preaching to his pedantic countrymen , but charming above all for its delicacy of sentiment , `` Memories '' in its present artistic form will appeal to many holiday buyers .

		Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	, whose compilations are valued by a. large circle of readers , has this year edited and arranged two more volumes , ''
London	LOCATION	'' and `` Famous Paintings '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead < & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The latter continues the work begun in '' Great Paintings Described by Great Writers . ''

		As before .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	has been careful to select only rec - ognized masterpieces , and to choose as commenta - tors competent and interesting critics who know how to interpret a picture broadly , so as to make it speak for the artist 's whole work .

		As a guide - book or a foundation for art-study at home , thu work will be found interesting and valuable .

		The volume on
London	LOCATION	is much on the plan of the pre - Tions one on
Paris	LOCATION	, except that the selections , in - stead of dealing with special monuments , oftener record general impressions mide by various parts of the great city .

		The subject is limited by the exclusion of articles on
London	LOCATION	of the past .

		The pieturesqueness of the city , its immensity , the dis - tinctive characteristics of the several districts , the churches , clubs , and theatres , varioas types of Lon - doners , and the charm of the
London	LOCATION	fog .

		are a few of the chief topics treated in charming essays by such writers as
Dickens	LOCATION	,
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	,
Gautier	PERSON	, Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, and others .

		Bath of Miss
Singleton	PERSON	's books are profusely and beautifully illustrated .

		In the two handsome volumes entiUed '' French Cathedrals and Chateaux '' -LRB-
Euight & Millet	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
Miss Clara Crawford Perkins	PERSON	combines a simple account of the development of architectural styles in
France	LOCATION	with a guide to the great monuments of French architecture .

		About a third of the first volume is occupied with a general treatment of the growth of the Gothic style , -- including chapters on glass-staining , the art of tracery , and the sculpture employed as accessory decoration , -- and with historical outlines and tables .

		These last are intended for use in connection with the numer - ous references to names and events in the chapters that follow .

		Descriptions of some of the g ^ at French cathedrals , with attention to their historical associations as well as to the artistic q ^ ialities of each , make up the remainder of Volume I. Volume II .

		begins with an explanatory chapter on
Renais	PERSON	- sance architecture , and , since that type found its best expression in secular and domestic buildmgs .

		goes on to describe some of the more notable pal - aces and chateaux .

		Sixty-two half-tone engravings add clearness and attractiveness to the descriptive portions of the text .

		The plan of the work will commend itself to amateur students of architecture , who know how few manuals of architecture there are , at once simple , comprehensive , and trust - 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, worthy ; while travellers , dissatisfied with mere unrelated legends and isolated descriptions , will be glad to find so good a book for study and so pleas - ant a companion for their sight-seeing and their personal observations of the many interesting things described in
Miss Perkins	LOCATION	's expository chapters .

		Mr.
John Kelman	PERSON	's `` The Holy Land '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is a new evidence of the ever-increasing interest in
Palestine	LOCATION	and its history .

		To be able to vivify the meagre Gospel narrative of Christ 's life , to paint in the `` local color '' and so impart the note of reality , the tang of a genuine experi - ence to the apostolic story , is a vital need of mod - ern Christianity , and one which few of us can journey to Palestine to satisfy .

		Among the vol - uminous literature intended to serve as a substitute for such a pilgrimage the distinction of the present volume lies in the extraordinary beauty of its col - ored plates , and in the excellent arrangement , in - teresting detail , and completeness of the text .

		Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	arranges his impressions of Palestine un - der three divisions .

		Part I. , '' The Land , '' is of course largely descriptive .

		Its opening chapter , upon the color of the country , is particularly happy as serving to introduce Mr.
Fulleylove	PERSON	's paintings , the most conspicuous feature of which is perhaps their exquisite coloring .

		Part II. , `` The Invaders , '' deals with the traces , material and spiritual , left upon Palestine by Israelitish , Roman , Christian , and Moslem occupations .

		Part III. , entitled `` The Spirit of
Syria	LOCATION	, '' sets forth Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	's impres - sions of the spectre-haunted hopelessness , the par - alyzing superstition , and the stolid indifference to disease and filth that characterize modern Palestine .

		The book closes with the suggestion that not in the Zionist movement but in the advance of Western ideals and in the Christian missions is there hope of a resurrection for the Holy Land .

		Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	is a careful observer and a lucid and often brilliant writer ; so that his work is quite worthy of being made the basis for Mr.
Fulleylove	PERSON	's splendid paint - ings .

		Altogether '' The Holy Land '' is one of the most attractive of the season 's publications .

		Pleasant records of strolls '' Along French By - ways , '' '' Among English Hedgerows , '' and through '' The Isle of the Shamrock , '' have earned for Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	a reputation as a delightful racon - teur and an expert photographer .

		His latest book , ``
New England	LOCATION	and Its Neighbors '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is similar in form , and in its emphasis upon the rural aspects of the community 's life , to the volumes that precede it .

		Many of the sketches have been published before as magazine articles .

		Some have an historic or literary interest -- as , for example , the chapters entitled '' Midwinter in Valley Forge '' and '' The Home of
Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, '' But this is incidental ; the book is primarily a study of farm - life among the Yankees and their
New York	LOCATION	neighbors , as such chapter-titles as '' Down in
Maine	LOCATION	, '' '' The Autumn Cattle Show , '' and '' Life on a Green Mountain Top '' will suggest .

		From Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's preface we learn that this volume is to be the first in an American series of works dealing with some of the distinctive and picturesque phases of our native country life .

		The book is abundantly illustrated from the author 's own photographs .

		The descriptive element , incidental but of un - common interest , in Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	's '' Voice of the People , '' is emphasized in the new illustrated edition issued by
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A series of twenty-four pictures , from photographs taken especially for this book , portray the sleepy old town of
Kingsborough	LOCATION	, where the action of the story begins and ends , and
Richmond	LOCATION	, where
Nicho	PERSON	- las
Burr	PERSON	, its hero , spent his tragically ended term as governor . ''

		The Voice of the People '' is one of the few recent novels likely to have a lasting inter - est ; and this edition , with its added suggestions of local color and out-door charm , and its unusually artistic cover , bright with the fiame of the
Virginia	LOCATION	creeper , is a well-merited tribute to the strong and serious work of the author .

		Out of Book I. of ''
Ben Hur	PERSON	, '' which , it will be remembered , tells the story of the Christ-child 's birth ,
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	have made a beautiful little holiday volume .

		The illustrations are brown toned plates from paintings by
Murillo	PERSON	,
Raphael	PERSON	,
Knaus	PERSON	, and
Barabino	PERSON	; and there are , be - sides , tinted marginal drawings illustrating the text .

		General
Wallace	PERSON	's special preface is very interesting , telling the story of the inception of ''
Ben Hur	PERSON	, '' which , it seems , grew out of a chance conversation with the late
Robert G. Ingersoll	PERSON	.

		Long before , however , the author 's interest in the Wise Men of the
East	LOCATION	had led to the writing of a brochure upon their journey to
Bethlehem	LOCATION	; and this old manuscript , hitherto unpublished , was brought forth to make the beginning of the longer story .

		Bat the independent unity of the birth narrative was not sacrificed , and it made possible the inde - pendent publication , in
1899	DATE	, of the original bro - chure .

		The present richly illustrated edition , how - ever , is the one that
General Wallace	ORGANIZATION	looked forward to ` when he first recognized the literary possibilities of this most mystically beautiful of all the legends that cluster about the first Christmas day .

		From Messrs.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	& Sons come three volumes recently added to the '' New Century Li - brary . ''

		They comprise `` The Complete Poetical Works of
Robert Burns	PERSON	, '' '' The Poetical Works of
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	'' -LRB- containing the poems written between
1830	DATE	and
1859	DATE	-RRB- , and `` The Life and Ad - ventures of
Don Quixote	PERSON	. ''

		The little volumes , four by six inches in size and none of them an inch thick , are printed in large type on the thinnest of
India	LOCATION	paper , and daintily yet durably bound in cloth or limp leather .

		Each volume contains a frontispiece portrait , and the edition of
Burns	ORGANIZATION	includes an `` ap - preciation '' of the poet by
Lord Rosebery	ORGANIZATION	.

		For a holiday gift-book of moderate price , combining solid worth of contents with beauty of outward form , nothing better could be found than any one of these dainty pocket volumes .

		Since the intimate disclosures of the Browning

		THE DIAL 40 '' I Letters of

		In particalar do Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's `` Sonnets from the Portngnese '' -- the poetically restrained portrajal of the ptassion that floods an - measared through the letters -- compel fresh notice of their exalted tenderness of feeling and their per - fection of form .

		Bat while the sonnets themselves offer ample justification for a new edition , the distinctive feature of the dainty book just issued by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons is the series of exquisitely-colored illustrationg , including borders and fall-page drawings , by Miss
Margaret Arm	PERSON	- strong .

		The color-printing is particularly good , and the whole book is in keeping with the delicate spirit of the jx > etry .

		Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	sends to her American friends and readers through Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` A Christmas Greeting , '' in the form of the old - time `` annual '' or gift-book , whose mission , like that of the Christmas card , was to convey the compliments of the season , and whose appropriate resting-place was rather the parlor table than the library shelf .

		Perhaps Miss
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	deplores the new connotation that the term '' Holiday book '' ia rapidly acquiring , and thinks we have not yet fully emphasized the meaning of Christmas and of the New Year .

		Or , possibly , in prej > aring her `` Christ - mas Greeting '' she meant merely to utilize the odds and ends of material on her writing table , and in - cidentally to show how versatile she could be when she chose .

		In this last attempt she has certainly succeeded .

		# '' say8 .

		sketches , stories -LRB- including some for children -RRB- , poems , and even a piece of mosic , are included in the contents of the volume , -- a remarkable variety , certainly , to come with apparent ease from one pen .

		All the sabject - matter has a Christmas flavor , but many of the distinctive ideas for which Miss Corelli stands are touched upon in the sketches .

		Much of the verse is patriotic , and several articles deal with current affairs in
England	LOCATION	.

		Three volumes have been added this year to the dainty little '' Thumb-Nail Series '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- : `` The Rivals . ''

		with an introduction from Mr.
Jef	PERSON	- ferson 's Autobiography ; `` In Memoriam . ''

		with Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's criticism from the '' Victorian Poets '' as a preface ; and the '' Thoughts '' of
Pascal	LOCATION	, translated and edited by Mr.
Benjamin E. Smith	PERSON	.

		The em - bowed leather covers are wrought in beaatifal symbolic designs , and the little classics as a whole are notable examples of suitable and delightful book-making .

		The last completed story of the late
Paul Leices	PERSON	- ter
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, '' Wanted -- A
Chaperon	PERSON	, '' has been brought oat in dainty holiday dress by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	.


Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a clever little narrative , in much the same style as `` Wanted -- A Match - maker , '' and , like the other story , it has been illus - trated in color by Mr.
Christy	PERSON	and embellished with flower-borders by Miss
Margaret Armstrong	PERSON	, who also drew the nniqoe cover design .

		It is one of the prettiest of the smaller holiday books of the season .

		To the `` Ariel Booklete , '' Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ' series of diminutive classics ,
Dickens	PERSON	's `` Christ ' mas Carol '' is the most recent addition .

		There are now fifty-seven volumes to be had in this pretty series , with their neat printing and limp red leather covers . ''

		A Christmas Carol '' is profusely illus - trated by Mr.
Frederick Simpson Coburn	PERSON	, and , like all the issues of the series , is one of the daintiest of unpretentious gift-books . ''

		The Mishaps of an Automobilist '' -LRB-
Stokee Co.	ORGANIZATION	y is a book of comic drawings , in black-and-white and in colors , by Mr.
DeWitt Clinton	PERSON	Falls , with explan - atory verses by Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	.

		Here the amateur chauffeur will find the tragic accidents that beeet his mad career all drawn to the life , in most diverting fashion .

		The pictures are clever and amusing ; some of the verses have a touch of real humor ; the g ^ en burlap cover is unique and attrac - tive ; and the book as a whole is calculated to pro- vide the automobile enthusiast , his friends , and even his enemies , with entertainment for a dull half-hoar .

		Books fob thk T'oung .

		Again this year tbere must be entered a general pro- test against the lack of original literary quality in the books designed for the reading of tboae wbiMe years are not vet ripe .

		To a pecoliar degree th eee Tolanes justify the dictam of the late
Walter Bagebot	PERSON	, to the effect thai the writers of the day are of two classes : those who know bow to write , bat have notbiog to say ; and tboae who have something to say , but do not know how to write .

		As a partial offset , it most be said that tbere have never been so many books pablisbed with a teal claim to physical beauty .

		Few children 's books now go forth without illustratioas ; indeed , those with pictures in color are growing as common as were those with any sort of decoration a generation ago .

		In print and bind - ing , also , and in general tastefalness of design , maaj of the juveniles of the season deserve high praise .

		Again this year there is noticeable a decrease over the last few years in the nomber of children 's books dealing with war and bloodshed , even stories of the army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	having to do with those neeeaiaiy eriis in times of peace rather than those of aetaal eaasbat .

		Books of adventure show a slight increase in number ; those of travel in strange lands , a slight decrease , so far as the two can be differentiated .

		There are more books of jingles , and seemingly more for the very yoaog .

		There is Botioeable , too , an increasiag specialization in books addressed to those of varioas ages ; -- where books were broadly addressed to children as a whole not so long ago , they are now designed for children within more de - finite limits as to age .

		And there is a marked increase -- surely a sign of the times -- in the number of writers who appeal to girls alone , from the nursery to young womanhood .

		Among these are several which trace a girl 's career throngh continnons years , a manner quite unknown among the books for boys .

		The lack of liter - 404 THE DIAL -LSB-

		erary merit which we have noted leads us to give the place of honor in our list to a group of books that are rewritings or compilations , or attractive new editions , rather than to the original compositions of the year .

		Children , as well as their elders , have for some time been accustomed to look each year for a book of fairy stories from Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		These volumes , it will be remembered , have been designated by some color or shade of binding , from which they have taken their name ; so that we have had one year a '' Red Fairy Book , '' the next a '' Blue Fairy Book , '' and so on .

		Whether it is that the tints have run out , or the supply of fairy stories , or both , this year Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has given us '' The Book of Ro - mance '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , which contains a number of the legends of the Knights of the
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	, and one or two from the Sagas of the North .

		These are re-told in Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's attractive manner , and the volume is illus - trated in color and in black-and-white by Mr.
H. J. Ford	PERSON	.

		-- A worthy companion to this is the Rev.

Charlemagne	PERSON	and the Twelve Peers of

		Here all the illustrations are in color , from the hand of Mr.
George Morrow	PERSON	; while the text does for the chan - sons de geste what Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has done for Sir
Thomas Malory	PERSON	.

		-- Third in the group is another of Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	's volumes of the '' Annals of Fairyland '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , specifically termed '' The Reign of King
Ober	PERSON	- on . ''

		In the face of the title , most of the contents are taken from the folk-lore tales of the
Brothers Grimm	ORGANIZATION	; but they lose nothing in re-telling .

		Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	has made the pictures , in black-and-white with the ex - eeption of the frontispiece , which is in color ; and he is to be credited also with the cover design , also in color , and really beautiful .

		-- At last an edition of the most popular and the greatest of all books has been prepared especially for the use of younger folk , and it is quite likely that an apology is due for not placing at the head of this paragraph a mention of • • The Bible for Chil - dren '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which has been edited by Mrs.
Joseph B. Gilder	PERSON	-LRB- curiously enough , her name is omitted from the title-page , which gives notice only of the in - troduction by the Right Rev.
Henry C. Potter	PERSON	and the preface by the Rev.
Francis Brown	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The version of King
James	PERSON	has been used , everything which would lead an inquisitive child to ask untoward questions omitted , and the narrative pieced together in a skilful manner to make a fairly continuous story .

		Both the Old and New Testaments have been drawn on , but not the books known to Protestants as Apocryphal , though these would have done much toward filling the gap between
Jonah	PERSON	and the
Annunciation	LOCATION	.

		Twenty-fonr reproductions from the old masters serve as illustrations , and the entire volume , a fine quarto , is handsomely rubricated .

		Such a work , BO performed , has long been much desired .

		-- Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	's ''
Alice	PERSON	in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' of last year is now followed by his pictured edition of '' Through the Look - ing Glass '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A portrait of Mr.
Newell	PERSON	serves for frontispiece , and it is a pleasure to record the fact that for once the genial face of the artist does not in any way belie his work .

		This is all the better because this work continually suggests the time-honored pictures of Sir
John Tenniel	PERSON	in the same behalf , with changes which the younger folk , unquestionably the best judges , will decide are for the better New editions of Miss Aleott 's `` An Old - Fashioned Girl '' and '' Little Women '' have been made -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the former illus - itrated by Miss
Jessie Willcox Smith	PERSON	, and the latter by Mrs.
Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	.

		Here again there will be some regret among the elders at losing the quaint Teu - tonic outline sketches which decorated these books for so many years ; but sound artistic judgment must favor the more modern treatment , which will commend these favorite books to new readers as well as old .

		-- Mr.
William Wallace Denslow	PERSON	has made a series of designs for
Clement C. Moore	PERSON	's '' The Night before Christmas '' -LRB-
Dillingham	PERSON	-RRB- , every page in multicolor and the text lettered in .

		By shaving the upper lip of the good St.
Nicholas	PERSON	, Mr.
Denslow	PERSON	has made him as American as if he had taken out naturalization papers , and droll be - yond easy description .

		It is a pleasure to record the steady advance in the delineation of children on the part of this conscientious and ingenious artist .

		Quite as much care for the verities has fl ^ nt ^ uUe .

		K ° ° * ' '' * ° ^ ^ ^ making of
Miss Beulah Marie Dix	ORGANIZATION	's children 's story , '' A Little Captive Lad '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as into her historical ro - mances .

		The period is that of the expelled Stuarts , the small hero a devout royalist in exile under the care of an impecunious cavalier .

		His uncle brings him back to
England	LOCATION	, and the rest of the book is concerned with the child 's coming to a realization of the identity of his real friends .

		It is a good story .

		-- Mrs.
Harriet T. Comstock	PERSON	has taken equal pains with '' Tower or Throne , a Romance of the Girlhood of Elizabeth '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which she follows the cbecquered ca - reer of that great princess during her troubled early life .

		The book gives an excellent picture of the little scion of royalty who once wished herself a milkmaid Where the previous book stopped with the accession to the throne .

		Miss
Eva March Tappan	PERSON	, Ph.D. , takes the Queen on to the close of her life , in her romance , '' In the Days of Queen Elizabeth '' -LRB-

Holland	LOCATION	for Children '' -LRB- McClnrg -RRB- is by Mrs.
Jessie Anderson Chase	PERSON	, with illustrations by Mr.
Troy Kinney	PERSON	and Mrs.
Margaret West Kinney	PERSON	.

		It deals with a cheerful little girl in the dark days of the Spanish subjugation of that courageous people , and is both thrilling and instructive .

		-- Mrs.
Harriet T. Corn	PERSON	- stock has written another historical story for the young , '' A Boy of a Thousand Years Ago '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is an authentic account of the youthful
Alfred	PERSON	, not yet styled '' the great . ''

		The spirited illustrations are by Mr.
George Varian	PERSON	.

		-- Another good historical tale is '' The Story of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , Told by Aunt Kate '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which some small children are made to listen to a word-of-mouth narrative from an older kinswoman .

		Mrs.
Kate E. Carpenter	PERSON	is the author .

		Miss
Amy Brooks	PERSON	has drawn the frontispiece , a number of paintings depicting
Joan	PERSON	's career have been reproduced , and there is an accompanying map of the
France	LOCATION	at that time Mr.
John Bennett	PERSON	's skill is suf - ficient to make bis account of a young English boy 's experiences on the island of
Manhattan	LOCATION	in the days of

		It is called ''

		-- `` Under Colonial Colors '' -LRB-

John Preston True	PERSON	continues his account of the daring deeds of Major Stnart Scbuvler during the Revolutionarr period , with '' On Guard !

		Against Tory and
Tarleton	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the pictures by Mrs.
Lilian Crawford Traa	PERSON	.

		It is an entertaining account of the campaign that ended with the surrender of Cornwallis It only needs to have the name of
Betty Zane	PERSON	recognized in • '' Brave Heart
Elizabeth	PERSON	, a Story of the
Ohio Frontier	ORGANIZATION	'' • -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , to insure Miss
Adele E. Thompson	PERSON	's work a respectful hearing .

		The pictures are by Mrs.
Lilian Crawford True	PERSON	, and the book is wholly worthy .

		-- The Rev.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	's story of '' In the Wasp 's Xest '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- begins with the brief naval • war with
France	LOCATION	and carries it down to the close of the : seeond war of independence .

		The human interest is given , apart from war , by the career of a waif who - comes to full courage and manhood under the stress of his experiences .

		The pictures , as good as possible of their kind , are by Mr.
Rnfus F. Zogbaum	PERSON	Of a more inclusive sort , giving brief biog ^ phieg of the great naval heroes of
Holland	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	, and ending with our own Farragut , is Mrs.
Jessie Peabody Frothingham	PERSON	's '' Sea Fights and Fighters '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , an interesting and sufficiently inclusive work illustrating the impor - tance of sea-power .

		--
John Paul Jones	PERSON	is not a charac - ter in Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	's '' With the Flag in the Chan - nel '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , contrary to expectation , but Captain
Gustavus Conyngham	PERSON	, a good and successful Revolution - ary fighter , of whom most Americans are unaware .

		The story is both a true and a good one , with pictures of merit by Mr.
Carlton T. Chapman	PERSON	The war of
1812	DATE	in an unusual phase affords a background for Mrs.
Lucy Meacham Thruston	PERSON	's ``
Jack	PERSON	and his Island '' -LRB- Lit - tle ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the refusal to listen to words advo - cating peace at the be ^ nning of the hostilities leading to the wrecking of a newspaper office .


Maryland	LOCATION	is the scene of the book , and the engagement that gave birth to '' The Star-Spangled Banner '' forms a part of the narrative '' The Errand Boy of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, a War Story of 1812 '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the work of Mr.
W. O. Stoddard	PERSON	.

		The young hero is one of the
Tennesse	LOCATION	- Ans upon whom
Jackson	PERSON	depended so entirely , and the • eeonnt of his services as an aide and at the glorious ■ victory of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, after some previous dealings with
Lafitte	PERSON	and his privateersmen , makes entertaining reading ''
Margarita	PERSON	, a Legend of the Fight for the Great River '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the fourth vol - ume in the '' Dames and Daughters of Colonial Days '' series by Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney	PERSON	, and is based on the struggle for the
Mississippi	LOCATION	between
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	.

		It is a period of which little has been written , and is the more welcome on that account The fact that the war between the States was indeed a civil war gives the tone to Mrs.
Mary Tracy Earle	PERSON	's '' The Flag on the Hill-Top '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , being an account of the Knights of the
Golden Circle	ORGANIZATION	in southern
Illinois	LOCATION	and of the zeal displayed for
the Union	ORGANIZATION	by loyal citizens .

		Simply and clearly told , it is to be commended above most books of the sort Mr.
George Cary Eggleston	PERSON	has his boys on the other side of the great war , in '' The Bale Marked ' Circle X ' '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , wherein several young Confederates run the blockade with a bale of cotton in which valuable documents are concealed .

		It is sensational and exciting .

		-- Captain
F. S. Brereton	PERSON	, .

		R.A.M.C. , tells a story of the Spanish - American war Mittbf amif * rtltewk .

		in '' Under the Spangled Banner '' -LRB- imported by
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- .

		An English boy plays a prominent part in the narrative , which is written primarily for British con - sumption .

		-- The Rev.
H. H. Clark	PERSON	, a chaplain in the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	, has written '' The Admiral 's Aid , a Story of Life in the
New Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- .

		Here , for once , there is nothing more than the rumor of war , with a love-story thrown in .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	has quite an elaborate defence of the new navy , when setting it down once for all as more or less of a necessary evil would have covered the entire ground So many accidents oeenr and so many lives are saved in Mr.
Enrique H. Lewis	PERSON	's ''
Phil and Dick	PERSON	, the Adventures of Two Ap - prentices in the
American Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Sa & lfield -RRB- that it gets to be almost humorous .

		Mr.
George Alfred Henty	PERSON	, wboae re - cent passing away has left a gap in the ranks of writers for the young not to be filled , has departed from his usual manner in `` The Treasure of the Incas , '' where it is not so much fighting as looting that occupies the attention of his youthful band of Englishmen .

		This is the first of this year 's three books from this onoe so busy pen , and has the usual good pictures by Mr.
Walter Paget	PERSON	.

		The seeond is ■ ■ With
Kitchener	LOCATION	in the Sondan , '' with the battles of Atbara and Omdnrman duly celebrated ; and the third is `` With the British Legion , a Story of the Carlist Uprising in
1836	DATE	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		There is no need to particularize further in the case of this much regretted author .

		The books are long , and of uniform interest , with a slight preference for the Peruvian story .

		-- Of the same sort , only shorter , is Mr.
John Finnemore	PERSON	's '' The Story of a Scout '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , forcing comparison with Lever bj being placed in the activities of the Peninsular War .

		-- An old friend , the African gorilla , comes back with Mr.
Paul Du Chaillu	PERSON	's `` King Mombo '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , an ac - count of the wanderings of an American boy in the wild * inhabited only by these man-like apes and a number of ape-like men .

		-- '' The Secret of the
Everglades	LOCATION	'' -LRB- im - ported by Scribner -RRB- is another American story by an English author .

		Miss
Bessie Marchant	PERSON	.

		Two persons are lost , father and daughter , and there is a mystery - unsolved until the concluding chapter .

		-- A book of con - spicuous merit is Mr.
Charles Frederick Holder	PERSON	's '' The Adventures of Torqua '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the soo - eess being largely due to the anthor 's thorough familiarity with his subject .

		Three boys take unwilling refuge on the island of
Santa Catalina	LOCATION	, or Pimug-na , off the coast of
California	LOCATION	, during the later days of the eighteenth century , when the native tribes were still flourishing .

		The boys were brave and enterprising , and their adven - tures are quite by themselves in nature and extent .

		-- Mr.
Robert Lloyd	PERSON	begins his story of '' The Treasure of Shag Rock '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with school athletics , then trans - fers the interest to a supposed fortune concealed on one of the
South Sea	LOCATION	islands .

		A pirate sets out after the expedition , and there is war on the high seas .

		-- '' The Last Cruise of the Electra '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- would not have been written by Mr.
Charles P. Chipman	PERSON	, probably , with - out the precedent of the late
Jules Verne	PERSON	's '' Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea , '' of which it is rem - iniscent .

		-- Quite another sort of voyage is that described by Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	in '' The Cruise of the Dazzler '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , where an end is put to ocean depreda - tions near
San Francisco	LOCATION	by well directed effort .

		The pictures are by Mr.
M. J. Burns	PERSON	, and the book one of unquestioned interest .

		-- The last days of the slave-trade are touched upon by Mr.
William Perry Brown	PERSON	in 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, For girls and about them . ''


Ralph Granger	PERSON	's Fortune '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a sensa - tional but not a convincing book .

		-- Search for a sap - phire mine , in which an Indian of mysterious origin takes part , is described by Mr.
Edward E. Billings	PERSON	in '' A Red Man of Quality '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		-- Shooting birds of all sizes is the province Mr.
William Alexander Linn	PERSON	makes his own in `` Rob and his Gun '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- .

		A great deal of valuable information , and descriptions of some excellent sport , combine to give his pages interest and value `` Cruising on the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	; or , A Sum - mer 's Vacation in Historic Waters '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is another book by Mr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	, in which the boys of the earlier volumes of the '' St. Lawrence '' series , now in their sophomore year at college , learn a great deal of history , and even more about the Indians , during a pleasant
summer	DATE	's vacation ''
Jeb Hutton	PERSON	'' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- is by Mr.
James B. Connolly	PERSON	, and utilizes the dredging and other similar work of the
United States Engineer Corps	ORGANIZATION	for a theme .

		Jeb is a good-natured giant of a Southern country boy , and his experiences have a certain educational significance for his readers as well as for himself .

		-- Mr.
Homer Greene	PERSON	's ''
Pickett	PERSON	's Gap '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a story of modern commercial methods , two railways fighting for an outlet through the mountain pass owned by the hero 's father .

		It is astonishing to find how much excitement can lie within so simple a story .

		Boys have long had a monopoly of books relating to carpentry and other similar work , but '' What a Girl Can Make and Do '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- , by
Miss Lina Beard	ORGANIZATION	and Miss
Adelia B. Beard	PERSON	, daughters of a well-known artist , is likely to question their supremacy .

		There are two parts of the book , '' What a Girl Can Make '' and '' What a Girl Can Do , '' and both are suggestive and instructive , and exactly the thing to keep young people out of idleness on days blue or gray .

		-- Several books in our present group seem intended for growing girls , from the period of long skirts to that of matrimony .

		One of these is `` The Wyndham Girls '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Marion Ames Taggart	PERSON	.

		In this story , a family is brought from affluence to an income of a few hundreds a year , a reverse which proves to be a real though disguised blessing , the girls all finding good husbands , and one of the young men getting back a slice of their former for - tune for them .

		-- That a woman can keep a secret , and even find it profitable to her in the end , is demonstrated in ''
Polly	PERSON	's Secret , a Story of the Kennebec '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which Mrs.
Harriet A. Nash	PERSON	has drawn a pleasant picture of a
New England	LOCATION	family , following her heroine from girlhood into married life .

		-- The striking title of ''
Madge	PERSON	, a Girl in
Earnest	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is borne out by the spirited tale which
Miss S. Jennie Smith	ORGANIZATION	has made of a self-respecting and indomitable young person , who teaches some of her kinsfolk a lesson or two worth learning The stern need for self-restraint is the lesson taught to a rather wilful young girl , in `` A Dornfleld Summer '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Mary M. Haley	PERSON	.

		All the girls in the book are worth knowing , and the one who makes the most mistakes is not the least lovable .

		-- What country life can do toward making a good woman out of a wretched little city girl is shown by Miss
Helen M. Winslow	PERSON	, in the cheerful story entitled '' Concerning Polly and Some Others '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There is a bubbling up of Yankee humor all through the book , which has been well illustrated by Mr.
Charles Cope	PERSON	- land Beauty , so long regarded by our Puritan ances - tors as a wile and lure of the enemy , makes trouble for the pretty
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	girl whose one striking experience is told in ''
Lois Mallet	PERSON	's Dangerous Gift '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Miss
Mary Catherine Lee	PERSON	places her beautiful heroine in
New Bedford	LOCATION	, and Mr.
W. L. Taylor	PERSON	has painted her portrait for the frontispiece , a picture which for once does not belie the author 's description .

		-- ''
Emmy Lou	PERSON	, her Book and Heart '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a delightful accouut of a little girl who begins in the lowest grade of the primary school , and wins her way , with mingled tears and smiles , into the high school and the first stirrings of attraction for boys and dancing .

		It is the work of ''
George Madden Martin	PERSON	, '' who has made way into some of the inmost recesses of the feminine mind in early girlhood and youth .

		--
Agnes Grant	PERSON	has even more trouble coming into her life in the book named for her , ``
Agnes Grant	PERSON	's Education '' -LRB-
Jennings & Pye	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss Hope Daring .

		There is a strong religious element of the evangelical sort , and salvation comes slowly but surely .

		Few stories of school and college appear ^ ' ■ rf ' '' , , * ' * ° ° ' this season , and again the best of those ' ■ for boys is by Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	, whose three previous stories have been duly praised in these columns .

		Those were all concerned with a fitting school ; the last , '' Behind the Line , a Story of College Life and Football '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , deals with two boys from the same school , but chiefly after they have en - tered one of the smaller colleges .

		Granted an interest in football , Mr.
Barbour	PERSON	's story is fascinating , and Mr.
C. M. Relyea	PERSON	's drawings add to its interest .

		It is em - phatically a book for boys : there is no woman men - tioned in it from beginning to end .

		-- The English school finds a historian in Mr.
Robert Leighton	PERSON	, and he has introduced the son of an American multimillionaire into '' The Boys of Waveney '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- as the god from the machine who straightens up all the entangle - ments .

		The author has the usual trouble in reconciling the American dialect , as spoken by this youth , with anything ever heard on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	; but the book is thrilling to the point of melodrama It would be difficult to tell why almost all stories of boys in college are for the perusal of adults , while the stories of their sisters are written to appeal to young girls ; but this seems to be the fact . ''

		Brenda 's Cousin at Rad - cliffe '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is another volume in Miss
Helen Leah Reed	PERSON	's successful series , and it makes a very pretty picture of student life .

		Here , as in similar stories , the stress is laid first upon studies , then on so - cial life , and finally on recreation ; in the boys ' books this order is reversed .

		But it hardly seems needful at this time to enter upon a defense of the higher edu - cation for women , as Miss
Reed	ORGANIZATION	does , nor to devote several pages to proving that girl students are not un - womanly .

		-- Radclifte appears again in Miss
Mary G. Darling	PERSON	's '' A Girl of this Century '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It reaches beyond the brilliant college career of the heroine , however , takes her into society , and then , upon the loss of the family fortune , enables her to put her knowledge to the best advantage .

		-- There is a girl , the daughter of wealthy and indulgent parents , who does not wish to continue her schooling , and she is permitted to send a young French girl , the daughter of a painter , to school in her stead .

		It is the delineation of the dif - ferences between the American girl and this alluring little foreigner , who has been in a convent school in her own country , that lends both name and interest to Mrs.
Myra Sawyer Hamlin	PERSON	's `` Catharine 's Proxy '' -LRB- Little ,
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 40T B --
tt/tr Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- An excellent opportunity is given for contrasting quite another sort of education , bv Mrs.
L. T. Meade	PERSON	's story of '' The Rebel of the School '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- .

		The real heroine of the book is a poor girl whose beauty and talent win her a leading place in the affections of both her teachers and her fellow-pupils in a great English school for girls ; while the rebel is a wild Irish girl who undertakes to run things with a total disregard for rules and precedents .

		The closing chapters are really exciting , and the book is one to be read with interest .

		For boys not yet half-way in their ` teens , though out of childhood , a number of interesting stories hare been devised , rather more interesting , upon the whole , than those in - tended for their elder brothers .

		Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	's Ule of `` The Flight of Pony Baker '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is an admirable bit of composition , shoFring that one author , at least , has kept bis own boyhood in vivid and grateful remembrance .

		The days are those before the war ; the scene is in a little
Ohio	LOCATION	river town ; and the characters are real boys and real girls .

		Pony
Baker	PERSON	decides upon flight from his home , and the most admirable humor is shown in narrating his various attempts at absconding , not one of which becomes known to his unsuspecting parents until the book 's close ; and even this attempt is not carried very far .

		-- Another
Ohio	LOCATION	boyhood , farther to the south than Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's and almost a generation later in point of time , is delineated bv Mr.
William Henry Venable	PERSON	in `` Tom Tad '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	.

		`
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Questions of social status complicate the situations of the book somewhat , and there is a naturalist uncle who imparts useful information in palatable form .

		-- Miss Murfree -LRB-
Charles Egbert Craddock	PERSON	-RRB- takes up a new field in '' The Champion '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a story of a half - grown boy , the `` devil '' in a newspaper office who ac - cidentally hears of a plot to commit crime , sees the crime actually committed , and , with all the readiness in the world to tell of it , is so intimidated that it is only when an innocent man is placed in jeopardy that he takes eonrage to reveal what he knows .

		The interest of the book is in the study of character , and it can be read with pleasure by any boy 's parents as well as by any boy .

		-- The points of difference between an athletic lad and one given more exclusively to study are admir - ably brought out by Miss
Evelyn Sharp	PERSON	in her story of • ' ITie Other Boy '' -LRB-
Macmillan j	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is '' an odd sheep '' in every particular that comes into the family of an English painter , bnt he has moral courage where the others had known only '' pluck , '' and a healthful re - action follows .

		-- A bereaved family left with a sadly diminished income is enabled to keep itself in comfort through the clever devices of the half-grown children , who are unusually gifted , forms the theme of Miss
Kath	PERSON	- arine
Newbold Birdsall	PERSON	's '' Jacks of All Trades '' -LRB- Ap - pleton -RRB- ; and the book would have been better if she had depended a little more on the inherent interest of this alone .

		-- It is a bright and active youngster that lends his name to ''
Tom Winston	PERSON	, ' Wide Awake ' '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by ''
Martha James	PERSON	, '' this last an admitted pseudonym .

		The boy goes to school , is athletic , and is the sort of boy we like to know .

		-- `` A Struggle for a Fortune '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Charles Austin Fosdick	PERSON	-LRB- '' Harry Castlemon '' -RRB- , is not the story of a boy who earns his way to wealth by any endeavor on his part , beyond keeping the father and the brother with whom he lives from getting from him a great deal of money left him by an old man who was also an inmate of the BeokMfm gmui gergirU .

		household .

		The scene is laid in the South , and the story is somewhat sensational .

		-- The second volume of ''
Bob Knight	PERSON	's Diary '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is specifically called '' Camping Out , '' and , like its predecessor , has the boy 's own sketches .

		The story is by Mrs.
Char	PERSON	- lotte
Curtis Smith	PERSON	, and the pictures , by whomsoever made , are boyish in conception and execution .

		The book is of unquestionable interest to little folk , the more so on this last account .

		-- In ''
Larry Barlow	PERSON	's Ambition '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Arthur M. Winfield	PERSON	tells of a youth who gets a position on a metropolitan fire de - partment and effects the most exciting rescues of im - perilled people , including sometimes himself .

		-- The untoward tradition which attaches to the conduct of clergymen 's children , as well as to the footgear of the offspring of shoemakers , is disputed in the Rev.
W. W. Hooper	PERSON	's `` That Minister 's Boy '' -LRB-
Brooklyn Eagle Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a wholesome and hearty youth that is here de - picted , the tale being told by episodes Another pro- verb , that of the wise child , is worked out in Mr.
J. M. Merrill	PERSON	's '' His Mother 's Letter '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The youthful hero is here a long time coming to his own , and his experiences are lurid during the process .

		-- < *
Timothy	PERSON	and his Friends '' -LRB-
Saalfield	PERSON	-RRB- , the work of Mrs.
Mary E. Ireland	PERSON	, is the story of a boy 's search for a father , who does not torn op until the last chapter of the book .

		Three pretty little stories for girls of '' middle size '' are told by Miss
Nora Archibald Smith	PERSON	in '' Three Little Marys '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		One of the girls is English , one Scotch , and the most alluring one of all is Irish .

		It is rare that national characteristics are hit off so well in a field so limited .

		-- Just the sort of little girl that most men would like all little girls to be , comes from a
Kansas	LOCATION	home to visit her nncle , a
New Tork	LOCATION	stock-broker , and one of her cousins gives her the soubriquet which pro- vides the title for Mrs.
Marion Ames Taggart	PERSON	's ''
Miss Lochinvar	LOCATION	, a Story for Girls '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		Those who have long thought that
Kansas	ORGANIZATION	could impart valuable information to the devotees of Wall Street can find an unexpected verification of it here ''
Randy	PERSON	and her Friends '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the third of Miss
Amy Brooks	PERSON	's volumes with a single heroine .

		In this one , the little girl is befriended by an early acquaintance to the extent of a term in a private school in
Boston	LOCATION	, adding a new factor to the portraits of quaint rural folk who have already made themselves known to the reading public .

		-- In this last book .

		Miss
Brooks	PERSON	is both author and illustrator ; and so she is in '' Dorothy Dainty '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which a model little girl is con - trasted with some others not so well behaved , including a little waif of the streets .

		-- Grandparenthood has always been held to be the most enviable of relation - ships , because it carries all the delights of having chil - dren with few or none of the responsibilities .

		In `` Grandma 's Girls '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , this is only partly true , for the author .

		Miss
Helen Morris	PERSON	, has there brought two batches of girl cousins together on a seaside farm while their respective parents are in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The girls have a good time , and their grand - mamma proves herself among the wisest of women .

		-- '' The Yellow Violin '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a confused story of an old-fashioned sort , by
Miss Mary A. Denison	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are both rich and poor in the story , and the little girl who is the principal figure knows them all .

		-- The little blind daughter of a family dwelling in city apartments is '' The Little Girl Next Door '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, For youngtlert of both Kxei .

		Miss
Nina Rhoades	PERSON	's new book .

		She is made much of by the child of a wealthy family living as neighbors in the geographical sense , and is eventually discovered to be of the gentlest birth .

		-- Miss
Anna Cbapin Ray	PERSON	has brought into ``
Nathalie	PERSON	's Chum '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a number of the characters from '' Teddy , her Book , '' and has made a good story of the life led by a young man who is compelled to be both father and brother to four youngsters .

		-- Some of the difiiculties of bringing up a child who is unwilling to assist in the process are painted by Miss
Edna A. Foster	PERSON	in ''
Hortense	PERSON	, a Dif - ficult Child '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Hortense is a little girl placed under the care of a maiden aunt with a fixed theory about the rearing of children , and it is not the unexpected that happens .

		-- Those who know Mrs.
Martha Finley	PERSON	's '' Elsie '' books will welcome ''
Elsie	PERSON	's Winter Trip '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which the child goes to the
West Indies	LOCATION	on a private yacht and has a very good time indeed .

		-- '' The Little Woman in the Spout '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the name given by two or three little folk to a '' make-believe '' person in Miss
Mary Agnes Byrne	PERSON	's book , wherein a child mistreated comes into unexpected wealth .

		-- The same author gives us '' Roy and Rosyrocks '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with much the same ending , only two children are here brought to the arms of an unlooked-for uncle and aunt .

		A few books remain , designed for the smaller children of both sexes .

		Of these the '' Just So Stories '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	, both text and illus - trations from the same hand , is most likely to arrest attention ; and yet the book is somehow a disappoint - ment .

		The most desirable portions of the text are those describing the pictures , and these little descrip - tions are not such as appeal to the young .

		There is a roughness of workmanship about the book as a whole that detracts from the virtues of even the best of the stories , that of the cat .

		-- Mr.
R. W. Chambers	PERSON	appears in a new field in his '' Outdoorland '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , in which stories of nature are profusely and beautifully illus - trated for small children Bright and witty are the experiences embodied by Miss
Gertrude Smith	PERSON	in '' The Lovable Tales of Janey and
Josey	PERSON	and Joe '' -LRB- Har - per -RRB- , with many illustrations by
Misses E. Mars	ORGANIZATION	and
M. H. Squire	PERSON	.

		The title is fully descriptive .

		-- A col - lection of animal stories from Indian folk-lore have been told by Mrs.
Therese O. Deming	PERSON	, with numerous pictures of more than ordinary value by Mr.
Edwin Willard Deming	PERSON	, under the title of '' Red Folk and Wild Folk '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The book has unusual merit in every respect .

		-- ''
Billy Whiskers	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of an illustrated history of a guileful goat , written by Mrs.
Frances Trego Montgomery	PERSON	.

		The book is broadly hu - morous , including the illustrations .

		-- The `` Chatterbox '' appears in the customary bound volume for
1902	DATE	-LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Nothing more likely to please the average child is put forth , and the new number does not fall behind in any respect .

		-- Close beside the foregoing is ''
Sunday	DATE	Read - ing for the Young ,
1903	DATE	'' -LRB-
E. & J. B. Young	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a mis - cellany for the very young .

		Fairy tales rightly continue to hold the attention of the young .

		One of the really charming books of the season is '' In the Green Forest '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , toth text and pictures by Miss
Katharine Pyle	PERSON	.

		Two fair - ies .

		Red Cap and Nightshade , set out to find the palace of the Sua Queen .

		Nightshade , as his name goes to show , makes trouble and to spare .

		The narrative is Taltt of the/airies .

		interesting , the pictures are admirable .

		-- In the man - ner of
Hans Andersen	PERSON	, the '' Fairy Tales from the Swedish '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- have been translated from the orig - inal of the
Baron Djurko	PERSON	by Mr.
H. L. Breekstad	PERSON	, with numerous illustrations from Swedish artists of emi - nence .

		The stories are uniformly simple and sweet , arresting the attention of any reader .

		-- One of the most beautiful child 's books of the season is Mrs. Cor - nelia
Baker	PERSON	's '' Coquo and the King 's Children '' -LRB- McCIurg -RRB- , with six illustrations in color by Mrs.
Lucy Fitch Perkins	PERSON	.

		Coquo is the court jester and the leader of the little prince and princess in their esca - pades .

		All manner of fairies meet them on their ram - bles , but nothing quenches
Coquo	ORGANIZATION	's unfortunate habit of punning .

		-- Another beautiful volume is ''
Kallisto	PERSON	and Other Tales of the Fairies '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
William Dana Orcutt	PERSON	, with numerous decora - tions and pictures in color by Miss
Harriette Amsden	PERSON	.

		Good use is here made of both northern and classical mythology in constructing a story of considerable merit .

		-- Seven fairy tales by Mrs.
Edith Odgen	PERSON	Har - rison are given the title of '' Prince Silverwings '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Toid originally to the author 's children , , these little narratives have a spontaneity and freshness - that commend them at once .

		The book is handsomely decorated in color by Mrs.
Lucy	PERSON	-
Fitch Perkins	PERSON	.

		-- There is a reversal of the process just mentioned in the book called '' In Happy Far-Away Land '' -LRB-
Zimmer	PERSON	- man -RRB- , where the stories were told by Mrs.
France * Palmer Kimball	PERSON	to her daughter , Mrs.
Ruth Kimball Gardner	PERSON	, and have been set down in riper years from the vivid memories of childhood .

		It is a pious labor and one tenderly performed .

		The illustrations are by Mr.
Howard Smith	PERSON	Abandoning historical novels for a time .

		Miss
Mary Imlay Taylor	PERSON	has written '' Little Mistress Good Hope and Other Fairy Tales '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- with her accustomed sprightliness and interest .

		The inspiration here is from English provincial folk-lore , and the colored plates by Miss
Jessie Willcox Smith	PERSON	add to the reader 's understanding of the stories .

		-- A wonder-tale of swinging away from this old earth and visiting the other planets has been told by Mr.
P. L. Gray	PERSON	in a prettily bound book styled '' In a Car of Gold '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		-- Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	has writteo two books of fairy stories or their modern equivalents .

		The former of these , '' Folly in the Forest '' -LRB-
Altemus	PERSON	-RRB- , is in a manner a sequel to the author 's '' Folly in Fairy - land '' of last year , but here the little heroine is made to meet all the mythological and historical beasts and either sing to them or listen to their singing .

		The songs are very funny , and so are those in Miss Wells 's second book , `` The
Pete	PERSON	and Polly Stories : A Book of Nonsense Prose and Verse '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Miss
Fanny Young Cory	ORGANIZATION	has drawn some delicious pictures for these extraordinary adventures , which are wild enough to be interesting to any child , and to his parents as well .

		Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	has joined the little army of poets laureate to their royal highnesses the coming generation , following the good example of
Robert Louis Steven	PERSON	- son . ''

		The Book of Joyous Children '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- has been illustrated copiously with both full-page and text drawings by Mr.
J. W. Vawter	PERSON	, and is in every respect a handsome book .

		But it contains no children 's poems at all equal to some of the author 's earlier lines , '' Little Orpbaut Annie '' for example , full though the book is of pleasant songs and jingles .

		The most inter - Songs , jinglet , and pictures .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		409 eating feature in it -LRB- though at first blush it seems oat of place in such a volume -RRB- is the chapter devoted to imitations of several of the greater poets .

		-- Miss
Abbie Farwell Brown	PERSON	has come nearer to the spirit of
Steven	PERSON	- son in some of the numbers of '' A Pocketful of Posies '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and
Miss Fannj Young Cory	ORGANIZATION	has made most appropriate designs to accompany them .

		A pleasant and novel feature are the marginal annotations in red with every stanza , adding g ^ atly to the humorous effect .

		-- Mr.
William Wallace Whitelock	PERSON	is known as the writer of graceful and witty vers de lociete in '' Life '' and similar publications .

		To those familiar with these clever trifles , `` When the Heart is Young '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- will be a disappointment .

		It is conventional , little witty , and not in the least poetical .

		Mr.
Harper	PERSON	Pen - nington 's drawings are better .

		-- In welcoming a new edition of Mr.
Peter Xewell	PERSON	's '' Topsys and Turvys '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in a volume made up by taking from its two predecessors the best things they contained , it is worth while calling attention to the exceedingly witty lines that accompany the drawings in color , those won - derful drawings that make a picture seem one thing when looked at one way and quite another when re - versed .

		One does not always think of Mr.
Newell	PERSON	as a writer of verses , but be certainly knows how to combine effectively his two distinct varieties of cleverness `` Six and Twenty Boys and Girls '' -LRB- imported by
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- is reminiscent of the immortal '' Slovenly Peter '' and of Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	's '' Alphabet of Famous Goops , '' but Mr.
Clifton Bingham	PERSON	's verses and Mr.
John Hassall	PERSON	's colored drawings have merits of their own .

		As the title indicates , there is a boy or girl for each of the twenty-six letters , and some of these child - ren are very good indeed , and some are bad enough to be horrid .

		-- `` Animal Life '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has many of its illustrations taken from older plates , while the rhymes of Miss Elizabeth
May	DATE	are more rhymes than anything else , dealing with a number of our animal friends .

		-- Animals again lend interest to '' Game * and Gambols '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , the verses by Mr.
John Brymer	PERSON	and the colored drawings by Mr.
Harry B. Neilson	PERSON	.

		The books by these collaborators are already familiar , the attraction in them coming from the placing of birds and beasts in human situations more or less comical .

		-- '' The Bogey Book '' -LRB- Young -RRB- is a novelty in size , which is that of a large thin folio , the rhymes by '' E. S. '' and the pictures by ''
R. J. S.	PERSON	'' Both would be appalling if they were not so wholly grotesque Really interesting , and an unexpected proof of the versatility of Mrs.
Laura #	PERSON	.


Richards	PERSON	, is `` The Hurdy Gurdy '' -LRB- Elstes -RRB- , with its surprising dedi - cation '' To
Adams Sherman Hill	PERSON	,
Arthur Dehon Hill	PERSON	,
Adams Sherman Hill	PERSON	, Three Generations of Agreeable Boys . ''

		The illustrations are by Mr.
J. J. Mora	PERSON	.

		The book is worth while The year would not be quite complete without something from the Misses
Upton	PERSON	with a topic entirely up to date .

		So '' The Golliwogg 's Air Ship '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , the jingles by Miss Bertha Up - ton and the colored plates by
Miss Florence R. Upton	PERSON	, is to be welcomed as fully equal to the former volumes of a veracious history , as amusing as possible to thoM for whom it is intended In a class quite by itself for novelty and potential entertainment is Mr.
J. M. Bar	PERSON	- nett 's `` Mother Goose Paint Book '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the text from an approved edition of that classic , the pic - tures in outline , and five cakes of paint of different colors and a camel 's hair pencil on the inner side of the back cover , readv for use .

		XOTES ,

Harper	PERSON	's
Cook Book Encyclopedia	ORGANIZATION	, '' compiled un - der the direction of the editor of ''

		The Government of
Maine	LOCATION	: Its History and Admin - istration , '' by Dr.
William MacDonald	PERSON	, is a volume in the '' Handbooks of American Government '' published by the

New York	LOCATION	and
Minnesota	LOCATION	are now on the market , and
Ohio	LOCATION	and Mich - igan are in active preparation .

		410 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Mr.
S. E. Riser	PERSON	's '' Love Sonnets of an Office Boy '' were too good to remain entombed in the daily news - paper for which they were written , and we are glad that they have been made into a little book , with illus - trations by Mr.

		Messrs.
Forbes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

ILLINOIS	LOCATION	OURS is the largest establishment in this country devoted exclusively to books and stationery .

		Above all it is the ideal place for holiday book buying , as the stock is so complete that patrons can be practi - cally assured of finding any publication desired without inconvenient delay .

		From now on every facility of our retail department -- every convenience and assistance that we can offer -- is at the entire disposal of customers who are engaged in the perplexing selection of books for holiday presen - tation .

		Patrons from out of town will appreciate the comfortable reading-room where catalogues may be consulted , books examined , letters written , or appoint - ments kept as desired .

		In regard to the desirability of books as Christmas gifts , nothing else is likely to give the same amount of pleasure at a relative cost .

		And it may be added that never before has the array of holiday books been so beautiful , so varied , and so altogether attractive from every standpoint .

		This is particularly true of the books for young people , which seem to have been the subject of special effort on the part of the publishers this season .

		NOTES 479 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 480 MUSIC AND CULTURE .

		Those writers who engage in the discussion of the delicate sabject of caltare seem to take it for granted that the printed page is what chiefly concerns their theme .

		It is undoubt - edly true that among the agencies of culture literature occupies the foremost place , and that it is mainly by means of books that we come to know the best that has been thought and done in the world .

		But there are other agencies as well , and they must not be left out of the reckoning .

		There are , for example , such things as travel through lands associated with past human achievements , participation in commem - orative exercises and civic festivals , and per - sonal intercourse with the high-minded men who keep the torch of idealism alight from generation to generation .

		There are also the fine arts other than literature ; for it is a very one-sided and contracted culture that ignores the immense contribution made by sculpture and painting , by architecture and music , to the treasure-house of man 's creation .

		With all that may be urged in behalf of the other forms of what is called fine art , it seems to us that music must , on the whole , be given the place next in importance to that occupied by literature among the agencies of culture .

		Even graphic art , with all its manifestations in color and line , with all its modes of multi - plication for the service of the many , seems to 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, us less important than music as the expression of the human spirit , and less potent as a source of that `` joy in widest commonalty spread '' which art alone is capable of diffusing .

		But coupled with this belief of ours in the power of music for the purposes of culture there has always been the feeling that its possibilities were very dimly realized and its mission very imperfectly fulfilled .

		This is not so much because of any failure of music to secure its requisite share of our attention as because of the thoughtless if not wilfully perverse attitude toward the art which is too often assumed by those who should know better .

		There is clearly no reason for saying that music is neglected in our modern life .

		When we consider the part that it plays in religious exercises and public gatherings of every sort , its serviceable function in the school and the family , we may not fairly bring that charge against it .

		Does not the humblest home boast its piano or cabinet organ , and do not the daughters of the household take what they call `` vocal '' or `` instrumental '' in `` studio '' and '' conservatory , '' and afterwards make ruthless exhibition of their accomplishments ?

		And yet -- the question is of the gravest import -- one can not help asking if all this activity , all the expenditure of money and energy which this involves , really makes for culture .

		For entertainment is one thing , and social accom - plishment is another thing , and culture is a third Ihing , quite different from either .

		From considerable observation and inquiry it seems to us that the two former aims obscure the latter to an extent that should be the cause of much concern .

		To cultivate music primarily for the amusement of one 's friends or for the enhancement of one 's social value is to deal unworthily with a noble art and to miss a means of self-development which has few equals and perhaps no superior when viewed in its relation to the totality of the individual -- intellect , emotion , and character .

		What should we think of literature if it were studied in the spirit with which most young people -- not of their own motion , but because they are so taught -- approach the study of music ?

		Imagine the study of literature so narrowed that it should mean nothing more than the mechanical art of reading aloud , and of constant practice in reading selected trivial - ities to one 's friends .

		Think of setting before young people such an ideal of literature as that , an ideal which would deal with literature as if it were a collection of '' pieces to speak '' and not the refined expression of the human spirit in all ages .

		To advance this supposition is to make manifest it absurdity , yet something not unlike this is what we commonly do in the case of music .

		Here also is an expression of the human spirit perhaps as rich and varied and potent for the uplifting of the soul as the other , and we allow ourselves to fall into the habit of regarding music as a collection of '' pieces to play '' or to sing .

		The young student of piano-playing spends weary years in acquiring facility of execution , and never dreams that this technique is not an end in itself , but sim - ply the means to an end -- that learning to read is only a preliminary necessity , and does not touch upon the purpose of a rational pur - suit of the culture obtainable through music .

		For this exaltation of accident at the ex - pense of substance there is a complex of causes not easily analyzed .

		The case may be cleared up in part by specifying a few such things as the personal vanity of most students , the com - mercialism which actuates many teachers and institutions for the training of musicians , and the general apathy of the public toward the serious aspects of musical art .

		The whole environment of the average young person en - gaged in the study of music is such as to endow him with false ideals and to obscure the nobler aims of the art to which he is giving his best energies .

		He is taught to perform compositions merely for the sake of playing them , and with - out being helped to understand either their spiritual message or their place in the history of music .

		He is forced to play a few things with wearisome iteration instead of being en - couraged to play many things without greatly caring whether or not they are well played .

		In fact , if he shows signs of the habit of browsing in the musical library , he is severely discour - aged , although browsing in music , as in litera - ture , is one of the most helpful of practices , and can do what no amount of formal teaching can do for the growing mind .

		At home and among his friends , he is placed on exhibition upon every possible occasion , and at every stage of his progress , thus strengthening him in the misconception that his study is not being pur - sued at all as a means of culture , but as a means of supplying diversion for the social circle .

		This point of view , although absolutely destruc - tive of the culture-mission of music , is adopted only too readily by the average young person in the average non-musical environment , and the final stage of degradation is reached when he deliberately adapts himself to the taste , or the
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45T tastelessness , of his audience , and , instead of giving the best that is in his power , gropes upon the lower level of the imagined likings of his hearers .

		Those who are thus false to the light that is in them are to be found among musicians of all ranks , and their number includes finished artists as well as immature students of the art .

		The prostitution of music to this ignoble ministry is very common , and is one of the most discouraging features of the general situation .

		It has always seemed to us that the publishers of music might do much more than they have done to encourage the student to study music as he would study literature .

		Nothing is more common than to discover that the performer of some famous composition has no intelligent notion of where it stands among the composer 's works or of its relation to the historical devel - opment of the art .

		One may be a brilliant player of the sonatas of Beethoven and , except for the mnemonic jog of the opus numbers , have but a dim notion of where a given sonata belongs in the development of the master .

		One may bring much musical training to the con - cert hall , and listen to the symphony or the oratorio without in the least understanding whether the work in question was written early or late in the composer 's career , or what it represents in the history of music .

		Among opera-goers , whether they are musicians or not , the same confusion exists , although opera is the branch of musical composition whose develop - ment is the easiest to understand .

		Not to know , for example , that
Weber	PERSON	came before
Wagner	PERSON	-- that he must have come before
Wagner	PERSON	-- is like being ignorant of the fact that
Lessing	PERSON	was a predecessor of Goethe .

		Not to realize the artistic abyss that lies be - tween the second and fifth symphonies of Bee - thoven or between
Verdi	ORGANIZATION	's '' Rigoletto '' and '' Otello '' is like failing to realize the like dis - tinction between '' Comus '' and '' Paradise Lost '' or between
Romeo	PERSON	and Hamlet as heroes of tragedy .

		In the literary cases here adduced we should call it blank and inexcusable ignor - ance of elementary matters ; but in the mus - ical cases it would not be difficult to find musicians with long years of training who would regard such mistiness of view as a thing of trifling importance .

		Even with the musician who makes a specialty of the interpretation of some one composer , it will not infrequently be found that he is without a systematic view of that composer 's artistic development : that he can not tell which compositions follow which others , and why , or which belong in the same group , and why ; that his acquaintance with his own chosen master is on a par with the knowl - edge of the Shakespearian reciter or elocu - tionist , and not with the knowledge of the tme Shakespearian student .

		We have said that the publishers of music might extend their usefulness in this matter of musical education with a view to culture rather than to performance , and the impulse which led ns to the foregoing discussion was , in fact , provided by a publishing enterprise that has recently been inaugurated by the Oli - ver
Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the preparation of their '' Musicians ' Library , '' of which the initial vol - umes have just appeared , these publishers have nndertaken '' to include all the masterpieces of song and piano music ; to gather into beanti - fully made volumes of uniform size and bind - ing the best work of the best composers , edited by living men of authority . ''

		Here at last we are to have an extensive series of books of music to which are applied the methods with which we are familiar in books of literature ; we are to have musical works accompanied by portraits , biographies , and critical discussions , their selections dated and chronologically ar - ranged , their contents accurately reproduced from standard texts , and provided , in the case of the volumes of song , with the exact words of the original and with English translations of literary quality .

		The two volumes now at hand are '' Fifty Master Songs , '' edited by Mr.
Henry T. Finck	PERSON	, and '' Forty Piano Com - positions of
Frederic Chopin	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
James Hnneker	PERSON	.

		Some two score additional volumes are in course of preparation , among which we note , as particularly attractive , four volumes of '' Songs from the Operas , '' edited by Mr.
Frank Damrosch	PERSON	; four volumes of '' The Lyrics of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Carl Armbruster	PERSON	, besides the song and piano albums devoted to single composers , and edited by such men as Messrs.
H. E. Krehbiel	PERSON	,
Philip Hale	PERSON	,
W. F. Apthorp	PERSON	, and
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	.

		This enterprise is so en - tirely in the right direction and so clearly embodies the right principles of music publi - cation that we extend to it a most cordial wel - come , and believe that it will become an effi - cient agency in promoting musical culture in the sense in which that term has been used in the above discussion .

		Here are books of music that are not made for the performer alone , but are as nearlv as possible like other books , and may claim the same place in the library .

France	LOCATION	.

		* A lively account of French society and the French court in
the first half of the seventeenth century	DATE	is furnished by
M. Arvede Barine	PERSON	's '' La Grande Mademoiselle . ''

		As explained by the dates on the title-page , and also by the running title in the body of the book , it is only the youth of Mademoiselle that we have to do with in this volume .

		The author takes leave of her forty-one years before her death , but his closing words give promise of a sec - ond volume at no distant date .

		In another respect , too , the main title of the book might be criticized as deceptive : our heroine 's affairs occupy but a small part of the 436 pages the work contains , her life serving rather as a handy string to fasten together a miscellaneous mass of material illustrating the manners and customs of her age .

		The writer so crowds his stage with other characters , -- Richelieu ,
Maz	PERSON	- arin ,
Marie de Medicis	PERSON	,
Anne	PERSON	of
Austria	LOCATION	, Cond ^ ,
Turenne	LOCATION	, kings , princes , and a host of lords and ladies , -- as greatly to obscure his intended star .

		Mademoiselle 's own memoirs , of course , afford the historian an important , though often untrustworthy , source of informa - tion .

		He supplements them with many con - temporary letters and memoirs , sometimes giving his authorities in a footnote , but oftener leaving them to the reader 's conjecture .

		Nor is there any bibliography provided , although a reasonably full index -- which it is not improb - able that we owe wholly to the translator -- is found at the end .

		These allowances being made , the book has much to commend it .

		The age in which
Mademoiselle de Montpensier	ORGANIZATION	lived is regarded by the author as one of transition .

		The ''
Chris	PERSON	- tian pessimism of
Racine	LOCATION	, '' succeeding the ♦ ' stoical optimism of Corneille , '' he looks upon as exemplifying a marked transformation wrought at this period in the moral atmos - phere of
France	LOCATION	.

		The five chapters of the book are five studies in as many phases of seventeenth-century life , -- education in the early part of the century ; public manners as influenced by the salon ; the theatre ; the state of religion ; the Fronde .

		topics , while around them are grouped count - less subsidiary matters .

		We note , in the first chapter , the little es - teem in which education was held by the nobility and gentry .

		People of quality regarded books and writing as the tools of plebeians , good enough for professional fine wits and lawyers ' clerks , but not fit for their betters .

		The education of women was , of course , a con - spicuously minus quantity .

		An illustrative extract from our heroine 's correspondence is almost incredible in its orthographic vagaries -- to use a contradiction in terms .

		The rude - ness of manners , too , even of court manners , passes belief .

		The corridors and stairways of the
Louvre	LOCATION	were put to uses that forbid de - scription .

		The semi-barbaric housekeeping practised by royalty fairly astounds one .

		When the king invited distinguished guests , he never furnished their rooms .

		He offered them four bare walls and bade them provide for their own comfort as best they could .

		Banquets , we read , '' were given in the corridor , in the aalle , in the ante-room , or in the sleeping-room , because literary intuition was undeveloped . ''

		-LRB- A rather curious non sequitur . ' -RRB-

		As illustrating the man - ners of the '' gentle , '' take the following : `` Once upon a time , at a dance , Comte de Br ^ gis , having received a slap from his partner , turned upon her and pulled her hair down in the midst of the banquet .

		At a supper , in the presence of a great and joyous company , the
Marquis de la Case	ORGANIZATION	snatched a leg of mutton from a trencher and buffeted his neighbor in her face , smearing her with gravy .

		As she was a lady of an even temper , she laughed heartily , and the inci - dent was closed .

		Malherbe confessed to
Madame de Rambouillet	ORGANIZATION	that he had ■ cuSed the ears of the Vis - countess d'Auchy until she had cried for aid . '

		As he was a jealous man , his action was not without cause , and in that day to flog a woman was a thing that any gentleman felt free to do . ''

		Great need , in truth , was there of the refin - ing influence of the Precieuses , and of the salon as instituted by
Madame de Rambouillet	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pranks of her guests began to assume a less brutal form than slugging and hair-pulling .

		The
Comte de Guiche	ORGANIZATION	, after a hearty supper of mushrooms , awoke the next morning to find his clothes much too small for him .

		Convinced that his indulgence had wrought his undoing , he thought his last hour was come .

		But his friends took pity on him in time to save his life by explaining that some merry rogue had caused all the mischief with needle and thread while the victim of the joke was asleep .

		The condition of the theatre and the state of the church are treated at some length , with interesting iUnstrative matter .

		The move - W02 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 459 ` ineDts of the Fronde , with special reference to
Mademoiselle	ORGANIZATION	's participation therein , claim the last hundred pages of the book .

		The rescue of Conde by opening the city gates to him when hard pressed by
Turenne	LOCATION	, after the battle of the
Faubourg St. Antoine	ORGANIZATION	, is ascribed wholly to our heroine , in accordance with the claims - made by her in her memoirs .

		With her flight from
Paris	LOCATION	, upon the downfall of the Fronde , this account of her youth , and of her persever - ing but unsuccessful quest for a royal husband , is brought to a close .

		It is rather a distant acquaintance with this energetic and self-assertive lady that the reader gains .

		Such portraiture as the author ven - tures upon is somewhat feeble in tint and hazy in outline .

		At one time
Mademoiselle	ORGANIZATION	appears ■ as a decidedly unlovely person with the bearing of a
Cossack	ORGANIZATION	, at another as a marvel of spright - liness and beauty .

		Perhaps this is true to life , ■ however , on the principle of the Virgilian adage concerning the mutability of woman .

		An amusingly frank bit of self-portrayal is worth quoting here from her own pen . ''

		I am t & ll ; I am neither fat nor lean ; I hare a graceful and freely moring figure , and mv bearing is natural and easr .

		Mj bust is well formed .

		My hands and feet are not beautiful , but there is great beauty in their flesh , and the flesh of my throat is very pretty .

		My leg is straight , and my foot is weU formed .

		My hair is beautiful ash-blonde .

		My face is long , and ite ^ WDtour is fine .

		The nose is large and aquiline .

		The mouth neither large nor little , but distinctly outlined and of a very agreeable form .

		The lips are the color of Termilion .

		My teeth are not handsome , but neither are they horrible .

		My eye5 are blue , neither large nor small , bat brilliant , gentle , and prond , like my mien .

		I have a haughty , but not self-glorified air ; I am polite and familiar , but of a manner to excite respect rather than to attract the lack of it .

		... I may say withont boasting that I become whatever I put on better than anything I put on becomes me ... Nothing breaks me down ; nothing fatigues me ; and it is di # Bcnlt to jodge of the events and the changes in my fortunes by my face , for my face rarely shows any change .

		I had forgotten to say that I have a healthy complexion , which is in accord with what I have just said .

		My tint is not delicate , but it is fair , and very bright and clear . ''

		The two portraits given in the book -LRB- from what originals we are not informed -RRB- tend rather to confirm than to refute this testimony .

		An item of some importance concerning the death of Marie de Medicis may be worth men - tioning .

		Contradicting the commonly accepted report of her death in a garret in
Cologne	LOCATION	, in the utmost poverty , the author contends , but still withont giving chapter and verse for it , that she died in a house formerly occupied by
Rubens	PERSON	, and that at least eighty servants sur - rounded her death bed .

		T ' ^ is latter he infers from the list of her legatees . ''

		To the day of her death , '' he adds , '' the aged Queen retained possession of silver dishes of all kinds , and had her situation justified the rumours of extreme poverty which have been circulated since then , she would have pawned them or sold them . ''

		The author 's diligence in getting together such a mass of material and making so reada - ble , and in some respects valuable , a book out of it , is worthy of praise .

		If its length seems somewhat fatiguing in the translation , that may be partly the reader 's fault in not having been bom a Frenchman .

		Now and then a racy bit of character-sketching enlivens the narrative .

		What could be more delicious than this picture of the jaunty and irresponsible
Gaston	PERSON	,
Duke of Orleans	LOCATION	, the father of our heroine ?

		`` His vivacity was extraordinary .

		The people mar - velled at his unfailing lack of tact .

		Though very young , be was well grown .

		He was no longer a child whose nurse caught him with one hand , forcibly buttoning his apron as he struggled to run away ; yet he skipped and gambolled , spinning incessantly on his high heels , his hand thrust into his pocket , his cap over one ear ... He carried out his cowardice with impudence , and his villainy was artful and adroit .

		However base his ac - tion , he was never troubled by remorse .

		He was insen - sible to love , and devoid of any sense of honour .

		Having betrayed his associates , he abandoned them to their fate , then thrust his hand into his pocket , piroutted , eat a caper , whistled a tune , and thought no more of it . ''

		After this , one is not surprised to read of his brother ,
Louis	LOCATION	XIII. : ' < He had studied but little ; he took no interest in the things that pleased the mind ; his pastimes were purely animal .

		He liked to hunt , to work in his garden , to net pouches for fish and game , to make snares and arquebuses .

		He liked to make preserves , to lard Meat , and to shave .

		Like his brother , he had one artistie quality : he loved music and composed it .

		` This waa the one smile , the only smile of a natural ingrate . ' ''

		The translator has done her part acceptably , but not with such happiness of effect as to make the reader oblivions of her intervention . ''

		A document dated posterior -LSB- i. e. posteriorly -RSB- to 1670 , '' is an example of '' elegant '' English that reminds the reviewer of an unlettered acquaintance who thought to convey an impres - sion of culture by speaking of the centre of the day , meaning noon . ''

		Repeated freqnentation of the Salon '' smacks somewhat of Chester - field . ''

		Inenarrable depravity '' is rather good , though obsolete . ''

		Years gorged with events '' calls up a picture of old Father Time as a glutton -- devouring the way before him . ''

		Re - criminative dualogues '' is self-explanatory .

		The numerous portraits and other illustrations add much to the attractiveness of the book .

		460 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, The Pleasures oe the Table .

		* Here is a noble '' Yule-gift , '' a book truly fit for the season ; a book beautiful to behold , and which fairly smells of Christmas , -- of burnt brandy and holly and bays ; a book which goes out into the world singing cheerfully and lustily : '' The Boar 's Head in hand bring I With garlands gay and
Rosemary	PERSON	.

		I pray you all sing merrily Qui estis in convivio . ''

		And in very truth the book bears a Boar 's Head upon its cover .

		It tells , too , of daintier fare , as these chapter-titles bear witness : Cookery among the Ancients -- With LucuIIas and Apicius -- The Renaissance of Cookery -- Old English Dishes -- L ` Almanach des Gourmands -- A German Speisekarte -- The School of Savarin -- From Careme to
Dumas	PERSON	-- The Cook 's Confrere -- American vs. En - glish Cookery -- At Table with the Clergy -- Sundry Guides to Good Cheer -- On Sauces -- The Spoils of the Cover -- Two Esculents Par Excellence Sallets and Salads -- Sweets to the Sweet .

		It needed good knowledge of cookery and literature even to frame such a list of chapter - headings ; and a ready wit and cunning hand to make them speak to us so temptingly '' be - tween the lines . ''

		The full title of Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	's book reads as follows : '' The Pleasures of the Table : An Account of Gastronomy from
Ancient Days to Present Times	ORGANIZATION	.

		With a History of Its Litera - ture , Schools , and Most Distinguished Artists ; together with Some Special Recipes and Views concerning the Esthetics of Dinners and Dinner-Giving . ''

		If every book-review could quote such a succinct and true epitome of the contents of a volume , as is this , and add such a list of vivid chapter-titles , we might secure in a few lines an exact knowledge of the book under consideration , and thus be spared the verbose platitudes of so many of our reviewers .

		This book , however , deserves more than a presentation of its attractive title-page and chapter-headings , for it is an unusual and al - together novel book .

		No previous work has thoroughly covered the important art in ques - tion , -- an art so closely connected not only with the pleasure but the welfare and hygiene of mankind .

		We have had innumerable treatises on prac - tical cookery and gastronomy .

		Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	gives a Bibliography of such , in which , it may * The Pleasures op the Table .

New York	LOCATION	: Doubleday , Page `` fcCo .

		be noted , works by women predominate in the English language , while in
France	LOCATION	men seem to have furnished the literature as they have developed the art of cooking .

		In the present book the history and aesthetics of the table pre - dominate over the utilitarian side .

		An occa - sional rare recipe is given , however ; and in treating of the hygiene of the table some per - nicious customs are dealt with in plain speech .

		A sense of gratified appreciation fills me as I read the sparkling chapter upon '' The Cook 's Confrere , '' -- something of the mingled feeling of gratified pride and satisfied justice which we have upon hearing tardy praise given a worthy friend who has through some misapprehension or mistake been for a time under a cloud .

		For '' The Cook 's Confrere '' is he who was chosen by ancient
Rome	LOCATION	and by
King Richard III	ORGANIZATION	.

		of
England	LOCATION	as a badge and cognizance , and by St.
Anthony	PERSON	as his patron , -- the Hog , an entity of inestimable benefit to mankind and to cooks .

		Hindus ,
Mohammedans	LOCATION	, Bud - dhists , and Israelites to-day regard the Hog as what ancient writers termed `` rascal . ''

		And what must be their cuisine ?

		It has well been said that were his lardship , the onion tribe , and that priceless herb parseley removed from us , gastronomy would become obsolete and would hopelessly cease to exist .

		Without lard , ham , bacon , sausages , spare rib , souse , head cheese , or chine , how empty would be our larder !

		And vanished too would be our pates , our larded filets and game .

		This chapter on the Hog is a fit companion to
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's famous essay on
Roast Pig	LOCATION	; and a prize of great delight is offered to the reader in the account of a copy of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's works which Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	bought in
Paris	LOCATION	, bearing the initials of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and annotated in
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's own hand - writing , and having two additional pages writ - ten into the dissertation on
Roast Pig	LOCATION	.

		One minor statement of Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	's I am going to question , though it is of no gas - tronomic importance .

		He gives the year
1774	DATE	as that of the invention or discovery of a much - loved dish -- ice cream .

		It is said that a French chef in the employ of the Due de
Chartres	LOCATION	set a dish of ice cream before his master upon a hot day in that year .

		I can not believe that the French -- the leaders in culinary arts -- could have been so slow in learning of that delicacy ; for in the journal of
William Black	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- a gay young spark who was Secretary of the Commissioners appointed by Governor
Gooch	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	to treat with the Iroquois -RRB- is the following entry under the year 1744 :
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 461 ``
Annapolis	LOCATION	, Satnidar ,
May 19	DATE	, ... After which came a Dessert no less Curious : Among the Rarities of which it was Compos 'd , was some fine Ice Cream which , with the Strawberries and Milk , eat most Delieiously . ''

		The illnstrations scattered throughout Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	's pages are unusually charming , and form a valuable collection of pictures on culi - nary , gastronomic , and sporting subjects .

		All of the originals are rare , and some are unique .

		Among the most pleasing may be mentioned the beautiful Flemish interior entitled ' • A Sa Toute-Puissance I '' from a painting by
Gabriel Metzu	PERSON	,
1664	DATE	: a spirited etching , by
Birket - Foster	PERSON	, of a splendid flock of geese , '' The Bird of St.
Michael	PERSON	'' ; the '' Promenade Nutritive , '' with its curious antique choking utensils : Kleins unctuous monk in his '' Non in Solo Pane Vivit Homo '' ; Masquelier 's '' Supper in the Eighteenth C `` ntury '' ; and the three sen - suous woman diners in ' `` Apies Bon \ in , '' from the engraving by
Eisen	PERSON	in the
1762	DATE	edition of '' Contes et Nouvelles . ''

		Of course the chapter on '' The Spoils of the Cover '' gave opportunity for the inclusion of such fine sporting prints as
Cooper	PERSON	's '' First of
September	DATE	, '' Snow 's `` First Catch Tour Hare , '' one from the painting by
Stubbs	PERSON	-LRB- 1768 -RRB- of `` The Spanish Pointer , ' '' and
Howitt	PERSON	's `` Partridge Shooting '' -LRB- 1807 -RRB- .

		The chapter on truffles and mush - rooms has Vayson 's realistic picture , '' Truffle - hunting in the Dauphice . ''

		I turned the last of the four hundred and fifty pages of Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	's book with un - usual sentiments in my brain .

		Perhaps no other book ever roused in me not precisely an envy of the author -- of his having writt `` n the book , nor of the good fame and name which will come to him through it ; but , rather , a dis - tinct envy of the qualifications , the traits , the experience , the learning , which had made him capable of writing it .

		I can see what it all means , what it proves .

		To elucidate this special subject in the manner which he has , called for special qualities : some of these were natural gifts , others were acquired by association and by education .

		The writer must know the his - tory and literature of many lands -- of all civi - lized lands .

		This knowledge he could acquire only by careful study , liberal education , and ample means , since be must have above all a well-selected French library , a special library not found in public collections , and he must be distinctly a good French scholar .

		He must have travelled widely , and have a discerning mind , and an excellent memory .

		He must have a fine and critical palate , must know well his wines so as to tell of them separately and to make them accord with their complementary dishes ; thus once more is indicated the neces - sity for financial ease and welfare .

		He most be a botanbt and agriculturist , to know of fruit and flower in field and garden ; and he mast be a Qover-lover , else the book had lost many of its daintiest touches , much of its deli - cate charm .

		And with all this must be combined the power to place his natural gifts and acquired knowledge gracefully , fluently , and forcibly in print .

		Incidentally , the writer should know more than a smattering of hygiene , medicine , and chemistry , and be able to point out the digestive sequents of various articles of diet ; he should have good health himself that his sense of taste and smell should be unimpaired .

		He should know of art , of the great pictures of the Dutch and Flemish schools ; should be a sportsman , to tell of game-food in fur and feathers , and a disciple of
Isaak Walton	PERSON	.

		I think he mnst be a bit of a oook himself , and I am sure he must be a man -- no woman could have written the book .

		Ax Epic of
American Exploratiox	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Two events of more than ordinary import - ance opened up the nineteenth century for the young republic of the
United States	LOCATION	: two that are but as one in their common relation to the same imperial domain , and yet each in itself a transaction so great that it well merits the separate interest which it always excites .

		These events were the acquisition by President
Jeffer	PERSON	- son of the territory known as the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, and the exploration of that territory and its western neighbor by
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	.

		Appropriately , each of these two episodes is to be separately commemorated by centennial ceremonies in the early years of the present century , -- the purchase of the
Louisiana Terri	LOCATION	- tory at its eastern margin on the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	, and the Expedition of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	at the farthest limit attained by them on the shores of the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	.

		462 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, tratiun of American enterprise , and in each the foremost factor was the vigorous and zeal - ous personality of the alert President ,
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	.

		It was he who selected and sent to
France	LOCATION	the ministers who effected the pur - chase , and it was he whose flaming imagination had long before suggested the western explor - ation as both desirable and feasible .

		Leader in diplomacy and statesmanship , and pioneer in advancing scientific discovery , -- these were but two of the phases of character of the '' many - sided
Jefferson	PERSON	, '' who was at once framer of the Declaration , advocate of religious free - dom , promoter of
State	ORGANIZATION	education , organizer of Territorial Government , constitutional law - yer , inventive agriculturist , and disciple of music and the fine arts .

		Yet it was less the diversity of his intellectual pursuits than it was the excellence of his attainments in so many fields that won him distinction .

		One gains new views of the quality of Jef - ferson 's leadership in studying concurrently his methods and processes in these two phases ■ of western development .

		It has become fash - ionable to decry his slowness in rising to the great opportunity of acquiring at once the whole of the
Louisiana	LOCATION	Territory .

		But it should be remembered that
Jefferson	PERSON	's doubts ■ were constitutional scruples , and they did not convict him of feebleness ; for a mere weakling could not have risen to the height of conscien - tious misgiving on the subject .

		It should be remembered , too , that
Jefferson	PERSON	took the lead in voicing the demand for free navigation of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and that not even his ministers at the French court had suspected the willing - ness of the
First Consul	ORGANIZATION	to sell all the French possessions .

		It was
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	alone who was the great originator of the scheme for the transfer of the
Louisiana	LOCATION	Territory ; and there was no American who could have foreseen the rapidity with which events would press forward when prompted by the necessities of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's plans .

		But that
Jefferson	PERSON	was no dullard among his progressive countrymen is shown by his early advocacy of the scheme of trans-continental exploration .

		Before the most sanguine could have hoped for any early acquisitions of territory west of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, even before Gray 's discovery of the
Columbia River	LOCATION	,
Jefferson	PERSON	had , as early as
1783	DATE	, broached the idea of such an exploration to Colonel
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	, and had asked him , '' How would you like to lead such a party ? ''

		In
1786	DATE	and
1788	DATE	, he had twice proposed the project definitely to
John Ledyard	PERSON	, and Led - yard had once undertaken such an expedition .

		At about the time when Gray was discovering the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Jefferson	PERSON	was again airing his design , and this time it was planned to pursue the route of the
Missouri River	LOCATION	, with
Meri	PERSON	- wether
Lewis	PERSON	in charge .

		So it was merely the realization of his twenty years ' dreams of west - tern exploration , when it fell to the lot of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, in
1803	DATE	, to exercise authority on the subject , and to become the director of the actual journeys of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	.

		His intense desire for the success of the project was mani - fest when he addressed
Congress	ORGANIZATION	confidentially on the subject , on
January 18 , 1803	DATE	, suggest - ing that the real design be masked under an act appropriating money `` for extending the external commerce of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		His ascendancy was exemplified in the celerity with which
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, within six weeks , acquiesced literally in what
Jefferson	PERSON	had proposed .

		All this was before even
Napoleon	PERSON	had become ready to abandon the French claims on this continent .

		Even if
Jefferson	PERSON	were among the latest to realize that
Louisiana	LOCATION	was actually ours , his perspicacity and inventiveness had already prepared the nation to receive and to develop the magnificent domain which was to drop into
America	LOCATION	's lap when the Napoleonic earthquake should shake the world .

		It ought not to be urged as a reproach , as has been done , that this grand exploration in behalf of scientific knowledge was projected as a commercial venture .

		That such was the fact is only one of the palpable evidences that the Americans are preeminently a commercial people .

		This national proclivity has more than once given tone to our political affairs .

		Com - mercial differences were at the bottom of the contest between the thirteen colonies and the mother-country ; and it was largely the neces - sities of trade that united the colonies in their resistance to
Britain	LOCATION	.

		So , again , the movement toward the constitution of
1787	DATE	originated in a commercial convention at
Annapolis	LOCATION	.

		An in - timate connection between politics and traffic is quite normal in a great industrial state .

		The sagacity of
Jefferson	PERSON	used the passion for trade as the readiest means of increasing the national stock of knowledge of our geography , natural history , ethnography , and general resources .

		The versatility of
Jefferson	PERSON	was manifest in the instructions which he gave to this ex - pedition for the extension of trade , on the eve of its departure .

		Minute and wide-reaching , these instructions added to the duty of explor - ation that of making and preserving ample
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 468 notes of the observations of the party as to lati - tude , longitude , and the courses of streams , and the topography , soil , climatic conditions , weather phases , vegetable and mineral produc - tions , and animal life , of the country traversed ; the extent of trade conducted between the na - tive inhabitants and their Canadian and other neighbors ; and the possible conditions of the fur traffic both in the interior and on the Pa - cific coast , and the best means to promote the same .

		To the recital of these duties were added prudent suggestions looking toward the main - tenance of pacific relations with the tribes en - countered , and for precautions to be taken to assure the return of the party from the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and also directions for frequent reports to the seat of government .

		Nor did the provident President fail to arrange for the undisputed Boooession of the leadership of the expedition in ease of emergencies .

		Reading to-day the minutiae of this chart for a wilderness journey , and noting how it anticipated the daily neces - sities of the travellers , a stranger might think that
Jefferson	PERSON	was himself a hardy explorer whose wise precepts were the fruit of long ex - perience in wood-craft .

		The inspiration of these ample instructions was not lost up > ou the ardent pupils of Jef - ferson who led forth his expedition across the anknown continent .

		The fulness , minuteness , and fidelity of their reports of their travels are now , after the lapse of a century , as they have ever been , the admiration of all who read them .

		Theirs was the most extensive explora - tion upon the continent , and their account of it remains the greatest book extant of western continental travel .

		Dr.
Elliott Cones	PERSON	well styled it '' Our National Epic of Exploration . ''

		It was the worthy forerunner of a long line of American literature of travel and exploration .

		When the History of the Expedition ap - peared in print , its charm speedily overran the borders of our own land , and it was hailed with foreign as well as domestic approbation .

		The daring Americans , says Mr.
Richard Walsh	PERSON	, had '' disclosed a new world to the gaze of phil - osophy and the march of civilization . ''

		The Scotch and the English reviewers frankly admitted that '' this expedition does great credit , both to the government by which it was planned , and to the persons by whom it was executed , '' and that the leaders had '' per - formed , with equal ability , perseverance , and saccesB , one of the most arduous journeys that ever was accomplished . ''

		The first authentic edition of the Travels , -- that of
1814	DATE	, pre - pared under the direction of
Nicholas Biddle	PERSON	, with the cooperation of Captain
Clark	PERSON	, after the untimely death of Captain
Lewis	PERSON	, -- was immediately republished in
London	LOCATION	, and was within two years translated into and published in the German and Dutch languages .

		Before
1814	DATE	, the journal kept by
Gass	PERSON	, a member of the exploring party , had been printed in sev - eral editions : and from this and other sources , partial accounts of the Expedition and its work had been prepared and published , so that eleven editions in English and one in French had ap - peared , all of them fragmentary and none par - ticipated in by the leaders of the expedition .

		Reprints of the authentic version of
1814	DATE	, in English , were issued in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	in
1815	DATE	,
1817	DATE	, and
1893	DATE	, the last named in four volumes , edited and copiously annotated by Dr.
Elliott	PERSON	Cones : and the abridged version published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	has appeared in twenty successive issues , limited in number , during a series of years .

		So nearly continuous , and so well-nigh perennial , has been the desire to read and re - read this story of adventurous travel .

		Yet all these issues of the authentic narrative were but recently out of print , inaccessible to the gen - eral public , and to be found only on the shelves of favored libraries .

		The recent revival of interest in centennial history has created a demand for the republi - cation of this '' epic of exploration . ''

		One new issue has preceded the
Chicago	LOCATION	edition here chronicled ; and the early presentation has been announced of a full copy of the original notes of the explorers , from which the
Biddle	PERSON	edition was compiled .

		But among all these responses to the general desire , the
Chicago	LOCATION	edition pub - lished by
Messrs. A. C. Clnrg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will easily hold high place .

		It is a faithful reproduction of the
Biddle	PERSON	edition of
1814	DATE	.

		Its clear and distinct letter-press and tasteful binding , both so pleasing to the eye , will be welcomed by readers who are so fortunate as to peruse it '' and those to whom the Travels are not new will delight to greet their old acquaintance in so elegant a dress .

		Dr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	, whose lucid historical style abundantly recommended him for the assignment as editor of this re - issue , contributes to it a graceful introduction , in which the large import of that expedition , its high place in the development of the
Great West	LOCATION	, the skill with which it was managed , its pacific effect upon the suspicious and uneasy tribes , and the vast results flowing from it , are tersely yet felicitously summed up .

		Here 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, again , as in other o # his historical writings , Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	has emphasized the imperious will of the future Emperor of
France	LOCATION	as the dom - inant element in the transfer of
Louisiana	LOCATION	.


Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	are happily idealized as '' the Dioscuri of American tradition , '' whose achievements have made real to the present age the fabled exploits of Castor and
Pollux	PERSON	, the stalwart champions of Greek mythology .

		The publishers are to be congratulated on their choice of an editor for the
Chicago	LOCATION	edition of this `` national epic , '' no less than upon its praiseworthy typography .

		The stirring and strenuous life of the west - ern frontier , as that frontier was aligned before the great expedition , and also as it has since been advanced , teemed with romantic experi - ences ; and the renewed recital of the events of that early period naturally arouses the imag - ination of lovers of the marvellous .

		Our na - tional literature already exhibits a centennial phase in the abundance of recent historical romances .

		In this class may be mentioned , for convenience , one entitled `` The Conquest : the True Story of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, '' -- though it is not easy to class this book as either a his - tory or a romance .

		Its narrative embraces the entire period of the life of
William Clark	PERSON	, who was four years older than
Meriwether Lewis	PERSON	and survived him many years ; and it covers the years of the wonderful activity of
Clark	PERSON	's older brother , General
George Kogers Clark	PERSON	.

		In chronological sequence , the author has set forth all the leading incidents of the romantic lives of these stalwart pioneers and of some of their spirited contemporaries , and has gar - nished her story with much that is apparently only traditional .

		The startling surprises of the journey across the continent appear in all their novelty ; and the exciting narrative wears the garb of fiction , though occasional state - ments of familiar history , and transcripts of letters from members of the exploring party , give to romance an air of verisimilitude .

		The author 's title , '' The Conquest , '' implies more than the mere expedition ; it is '' the Winning of the West '' that has awakened her fancy , and that she has sought to narrate in heroic form .

		Her unique version of the `` epic of exploration '' will fascinate many readers , and will doubtless induce in many others a more appreciative interest in and a more sympathetic understanding of the intrepid men who actively promoted the expansion of our national domain .

		An Old and a
New Estimate of Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	.

		* An edition de luxe of ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' a reprint of
William EUery Channing	PERSON	's ''
Thoreau	PERSON	, the Poet-Naturalist '' edited by another friend and biographer of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, Mr.
F. B. Sanborn	PERSON	, and a new life by Mrs.
Annie Russell Marble	PERSON	, all issued within a few months , point unmistak - ably to a gratifying awakening of interest in
Thoreau	PERSON	and his philosophy of life .

		From the nature of his message this is only to be ex - pected .

		The strange thing is that , with all the latter-day emphasis upon nature-study , the her - mit of Walden should not sooner have come to his own .

		It has been said that every American newsboy knows his
Emerson	PERSON	, but the phase of Transcendentalism represented by
Thoreau	PERSON	has never been in the air .

		And today , after forty years , his two-fold panacea for social ills solitude and simplification -- is but beginning to be received as a fresh and timely revelation by an over-burdened world .

		This neglect has been due of course to the sharp edges of the man .

		An eccentric , an egotist , sentimental over Nature , cynical towards his fellow-men , -- the popular idea of
Thoreau	PERSON	has been that of
Lowell	LOCATION	's brilliant but unsympathetic essay , which sets forth that most insinuating of fal - lacies , a dramatic half-truth .

		It is the one point of likeness between Chan - ning 's and Mrs. Marble 's biographies that they combat
Lowell	PERSON	's position , both painting
Thoreau	PERSON	as thoroughly human and natural in spite of his oddities .

		To Channing the time passed at
Walden	LOCATION	was the merest episode ; he barely mentions it .

		He is writing of his most intimate friend , with whom he talked and walked , and whose poetic appreciation of Na - ture he so enjoyed .

		It does not occur to him that any man of sense should think Thoreau abnormal . ''

		Walden , '' he says somewhere , '' increased
Thoreau	PERSON	's repute as a writer , if some great men thought him bean-dieted , with an owl for his minister , and who milked crea - tion , not the cow .

		It is in vain for the angels to contend against stupidity . ''

		And he turns serenely to his next point .

		Mrs. Marble 's de - fence of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	is conscious .

		It is indeed her main contention that his Quixotism has been •

		THE DIAL 465 over-emphasized , her chief aim to translate his apparent antagonism to society into an earnest effort to meet its vital problems .

		Except for this one point in common , the methods of the two biographers are as the poles apart .

		Channing did his work before
1873	DATE	, when biography had not yet become a fashion , nor the making of it an exact science ; he was therefore not hedged in by precedent as he might be today .

		But furthermore he was a genius , -- without being like that other genius ,
Boswell	PERSON	, a fool .

		His work is erratic , irregular , rambling , often obscure , marked by curious omissions and constant repetition , rich with recondite allusions and interesting citations .

		It is necessary to wade in deep if you would find
Thoreau	PERSON	, but you are paid double for your effort .

		You find Channing also .

		And if his work displays the eccentricities of genius , it does not stop with the merits of mediocrity ; it presents
Thoreau	PERSON	with a vividness , an intimacy , a completeness , equalled only by the few master biographies .

		It is needless to say that Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	has performed his difficult editorial duties with rare tact and discretion .

		He knew
Thoreau	PERSON	well , and Channing better .

		He has been familiar with this work on '' The Poet-Naturalist '' for almost forty years , having read the draft of
1863	DATE	and published it in part in his newspaper , '' The
Boston Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, '' and seen the
1878	DATE	version -LRB- now out of print -RRB- through the press .

		The present edition is based upon a copy marked with
Channing	PERSON	's revisions and annotations .

		In the interest of clearness a few insertions from the original sketch of
1863	DATE	have been made .

		There are some new pas - sages from
Thoreau	LOCATION	's unpublished journals and papers , and a few additions to the '' Memorial Verses '' at the end of the biography .

		In the '' Walks and Talks '' of
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and
Channing	PERSON	, the names of the interlocutors , omit - ted by Channing , have been supplied , and there is an occasional change of order .

		An excel - lent index systematizes the book and makes it available for reference .

		But the alterations are superficial ; in its new edition the work is still
Channing 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is his portrait that Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	has chosen for the etched frontispiece of the volume , and he has refrained from omit - ting any of the '' Memorial Verses , '' though their connection with
Thoreau	PERSON	seems slight , because '' the connection existed in his -LSB- Chan - ning 's -RSB- enduring memory and his tender heart , and among them are some of his best lines . ''

		When brought into contrast with
Channing	PERSON	's unmeasured '' feast of reason and flow of soul , '' Mrs.
Marble	PERSON	's book is noticeably methodical .

		If he is wilfully obscure and enigmatical , she is almost painfully anxious to secure proper proportion and to make herself understood .

		That is , she has aimed to write a popular and at the same time an unbiassed study of
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		To this end she has made use of Channing 's ,
Sanborn	PERSON	's , and Mr.
Salt	PERSON	's biographies , as well as of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's letters and diaries -LRB- some still unpublished -RRB- , and she has interviewed the few surviving friends of
Thoreau	PERSON	and his sister
Sophia	PERSON	.

		She has studied her subject conscien - tiously and thoroughly , and has made good use of her ample materials .

		Mrs.
Marble	PERSON	has not tried to paint a striking , dramatic picture .

		Thoreau 's reputation , she thinks , has already been dragged at the tail of too many epigrams .

		Instead , she wishes to tell the whole story , omitting nothing in the way of inherited temperament , early training , or environment , that will serve to account for the man 's seeming inconsistencies .

		The '' Walden Experiment '' -- she uses
Thoreau	PERSON	's own phrase for it -- is perhaps the crisis of her book , but she shows that it was not the experiment of a hermit , nor yet of a misanthrope , that its motive was neither laziness , selfishness , nor a desire for notoriety ; and that independence of society formed no part of the plan .

		These popular misconceptions she refutes with
Thoreau	PERSON	's own words and the testimony of his friends , and she makes out an excellent case .

		The gist of the argument is that
Thoreau	PERSON	was both '' sylvan and human , '' as
Alcott	PERSON	aptly put it , that his complex nature asked correspondingly much of life , and that he went to
Walden	LOCATION	because he preferred beans and leisure for poetry and Na - ture study to drudging days spent in catering to the '' bugbear maintenance . ''

		St.
Francis	PERSON	taught his followers that the guide-posts on the royal road to freedom of the spirit read , '' Have no riches . '' ''

		Have no wants and you are free , '' amended
Thoreau	PERSON	.

		But he did not make a programme nor gather a party .

		He applied his theory , but it was the theory and not the specific application that he valued .

		So it is a mistake to suppose that to be a disciple of Thoreau one must seek out a
Walden	LOCATION	and plant a bean field .

		Thoreau spent two years in his '' wooden ink-stand , '' but he lived his philosophy to the last day of his life .

		Mrs.
Marble	PERSON	's interest in
Thoreau	LOCATION	's theory of living does not make her oblivious to his work as a naturalist and a writer .

		In this last connection she insists that his so-called imita - 466 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec.	DATE	l & r tion of
Emerson	LOCATION	was merely the result of sim - ilar surroundings and interests , and that he was as far as possible from being a parasite of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	or any other man .

		Indeed his ultra - individualism is at once his most distinctive trait and his worst failing .

		So Mrs. Marble is not a mere apologist .

		She freely admits the rough edges , but she pleads for the integrity and consistency of the man .

		On the whole her impression of Thoreau seems well rounded , impartial , and sympathetic ; one which should enlarge the circle of his influence .

		Both books are handsomely bound and well printed .

		Besides the ordinary edition of the Channing reprint there is a limited edition on hand-made paper , with five additional full-page etchings .

		Mrs.
Marble	PERSON	's work contains eleven beautiful photogravure illustrations .

Public Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In his latest book Professor
McMaster	PERSON	has re-written the public life of
Webster	PERSON	from the sources , and has given the reading public per - haps the best account of the development and the effective influence upon the nation 's history of our greatest orator and one of our greatest statesmen .

		Such of the chapters as were pub - lished in the '' Century Magazine '' proved to be interesting ; but it is only as they are gath - ered together in a volume that we see the strength and skill of the author 's work .

		Comparing the book not only with
Curtis	PERSON	's full biography , but with Lodge 's volume in the '' American Statesmen '' series , or even with Congressman
McCall	PERSON	's fine oration of last year , one misses much that he would expect and wish to find in such a biography .

		Al - though there is a somewhat full account of
Webster	PERSON	's early life , and of the environment that gave shape to his character and develop - ment , the account of his mature years presents only his public life to us .

		There is nothing of the personal side : we are told that he made a fine income as a lawyer ; we learn incidentally that he was married and had children , and a picture of his second wife leads us to infer a second marriage .

		There is nothing about his social life , nothing about his personal habits and characteristics , his intense love of nature , his
Marshfield	LOCATION	home , and his home life .

		It is not
Webster	PERSON	the man , but
Webster	PERSON	the great figure in American history , that interests Pro- fessor
McMaster	PERSON	.

		Nor does our author give us much of his own opinions about
Webster	PERSON	and his various achievements .

		There is no dis - cussion of him as an orator , or as a lawyer , or even as a statesman : for these matters we must go to the books of
McCall	ORGANIZATION	and Lodge and
Curtis	PERSON	.

		We are taken , as it were , to see Web - ster in the important acts and moments of his - life ; and these are left to tell us of the man > Even of such events , some are almost un - mentioned : the
Dartmouth College Case	ORGANIZATION	, that made
Webster	PERSON	's reputation as a lawyer , ha '' one line ; the
Plymouth	LOCATION	oration , another line ; and his service in the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Conven - tion , less than a page .

		But we have forty - five pages , or one-seventh of the book , given to the encounter with
Hayne	PERSON	as the climax of
Webster	PERSON	's career , -- though even here there is little of enthusiastic description of the dram - atic scenes , but rather a setting forth of main points made by the contestants and of the sig - nificance of the contest in the great struggle between
the North and South	ORGANIZATION	.

		With proper gratitude for what the author has given us , the reader can not help wishing that he had seen fit to give more .

		One naturally turns to the
Seventh of March	ORGANIZATION	speech as a test of an author 's treat - ment of
Webster	PERSON	; and Professor
McMaster	PERSON	's final chapter containing his discussion of this most famous of all his speeches is interesting and valuable .

		We quote a few sentences . ''

		The purpose of
Webster	PERSON	was not to put slavery in - nor shut it out of the new Territories , nor make every man in the North a slave-catcher , nor bid for
Southern	ORGANIZATION	support in the coming election .

		He sought a final and lasting settlement of a question which threatened the permanence of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and the Constitution , and ' Clay 's ' comprehensive scheme of adjustment , ' he be - lieved , would effect the settlement .

		The abolition , the anti-slavery , the Free-soil parties , were to him but ' Northern movements ' that would ' come to nothing . '

		The great debate of
1850	DATE	he regarded as idle talk that interrupted consideration of the tariff .

		Never , in his opinion , had history made record of such mischief arising from angry debates and disputes , both in the government and iu the country , on questions of so very little real importance .

		Therein lay his fatal mistake .

		The great statesman had fallen behind the times , and ' it was perhaps well for him that he was now removed ' from the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	to the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	... Change of place , however , brought no change of views , and his hatred of the Free-soilers and the abolitionists grew stronger and stronger .

		To him these men were

Union	ORGANIZATION	go to pieces if their own selfish ends were gained .

		Free-soilers and abolitionists were all one to him , and as such were attacked in lan - gnage unworthy of the great man . ''


Webster	PERSON	had indeed fallen behind the times , had parted company with the constituency that had always idolized him , and had brought upon himself criticism and denunciation which em - bittered the remainder of his life .

		From the beginning , his passion had been for the Con - stitution and the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		He could see the forces that were working to undermine this
Union	ORGANIZATION	, but he had not the moral insight that oould discern the new forces and the new issues that were to displace those that had filled his life .

		His motives were fiercely attacked ; he was called traitor , slave-catcher ; he was ac - cused of giving up his life-long convictions to secure Southern support for the presidency ; he was compared with
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	by those who had been his ardent supporters .

		But we are far enough away now to see that his motives were pure and his statesmanship was sound in many of his positions ; but he could not discern the signs of the times .

		The book is beautifully printed , is adorned with twenty-three excellent portraits in addi - tion to other illustrations , and contains a full index .

		The author 's journey from Peking lay through
Shansi	ORGANIZATION	and
Shensi	PERSON	along the route of the retreat of the
Dowager Empress Tsz	ORGANIZATION	' Hi and her court when distasteful foreigners were in the
Imperial City	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Nichols	PERSON	entered
China	LOCATION	as the representative of the '' Christian Herald , '' in the interests of the distribution of the famine fund raised in this country for suf - ferers in
Shensi	LOCATION	.

		He travelled with official escort , and with the card of Prince Ching , head of the foreign office .

		This proved to be an '' open sesame '' to the best that the man - darin could command , and brought immediate solution of all difficulties .

		As a guest at official inns , he drank the tea which the Emperor liked , and became accustomed to being gravely reminded by the banchaiti that the pile of bricks on which he slept was the same bed on which the
Son of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	had passed the
night	TIME	.

		The book is especially opportune because of the light which it throws upon the retreat of the Court and other recent events of Chinese history .

		The unique facilities which the author enjoyed brought him into close contact with Chinese officialdom , the source of many of the incidents related .

		In Chinese eyes , this retreat was a triumphal progress , a leisurely tour of inspection , followed by a return in state after the dispersal of the barbarians who had invaded the capitol before the invincible Chinese .

		The route of the royal party was still marked by repaired roads and bridges , by fresh paint and gilding on idols and temples , and by unwonted order and cleanliness in the
Kung Kwans	LOCATION	, or official inns .

		The dominating personality as well as the barbarous punishments of the Em - press Dowager were everywhere apparent .

		She forcibly suppressed all sympathy with the
Boxer	PERSON	movement , and decapitated corrupt offi - cials or unsatisfactory cooks with equal ruth - lessness .

		The common people were everywhere loyal to the Empress , and had unbounded con - fidence in her ability and desire to maintain '' Peace . '' ''

		Nearly all the stories that were told to me to illds - trate the trne greatness of the Empress Dowager con - cloded with the words ` and bis head was cnt off . '

		Aeeonnts of the imperial progress through
Shansi	ORGANIZATION	and Sbensi , as related by mandarins and banchaitis , strongly resemble the experiences of '
Alice	PERSON	' with the ' Wonder - land ' queen . ''

		The degradation of Ta-a-Ko , son of Prince
Tuan	PERSON	and heir-apparent , was not a political move nor occasioned by the banishment of his father , but resulted from the pranks by which this
Manchu Don Juan	ORGANIZATION	sought to enliven the dull capitol Sian .

		468 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, '' Ta-a-Ko was such a good fellow and his wanting to have a good time was such a rare Chinese fault that these characteristics might have proved an antidote to hereditary narrowness and fanaticism .

		One can hardly help regretting that he will never sit cross-legged on the throne of the black-haired people . ''

		Mr.
Nichols	PERSON	visited the ruins near Sian which contain the disputed Nestorian tablet which records in Chinese and Syriac the introduction of Christianity into
China	LOCATION	in the seventh cen - tury .

		Photographs of the inscriptions are repro - duced , including some not heretofore recorded .

		The author regards the evidence for the authen - ticity of the tablet as conclusive .

		Neither military nor missionary spirit breathes in these pages .

		It is an unimpassioned record of the author 's observations , and Chinese problems are mostly untouched ; however , the blight of the land , the opium curse , does rouse him to expressions of indignation at
England	LOCATION	's course in forcing the trade upon
China	LOCATION	, and at the falsifications of the
Royal Commission	ORGANIZATION	of
1893	DATE	which condones the iniquity .

		In his preface , the author acknowledges that he fell somewhat under the spell of the Shensi point of view .

		His veneration of ancient and antique methods reaches such a point at times that it warps his comparisons of policies in this '' gray land of dim beginnings and of upstart barbarian na - tions . ''

		A single instance will suffice to show the method and spirit of these contrasts .

		A few taels had been stolen from his caravan by one of his carters , who under torture confessed to the mandarin that he had spent the money .

		Whereupon the mandarin insisted that Mr.
Nichols	PERSON	accept reimbursement from his private purse .

		In comment the author remarks : '' I have heard of
Mott Street Chinamen	ORGANIZATION	being held up and robbed by ' toughs ' on the Bowery , and I believe that some of the thieves have been punished ; but I have yet to learn of one such case in which a police-captain refunded to the complainant the amount of his loss . ''

		Ob - viously there is little basis for comparison of the aforesaid laundryman and the famine-fund envoy travelling on Prince Ching 's card ; nor is this incident typical of the treatment of foreigners by Chinese mandarins .

		This dis - tortion of perspective , combined with the brevity and unique conditions of the author 's acquaintance with
China	LOCATION	and with his ignor - iance of the language , render his judgments of Chinese character and customs less discrimin - ating than those of others who have written from the experiences of many years of intimate contact with the race .

		Still , the book is a val - uable contribution to the literature on
China	LOCATION	.

		For two years Professor
Edward S. Morse	PERSON	occupied the chair of zoology in the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	at
Tokyo	LOCATION	, and after a residence of several years in
Japan	LOCATION	he made a brief visit to
Shanghai	LOCATION	and
Canton	LOCATION	, and thus gained a few '' Glimpses of
China	LOCATION	and Chinese Homes . ''

		The notes of his journal , with pen-and-ink sketches of Chinese dwellings and interiors , especially of kitchens and utensils of house - hold economy and industry , were published in an American architectural journal .

		These have been expanded into a small book , with the help of a wide margin and thirty-five empty pages between chapters .

		The value of the work lies in its illustration of articles not usu - ally pictured in books on
China	LOCATION	, and in the critical comparisons of things Chinese and Japanese .

		The book is marred by a tinge of pessimism even on extraneous subjects .

		An address before the
New York Yacht Club	ORGANIZATION	upon '' Cruising in the
West Indies	LOCATION	'' has been published in book form by Mr.
Anson Phelps Stokes	PERSON	, for the use of yachtsmen in these waters .

		It recounts briefly the experiences of the '' Sea Fox '' on a trip from
Charleston	LOCATION	to Port of
Spain	LOCATION	, and return via the
Bahamas	LOCATION	.

		Suggestions are made for a sixty and for a hundred days ' itinerary among the Virgin ,
Windward	ORGANIZATION	, and
Leeward Islands	LOCATION	; and there are notes regarding the Bermudas ,
Barbados	LOCATION	, and
Bahamas	LOCATION	.

		Reminiscences of yachting and sailing experiences , and a few words about yachting in Grecian and English waters , the latter principally concerned with royalty , are added .

		A brief appendix deals with the polit - ical future of these islands of our tropics .

		A good map , a list of books , and blanks for the record of a cruise , are inserted .

		Several books have been written about Bor - neo and its people , but most of them are con - cerned with the externals of the subject , and at the most deal only with the coast tribes .

		Dr.

Kay	PERSON	- ans and Kenyahs of the

		His book , '' The Home-life of Bor - neo Head-Hunters , '' as its title indicates , is a piece of intensive work confined to a thorough and skilful investigation of the life and cus - toms of these savage tribes .

		His several chap - ters treat of the home-life , of the ceremonies attending the naming of a chief 's son , and of the early training of a head-hunter , an incident in which is the method by which the boys are accustomed to the letting of human blood .

		The author also de - scribes in detail the omens of the preparations for , and the progress of a war expedition , and the elaborate ceremonies at the conclusion of peace .

		Their religion requires that a fresh hu - man head must be hung on the verandah of the village long-house after every calamity , to bring again blessing and prosperity to the community .

		The chapter on personal embellishment treats of the patterns and method of tatooing , and the cu - rious splitting and elongation of the ear-lobes , together with other bodily mutilations .

		The signs and customs attending the operation of lali , a species of Bornean taboo , are explained , and variations in the different tribes are noted .

		These chapters also give a most interesting pic - ture of the jungle-life of these simple people , of the structure of their homes with their do - mestic and industrial equipment , of their rude arts , of their culture of rice , preparation of tapioca , and collection of camphor and edible bird 's nests , of their military accoutrements and religious symbols .

		The author also vividly portrays the daily life in the villages along the river , the work and play , the customs and su - perstitions , which attend minutiae of the daily routine , as well as those which mark more im - portant events , such as a camphor hunt , a fish - ing party , a trip to a neighboring tribe , the taking of a head , marriage , sickness , death and burial .

		He also gives an insight into the char - acter of the people , and the reader comes to admire the intelligent

Laki La	PERSON	, and to tire of the lugubri - ous and voluble

		What with browless and lashless eyes , inky teeth , brass plugs , looped ears , and blue legs , I am afraid I have given but a sorry picture of those whom I would fain have my readers regard with as much kindliness as my memory now holds for the originals .

		These freaks of fashion are , however , merely external ; underneath I found honesty , hospitality , gentleness , and a child-like simplicity .

		The Kayans and
Kenyahs	PERSON	harmonise with their surroundings .

		The very word ' jungle ' possesses an indefinable charm , -- it is full of gay , exuberant life in insect and flower ; but in its depths , side by side with these , lurks swift death .

		Deep-seated in the heart of the joyous , child-like Borneans , there reigns in their bosoms , true to their jungle home , an inextinguishable yearning for a bead not their own .

		Nevertheless , I like them . ''

		The author also comes to understand why
Rajah Brooke	PERSON	has been so successful in gov - erning
Sarawak	LOCATION	.

		Running through several chapters is a tale of diplomacy in which the Resident skilfully uses a tribal feud to admin - ister retributive justice , utilizes their belief in omens to further peace even while proclaiming his own skepticism of their efficacy , satisfies a headhunting expedition with an ancient bor - rowed skull , and brings a bloodless foray to a triumphant Jawa , or peace celebration .

		We are also told of the Punans , who '' have never a thought of the morrow ; no cares ; no respon - sibilities ; no possessions ; no enemies , for they desire nothing that other people have , not even clothes ; money is dross ; and home is where they rest their blow-pipes and hang up their parangs . ''

		This is a most charming book of travel .

		It reads well , its field is novel , and its treatment is most thorough and satisfactory .

		Moreover , there is in it a wholesome human element .

		One notes a slight tendency to repe - tition , with too frequent use of the parenthesis ; he longs for a map , and wishes so heavy a book were better bound .

		Its charm is greatly height - ened by the 89 full-page heliotype plates , well executed from photographs which excel in com - position and appropriateness .

		In his preface to the book just noted , the author states that he omits unimportant details as to the height of the thermometer , the dis - comforts of food or travel , or the number of men who carried his luggage .

		On the other hand , in Mr.
George Horton	PERSON	's '' In Argolis '' we find that it is primarily personal experience and incident which forms the thread of his story .

		Anything , from the setting up of a stove to the christening of the family
Babycoula	LOCATION	, serves to guide his '' flitting about in an irrele - vant and inconsequential manner . ''

		With the craft of a bookmaker , he manages incident and story to portray the life of shepherds and fish - ermen , townsfolk and priest , in the little Greek village of
Poros	LOCATION	, and to mingle with narrative myth and history , and not a little poetry and fancy , -- and all in a humorous , nay , jocular style .

		Mr.
Horton	PERSON	was once in our diplomatic service in
Greece	LOCATION	, and his book records the experiences of a
summer	DATE	with his family in a remote Greek village .

		It illumines the life of the Greeks of to-day .

		A few illustrations from photographs , and an introduction by Professor
Alexander	PERSON	, formerly United States Minister to
Greece	LOCATION	, lend interest to the volume .

		One might well imagine that an author plan - ning to write a book of Italian travel today would find it difficult to avoid well-beaten paths and to clothe the theme anew with interest and novelty .

		But this is just what
Miss Hooker	PERSON	has most admirably done in her '' Wayfarers in
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		It is an account of the sojournings of a small party of ladies in some of the smaller cities , towns , and villages of the Lombard plain , 470 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, in the Marches and
Abruzzi	LOCATION	and the heart of
Umbria	LOCATION	.

		It records a drive through
Tuscany	LOCATION	, and excursions from
Rome	LOCATION	and along the
Adriatic	LOCATION	, with visits to little-known towered cities .

		One chapter is given to a sojourn in
Florence	LOCATION	with an Italian household , and an - other , the best in the book , to a charming account of gondola days in
Venice	LOCATION	.

		It is typi - cal of the work that widely-known places of interest are passed by , and the reader is de - lighted with new discoveries in byways of city and country .


St. Marks	ORGANIZATION	and
the Grand Canal	ORGANIZATION	are mere landmarks by the wayside , and the
Campanini	PERSON	is not even mentioned ; but we do visit the
Madonna of San Giorgis	ORGANIZATION	, and make a most memorable call at the home of
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	, our clever gondolier .

		These were merry way - farers , and
Italy	LOCATION	through their eyes is not only beautiful and everywhere interesting but it is also a land of good cheer and pleasant folk , -- so much so , in fact , that one longs for disaster or a villain to break the spell .

		This is a charmingly written book , dainty and bright , and full of humor and human interest .

		It also contains a deal of information , and might well be used as a supplement to
Baedeker	LOCATION	.

		The whole volume , binding , typography , illustra - tions , from title to tail-piece , is in excellent keeping with the refinement and good taste of the text .

		It is a different
Italy	LOCATION	that one sees in Mr.
Ashton Willard	PERSON	's `` Land of the Latins , '' which is mainly confined to Home and its environs , and , notwithstanding the title , deals more with modern Koman society and Italian men and women of affairs than it does with
Italy	LOCATION	or Home of to-day .

		The reader gains some in - sight into the personalities of the royal family , of Italian actors of note , and of authors in several fields of literature .

		It is the life in the palaces , at the theatre , at the races , in country homes , at the
summer	DATE	resorts , in the studios and bookshops , which the author de - scribes in a manner not without interest , but lacking somewhat in color and humor .

		A handbook originally prepared for the
Glasgow International Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	by the De - partment of Agriculture and Technical Instruc - tion for
Ireland	LOCATION	has been reissued in more elaborate form , becoming , in fact , an encyclo - paedia of
Erin	PERSON	.

		It sets forth
Ireland	LOCATION	's chief economic resources and industries from lace to linen and stone to ships .

		It is also full of information on questions of sociological import and more than local interest , such as the eco - nomic distribution of the population , the work - ings of the cooperative credit associations , and the '' Congested Districts Board '' for the re - lief of the peasantry , and especially the exten - sive system of agricultural cooperation in a great variety of ways , such as the sale of pro- duce and the employment of expert instructors .

		The splendid equipment for art instruction in
Dublin	LOCATION	,
Belfast	LOCATION	, and
Cork	ORGANIZATION	is described , and ita results upon the lace and linen industries and the home-crafts carried on in peasants ' cottages are made apparent .

		A fully illustrated chap - ter on modern Irish lace-making follows the process from designing to marketing , with a wealth of details that will delight connoisseurs .

		Naturally , the agricultural resources are most fully dealt with , from the physical features of the land to the various products of the fields and pastures ; but the whole question of land - tenure , for obvious reasons , is not mentioned .

		.

		The book is filled with facts from cover to cover , and is printed on a special Irish paper of excellent quality .

		n. Weighty in both senses of the word is the huge - folio upon the painter ''
Pintoricchio	PERSON	, his Life , Work , and Time '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Dr.
Corrado Ricci	PERSON	, Director of the
Brera	LOCATION	at
Milan	LOCATION	.

		Indeed one must draw up to his library table if he would look this book over in comfort .

		The extra-heavy paper , however , makes a splendid printing-surface for the numerous superb reproductions of the painter 's fres - coes , some in color , some in photogravure , besides many half-tones , large and small .

		A number of th & most beautiful of these plates depict the frescoes in the
Borgia	LOCATION	rooms of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	.

		The restoration of these famous rooms and their reopening to the public in
1897	DATE	, under the direction of
Leo XIII.	PERSON	, awakened interest in the great decorator and render timely this exhaustive study by Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	, who has aimed to make his work more comprehensive , along both critical and biographical lines , than that of any previous writer .

		Pintoricchio is ranked very high by Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	.

		While he lacks the depth and pas - sion of the three or four greatest Italian masters , he clearly stands well up in the second rank by virtue of '' his quaint and graceful fancy , the richness of his accessories and ornament , and his skilful distribution of animated groups of figures . ''

		Again , he is interesting because he occupies so unique a position in the Umbrian school , standing between the '' conventional sweetness '' of his master
Peru	LOCATION	- gino and the strongest work of
Raphael	PERSON	, who , Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	thinks , has gotten credit for some of his older friend 's best designs .

		Then he lived in the fifteenth
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 471 centary , that most princely and profligate period of the Italian Renaissance ; and by no means the least interesting feature of Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	's monograph is its attempt at a reconstruction of the environ - ment of this protege and friend of the
Borgias	LOCATION	.

		All the magnificence of the period glows in his splendid coloring and in the rich silks and brocades that bedeck his figures ; and a real understanding of the frescoes implies a knowledge of the sumptuons beauty of fifteenth century
Italy	LOCATION	.

		As has been said , the most novel chapter of the book is that upon the
Borgia	LOCATION	frescoes .

		Next , both in interest and in beauty of illustration , is the treatment of the decor - ations for the
Siena Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here the theory , current since
Vasari	PERSON	's day , that
Pintoricchio	PERSON	was indebted to
Raphael	PERSON	for his designs , is discussed and shown not to be plausible .

		It is a pity that so scholarly and authoritative a work as Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	's should be published without an index or a complete list of the plates it contains .

		In '' Social
New York	LOCATION	under the Georges '' -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	writes of the city houses and country homes , the furniture , plate , and china , the dress , the plays , balls , and dinners of the opulent pre-Revolutionary New-Yorker , aiming thus to build up a clear picture of the social condi - tions in what has sometimes been called `` The Golden Age of
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Primitive these conditions cer - tainly were not , as Miss
Singleton	PERSON	proves from such authentic records as old wills , inventories , letters , diaries , and newspapers .

		The documentary tone of the book grows a little wearisome before the end , unless one has some special interest in the subject ; yet from another point of view it is a most valuable quality , indicating accuracy and completeness , and making the conclusions of real historical value .

		Like Miss
Singleton	PERSON	's other study of Colonial days , '' The Furniture of Our Forefathers , '' her new book is fully illustrated .

		The pictures show articles of furniture , china , plate , and costumes actually owned by famous citizens whose descendants have kindly allowed them to be photographed .

		The quaint tail-pieces to the chapters are reproductions of adver - tisements found in the newspapers of the day . ''

		Social Life in the Early Republic '' by Miss
Anne HoUingsworth Wharton	PERSON	treats most fascinat - ingly a similar theme .

		The author passes over the characteristic and interesting society of early
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and the Southern cities , to write of the more typically republican life at the new capitol of a new nation .

		Why this capitol was chosen despite the loud protests of the older cities , and how it was planned and built in nucleus , forms the theme of the earlier chapters .

		Those were the days when '' a city of magnificent distances '' had bitter meaning for the elegant Spanish minister whose gilded coach stuck in the mud in its transit across the miles of rutted lane that lay between the scattered residences ; and when the prayer of the French diplomat , '' My God I What have I done to reside in such a city ? ''

		was doubtless echoed by many a patriotic American statesman .

		But with characteristic republican promptness conditions were changed , and
Washington	LOCATION	blossomed into a social centre , retaining traces of its distinctive , old-time flavor down to the middle of the last century .

		Miss
Wharton	PERSON	is steeped in all sorts of Colonial lore , and her racy , gossipy narrative is charming from begin - ning to end .

		The publishers -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- have brought out the book in a dainty yellow binding and with many excellent pictures .

		Most of these plates are reproductions of famous portraits and miniatures of some of the belles and beauties of the early republic .

		One of the most profound and elaborate art studies of the season is Miss
Maud Crnttwell	PERSON	's `` Lnca and
Andrea Delia Robbia	PERSON	and their Suc - cessors '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Some idea of the book 's scope may be gained from the fact that , with its various appendices , it contains three hundred and fifty large octavo pages and includes also no less than one hundred and fifty full - page illustrations .

		Again , the monograph embodies the results of original research , which shows itself as patient , painstaking , and scholarly .

		And , thirdly , the treat - ment , while detailed , is clear , unified , and surpris - ingly simple .

		The biographies of
Lnca	LOCATION	,
Andrea	PERSON	, and
Giovanni Delia Robbia	ORGANIZATION	are pieced together from the scant materials at hand ; the distinc - tive characteristics of the art of each are pointed out , and there is a detailed analysis of all their important works , followed by an account of the productions of the more talented of
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	's brothers , including the bizarre porcelain palace that
Girolamo	PERSON	built for the
King of France	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the appendices are to be fonnd a genealogical tree of the
Robbia	PERSON	family , complete lists of the works of its various members , a bibliography , and a collection of documents many of which are here published for the first time .

		The purpose of the author is twofold .

		She wishes first to show that while
Luca Delia Robbia	PERSON	worked in terra cotta , and indeed invented that pretty and popular process in its application to sculpture , yet it was in marble and bronze that he showed his greatest power .

		And next she urges that
Luca	PERSON	, being judged by such masterpieces as the Cantoria and the Bronze Doors , shall not be made to stand sponsor to the charm - ing but inferior work of his nephew
Andrea	PERSON	, and certainly not for the paltry performances of
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	and the later school .

		The connoisseur in Renaissance art will be most interested in the col - lection of documents , and in
Miss Cruttwell	LOCATION	's de - tailed investigations which aim to extricate from the composite terra-cottas of the
Robbia	PERSON	family the special handiwork of each , as well as to assign entire sculptures to their respective artists .

		But the gen - eral reader will find delightful description and clear exposition , so unified by being related to a few essential points that he can easily follow this inter - esting history of the rise and decline of the Robbia art .

		The illustrations , many in photogravure , form a notable collection , and the binding of the volume is strikingly artistic .

		472 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Mr. and Mrs.
Edwin H. Blasbfield	PERSON	's well-known work on `` Italian Cities '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is now issued in a holiday edition , in two attractive volumes .

		The distinctive feature of the book in its present form is the remarkably soft and clear half-tone plates , almost equal to photogravures in beauty .

		These reproduce about one hundred masterpieces of Italian painting , sculpture , and architecture -- gen - erally in the last case some beautiful detail rather than a less isteresting view of a whole building .


Ravenna	LOCATION	,
Siena	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	,
Parma	LOCATION	,
Perugia	LOCATION	, Cor - tona ,
Spoleto	LOCATION	,
Assisi	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and
Mantua	LOCATION	are the cities considered , -- not street by street , but for their spirit and atmosphere , and chiefly for their art treasures .

		St.
Francis	PERSON	, however , who gave
Assisi	LOCATION	all its fame , is accorded , in the study of that city , equal place with
Giotto	PERSON	; and the sketch of
Cortona	LOCATION	is entirely devoted to a visit to the nuns of
Santa Margherita	LOCATION	.

		The fact that '' Japanese '' has come to be almost synonymous with '' artistic '' probably accounts for the other fact , that books about
Japan	LOCATION	are always beautifully bound and copiously illustrated .

		``
Japan	LOCATION	and her People , '' by Miss
Anna C. Hartshorne	PERSON	, is no exception to this rule .

		It is issued in two vol - umes by
Messrs. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in their `` Photo - gravure Series , '' and its handsome red cloth covers are richly decorated with a stork pattern in gold .

		There are fifty excellent photogravures , picturing all parts of the land and all phases of the life of its people .

		Miss
Hartshorne	PERSON	has lived in
Japan	LOCATION	for several years , has entered into the every-day life of all classes of the people , and loves the land and its traditions as if they were her own .

		She takes her reader into remote nooks and corners , where the customs of `` old
Japan	LOCATION	'' still linger undisturbed , and shows him how the genuine native lives and works and plays and worships .

		She gives him legends and folk-tales in plenty , and history , too , enough to make the monuments of to-day intellig - ible .

		She has in mind particularly the tourist , but in planning her work with reference to his probable itinerary , she merely makes it all the easier for the stay-at-home reader to imagine himself in the sunny land of the cherry blossom .

		A copious index , so often unfortunately omitted from books of travel , makes the material presented available for reference .

		A second volume in the '' Photogravure Series '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- , similarly illustrated , indexed , bound , and boxed , is ``
Vienna	LOCATION	and the Viennese '' by
Maria Hornor Lansdale	PERSON	.

		Miss
Lansdale	PERSON	bases her work upon
Victor Tissot	PERSON	's , which she has considerably expanded and altered to bring it up to date .

		In writing of the gayest capital in
Europe	LOCATION	one can not lack material .

		Miss
Lansdale	PERSON	makes the most of all the associations of the city , as well as of its pic - turesque charm ; and particularly for those of her readers who are looking forward to visiting
Vienna	LOCATION	she has written a very interesting guide .

		From the press of
Messrs. James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		comes a book closely resembling , in make-up and illustration , the volumes on
Japan	LOCATION	and
Vienna	LOCATION	spoken of above .

		Its subject is '' The
Mediterra	PERSON	- nean , '' and it is the work of six writers whose vivid descriptions of the famous
Mediterranean	LOCATION	ports in
Africa	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	will be of value and interest not alone to travellers , but to all for whom the `` venerable cities and storied ruins `` associated with the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	have a perennial fascination .

		Twenty finely-executed plates in photogravure ad - mirably supplement the text .

		In her '' Fictional Rambles in and about
Boston	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Miss
Frances Weston Carruth	PERSON	takes her readers about new and old
Boston	LOCATION	and out to
Cambridge	LOCATION	.


Lexington	LOCATION	, and other historic suburbs , in search of the highways and homesteads that have been immortalized in ''
Boston	LOCATION	fiction . ''

		If
Europe	LOCATION	is attractive because its great romances have made it so , likewise ,
Miss Carruth	PERSON	reasons , has
Boston	LOCATION	been the scene of much that is interesting in American fiction .

		But she straightway pricks her own bubble by adding that
Boston	LOCATION	's literary men were at first theologians , and later for the most part poets and essayists .

		She is therefore obliged to fall back on some rather unfamiliar novels , because the American classics do not give her sufficient material .

		Nevertheless the '' Rambles '' are very readable .

		Miss
Carruth	PERSON	's interest in her subject is infectious ; and then , if you do not remember the fictional reference , you can glance across the page and see the place referred to , for almost half the book is made up of illustrations .

		These plates are all of them excellent , and combine with the gay blue cover , and the interest of the text , to make a de - lightful holiday book about
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Equally enthusiastic over another city , and for other reasons , is Mr.
Jesse Lynch Williams	PERSON	.

		His `` New York Sketches '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , now published in book-form , invite the reader to ramble with him along the water-front , walk up-town of a sunny afternoon , investigate the cross-streets of the city , and , venturing farther afield , test the actuality be - hind the phrase , '' rural
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		It is not as - sociations , literary or historical , that interest Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, but the pulsing humanity and fascinating variety of the great city as it stands today .

		The illustrations , which are by Messrs.
Jules Gu	PERSON	^ rin ,
Henry McCarter	PERSON	,
W. R. Leigh	PERSON	,
Charles L. Hinton	PERSON	,
Ernest Peixotto	PERSON	,
Everett Shinn	PERSON	, and others , show us
New York	LOCATION	from as many points of view as there are artists represented ; but all the drawings are striking and all bring out the city 's picturesqueness , -- the quality that Mr.
Williams	PERSON	emphasizes . ''

		The Quest of Happiness , '' with its message of hope and good cheer , is just the holiday gift to choose for a pessimistic or disheartened friend .

		He will have to gain the quest for himself , but Dr.
Hillis	PERSON	's point of view can not but prove interesting and suggestive .

		The author is neither a visionary nor a materialist .

		His feet are planted on the facts of life , but his outlook is optimistic , and he is of course a Christian philosopher , with a Christian 's idea of the meaning of happiness .

		Thus his view of a hackneyed subject is fresh and inspiring .

		He
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 473 poshes his explorations to the depths of the sabject , and adorns every phase of it with a profasion of literary and historical allusions , interesting in them - selves , if not always quite accurate or pertinent to the main thesis .

		The serious treatment of the theme does not suggest a decorative edition , bat the publishers -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have brought out the book in an ornate binding , with border designs in green on every page .

		In '' An Old Country House '' -LRB-
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	is at his best .

		There are all sorts of quaintnesses for him to ex - ploit -- the old gardens and the older house , a room full of moth-eaten folios , a newly married pair , and finally a real old English Christmas , with a Yule - log and carol-singers .

		All these are written of in Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's dainty and highly finished style , and permeated with his delicate fancy .

		Miss
Eliza	PERSON	- beth
Shippen Green	ORGANIZATION	's softly-tinted illustrations ex - actly fit the text ; and paper , typography , and binding are all in harmony with the leborely , luxurious spirit of the writing .

		With the three new volumes -- ''
Joshua	PERSON	and Judges , '' ' • The Later
Pauline Epistles	PERSON	, '' and '' An Introduction to the Study of the Scriptures '' by the Bishop of
Ripon	LOCATION	, -- the `` Temple Bible '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- is complete in twenty-five volumes .

		By its convenient and dainty form , with each book or group of books printed separately , the principle of the natural growth and composite character of the
Bible	LOCATION	has been emphasized as it could be in no other way .

		The arrangement of the text by paragraphs instead of by arbitrarily divided verses can not but aid intelligent reading .

		And the introductions , em - bodying the results of the best modern scholarship and written in a spirit alike rational and reverent , must be influential in unmasking the spectre of higher criticism ; an influence which the excellent general introduction to the whole series will greatly strengthen .

		The appearance of the small leather - covered volumes , with their attractive typography and beautiful photogravure frontispieces , is too well known to need description .

		Indeed the ''
Temple Edition	ORGANIZATION	'' has already made a place for itself among those whose interest in the
Bible	LOCATION	is many-sided , who appreciate its supreme spiritual value , and yet , believing that real appreciation implies clear un - derstanding , wish to read and study it with the same earnest attention that they give to other great literature .

		With ten of the world 's greatest paintings as points of departure .

		Dr.
Amory H. Bradford	PERSON	ex - plains what is for him the spiritual significance of each , calling his book `` Messages of the Masters '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- . ''

		These essays are not critical studies , '' the author tells us in his preface .

		`` The one object in preparing them has been either to interpret the spiritual meaning of the painters or to follow the suggestions of their work . ''

		Thus from
Murillo	PERSON	's '' Holy Family '' Dr.
Bradford	PERSON	draws the theme of '' The Sanctity of Human Love '' ; while
Watts	PERSON	's '' Sir Galahad '' inspires a chapter on goodness , the crown of life ; and
Benouf	PERSON	's `` The Pilot , '' one on `` The Message and Ministry of the Sea . ''

		Each chapter is illustrated by a full-page photogravure of the painting discussed .

		The book is exceptionally well printed and handsomely bound .

		`` The History of Mr.
John Decastro	PERSON	and hia Brother Bat , Commonly Called Old Crab , the
Merry Matter Written	ORGANIZATION	by
John Mathers	PERSON	, the Grave by a Solid Gentleman '' : -- so runs the quaint title-page of one of the season 's interesting reprints -LRB-
Irwin Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		First published in
1815	DATE	, mysterious as to authorship , neglected by the reviewers , but kept in memory in an esoteric fashion by an occasional bit of clever criticism , and eagerly in demand of late years among its little circle of admirers , `` The History of Mr.
John Decastro	PERSON	'' has had a career unique in literary annals .

		A conjecture that the original dedication was to Lord
Ormonde	PERSON	gives name to this '' New Ormonde Edition , '' which the editor , Mr.
William S. Walsh	PERSON	, and the publishers have aimed to present '' in just the shape the au - thor would have approved were he still living in the flesh . ''

		The text has been but slightly modern - ized , and not expurgated at all , but left to stand as '' an extraordinary efflorescence from the jovial , genial , boisterous , and none too squeamish
Merry England	LOCATION	of the Georges . ''

		A brilliant Introduc - tion by Mr.
Walsh	PERSON	discusses the various answers that have from time to time been proposed to the quite insoluble question of the book 's authorship , and characterizes the racy Rabelaisian humor of the satire , suggesting its probable influence upon
Thackeray	PERSON	, and its undoubted indebtedness to the whimsical mockery of Fielding and
Sterne	PERSON	.

		The edition is in two volumes , handsomely bound in half morocco .


William Blake	PERSON	's famous illustrations for the Book of Job , twenty-one in number , have been reproduced in photogravure from the original etch - ings and issued in a folio volume bound in heavy cardboard , by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		These reproductions , which are of the same size as the now very rare originals , are the first to give any adequate impression of the strength and fantastic richness of
Blake	PERSON	's best work .

		The present edition , which is limited , will be a great addition to any art library .

		Not limiting her field to our rather modern Amer - ican '' antiquities '' at all , Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	has still kept pretty well within the geographical limits of the island of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and of the thirteen original States of the Union for the charm - ing materials that , culled and sorted , go to make up her '' Sun-dials and Roses of Yesterday : Garden Delights which are Here Displayed in very Truth and are Moreover Regarded as Emblems '' -LRB- Mac - mUlan -RRB- .

		The qnaintness of a day far more remote than the mere passing of time can hint pervades the pleasant narrative , giving it a notable literary quality .

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	passes from sun-dials to roses and back again with a unity of sentiment that makes the phrase in the sub-title of '' Garden Delights '' 474 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, wholly appropriate .

		The earlier two-thirds of the book is given over to sun-dials , and examples of this time-honored method of telling the time of day have been gathered from
Italy	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and even distant
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	; but with hardly more than a single example from each of these countries .

		England and
Scotland	LOCATION	supply an element which , under Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's treatment , is not felt as foreign .

		These examples , delineated in both letter-press and illustration , are numerous and inclusive -LRB- the dial without the gnomon on
Massachusetts Hall	ORGANIZATION	in
Cambridge	LOCATION	being the only instance of any note that seems to be omitted -RRB- , and the whole constitutes a veritable encyclopaedia on the subject within the limits of civilization .

		Roses are discussed in something less of the discursive and more of the historical manner , but with the same play of delightful and thoroughly assimilated imagina - tion .

		The lines at the very close -- the inside of the back cover -- of the handsome volume , headed '' The Authors Friend to the
Booke	PERSON	, '' are so entirely in the spirit of the whole work that they may well be quoted .

		`` Goe ventrous booke , thy selfe expose To learned men , and none but thoae ; For this carping age of ours Snuffes at all bnt choycest flowers , Cul 'd from out the carious knots Of quaint writers garden plots ; These they smell at , these they savor .

		Yet not free from feare , nor favour : But if thou wert smel 'd a right By a nose not stnft with spight , Thou to all that learning love Might ` st a fragrant nosegay prove , So content thee , till due time , Blaze thy worth throughout this Clime . ''

		It is '' To my Sister
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	'' that Miss
Frances Clary Morse	PERSON	dedicates her book on '' Fur - niture of the Olden Time '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author 's recondite knowledge of her subject is strictly limited to examples of furniture actually within the
United States	LOCATION	and in many instances made here .

		But the wealth that came so freely in the early days enabled our ancestors to import from abroad , chiefly from
England	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	, the best specimens of the cabinet-makers there ; and
Miss Morse	PERSON	is thus given the opportunity to include examples which fairly cover the period from the middle of the seventeenth to the middle of the nineteenth centuries -- until the desperate philistin - ism which
Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	so resented and
William Morris	PERSON	so reformed , had closed upon us with its meaningless curves and stained '' black '' walnut .

		Though
France	LOCATION	until the Revolution con - tained the greatest of artists and handicraftsmen in the manufacture of household furniture , the omis - sion of all consideration of the charming instances of their work still so numerous in
Louisiana	LOCATION	gives Miss
Morse	PERSON	's book narrowed and strictly defined lim - itations -- necessary , perhaps , if the present volume was not to become unwieldy , but certainly worthy of a companion work to it at no distant day .

		Miss
Morse	PERSON	's treatment is by chapters severally devoted to specific articles in customary use , as '' Chests , Chests of Drawers , Dressing-tables , '' '' Bureaus and Washstands , '' '' Bedsteads , '' etc. .

		Her narrative is free , unforced , and sufficiently succinct and well digested ; and almost every page contains a repro - duced photograph of some quaint or beautiful heir - loom .

		Mr.
Guy Wetmore Carryl	PERSON	's '' Grimm Tales Made Gay '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a collection of amusing tra - vesties , in verse , of certain familiar fairy stories , '' Grimm '' and otherwise .

		Among the tales , to quote from the rhymed table of contents , are those which tell us '' How Rudeness and Kindness were Justly Rewarded , How Beauty Contrived to Get Square with the
Beast	LOCATION	, How a Fair One no Hope to His Highness Accorded , How Thomas a Maid from a Dragon Released , '' and so on .

		Each '' gay '' tale has an ingenious up - to-date moral , and is copiously illustrated by Mr.
Albert Levering	PERSON	, in his usual grotesquely humorous style .

		`` Penelope 's Experiences in
Ireland	LOCATION	'' by Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	is reprinted this year in an illus - trated holiday edition uniform with the other vol - umes in the
Penelope	LOCATION	series -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	, the illustrator of the series , is an adept at drawing Irish types , and the sketches that head each chapter are as good in their way as the text , the delightful humor of which is too familiar to need comment .

		Thoroughly Ingoldsbian in spirit is the new edi - tion of the immortal `` Jackdaw of Rheims '' -LRB- Young -RRB- , illustrated by Mr.
Ernest Maurice Jessop	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Jessop	PERSON	has caught the whimsical humor of the poet - antiquary perfectly .

		His drawings are full of the same solemn fooling and rollicking wit that char - acterize the verses .

		He pictures everything , and , from the poor little Jackdaw with drooping head and rumpled feathers to the microscopic red hat that always stands above the Cardinal 's name , everything is charming , -- except perhaps the Car - dinal himself , who is hardly impressive enough for so exalted a personage .

		The decorations , printed in two colors , are as artistic in general effect as they are humorous in detail .

		The volume is bound in unassuming brown boards with a picture of the Jackdaw on the cover .

		Two delightful essays in
Thackeray	LOCATION	's most char - acteristic critical style , which have somehow almost escaped the notice of the bibliographers , are now published together in a choice limited edition by
Messrs. H. W. Fisher & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Both essays originally appeared in ''
Fraser	PERSON	's Magazine , '' and both are satires upon the old-time Christmas `` Annual , '' now happily defunct . ''

		A Word on the Annuals , '' so Mr.
Almon Dexter	PERSON	tells us in the in - troductory note , appeared a year before '' Our An - nual Execution . ''

		The former has never before been reprinted , and the latter only once -- in the `` Mis - cellanies '' of Messrs. Fields ,
Osgood & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's edition of
Thackeray	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 475 Duals , and each eopf is nambered and enclosed in a neat ease .

		It sboald form a rare prize to collectors .

		The bringing together of a great collection of European paintings , scnlptares , and objeU d'art in the Fine Art Loan Collection of the
Glasgow Inter	LOCATION	- national Exposition of
1901	DATE	.

		gave Mr.
D. S. Mac	PERSON	- Coll the opportunity he has made inch good use of in his '' Nineteenth Century Art '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This handsome folio has for its letter-press a long and searching historical criticism of painting and sculp - ture during the century just closed , the numerous full-page illastrations being taken from the exam - ples on view during the Exposition .

		Hardly a great name among the moderns is neglected , either by the text or pictures .

		The painters are arranged in schools , chapter by chapter , as far as possible , the question of nationality not entering into considera - tion at all except where a school has risen and per - sists in a single nation .

		Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	is the only American artist mentioned at length , and the
United States	LOCATION	are not considered in any aspect .

		Though an impression mast remain that Mr.
MacCoU	PERSON	has attempted to cover too much in a single volume containing no great amount of reading matter , his work is nevertheless conscientious and painstaking , and is informed with a practical knowledge of both French and English art .

		The illustrations , num - bering not less than a hundred plates , many of them photogravures of exceptional quality , form a most interesting collection .

		The beautiful typography and binding also call for a word of praise .

		A more - desirable gift for an art-loving friend could hardly be found among this season 's publications .

		Mr.
E	PERSON	^ gar
Mayhew Bacon	ORGANIZATION	has written an inter - esting account of '' The Hudson from Ocean to Source '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		He considers his subject from three points of view : as important because of its history , for the legends that cluster about it , and for its picturesque scenery .

		The mat `` rial is ar - ranged chronologically in part , and in part it follows the course of the stream northward .

		The story of the growth of the modern city of
New York	LOCATION	is of course excluded , as being a history in itself ; but the struggles and achievements of the Dutch settlers , as well as of the adventurous spirits who pushed their way northward into the wilderness are narrated interestingly , in detail .

		Over one hundred illastra - tions depict scenes along the river .

		In a two-volume edition , bound in white and gold ,
Messrs. G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons reprint the original
Moxon	PERSON	folio edition of
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Idylls of the King . ''

		with its thirty beautiful Ulnstratiotis by
Gustove Dor ^	ORGANIZATION	.

		Four of the • ' Idylls '' -- '
• Enid	PERSON	, '' ''
Vivien	PERSON	, '' ''
Elaine	PERSON	, '' and • • Guinevere '' -- are here included .

		The paper and typography are unusually attractive , and the photogravure reproductions are marrellous approximations to the original engrav - ings .

		The book will be a rare treasure to the lover of artistic editions . ''

		Songs of Two Centuries '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is the title given to a new book of poems by Mr.
Will Carleton	PERSON	, ` written , as the name suggests , in the last years of the nineteenth and the first of the twentieth eentorj , and dedicated to the memory of the one and the success of the other .

		The poems are grouped under snb-titles , a citation of which will serve to show how varied is the contents of the volume .

		There are '' Songs of Months and Days , '' • ' Songs of Home Life , '' of the
Rivers	PERSON	and the
Mountains	LOCATION	, of the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	, of Pleasure and Pain .

		Some are written in the quaint dialect which we associate with Mr.
Carleton	PERSON	, others are in more serious vein and mora conventional English .

		The volume is liberally illus - trated from original drawings and photographs .

		Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	's well known poem `` An Old Sweetheart of Mine '' is now published by the
Bowen-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a holiday edition , with Mr.
Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	's illustrations in del - icate color , and tinted subordinate decorations by
Miss Virginia	LOCATION	Keep .

		The poem , as published hith - erto in Mr.
Riley	PERSON	's works , has contained only eleven stanzas , though the audiences that have heard the writer 's public recitation of his lines have been able to realize that the spoken version had a rocmd eighteen stanzas .

		The missing seven are now for the first time allowed to appear in print .

		Mr.
Christy	PERSON	's pictures follow closely the sentiment of the poem , and Miss Keep 's floral wreaths are daintily conceived and colored .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	have this year added a selec - tion from the poems of Shelley to their '' Endymioa Series . ''

		As in the
Keats	PERSON	volume in the same serial , Prof.
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	has written the introduction and Mr.
Robert Anning Bell	PERSON	has abundantly de - corated and illostrated the book , and designed the cover and end-papers .

		Mr.
Bell	PERSON	's symbolic draw - ings are evidently intended as a beautiful setting suggested by the poetry , rather than as intellectual interpretations of it .

		They are wholly in harmony with
Shelley	PERSON	's strange , evasive spirit , and lend new charm to the lyrics that make up the bulk of this selection . ''

		In re-writing these volumes , '' says
Hawthorne	PERSON	in his preface to '' The Marble Faun , '' '' the author was somewhat surprised to see the extent to which he had introduced descriptions of various Italian objects , antique , pictorial , and statuesque . ''

		It is this strongly marked Roman setting that has been farther emphasized by sixteen half-tone illastra - tions in the new ''
Luxembourg	LOCATION	'' edition -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- of this , the most popular of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's romances .

		An introduction by Miss
Katharine Lee Bates	PERSON	also calls attention to the close relation between the de - scriptive element in the romance and the jottings of the '' Italian Note-books . ''

		The present edition is printed on good paper , and handsomely and durably boand in scarlet and gold . ''

		The Social Comedy '' is a handsome quarto vol - ume , containing over a hundred line and half-tone drawings .

		It is issued by the Life Pablishing Com - pany , and the pictures are representative of the sort of clever and genial satire on the seamy side of polite society , for which `` Life '' is famous .

		The drawings are carefully printed on heavy coated 476 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, paper , and the artistic red and gold binding is in keeping with the contents of the book .

		That ever-flowering yew d'esprit of the Reverend
Richard Barham	PERSON	's , '' The Ingoldsby Legends ; or , Mirth and
Marvel	ORGANIZATION	, by
Thomas Ingoldsby	PERSON	,
Esquire	ORGANIZATION	, '' has been reprinted in delightful form by
John Lane	PERSON	, with scores of humorously interpretive illus - trations by Mr.
Herbert Cole	PERSON	.

		The volume , bound in red with a delectable cover design stamped in gold , contains the prefaces to the first and second editions , the three series of legends in both prose and verse complete , and the miscellaneous poems added for good measure .

		Growing interest in Franciscan studies is attested by the publication of the fourth edition of '' The Lady Poverty '' -LRB-
Tennant & Ward	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as translated and edited by Mr.
Montgomery Carmichael	PERSON	.

		This quaint little mediaeval allegory of St.
Francis	PERSON	's de - votion to poverty is here translated into simple and stately English , often Biblical but never disagreeably archaic , which preserves all the freshness and reality that the story must have had for its unknown author .

		A photogravure reproduction of Giotto 's ''
Espous	PERSON	- als of St.
Francis	PERSON	to the Lady Poverty '' is given as a frontispiece .

		In its very attractive typography and tasteful binding , this dainty volume holds a promi - nent place among the inexpensive gift-books of the season .

		Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's tale of '' The Lane That Had No Turning , '' which , when first published , gave the title to a volume of short stories , is now printed separately in holiday dress , with decorations and illustrations by Mr.
Frank E. Schoonover	PERSON	.

		Besides the end-papers and numerous head and tail-pieces , there are seven full-page half-tone plates , illustra - ting as many dramatic moments in the story .

		The cover is very artistic , with its delicate fawn ground - work , green lettering , and dainty picture of Made - linette among the apple blossoms .

Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Mr.
Harper Pennington	PERSON	has made eight illustra - tions in color for the new edition of Mrs.
Nancy Huston Banks	PERSON	's popular novel , '' Oldfield '' -LRB- Mac - millan Co. -RRB- .

		The drawings are quaint , but rather too highly colored , and scarcely dainty or delicate enough to fit the Cranford-like quality of the Old - field ladies ; so that it is doubtful if they add much to the reader 's enjoyment of this very charming old-time romance .

		The typography of the volume is excellent , and the cover artistic in color and design .

		Magazine readers will remember Mr.
W. D. Ellwanger	PERSON	's graceful lyrics , some of which are now collected in an entertaining volume under the title '' A Summer Snowflake and Drift of Other Verse and Song '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		With wide margins and illuminated initials the pages present an attractive appearance .

		There is a frontispiece by Mr.
A. B. Wenzell	PERSON	; and a snowflake design on the cover gives the book a holiday air .

		Two popular illustrators .

		Miss
Jessie Willcox Smith	PERSON	and Miss
Elizabeth Shippen Green	PERSON	, have col - laborated in the preparation of a charming calendar called '' The Child , '' issued by Mr.
Charles W. Beck , Jr.	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		There are seven large-sized pictures in colors , representing quaint little folk amusing themselves appropriately to the various seasons .

		The color-printing is remarkably good , and altogether this is perhaps the most artistic and attractive of the calendars for the coming year .

		In this busy age we no longer write journals for our descendants to gloat over , but diaries are still a necessity , and for the new woman quite as much as for her brother man .

		The special features of the '' Lest We Forget '' Standard Diary for

Diary Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are clearly set forth on the title page , where it is said to be '' A Book for Ladies ' Use , in which to record Memoranda , Engagements , etc. , with special pages for

		The Cynic 's Calendar of Revised Wisdom for
1903	DATE	'' -LRB-
Elder & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an amusing booklet constituting a calendar and memorandum combined , with scarlet page-borders and daily -- or rather weekly -- food in the form of familiar proverbs revised in the interests of the cynic . ''

		Many are called but few get up , '' '' Economy is the thief of time , '' '' As you sew , so must you rip , '' '' A word to the wise is resented , '' '' Pride will have a Fall bon - net , '' '' God gives us our relatives -- thank God we can choose our friends , '' are a few crumbs of the delicious '' wisdom , '' which we are all of us cynics enough to enjoy .

		The checked gingham cover is unique .

		The '' Love Poems of
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	, '' edited by Mr.
Frederic Chapman	PERSON	, is the latest volume in the `` Lover 's Library '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In decoration it is uniform with the rest of the miniature series : there is a dainty violet pattern in gold on the purple cover , and marginal designs of violets , rings , and true-lover 's knots .


Herrick	PERSON	's love-note is unique and charming , and his lyrics seem especially appro - priate , by virtue of their light touch and playful fancy , for inclusion in the tiny gift-books of this charming series .

		Unusual both in subject-matter and make-up is '' A Balloon Ascension at Midnight '' -LRB-
Elder & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
George Eli Hall	PERSON	.

		It is an au - thentic account of the author 's first balloon trip , made from
Paris	LOCATION	, in
June , 1901	DATE	, in company with a venturesome young Frenchman .

		The story is tersely and vividly written , from the artist 's , not the scientist 's , point of view ; and Mr.
Gordon Ross	PERSON	has drawn a series of silhouettes in color , which empha - size both the wierd and the humorous phases of the adventure .

		Messrs.

Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , and makes the story interesting to boys by associating two youthful eoosins with the history of that heroic victim of the white man 's perfidy .

		Mr.

		A Confederate colonel braves capture as a spy to keep a promise to his children at
Christmastide	LOCATION	, and falls in the bands of a federal general who has little ones of his own at home .

		But the small rebel who understands his father 's plight makes it possible for him to avoid the accusation of being in the enemy 's ranks out of uniform .

Hervey White	PERSON	, hitherto known as a novelist of decided but sombre power , puts his lit - erary past behind him to write ''
Noll	PERSON	and the Fairies '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- , a most amusing bit of imaginative writing for which the tender infancy of
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	affords a basis .

		Not only is it written in sparkling prose , but there are numerous bits of interpolated verse , some of it purposely nonsensical , but all charming .

		What is more astonishing than these , however , is Mr.

Seymour Lucas	PERSON	and
Miss Eveline Lance	PERSON	make the volume a most attrac - tive one .

		In '' The Animals ' Rebellion '' -LRB- Button -RRB- Mr.
Clifton Bingham	PERSON	tells in rhyme of the manner in which the Tiger , the
Brown Bear	PERSON	, and the
Wolf	PERSON	set about overthrowing the throne of
King Leo	PERSON	, and the way the charge of the Giraffe cavalry upset all their hopes at the critical moment .

		Most elaborate and amusing are the colored pictures by Mr.
C. H. Thomson	PERSON	which illus - trate the verses .

		-- Last year Mr.
L. J. Bridgman	PERSON	pro- vided both text and illustrations for '' Guess , '' in which riddles of the kind children dearly love were asked on one page and answered when the leaf was turned .

		This same idea he has expanded in '' Guess Again '' -LRB-
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with results equally happy .

		Especially witty are the end papers , showing the '' Conun-Brnm Corps '' on parade .

		-- Curious little creatures , not unlike Mr.
Palmer Cox	PERSON	's brownies , are busy in the pages of '' Kewts '' -LRB-
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , also the invention of Mr.
L. J. Bridgman	PERSON	.

		The Kewts are sent to visit all the states and territories of the Union by their inventor , and a page is devoted to a rhymed account of the in - dustries they discover under way in each of the com - monwealths they visit , with a picture showing them in the act of inspection or participation .

		The idea is both ingenious and instructive .

		Notes . ''

		The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' with a preface by Mr.
Austin Bobson	PERSON	and illustrations by Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	, is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a pretty and inex - pensive holiday edition .

		Two new preprints from the
Becennial Publications of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	are as follows : '' The Lecithans , '' by Mr.
Waldemar Koch	PERSON	; and '' Studies in Popular Poetry , '' by Mr.
Philip Schuyler Allen	PERSON	.

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a '' Mental Arith - metic '' prepared for elementary schools by Mr.
I. C. McNeill	PERSON	.

		A '' List of Books for
High School Libraries of the State of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, '' prepared under the direction of State Superintendent
L. B. Harvey	PERSON	, is a publication that will be welcomed by schools everywhere .

		The titles number about sixteen hundred and are intelli - gently annotated , the work making a volume of nearly five hundred pages . ''

		The Sources of
Plutarch 's Life of Cicero	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Pro- fessor
Alfred Gudeman	PERSON	, is a recent publication of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Tom
Grogan	PERSON	'' and '' Gondola Bays '' make up the fifth and sixth volumes of the new uniform edition of Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's writings .

		The Messrs.
Scrib	PERSON	- ner are the publishers . ''

		Greek Myths in English Bress , '' edited by Pro- fessor
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	, Jr. , is a small volume for school use made up from
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Kingsley	PERSON	, and Bnlfinch , and published by tbe
Globe School Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		That old-time favorite , '' The Lamplighter , '' by
Maria Susanna Cummings	PERSON	, is issued in a new edition by
Messrs. Hongbton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An interesting '' publishers ' note '' tells something of the author and the history of her book . ''

		The Poems of
Ovid	LOCATION	, '' edited by Professor
Charles Wesley Bain	PERSON	, form a volume in
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's `` Latin Series . ''

		There are nearly two hundred pages of selected text , and a copious apparatus of notes and vocabulary .

		Miss
Ella M. Sexton	PERSON	's '' Stories of
California	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Mae - millan -RRB- are told in simple language , and are addressed to a youthful audience .

		They relate not only to the early history of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, but also to its industrial de - velopment , and are well illustrated .

		Messrs.
Tennant & Ward	ORGANIZATION	are tbe publishers of three practical handbooks upon certain phases of the art of photography .

		Their respective subjects are '' The Lens , '' `` Finishing the Negative , '' and `` Photographic Appar - atus . ''

		Mr. -LRB- reorge # .

		Brown is the author of all three books . ''

		An Elementary Commercial Geography , '' by Mr.
Cyrus C. Adams	PERSON	, published by
Messrs. B. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a response to the growing need of books for in - struction in the commercial courses of our high schools .

		It is abundantly illustrated with maps and photographs . ''

		The Splendid Idle Forties '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	, is a revised and enlarged edition of the volume of stories originally entitled '' Before the Gringo Came . ''

		There are also illustrations , and they are of a sort that tempt one to search the text to find out what they represent The '' Stories in Stone from the Roman Forum '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which Miss
Isabel Loveli	PERSON	has prepared for young students of ancient history , presents in simple and readable form some of the results of recent archs - ological work in the great city .

		It is an excellent piece of work , and teachers will find it very helpful .

		A reprint of
Clarence King	PERSON	's '' Mountaineering in the
Sierra Nevada	LOCATION	, '' which comes from the Messrs.
Scrib	PERSON	- ner , will be welcome to many readers .

		This fascinating work was first published in
1871	DATE	, but was soon there - after withdrawn from the market by tbe author , who wished to correct it in certain particulars , a task which he never found time to perform .

		The extraordinary vitality of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's `` French Rev - olution '' is attested by the new editions that appear with great frequency .

		No year has passed of late in which one or more such reprints have not found their way to our table .

		The three-volume edition just pub - lished by tbe Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	is , however , much more than a reprint .

		It is tbe edition of a competent histor - ical scholar , Mr.
C. R. L. Fletcher	PERSON	, who has provided it with many maps and plans , and also with the critical 480 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, apparatus of notes which are absolutely necessary for the reader whose intent is historical as well as literary .

		The set is included in ''
Putnam	PERSON	's Library of Standard Literature , '' favorably known by several other reprints . ''

		From the Old World to the New , '' by Miss Mar - guerite
Stockman Dickson	PERSON	, is a book for children in elementary schools .

		It deals with the period of early American exploration and settlement , and has a great many pictures of a kind calculated to attract the child - ish interest .

		It is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The American Jewish Year Book '' for
5663	DATE	, edited by Dr.
Cyrus Adler	PERSON	for the
Jewish Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, is chiefly devoted to information concerning the Jewish organizations of the country .

		Its special features include articles on '' The Jewish Population of
Maryland	LOCATION	'' and '' The History of the Jews in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Miss
Katharine Preseott Wormeley	PERSON	has undertaken to translate the '' Impressions de Voyage '' that
Alex	PERSON	- andre
Dumas	PERSON	produced in such profusion during the earlier part of his career , and the first volume of this venture , '' The Speronara , '' is now at hand from
Messrs. Little	ORGANIZATION	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		May it speedily be fol - lowed by all the others ! ''

		How to Live , '' by the Rev.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	, is a series of fifteen papers prepared for Chautauquans a number of years ago .

		These little homilies on the conduct of life are characterized by Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's well known practical sense and felicity of phrasing .

		They are now collected into a volume which is published by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Condensations of standard works do not as a rule meet with our favor , but we are willing to make an exception in the case of `` A Short Life of Abraham Lincoln , '' just published by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a single - volume edition of the ten-volume work by Messrs.
Nicolay	PERSON	and Hay , the abridgment having been made by Mr.
John G. Nicolay	PERSON	.

		The complete work is so much more than a mere biography , that the present condensation is not only justifiable but even praise - worthy .

		Even now there are nearly six hundred pages of the biography , which ought to be enough for the majority of readers .

		The volume of '' Select Translations from Old Eng - lish Poetry '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- which has been edited by Messrs.
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	and
Chauncy B. Tinker	PERSON	, presents a se - lected series of versions , partly familiar and partly made for the present work , from the literature created by those men who were English poets centuries before
Chaucer	PERSON	was born .

		The selections are typical , and cover a wide range of theme and literary form .

		Beo - wulf is represented by a few brief extracts , the battles of Rounanbush and Maldon are given in full , there are many passages from the Csedmon ,
Andreas	LOCATION	, and
Elene	PERSON	manuscripts , and lyrics both secular and religious .

		A very fair notion of the body of old English poetry is thus given within a brief compass , and the book will prove a boon to both special students and general readers .

		The '' Nonsense Anthology '' -LRB- Soribner -RRB- of Miss
Caro	PERSON	-
lyn Wells	PERSON	is a book that will bring joy to both young and old .

		Miss Wells has an appreciation of fooling that is not a common attribute of her sex , and a sense of humor that is exemplified by many delightful produc - tions of her own .

		In making the selections for the present volume she has shown excellent judgment and a wide acquaintance with the special sort of verse that is concerned .

		She gives us examples from a wide range of authors , including several seventeenth century examples , and coming down through
Lear	PERSON	, ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	, '' and
Gilbert	PERSON	to such whimsical writers of to - day as Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	and Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	- Macaronic verse is also illustrated , and there is a clever Latin version of '' Jabberwockey '' called '' Mors labrochii . ''

		This is anonymous , and , in fact , the num - ber of anonymous pieces included is noticeably large .

		There is also an excellent profusion of '' Limericks . ''

		Professor
Hjalmar Edgren	PERSON	, having given us , with the collaboration of Professor
Percy Burnet	PERSON	, one of the best of modern French and English dictionaries , now comes forward with '' An Italian and English Dictionary '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , which he has prepared with the help of Dr.
Giuseppe Bico	PERSON	and Mr.
John L. Gerig	PERSON	.

		Such a work as this was greatly needed , and is -LRB- unlike its French com - panion -RRB- practically without a rival .

		Although not an etymological dictionary , sufficient attention is given to etymology to satisfy the needs of the ordinary student , and English cognates , when not perfectly obvious , are emphasized by being given in small capitals .

		Pronun - ciation is indicated by subscript signs , and accentuation is carefully marked .

		The vocabulary is large , and in - cludes such obsolete forms as the student is likely to meet with in the older classics .

		From now ^ on every facility of our retail department -- every convenience and assistance that w ^ e can offer -- is at the entire disposal of customers who are engaged in the perplexing selection of books for holiday presen - tation .

		Patrons from out of town will appreciate the comfortable reading-room where catalogues may be consulted , books examined , letters written , or appoint - ments kept as desired .

		In regard to the desirability of books as Christmas gifts , nothing else is likely to give the same amount of pleasure at a relative cost .

		And it may be added that never before has the array of holiday books been so beautiful , so varied , and so altogether attractive from every standpoint .

		This is particularly true of the books for young people , which seem to have been the subject of special eflort on the part of the publishers this season .

		The difficulties which confront the people of the
United States	LOCATION	in the administration of their new insular possessions render this work especially timely and useful .

		Its chief aims , throughout , are to cast light on the great Philippine problem -- by miking accessible to the reading public the history of those Islands , both religious and secular , and showing the character , customs , and beliefs of tbe native peoples who inhabit them , -- and thereby to furnish in a thoroughly and scholarly manner and at a reasonable price the sources of Philippine History . ''

		This publication is very highly to be commended , as , in the confused state of current information upon the conditions in our insular dependencies , evidence direct from unimpeachable sources is of the greatest importance .

		The American people realises its responsibility , but is at a loss to know what should be done , as so much uncertainty exists as to the conditions . ''
