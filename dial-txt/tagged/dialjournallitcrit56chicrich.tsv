		32 A NOVELIST ON HIS ART .

		`` An author always talks badly about his work , and positively the best thing he can do , once his creation has been accomplished and given to the public , is to keep quiet . ''

		Quoting these words from the younger
Dumas	PERSON	, Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	, in '' The
Yale Review	ORGANIZATION	, '' disre - garding the quoted counsel just as
Dumas	PERSON	him - self disregarded it , proceeds to discuss the problem of the novelist , as it presents itself to the American practitioner of the art of fiction .

		The essay is entitled '' The Background of the American Novel , '' and discusses , as the title suggests , `` not technique nor literary faiths , but the larger phenomena of our common social life , which must irresistibly determine the product of any serious American novelist . ''

		It is with the '' outer sphere of the novelist 's experience , rather than his inner spiritual reactions '' that Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	is concerned , for he conceives of his function as being `` not to entertain , not to preach a moral , but to realize our world for us , to make us see and feel what we are too dull or too preoccupied to realize for ourselves , in order that we may live vicariously in that larger life that we know exists , albeit beyond our feeble sight . ''

		In thus restricting himself to the secondary aspects of his work , and in refraining from an exhibition of '' the very pulse of the machine , '' Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	takes the ground that the novelist 's '' inner spiritual reactions '' are better set forth in the works themselves than by any labored experiment in self-analysis . ''

		The deepest quality of a work of art , '' says Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, `` will always be the quality of the mind of the producer , '' and the novelist who speaks only of his `` background '' leaves the most vital characteristics of his art undisclosed .

		`` After all / ' says Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, `` the use of the materials of any art depends upon the man who employs them . ''

		And Brunetire , to similar effect , says : ''
Quelle	ORGANIZATION	que soit la formule , il n ' y a jamais au fond des oeuvres que ce que les homines y mettent . ''

		But the novelist , writing about his art , may hardly be held to the demand that he exhibit his soul in the discussion ; he is quite justified in leaving the body of his artistic production to make that showing for him , and to discourse chiefly upon the external influences 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	that condition his work , as Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	does in this highly thoughtful and suggestive essay .

		The principal difficulty of the American novelist , seeking to present the body of the time in his country , its form and pressure , is that of not being able to see the woods for the trees .

		The foreign observer , superficial after the manner of the vacation tourist , or sourly flippant after the superior manner of the
Satur	PERSON	- day Reviewer , knows nothing of the trees , but thinks that he has descried the contour of the woods clearly enough for characterization .

		But this is sheer delusion , for no one can know the real nature of the woods unless , like Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	, he has lived in them long enough to make the individual trees his familiars .

		And , abandon - ing the metaphor , no novelist can deal typically with American life unless he has observed it at close range at so many points that no essential element is missing from his synthesis .

		Now to qualify in this way means a task of appalling magnitude , well calculated to fill with despair the most enterprising explorer .

		To coordinate the physical , social , and spiritual facts of our complex civilization is a task so gigantic that it would baffle the powers of a Tourguenieff or a
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		No wonder that many of our best novelists have given up the attempt , and con - fine themselves to studies in genre and local peculiarity .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	makes us see this difficulty very clearly , and yet he feels also , as most of us do , that there is a '' permanent Americanism in the more or less marked provincialism of our peo - ple , not merely in character but in ideas , occu - pation , blood relationships , even in speech . ''

		He has a great deal to say about the physical background of our life , and emphasizes its wide diversities .

		`` A New Englander , emerging from his Pullman in
Louisiana	LOCATION	or
Arizona	LOCATION	or
Montana	LOCATION	, to take a few scattered instances , can not recognize anything in these strange land - scapes in common with his own rocky pastures and thin meadows .

		An Englishman or a French - man even an Italian under similar circum - stances could never be totally at a loss in any corner of his own land . ''

		If our landscape is thus lacking in a distinctive individuality , still more is it lacking in the sort of human quality which the novelist needs for his inspiration .

		It is because of this poverty that the appeal to '' See America First '' will always sound hollow to the ears of anyone who has seen anything of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		`` As one passes over the surface of
Europe	LOCATION	, no matter how hastily , one is aware of a human quality in the fields , the roads , the water courses , above all in the kind of hous - ing men have made for themselves on their soil .

		Here is a mother earth that has been lived upon by her children for generations ; and through the forces of human contact after cen - turies of war and peace , birth and death and change , she has come to have an individual expression of her own , subtly reflecting the character of her human children .

		There is little of this sort of thing in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The face of nature , no longer , alas , virginal , even in our far western states , has not yet achieved a distinguished maturity , although the soil may have been ploughed for a number of generations . ''

		It is all the difference between the English hedge and the barbed wire fencing of
Texas	LOCATION	, between the mellow thatched cottage of the German village and the crude structure of clapboards and shingles that strikes so dis - cordant a note in our rural landscape .

		These things are of immense consequence to the nove - list , for `` landscape is an important element in every deeply imaginative picture of life .

		It is much more than mere setting for certain char - acters ; it is that outer physical world in which they move , penetrating and interpreting them , part of their subconscious being .

		So Hardy rendered his background , also
Tolstoi	PERSON	, to take but two notable modern instances . ''

		Failing inspiration from landscape , the American novelist perforce directs his attention to those disfigurements of nature which most of our cities are , and what he sees there is anything but encouraging .

		For `` our intensely modern cities are , at least externally and in mass , un - deniably ugly sprawling , uncomposed , dirty , and noisy .

		With their slovenly approaches , their needless crowding , they express the indus - trial greed and uncoordinated social necessities of a rapidly multiplying and heterogeneous peo - ple . ''

		It is the city which provides the dreadful annual spectacle of `` moving day , '' `` with its horrors of crumbling possessions and decaying self-respect . ''

		This national institution tends to obliterate the more intimate individualities that are the result of slow growth in a settled environ - ment , and that have always offered the imagi - native creator his finest human material . ''

		The suburb does not alleviate matters very much , for , although it '' may well be the social salvation of
America	LOCATION	, it is surely its aesthetic purgatory . ''

		As the scene of super-luxurious life , the city has supplied the commercial novelist with a theme '' which is quite foreign to the experience of the majority of readers and , we may suspect , to that of the writers themselves . ''

		From these , and
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL other facts , Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	draws the sweeping conclusion that `` never has an American city got itself expressed imaginatively as have Lon - don and
Paris	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		Having thus exhibited the poverty of the American background of fiction in its threefold aspect of `` the physical scene , the city of tradi - tion , the developed external civilization of a unified people '' Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	comes to '' the core of the matter , '' which is that our real back - ground is '' human society in a larger freer sense than the world has ever known . ''

		Here at last is a gleam of light , and our writer 's message is to urge that the novelist seize this '' unique rich field of our opportunity . ''

		Our fiction should become primarily psychological , and give up the futile effort to follow in the foot - steps of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	. ''

		Ours is the most complex human ferment the world has ever seen .

		Strong peoples are still fighting within as for the mastery of a great , enormously rich country , which thus far remains no man 's land and every man 's , where ideas are being re - formed with a bewildering rapidity that seems to the more archaic American a sure indication of decay .

		But it is just this ferment , this capacity for absorbing and re-making ideas and ideals that constitutes our hope and incidentally furnishes the imagination with fruitful matter to work upon .

		Ours should be a literature of ideas and ideals a literature of the mind as well as of the primary emotions . ''

		Here is an inspiring motive , and we must add that Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	, albeit with too little patience and too much bitterness , has placed himself in the front rank of those who practice what he here preaches with so much force and insight .

		A NEGLECTED AMERICAN POET .

		All American poets are neglected , but `` the iniquity of oblivion '' that `` blindly scattereth her poppy '' has been perhaps busier over the grave of
Thomas Buchanan	PERSON	Read than over those of most of his mates and rivals .

		Yet during the Civil War his patriotic lyrics thrilled the country ; and
Murdoch	PERSON	, the elocutionist , toured the land reciting them and reading `` The Wagoner of the Alleghanies . ''

		As Read wistfully put it in the preface to this poem : `` The gratifying fact remains with the writer , that it has been instrumental , in the hands of Mr.
Murdoch	PERSON	, of putting no inconsiderable sums of money into the treasuries of sanitary committees , thereby benefiting the sick and wounded who have suffered in our country 's cause . ''

		He himself , apparently , received neither profit or advancement for his literary work .

		In one of his strongest and most beautiful lyrics , `` The Singer , '' he seems to speak of himself with proud bitterness , recounting what he had done for his country and his return for the service : '' His war songs fired the battle host , His mottoes on their banners burned ; , And when the foe had fled the coast , Wild with his songs the troops returned .

		Then at the feast 's triumphal board , His thrilling music cheered the wine ; But when the singer asked reward , They pointed to the herds and swine . ' ''

		Read served on the staff of General
Lew Wallace	PERSON	, under
Rosecrans	PERSON	; so that the blare of cannon and flash of sabre , which sound and glitter through so much of his verse , were more than a poet 's dream .

		He made his living by painting , ranging from signs in the beginning up to battle scenes and ideal pieces .

		He painted the portraits of many distinguished men , including President
Harrison	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Browning	PERSON	.

		Read was born in
Chester County	LOCATION	, near
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		It is remarkable how many champions of poetry and art this corner of our country , domi - nated by
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	influence , has sent forth .

James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, our greatest creator of character ;
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, our first all-round man , explorer , poet , novelist , scholar , and diplomatist ;
Charles Godfrey Leland	PERSON	, the creator of ''
Hans Breit	PERSON	- man , '' the best translator of
Heine	PERSON	, the father of manual training in this country ;
Benjamin West	LOCATION	, who at least achieved a great place in art ;
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, the master-etcher of our age , all these were born in or near
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		With the excep - tion of Read and
Leland	LOCATION	, they were all of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	blood ; but it is needless to state that this efflorescence of genius , inside or outside their fold , has always been without the will or consent of the Quakers themselves .

		They have set their faces like flints against any intrusion of literary or artistic fame within their precincts .

		We have not a word to say against the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	doctrine , which is a high and beautiful mysticism ; but , working on ordinary human nature , it seems capable of creating more whited sepulchres than any other creed ever known .

		Buchanan Read sang the praises of wine perhaps more liberally than any modern poet .

		We do not in the least know whether this was a mere poetic instinct , or a reflex from his own life ; but it has been made a reproach against him .

		In this connec - tion we are reminded of a story told us by an old gentleman , himself of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	blood .

		He was visit - ing a relation in
Kennett Square	LOCATION	, where at that time
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	also lived .

		The first morning , after breakfast , his
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	host drew him mysteriously aside and unlocking a cupboard brought out a bottle of whiskey , with the remark : `` Of course I do n't let ihe boys know I keep this stuff , but men like you and I need it occasionally . ''

		His guest drank and went outdoors , where one of the sons beckoned him into the barn , and from some recess produced another 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	bottle of whiskey , saying : `` Father does n't approve of this sort of a thing , but a young fellow must have it once in a while . ''

		Strolling about the place , my informant met the other son , who took him into the wood , and , out of a hollow tree , produced a third similar bottle , with a third similar speech .

		So my polite friend had to accept three drinks of whiskey in one morning , from a family which was probably among those who hounded
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	out of
Kennett Square	LOCATION	because he had wine and beer served at his table .

		Read 's poetry secured many verdicts of the high - est note during his lifetime .

		President
Lincoln	PERSON	kept `` The Patriot 's Oath '' in his pocket-book .

		The Brownings appreciated and encouraged him .

		Coventry
Patmore	PERSON	called him '' the only real poet
America	LOCATION	has had . ''


Longfellow	PERSON	said of `` The New Pastoral '' : '' It is full of beauty and people will turn to it as to pure
spring	DATE	water . ''

		Leigh Hunt wrote in the '' North British Review '' : '' We know of no other American poet , with the doubtful excep - tion of
Edgar Poe	PERSON	, having so much real feeling as is shown in some of Mr.
Read	PERSON	's verses . ''

		And of the poem , '' The Closing Scene , '' Hunt wrote : '' This is unquestionably the best American poem we have met with ; indeed , it is with one or two exceptions , the only American poem we have read , or could read , over again .

		It is an addition to the permanent stock of poetry in the English language , and is worth the whole album of ' Excel - siors ' and ` Psalms of Life , ' and other such attempted moralities , which are abundantly supplied to an applauding public on this and the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Tennyson himself , the great modern master of that kind of description which employs the objects of outward nature as a language of human feeling , has scarcely surpassed , in its way , this poem , which , in our opinion , merits the fame that Gray 's celebrated elegy has obtained without deserving it near so well . ''

		Read wrote of his poem , `` The New Pastoral '' : `` I know that I have attempted a great theme in fact the greatest theme left for an American to do .

		My plot sweeps the face of the country from
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania to the prairies . ''

		It is a fact that our early American writers came into a great inheritance .

		They lived on the edge of civilization ; the forest was at their doors , the prairies and the mountains beyond .

		The Indian and the backwoodsman , two of the most picturesque figures of modern life , wan - dered still into the cities .

		Every cigar-store had before it the wooden effigy of a child of the forest .

		Our beautiful clipper ships bore musical Indian names , and Indian warriors or maidens furnished the models for their figure-heads .

		And our first men of letters thoroughly appreciated this material .

		Prescott and Parkman in history , Irving and .

		Cooper in the tale and novel ,
Bryant	PERSON	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	in poetry , all realized the past and passing life in
America	LOCATION	.

		A multitude of lesser writers all dealt with American origins and primitives .

		We name as the first that come to our mind the records of
Clark	PERSON	's expedition , Abbot 's '' Hoaryhead and
McDonough	PERSON	, '' and
Frank Forester	PERSON	's hunting sketches and tales .

		Some day all this literature will be revived , and the world will be surprised to find out how good it is .

		Among the rest , Read 's '' New Pastoral '' will certainly have a high place .

		To-day , when even poetic readers decline to look into
Wordsworth	PERSON	's '' Prelude '' or '' Excursion , '' a blank verse poem of five thousand lines of somewhat similar type is hardly likely to attract .

		Read in his fidelity to somewhat prosaic circumstance is often as dull as
Wordsworth	PERSON	dared to be , and his poem lacks the passages of solid grandeur and sublime revela - tion which the recorder of the English Lakes was capable of giving .

		But Read 's material is more novel and interesting , and there is much freshness , beauty , and charm in his verse .

		The poem was published in
1854	DATE	; and , at a time when
Chicago	LOCATION	hardly existed and Lincoln was unheard of , Read made a daring prophecy of both .

		The passage is too long for com - plete quotation , but we condense it : '' Here shall the city spread its noisy streets , And groaning steamers chafe along its wharves : While hourly o'er the plain , with streaming plumes , Like a swift herald bringing news of peace , The rattling train shall fly ; and from the East Even from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the new found shores Where far
Pacific	LOCATION	rolls , in storm or rest , Washing his sands of gold the arrowy track Shall stretch its iron band through all the land .

		Here in the middle of the nation 's arms Perchance the mightiest inland mart shall
spring	DATE	.

		Here the great statesman from the ranks of toil
May	DATE	rise , with judgment clear , as strong as wise ; And with a well-directed patriot blow Reclench the rivets in our union bands Which tinkering knaves have striven to set ajar .

		; ' Surely that is hard to beat in vision and prescience .

		The story of the '' New Pastoral '' begins in a small agricultural community of
Eastern Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and follows the fortunes of a group of families which migrate westward .

		We do not believe that the life of the backwoodsman and pioneer settler has ever been more convincingly and admirably described . ''

		The Wagoner of the Alleghanies '' is all fire and spirit and action .

		The scene is laid in and about
Philadelphia	LOCATION	just before and at the time of the Rev - olution .

		It sweeps into its swift march the battles of the
Brandywine	ORGANIZATION	and
Germantown	LOCATION	, the Meschianza , the life in the stately manor houses and in the taverns and streets of the time .

		One reads it at a dash for the interest of the stories and characters , and then lingers again over it to enjoy its rich paintings of interiors and landscapes and to muse over its cadences and imagery .

		As a matter of fact , Read is always too profuse in fancy .

		He needed to have pondered over
Corinna	LOCATION	's advice to
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, to sow with the hand and not the sack .

		The poem , too , written in
Scott	LOCATION	's metre and with something of his manner , has undoubtedly a touch of the rococo in some of the scenes and incidents , a hint of
Ann Radcliffe	PERSON	.

		But it is thoroughly enjoyable , and we scarcely hesitate to say that it is the best narrative poem in our literature .

		To a world which does not love long poems , Read 's lyrical pieces will probably make the most instant and enduring appeal .

		We do not at all agree with
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	that `` The Closing Scene '' ought THE DIAL 9 to displace Gray 's '' Elegy '' in literature ; but it is a poein of grave and tranquil beauty and deep emo - tion .

		The enchanting lyric , '' Drifting , '' has been the most famous of Read 's works , except perhaps ''
Sheridan	PERSON	's Ride '' and one or two other of the war poems . ''

		The Brave at Home , '' one of the inter - spersed lyrics of `` The Wagoner , '' was at one time famous , and ought to be so again .

		`` The Appian Way '' is a stately and noble piece . ''

		My Her - mitage '' is one of the most perfectly and poignantly worded of his poems , and '' The Deserted Road '' has a touch of reality which brings the past before us in vision .

		`` The
Celestial Army	ORGANIZATION	'' does not fall far short of greatness .

		In view of the high praise Read has received , and the almost utter neglect which has befallen him , we feel some hesitation in essaying a verdict as to his final place in American literature .

		While every critic 's opinion must be more or less subjective , the comparative method is the only one which yields any hope of certainty .

		On the whole , then , we can not place him with our great triumvirate ,
Poe	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and
Bryant	PERSON	.

		They have a concentration which he lacks .

		Theirs is the imaginative word , the flashing phrase , which `` discovers continents yet unknown . ''

		But we think he is certainly the peer of any of the others , so much more widely known and accepted as some of them are .

		Pressed more closely to define his position , we should say that he is the spiritual and perhaps superior twin of Long - fellow .

		He has an equal affluence of fancy and grace of expression .

		He has more sensuousness in music and picture , a closer touch of reality .

		In originality of theme and treatment he is perhaps superior , the wings of
Europe	LOCATION	did not brood so closely over him .

		Rossetti , who disliked
Longfellow	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , clipped Read 's pieces from the newspapers , and said , `` They are as fine as any I know . ''

		He has a note of his own in lyrical poetry , a pervading purity , beauty , and emotional ring ; and in long narrative poems , in which , in fact , we in
America	LOCATION	have not too much to be proud of , he is unsurpassed .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A QUARTERLY REVIEW WITH THE COURAGE OF ITS TITLE , as well as that of its convictions , starts with the opening year under the name of `` The Unpopular Review '' -LRB- absit omen -RRB- and bearing the imprint of
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The peculiar title recalls the projected enterprise of a company of unsuccessful writers for unsympathetic periodicals who determined to endure no longer the repeated indignity of rejection slips , but to snap their fingers in the faces of unappreciative editors and start a magazine of their own ; and the plan would doubt - less have worked to admiration had it not been for the omission of one not quite negligible item , a suffi - cient working capital to launch and maintain the enterprise .

		But there is no reason to infer the same oversight in respect to the present undertaking .

		Its purpose is announced in a brief prospectus as '' the dissemination of some disagreeable truths , '' which will , it is expected , make the Review '' unpopular among that large majority of the public which is fond of the agreeable fallacies . ''

		Appealing thus to the wisely discerning minority -LRB- and who of us would not claim membership in this company of the elect ? -RRB-

		, the new quarterly will pay especial attention to `` economic and political matters , ... but all good interests are more or less directly allied , and when - ever its way touches general philosophy , rational religion , science , literature , and the arts , the Review will not be slow to gain from them variety as well as illumination , especially on the too frequent occa - sions when disagreeable truths should be told regard - ing them . ''

		Constructive , however , rather than de - structive , the new publication will strive to be ; `` and as , despite much that is false and ugly and evil , the world on the whole is true and beautiful and good , the general attitude will be optimistic spontane - ously , though cautiously , optimististic . ''

		Among other novel features , '' the names of the contributors will not be printed before the number next after that in which their contributions appear . ''

		Here is a chance for writers who have hitherto failed to achieve popularity to make a bold bid for a place among the Unpopular .

		... To MEN AND WOMEN OF THE PEN certain words spoken recently at
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	by Dr.
Talcott Williams	PERSON	, head of the Pulitzer school of journalism at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, will be of interest .

		Natu - rally the speaker 's remarks had especial reference to journalism , but they were often capable of broader application .

		`` Writing , '' he affirmed , `` all men delight to do .

		Men do not practice law or visit patients for nothing .

		Many men are glad to write for nothing .

		This competition the constant desire of men to affect their fellow-men in the interest of the work itself leads many men toward journal - ism and affects its material reward .

		This is , on the whole , lower than that of any other calling requiring the same ability , industry and effort . ''

		Although the writer 's real reward comes to him or her in some other form than that of money , as Dr.
Williams	PERSON	recognizes , it may be interesting to note the place he assigns to journalism in the scale of material compensation for the principal learned pro- fessions .

		`` In our American civilization , '' he says , `` the law is the best trade ; the doctor is the next best trade , taking in all cases the highest ranks of the calling ; the engineering manager comes next ; the rewards of the clergy are about those of the journalist .

		No man can enter the calling with the expectation that his pay will be large , that his work will be as well rewarded as that of other men , or that he will find himself increasing in his returns as he grows older . ''

		The possibility that journalism may prove to be the gateway to a larger field of literary activity , or to one on a higher plane , forms 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	with many eager aspirants no small part of its lure ; and it has indeed served as training school for a host of notable writers .

		A LIBRARY OF UNPUBLISHED BOOKS that is , books printed privately and never offered in open market to the vulgar passes , for a consideration , from the possession of Mr.
Bertram Dobell	PERSON	, who has been forty years in collecting it , to the appre - ciative custody of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		That there should be in the world of print so large a collection as fifteen hundred works , still-born and yet deemed worthy of a distinguished and discrimi - nating bibliophile 's cherishing care , is cause for some surprise ; but Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	is certainly not one to accumulate rubbish , even in unique editions , and this curious library of his gathering will repay examination when it is once on view in its new quarters .

		Too well known to need rehearsing here are his services to the world of letters , in researches concerning his favorite ,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	; in his be - friending of the ill-fated author of `` The City of Dreadful Night , '' whose poems he published in worthy form after their writer 's death ; and in his discovery of the seventeenth-century parson-poet ,
Thomas Traherne	PERSON	, whose manuscript writings his discerning eye saw to be literary treasures and his timely action saved from impending destruction .

		Traherne 's publisher , as well as
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's , he thus became , to the great indebtedness of at least a few connoisseurs .

		In the collection of books just trans - ferred to this country 's ownership , Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	had a library unmatched in the whole world , an assemblage of literary aristocrats that had held themselves so proudly aloof from the masses as to be for the most part unknown to librarians and dealers , and to rejoice in immunity from the vulgar advertisement of the catalogue and the trade-list .

		Whether this peculiar distinction was one worth striving for , may be debatable ; but that is another matter .

		`` THE LEAST OF ALL INTELLECTUAL EXERCISES , '' says Professor
Hardin Craig	PERSON	, of the
University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	, in a paper recently delivered before the
Minnesota Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, and now printed in '' Library Notes and News , '' the quarterly publica - tion of the
Public Library Commission of that State	ORGANIZATION	, is `` to sit and listen whether we take notes upon it or not to another 's speech .

		If it is well done , it gives the flattering illusion of thought to the hearers .

		They think they are thinking .

		Some - body else 's phrases delight them ; they make none of their own .

		What deeply permanent value beyond recreation can there be in hearing lectures on liter - ature , in a mere listening while somebody else says pleasant things about the English writers ? ''

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	long ago avowed that a lecture gave the listener nothing that he could not find in better form , and at less expense of time , in a book .

		Still , it is likely that most will agree in considering both Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	and Dr.
Craig	PERSON	too severe in their con - demnation .

		Lecturers do often present matter unob - tainable from other sources ; and if they entertain as well as edify , where is the harm ?

		Did not
New England	LOCATION	, the most intellectual section of our coun - try , originate the lyceum and its improving and stimulating course of lectures ?

		Was not
Emerson	PERSON	a lecturer , and did he not win hundreds , perhaps thousands , of disciples through his lectures ?

		And wherein is it worse to listen to the apt and cogent expression of thought , and to think one is thinking meanwhile , than to read the same thing in print , with the same accompanying illusion of intellectual activity ?

		No , the least of all intellectual exercises is not listening to lectures ; else how could we have lent so ready an ear to our
Minnesota	LOCATION	friend quoted above ?

		HOME READING FOR THE HIGH-SCHOOL PUPIL 18 the subject of a pamphlet issued by the
National Council of Teachers of English	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is , as the title - page announces , a `` Report of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	upon Home Reading , '' and it is inclusive enough to meet the needs of almost any boy or girl who has the usual number of high-school studies to master .

		The compilers announce that `` the list excludes books valuable only for the information conveyed .

		Books that merely give information , however needful , are not , in the opinion of the committee , books for home reading . ''

		Hence it is not surprising that `` fiction constitutes approximately half the list .

		This has seemed advisable , since it is through good fiction that most pupils are led to appreciate other forms .

		The number of suitable books outside fiction is , moreover , relatively small .

		In other departments the question is , ` What can we put in ? '

		In the de - partment of fiction , we find ourselves asking , ' What shall we leave out ? ''

		1 After the long list of good fiction come shorter lists of drama , poetry , biog - raphy , history and mythology , speeches , travel and adventure , and , finally , essays and works not other - wise classified .

		Explanatory symbols follow the titles , indicating the general character of each book and sometimes the relative maturity requisite in the reader for its best enjoyment .

		`` The list should not be put without comment into the hands of the pupils , '' is the warning accompanying it .

		`` From this list , as from a pharmacop -LSB- oe -RSB- ia where the cure for one would be poison to another , the teacher must pre - scribe the right medicine . ''

		Quadrennial revision of the list is recommended by its makers .

		It is obtain - able , as announced on the cover , at Sixty-eighth Street and
Stewart Ave.	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		THE TANTALIZING DELIGHTS OF BOOKSELLERS * CATALOGUES , to one whose fondest hopes extend not beyond the anxiously-considered purchase of one or two coveted and not too expensive books a year , resemble those vain stimulations of the salivary glands which the starving gutter-snipe experiences in gazing through the plate-glass window of a bake - shop at the custard pies and frosted cakes and jelly tarts there so temptingly displayed .

		From the
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 11
London	LOCATION	house of
Ellis	PERSON	-LRB- a name that is now but a survival , the present proprietors being Messrs.
Holdsworth	PERSON	and
Smith	PERSON	-RRB- there comes a richly illus - trated and beautifully printed '' Catalogue of Choice and Valuable Books and Manuscripts , with a Short History of the Bookselling Business Carried on since
1728	DATE	at 29 New Bond Street ,
London	LOCATION	, W. '' The most costly item enumerated is an illuminated manu - uscript missal -LRB- '' Missale Bononiense '' -RRB- of about
1600	DATE	, and now , three centuries later , offered at 1,750 .

		But probably more than one discerning reader of the catalogue will be more attracted by the last title in the list , that of the book so dear to
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, `` Wither -LRB- George -RRB- .

		A Collection of Em - blemes , Ancient and Moderne : Quickened with
Metricall Illustrations	ORGANIZATION	, both
Morall	PERSON	and Divine : and disposed into Lotteries , that instruction , and
Good Counsell	PERSON	, may bee furthered by an Honest and Pleasant Recreation . ''

		This is a first edition , folio ,
London	LOCATION	,
1635	DATE	, a '' tine tall copy , '' far superior to the one Lamb was delighted to pick up '' in a most detestable state of preservation , '' and is to be had for one guinea .

		STANLEY HouGHTON , the English playwright who died recently at
Manchester	LOCATION	, where he was born thirty-three years ago , probably needed only a few more years of life to attain a celebrity comparable with that of his fellow-countryman , Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	, if indeed he might not have won a renown of Sha - vian proportions .

		A certain originality and daring characterized his plays and sometimes , as in the case of ''
Hindle Wakes	PERSON	, '' aroused considerable criti - cism that did not confine itself to dramatic or technical questions .

		Other notable plays of his are `` The Younger Generation , '' `` Fancy Free , '' `` Phipps , '' `` Independent Means , '' and `` The Dear Departed , '' all of which have been seen in this coun - try , on the professional or the amateur stage , or both .

		Houghton 's conquest of success at the first assault is the subject of certain humorous autobiographic reminiscences .

		Well aware in advance that a pre - liminary series of heartbreaking failures is the usual price of fame in the dramatic world , he dili - gently set about accomplishing his required number of unsuccesses as the first step to ultimate triumph .

		But
Miss Horniman	PERSON	and her repertory company of Manchester thwarted his well-meant endeavors in this direction , producing play after play from his pen until his success was assured .

		His skill seems to - have lain in the realm of very modern realism , rather than in that of idealism or romance .

		THE
SUTRO LIBRARY	ORGANIZATION	, presented to the
California State Library	ORGANIZATION	by the heirs of the late
Adolph Sutro	PERSON	, is a little-known but a very valuable collection of books even in its present sadly depleted condition .

		The quarter-million of volumes brought together by the
California	LOCATION	millionaire came through the great
San Francisco	LOCATION	fire with a loss of more than one-half .

		But the remaining fraction , like the three unburnt Sibylline Books , is of inestimable value , containing , among other treasures , the four Shakespeare folios , early editions of Chaucer and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, illumi - nated manuscripts of great worth , a large collection of works on the history and life of
Mexico	LOCATION	and the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , many volumes of Spanish literature in all its departments , and a considerable selection of Chinese and Japanese books and manuscripts .

		The library , now numbering about one hundred thousand volumes in all , was not long ago removed from its place of storage to the second floor of the
Lane Medical Library Building	ORGANIZATION	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and with the new year will be unpacked and subjected to the processes of cataloguing , classifying , shelving , etc. .

		Thus it will be several months before any part of it is available for public use .

		By the conditions of the gift , the collection must have its home in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and there it will be operated by the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	as a branch , accessible to a much greater number of persons than if it were at
Sacramento	LOCATION	.

		A HARDY PIONEER makes monthly appeal to our notice .

		`` The Pioneer of Simplified Speling '' certainly has the courage of its convictions : it carries the principle of phonetic orthography -LRB- we acknowledge the contradiction in terms -RRB- to its remorseless limit .

		Without going beyond the table of contents printed on the cover of the latest issue , we note such headings as `` Mr.
Sexton	PERSON	' z Sceem , '' '' Voisez from acros the Chanel , '' `` A Hed Mistres ' z Apoloejia , '' `` Noetz andNyuz , '' `` PresCutings of the Munth . ''

		Who can fail to admire the unabashed insistence on forms like `` woz '' for unreformed `` was , '' `` poot '' for `` put , '' `` mistaicen '' for `` mis - taken , '' and `` chainj '' for `` change '' ?

		Bravo !

		Beter a lie wel stuc tu than the tryuth waivering .

		CHEAPER CARRIAGE OF BOOKS is inevitably com - ing .

		The Postmaster-General 's proposal to admit them to parcel-post privileges , with other notable modifications of the existing parcel-post rules , has been approved by the
Interstate Commerce Com	ORGANIZATION	- mission .

		When this reform has been fully effected , it will be possible not only to deliver to local patrons , at small expense , books from the public library and the bookshop , but also to send this class of freight in considerable packages , under
Uncle Sam	ORGANIZATION	's kindly care , to any part of the country .

		It ought to be astonishing , but is not , that under a government of the people , by the people , for the people , measures of so manifest popular benefit should be so late in getting themselves adopted .

		THE APPEAL OF '' POLITICAL POETRY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
December 1	DATE	, apropos of `` An Ode in
Time of Hesitation	ORGANIZATION	, '' Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	con - signs all '' political poems '' to limbo .

		Now by political poems he evidently means any verse which is concerned with politics , in war or in peace , no matter how great the 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	question involved or how far the ideal has removed that question from a mere party catchword .

		To rule out all poems which are political in this wide sense would be to ban the Jacobite ballads , '' The Lost Leader , '' the '' Ode on the Death of the Duke of Well - ington , '' '' My
Dark Rosaleen	PERSON	, '' '' The Concord Hymn , '' '' Peschiera , ''
Rossetti	PERSON	's sonnet '' On the Refusal of Aid between Nations , ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	's sonnet '' On the Ex - tinction of the Venetian Republic , '' many fine passages in
Byron	LOCATION	and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, much of
Lowell	LOCATION	's best satire , several of
Milton	LOCATION	's sonnets , Kipling 's '' The Recessional , ''
Whitman	PERSON	's `` O Captain !

		My Captain ! ''

		Longfellow 's `` Cumberland '' and `` A Nameless Grave , '' and '' Punch 's '' apology on the death of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, poems that are all very much alive for members of a '' blighted '' race .

		As a matter of fact , a fine political poem has an especial hold on immortality .

		The event which it com - memorates recedes ; but like events occur , demanding like expression .


Webster	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	pass , but Ichabods still fall and writers still leave the better part for the handful of silver and the riband to stick in their coats .

		Nothing could be further from the truth than to siy that because a particular struggle is over its voice must die .

		Rather it takes a wider meaning with time , and from being an incident born of an idea becomes an idea embodied in an incident .

		So certain place-names stand less for localities than for conditions of the soul .

		Zutphen ,
Smithfield	ORGANIZATION	, and
Balaclava	LOCATION	become chivalry , conscience , and obedience .

		If a great political poem is to lose its force , then why not any poem dealing with a moral question ?

		What are the Vaudois to us that a sonnet written nearly two hundred and fifty years ago should stir our blood ?

		Surely it is because we know that , though martyrs perish , martyrdom is never ending .

		When politics rises above the morass which we asso - ciate with the name , it may produce prose and poetry equal to that of religion or love or war .

		After all , what is the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	Address but political prose ?

		The courage which enabled a single ship to fight off the Spanish fleet is no more enduring stuff than the enthu - siasm which led
Robert Shaw	PERSON	to place his life at the service of an unfortunate race .

		The reproach of '' ig - noble battle '' overseas applies not alone to the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines .


Italy	LOCATION	wins her freedom , but the agony is only transferred to some other people .

		The Inquisition is over , but the charge of
Ritual Murder	ORGANIZATION	is a present fact in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		We read our own struggle into the politics of the past , just as we read our own love affair into another man 's love lyrics .

		These live because our ideals and our sorrows endure .

		A WORD ABOUT TRANSLATIONS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your interesting comment on translations in the current number suggests the thought that most trans - lators have never had their due .

		FitzGerald -LRB- as you point out -RRB- ,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Parsons	PERSON	,
Lang	PERSON	,
Symonds	PERSON	, and a few others are , of course , notable ex - ceptions , but they were great authors in their own right ; and their fame has foundation not so much on their adaptations from other languages -LRB- great as
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's was -RRB- as on their own genius , which made of their trans - lations works peculiarly and as much their own as the original was the author 's .

		But what shall we say of present-day translators like
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gar	PERSON	- nett ,
Miss K. P. Wormeley	PERSON	,
E. A. Vizetelly	PERSON	,
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos	PERSON	,
G. B. Ives	PERSON	,
Miss H. W. Preston	PERSON	-LRB- the first , if I mistake not , to introduce
Mistral	PERSON	's `` Mireio '' to
America	LOCATION	-RRB- , and many others , preeminent in their transfusion of the spirit of the author from one language to another , but combining it with a gratifying fidelity to the language of the original ?

		Theirs is a double fame : they are not only scholars , but are them - selves authors of the first rank .

		No literary hacks they , grinding out their sentences with lexicon and phrase - book !

		It has always seemed to me not quite fair that they should be for the most part unwittingly denied any of the credit which is rightly theirs for creating a work of art in another language and for broadening the mental range of thousands of those readers who , without them , would know nothing of a foreign litera - ture .

		Accompanying this feeling , however , is one of regret that , for some reason or other , so many foreign authors should be represented in English by works which are assuredly not their masterpieces .

		Within the year , three of the books of

		It is generally agreed that the masterpieces of this de - fender of traditionalism are '' La Peur de vivre , '' '' Les Roquevillard , '' and '' Les Yeux qui s ` ouvrent . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is refreshing to have one of your correspondents tell us that '' a man of even mediocre ability could read all of Greek literature in a few months ' time , and his acquisition would be a treasure of enormous pleasure and profit . ''

		He adds : `` Even more is this true of Latin '' ; one is not told whether '' time '' is meant , or `` pleasure and profit , '' or all three but one hopes , with misgivings , that it is only '' time . ''

		This is really very wonderful .

		I am acquainted with several persons who have spent a number of years reading Greek and Latin .

		I would have supposed that , if anything , their ability was above mediocre ; and yet I am sure that no one of them would claim knowledge , or even acquaintance , with the whole body of extant classical literature .

		They all acknowledge , however , the '' pleasure and profit '' derived from what they have accomplished .

		One friend , it is true , has confided to me his opinion that the longer time he gave to mat - ters of this kind the more '' pleasure and profit '' he got out of them .

		I suppose he must be very old-fashioned .

		RECORDS OF A HAPPY FRIENDSHIP .

		* The friendship of
Hawthorne	PERSON	and his pub - lisher ,
William Davis Ticknor	PERSON	, is memorable in its bearing on American literary history ; and the story of that friendship , as set forth in the volume by Miss
Caroline Ticknor	PERSON	, is thoroughly worth the reading , for more reasons than one .

		In the first place , the life-long service to the advancement of literature in
America	LOCATION	rendered by this famous
Boston	LOCATION	publisher , while less con - spicuous than that of his literary partner , Fields , is in itself worthy of recognition .

		The early am - bition of Ticknor , says his granddaughter , '' Differed materially from that of many other enterpris - ing youths who came to
Boston	LOCATION	far back in the twenties to seek their fortunes ; some longed for wealth , others sought fame , but this young man , whose heritage was a great love of books , desired that his ` imprint on a title - page should be the guarantee of a good book . '

		This was the corner-stone of a notable literary edifice which he was destined to rear ; a structure unique in the his - tory of book-publishing . ''

		It was in
1832	DATE	that Mr.
Ticknor	PERSON	, then in his twenty-second year , entered the book business , forming a partnership with Mr.
John Allen	PERSON	under the firm name of
Allen & Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	, at the corner of School and
Washington	LOCATION	streets in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		In
1845	DATE
James T. Fields	ORGANIZATION	, a clerk in the employ of Mr.
Ticknor	PERSON	, was taken into the firm , and the imprint became
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	,
Reed & Fields	ORGANIZATION	,
John Reed	PERSON	,
Jr.	LOCATION	, contributing capital .

		Upon Mr.
Reed	PERSON	's subsequent withdrawal , the firm name was compressed to the familiar style of
Ticknor & Fields	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was not many years before the '' Old Corner Bookstore '' had become a sort of literary shrine , it was the '' Hub '' of literary
New England	LOCATION	.

		What memories cluster about that historic spot in the recollection of the passing generation !

		Hawthorne ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	, and many others were its habitues .

		Dickens and
Thackeray	PERSON	enjoyed its hospitality , as did many another celebrity from the old world , drawn thither to pay visits of courtesy to the proprietors of this truly literary book-shop whose motto was '' fair play , ' for Mr.
Ticknor	PERSON	had been the first American publisher to make unsolicited payment to foreign authors for `` copyright '' and to pur - chase `` advance sheets '' of books coming from the English press .

		The enterprise of this pub - lishing house was shown in notable ways .

		To the firm of
Ticknor & Fields	ORGANIZATION	belongs the distinc - * HAWTHORNE AND His PUBLISHER .

		tion of issuing the first edition of De Quincey 's collected works , antedating by two or three years the appearance of the first British edition , which was supervised by the author himself .

		The task of collecting and arranging the scattered mate - rial was performed by Mr.
Fields	PERSON	, and we are told that De Quincey relied largely on this col - lection in preparing his own edition .

		If we are not mistaken , it was this same firm that first published in book form the earlier works of
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		The first two chapters of
Miss Ticknor	LOCATION	's work contain many interesting facts of this char - acter , and include some vivid glimpses of the inner sanctum of the old book-store : the green - curtained corner of the office where Fields had his desk and entertained the sociable spirits invariably gathered there ; the counting-room , elevated two or three steps above the level of the store , where the alert senior partner , sitting at his desk , could command the field .

		Here , in the little counting-room , was Haw - thorne 's chair , in a secluded niche , close beside his faithful friend , where he could see and yet be out of sight .

		`` In this one chair it was for many years
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	's custom to ensconce himself whenever he visited the ' corner ' ; he often spent whole hours here , resting his head upon his hand apparently in happy and satisfying sympathy with his environment ... watch - ing in the shadow , motionless physically , yet mentally alert , and following with an inward intentness the fan - tastic trains of thought evoked sometimes by what was passing in the outward world , and again by that which was merely passing within his active brain .

		... If any acquaintance , knowing him to be there , came to claim his attention , his face seemed to cast off an intangible but perceptible veil , and he roused himself to a genial and conversational mood , though still with a suggestion of having come rather unwillingly from a haunt of his predilection , to which he would fain return as soon as he might do so without impoliteness . ''

		For the general reader , however , the chief interest of the volume lies in the letters of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	to
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	, covering the years 1852-64 , in which the personality of the writer is revealed with the frankness of intimacy .

		`` The Scarlet Letter '' had been published in
1850	DATE	, `` The House of the Seven Gables '' in
1851	DATE	; '' The Wonder Book '' and '' The Blithe - dale Romance '' had followed ;
Hawthorne	PERSON	had removed from
Lenox	LOCATION	to
Concord	LOCATION	, and was at this time completing the campaign biography of his class-mate ,
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	.

		The probable ap - pointment to a position in the consular service was in the wind , and the assistance of Ticknor as counsellor , guardian , and friend was invoked .

		Until one reads this correspondence one can scarcely be aware to how great an extent Haw - 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	thorne leaned upon the ready assistance of his publisher in all these practical matters .

		He refused to travel without
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's companion - ship .

		It was like the first adventure of a shy and unsophisticated boy into the outside world ; he demanded a comrade whom he trusted .

		In
April , 1853	DATE	, the two friends made the trip to
Washington	LOCATION	to see the president and to promote the interests of his biographer .

		Ticknor , in this instance , is the correspondent , and his letters to his wife give us the story of the trip .

		It is rather interesting to find him referring to the '' Progressive `` element in the Democratic party : '' I am perfectly surprised , '' he says , '' to see to what extent this spirit is carried here -LSB- in
Wash	LOCATION	- ington -RSB- . ''

		He adds : `` I am convinced that old party lines in every section of the country are breaking up and that there is a spirit abroad which is to revolutionize the politics of the country .

		Whether it will be for the best good of the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	, I think is a question of very great importance but the tide is rolling on , and good men of all parties must control and guide , or we shall ' suffer loss . ' '

		The two comrades were royally entertained , and the novelist was rather lionized .

		`` Haw - thorne is quite a lion here , '' says Ticknor ; '' much attention is shown , and yet it annoys him very much . ''

		The mission was successful , and
Hawthorne	PERSON	's prospective income was largely increased by combining the duties of the con - sulate at Manchester with those of the office at
Liverpool	LOCATION	.

		The matter of the appointment having been settled , preparations for the departure were rapidly made ; and in
July , 1853	DATE	, the party sailed for
England	LOCATION	on the Cunarder `` Niagara , '' a first-class steamship , 250 feet in length , pro- pelled by paddlewheels and carrying about 150 passengers .

		Mr.
Ticknor	PERSON	accompanied his friend ; for without the former 's protecting com - panionship ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	had resolutely refused to embark .

		Of course it was not solely for this reason that the publisher made the journey ; there were errands connected with the trade , authors to be solicited , and books to be pur - chased in
London	LOCATION	; yet Ticknor remained with the Hawthornes in
Liverpool	LOCATION	for three days after the arrival , '' arranging his business as well as I could until he enters upon his duties
August 1st	DATE	. ''

		During his stay in
England	LOCATION	,
Ticknor	PERSON	paid an interesting visit to De
Quincey	PERSON	, then living with his daughter in the little cottage at Lass - wade .

		Hawthorne was included in the invita - tion , but found it impossible to leave his official duties .

		By the end of
September	DATE	,
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	had said farewell to the Hawthornes and departed on his journey home .

		Hawthorne 's experiences while abroad are pretty well known through his `` Note - books '' and the sketches in '' Our Old Home '' ; Miss Ticknor draws from these sources to fill the gaps in the correspondence and to round out the record of which the letters in this volume form a part .

		The letters are characterized by utter spontaneity ; rarely do they show traces of a formal or '' literary '' style .

		Says Miss Ticknor : '' He spoke his mind freely , and with a kind of boyish irresponsibility .

		He indulged in cutting and satirical remarks about men and things , as well as institutions that he truly respected ... He ' ran on ' with a care - less disregard of anything beyond his present mood .

		He talked with the freedom of a man who knows that he is so well understood that it does not matter what he says .

		He made daring comments for the fun of making them , in one paragraph , and took them back or softened them , for truth 's sake , in the next . ''

		This is an admirable statement of the facts , and only in the spirit of such an understanding can a proper interpretation be placed upon these letters , in which occur frequent outbursts of feeling due to momentary irritation and the whimsical expression of a passing mood .

		The duties of his office were conscientiously and efficiently discharged , but not unnaturally they irked
Hawthorne	PERSON	, as similar tasks had worn upon his sensitive disposition at Salem and in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Thus , just two months after
Ticknor	PERSON	's departure from
Liverpool	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	writes : '' I suppose
Baring Brothers	ORGANIZATION	have already advised you of my depositing 300 to your credit .

		If it had been 3000 , I would kick the office to the devil , and come home again .

		I am sick of it , and long for my hillside ; and what I thought I never should long for my pen !

		When once a man is thoroughly imbued with ink , he can never wash out the stain . ''

		There was a possibility that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	might reduce the emoluments of his office , and we find
Hawthorne	PERSON	writing in the same strain : '' Money can not pay me for the irksomeness of this office , at least only a very large amount can do it ; and I really think I should be glad to have
Congress	ORGANIZATION	put the question of my remaining here at rest by breaking down the office altogether .

		This very morning I have been bored to death by a woman ; and every day 1 am beset with complainants who I wish were all at the Devil together .

		But I can get along well enough with men , if the women would only let me alone . ''

		In an earlier letter -LRB- 1854 -RRB- he had specified some of these complainants : '' What with brutal shipmasters , drunken sailors , vagrant yankees , mad people , sick people , and dead people -LRB- for just now I have to attend to the removal of the bones of a man who has been dead these twenty years -RRB- it is full of damnable annoyances . ''

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 15 And still the climax of these irritations was a woman !

		His famous adventure with Miss
Delia Bacon	PERSON	, whose story is given in these pages , cost
Hawthorne	PERSON	a pretty penny , he having benevolently assumed the financial re - sponsibility of seeing that lady 's ponderous solution of the '' Shakespeare problem '' through the press .

		Hawthorne 's experiences in unwise charity are familiar to most of us ; not a few of these communications to `` Dear Tick '' contain re - quests to investigate the probability of his being reimbursed for some injudicious loan , as , for example , the following : '' Dear Ticknor , I have given B an order on you for
$ 50	MONEY	.

		Pay it , and I promise you not to trouble you again on his account .

		It is impossible not to assist an old acquaintance in distress for once , at least . ''

		P. S. Do not write me about this ; for I do not wish my wife to know how I throw away money . ''

		It is pleasant to note in the letters the senti - ments expressed regarding
America	LOCATION	and Amer - icans . ''

		The more I see of the rest of the world , the better I think of my own country , '' he exclaims in one of his characteristic outbursts , qualifying the statement directly with the paren - thesis '' not that I like it very enthusiastically either . ''

		The latter half of this decade in the
United States	LOCATION	was surcharged with premoni - tions of the approaching crisis ; and
Hawthorne	PERSON	viewed the situation with natural uneasiness .

		In
1856	DATE	he writes : '' We shall know how to prize a home , if we ever go back to one ; but I must confess , I am in no great hurry to return to
America	LOCATION	.

		To say the truth , it looks like an infernally disagreeable country from this side of the water . ''

		And yet he also wrote at about this same time : '' Pray do not be so hopeless about our political con - cerns .

		We shall grow and flourish , in spite of the devil .

		Affairs do not look so very bad , at this distance , what - ever they may seem to you who are in the midst of the confusion .

		For my part , I keep a steadfast faith in the destinies of my own country , and will not be stag - gered , whatever happens . ''

		In
June , 1860	DATE	, the Hawthornes arrived once more in
Boston	LOCATION	, and resumed their residence at `` The Wayside . ''

		But the excitement and con - fusion of war were not conducive to literary effort and seriously interfered with plans for projected romances .

		Conditions were depressing ; and in
March , 1862	DATE	,
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Ticknor	PERSON	made a second trip to
Washington	LOCATION	, arriving just after
McClellan	PERSON	had removed his force of 60,000 men across the
Potomac	LOCATION	.

		The trip was full of incident , and decidedly beneficial in its effect on
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's health and spirits .

		A year later , however , the novelist was again in failing health .

		His sensitive nature was depressed , he became less and less capable of creative effort ; his visits to the old '' Corner '' grew more and more infre - quent ; yet his letters to Ticknor are not signi - ficant of depression or of failing powers .

		He contributed now and then to the `` Atlantic Monthly , '' but his pen flagged when he worked at the unfinished romance . ''

		His splendid vigor paled , his hair grew snowy white , and he began to express certain wishes in regard to provisions to be made after his death and to burn old let - ters , while his efforts to carry on his work proved almost futile . ''

		His wife became thoroughly alarmed , and the aid of Ticknor was again in - voked .

		It appeared that a change of scene was desirable , and with the beneficial effects of the
Washington	LOCATION	trip in mind another was planned in the same direction .

		On the 28th of
March	DATE	the two friends left
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Hawthorne was in a very delicate condition ;
Ticknor	PERSON	, who was not in the best of health , as usual looked after all the details of the journey .

		The weather was stormy , and they remained in
New York	LOCATION	for almost a week ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	scarcely leaving his room .

		They reached
Philadelphia	LOCATION	on the
5th of April	DATE	.

		Writing to his wife two days later ,
Ticknor	PERSON	speaks encouragingly of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's condition and closes thus : `` Excuse this short note , as I must look after my friend .

		I have a bad cold and feel disinclined to move at all .

		Love to all . ''

		It was his last letter .

		The next day the relations of these two men were strangely reversed .

		Ticknor was stricken with pneumonia and died the day following , almost in
Haw	LOCATION	- thorne 's arms .

		The effect upon
Hawthorne	PERSON	of this sudden disaster was overwhelming ; he re - turned to his home a wreck .

		Five weeks later he , too , had passed away .

		It is obviously a labor of love the compila - tion of this work ; its tribute to Ticknor as a publisher and as an affectionate and loyal friend to one of the most striking personalities in American literature is deserved and just .

		More - over , the proportions are consistently maintained ;
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, as we naturally expect , holds the hero 's place in the narrative , and the light thrown upon him from this unusual angle is singularly effective .

		The extracts quoted in this review scarcely give an idea of the variety and interest of the letters as a whole .

		The author has done her work admirably ; one notes , however , a strange preference for the use of '' penned '' rather than the simpler '' wrote '' or '' written '' an odd mannerism to be associated with an unusually pleasing and attractive style .

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	With happy appropriateness the volume itself a beautiful example of the book-making art is dedicated to the company from whose house it issues , '' successors to the literary heritage of Ticknor and Fields and to the just and honor - able traditions of the earlier house which they to-day so steadfastly uphold .

W. E. SIMONDS	PERSON	.

		COMMENTING ON SHAKESPEARE .

		* There is almost nothing easier for a man of any literary ability than to write a book of commentary on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		All that one that way inclined has to do is to read one of these plays scene by scene and jot down his reflections on the incidents or characters or single speeches as he reads , praising here , fault - finding there , explaining , illustrating , comment - ing , narrating , etc. , as the mood strikes him .

		This becomes the more easy when one has a theory or a philosophy to defend ; for then the critic reads everything in the light of what ob - sesses him , and emphasizes those passages that apparently confirm his theories and suppresses or minimizes whatever militates against them .

		The prospective book may also be padded by interweaving old and well-known comments , especially such as seem to lend support to the writer 's views or appear so good to him that he wishes he had written them .

		Another way of handling the subject is first to state the theory and then bring together everything in the particular play under consid - eration that seems to corroborate the theory .

		Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	is a master of these methods .

		He accumulates a mass of material which is very likely to give the unknowing reader a distorted view of Shakespeare as a man and as an artist , besides vitiating his appre - ciation and understanding of the plays .

		If Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's latest book were written for professed Shakespeareans the danger would be reduced to a minimum ; they are accustomed to contend with fantastic theories , and are not easily im - posed upon .

		But Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	seems to have written with his eye mainly on beginners in Shakespeare study , and he should have been cautious in putting forth surmises , guesses , and conjectures , as facts .

		The beginner ought to be left with an open mind , and ought to be en - couraged to enjoy Shakespeare as a poet , a play - wright , and a revealer of the human soul ; there is time enough for him to go into the intricate * TEN MOKE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE .

		By
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		problems of the relationship between the poet and his work .

		A matter into which Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	might very profitably have gone is the rela - tionship between the finished product and the so-called `` original . ''

		Almost nothing else in Shakespeare study is so suggestive , interesting , and instructive as this , or more calculated to guard the student from indulging in vain and fantastic hypotheses .

		Shakespeare rejects noth - ing , retains nothing , and introduces nothing , without a reason .

		Another fruitful but much neglected field for commentary is the adaptation of sound to sense in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , something that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, like every great poet , is very rich in .

		But we should not be understood as condemn - ing Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's book .

		In Shakespeare com - mentary , as in the acting of `` Hamlet , '' no one can fail utterly .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	has such good literary taste and such genuine appreciation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and seems to be such a close observer of men , that he is almost always well worth listening to .

		He is interesting even when one does not agree with him , as when , for ex - ample , speaking of Cassius , he says : '' -LSB- Toward the end of the play -RSB- he becomes that which he probably was as a young man .

		This recurrence when the end of life draws near to that which a man was before he was spoiled awry by the world , is not infrequent in experience , but few writers have used it as Shakespeare . ''

		Such passages and the book is full of them at least have the merit of stimulating thought , even if they do not convince and do not help to the understanding of the characters .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	also possesses a really pleasing and interesting style , which makes the reading of most of his book distinctly pleasurable , although at times one is disagreeably conscious of an artificiality and straining for fine stylistic effects .

		The latter tendency is frequently responsible for such peculiar and uncouth phraseology as the fol - lowing : `` He dispersed Rosencrantz and Guil - denstern '' ; `` he was spoiled awry '' ; '' I only see in it the cunning almost of a madman '' ; '' when also we read it '' ; `` baited by a fool who wants he knows to find him out '' ; ''
Ophelia	PERSON	is drowned of her pain '' ; '' that is of feeling quite intense '' ; '' she forgets to tell him what to do in her excite - ment '' ; `` it draws me into the imagination '' ; and much more that is even worse .

		In his paper on ''
Twelfth Night	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	permits himself to be lost in fantasies concern - ing the sub-title , '' What You Will , '' instead of accepting Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's plain and sensible ex - planation .

		It is not true that the dramatis
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 17 personce in this play '' range from the highest to the lowest in rank , from the wisest to the most foolish . ''

		He is also guilty of gross exaggera - tion when he says that
Shakespeare	PERSON	`` took won - derful pains to give plenty of attractive work to all the members of his company , to give to the smallest acting part points to be made which should draw the attention and the praise of the audience . ''

		There are plenty of thankless parts in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, as any actor will testify .

		Nor does '' Twelfth Night '' deserve the reproach implied in the statement that `` the scenery of the play is less defined than it is in other plays . ''

		On the contrary , considering that the poet wrote for a practically bare stage and for an audience for whom the play was the thing , `` Twelfth Night '' is set in singularly picturesque and romantic surroundings .

		In the midst of much that is commonplace , Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	makes some statements that are so palpably at variance with the facts , and so calculated to suggest to the reader the author 's subsequently developed views concerning
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's tragic mood , that they must be singled out for correction and as an illustration of the worst kind of commenting on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		He says -LRB- page 51 -RRB- : '' Their jji.e. , Sir Toby 's companions ' -RSB- conversation is as clean as the moon , '' and in a footnote he says : `` It is remarkable that when the darkness fell on Shakespeare his lower characters sometimes use a grossness in thought and speech , which was not so before . ''

		Reading this , one is almost tempted to believe that Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's reading of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was limited to expurgated school editions ; or has he forgotten the equivokes in - dulged in by Sir Toby and
Aguecheek	PERSON	in Act I. , scene 4 ?

		And as to the plays preceding this one , let us refer him to the conversation of the nurse in '' Romeo and Juliet '' and to the dia - logue between
Samson	PERSON	and
Gregory	PERSON	in that play .

		Coarse allusions occur in almost all of Shake - speare 's plays , both before and after his /
Sturm	PERSON	und Drang period .

		In the chapter on ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	'' there is much interesting matter , such as the comments on the political interest of the play , the reasons why revolutions usually fail , the `` pathetic fal - lacy , '' and the character of
Brutus	LOCATION	, and much with which a Shakespearean and a psychologist will not agree .

		It is not true that the poet combined his borrowed material in such a way as '' to make a greater matter than that which actually happened . ''

		If Shakespeare departs from the historical order of events , he does so because of motives of dramatic and psychologic effectiveness as well as the necessities imposed on him by his stage .

		On p. 60 Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	says that ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	'' was written in
1600	DATE	, and on p. 64 he says that it was written in
1601	DATE	.

		The error is material only in so far as it involves the question why he mentions the subject at all .

		To the beginner in Shakespeare study , the date of composition is of no importance unless he is shown its significance in watching the evolution of the poet 's mind ; and to the professed student Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's unsubstantiated opinion on a dis - puted question is of no value .

		In discussing the failure of most revolutions , Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	strangely overlooks the fact that with the death of the `` tyrant '' the representative of law and order , the source of authority the repressed lawless - ness , the pent-up passions of humanity , are loosed and break forth ; note the destruction of
Cinna	LOCATION	.

		In common with many other critics , Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	makes too much of the political interest in this play .

		I do not believe that the struggle between
Elizabeth	PERSON	and the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in any way in - fluenced the dramatist in the composition of ''
Julius Caesar	PERSON	. ''

		Shakespeare employed the political events only as a means of portraying the psyche of his dramatis personce , not the characters as vehicles for the expression of his political convictions ; his interests were psycho - logic , not sociologic .

		The events , their causes and their issues , were supplied by his original .

		This is no more a political play than is ''
Cori	PERSON	- olanus `` or '' Antony and Cleopatra . ''

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's failure to understand this is the cause of his condemnation of the last two acts as being too long drawn out , and as containing needless interludes .

		Brutus , as usual , is described almost as the apotheosis of virtue .

		The blindness of the critics to his failings , all too human , is the more amazing because Shakespeare spares no pains to limn him at full length as a real living human being , not as an abstraction .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's description of the mighty Julius '' as subject to superstitions , as wavering to and fro , as led by the nose , as vain , as having lost his intellectual powers in self-sufficiency , as one who thinks himself separated altogether from his fellow men '' is more applicable to '' the lofty , dignified , and beautiful ''
Brutus	PERSON	.

		The latter is consumed by vanity and a mighty self-love , fail - ings which blind him to the fatuity of
Cassius	ORGANIZATION	's arguments , make him susceptible to the flattery of the anonymous letters thrown in at his win - dow , undermine his logical faculty , and which are directly responsible for the obstinacy with which he adheres to his ill-considered and fatal plans in the last Act as well as throughout the play .

		He is the geek and gull of Cassius .

		If 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1 Caesar	DATE	's speeches are '' almost the speeches of a fool , ''
Brutus	PERSON	's actions are much more so .

		This honorable man conspires against the life of his friend and benefactor for what he may become ; this honest and upright idealist will not wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection , but he resents not being per - mitted to share the moneys so collected .

		The true critic will not denigrate Cassius and
Antony	PERSON	for the purpose of exalting Brutus .

		That was not
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's way .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	attempts to explain the melodra - matic action of the conspirators bathing their arms in
Caesar	LOCATION	's blood by comparing it with Hamlet 's '' bursting into fantastic phrases after he has seen the Ghost . ''

		There is absolutely no parallelism between the two incidents .

		The conspirators are in a mood of exaltation after their butchery ; for the moment they really believe that their act was prompted by noble , patriotic , heroic motives , and that history will regard them as the liberators of their country .

		It is particularly significant that it is the peace - ful , gentle , philosophic , amiable and book-loving theorist
Brutus	PERSON	who makes the proposal that they bathe their hands in the sacrificial blood .

		This mood preserves Brutus from being horri - fied at the hideous spectacle he had made , from realizing that he had committed the stupidest and most reprehensible crime in history .

		From the modern psychologic point of view , we may say that the melodramatic action of the con - spirators is the expression of the regression to the infantile play instinct and sado-masochistic complex which so frequently come to the fore in moments of great exaltation or depression .

		Hamlet , on the other hand , is left dazed and stupefied by the Ghost 's revelations ; he is shocked into cynicism and flippancy by the tale of horror unfolded to his ears .

		Suddenly all the world of evil is bared to his gaze ; all his youthful ideals are shattered ; there is nothing serious in mortality .

		That is why he indulges in wild and whirling words , puts on an antic disposition , and speaks so vulgarly to his father 's spirit .

		To see Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	at his worst one has to turn to his remarks on '' Hamlet . ''

		In discuss - ing the Prince 's sanity , he vents his sarcasms on the '' mad doctors , '' and talks in such a dic - tatorial and cock-sure way that he makes himself laughable .

		Reading Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	, one would think that the alienists and psychiatrists know nothing of insanity , that they never read the play , that they purposely disregard the perti - nent facts , and that they are in a conspiracy to commit Hamlet to a lunatic asylum .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	is quite certain that he knows Shake - speare 's intention in the matter , and that Hamlet is perfectly sane , that his only trouble is that he '' glides away from the present into a rea - soning in his soul on a question which suddenly presents itself to him , '' and that he is as sud - denly `` shocked out of argumentative thought into the actual world . ''

		Notwithstanding this shocking formula , Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	is compelled to admit -LRB- p. 123 -RRB- that at times Hamlet shows `` the cunning almost of a madman , '' that his treach - ery to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern is '' a blot on the play '' of which Shakespeare should not have been guilty and which `` is not in
Hamlet	LOCATION	's character . ''

		So , too , according to this critic , the episode of Hamlet 's leaping into
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	's grave -LRB- with the declaration that he is King of
Denmark	LOCATION	-RRB- is unworthy of the poet .

		Of course if we omit those occurrences that point to insan - ity and leave out of consideration Hamlet 's twice - repeated confession of '' melancholy `` and '' madness , '' it is an easy matter to prove Hamlet sane .

		That is Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's way of studying
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, a characteristic which makes all the difference in the world between him and Professor
Bradley	PERSON	.

		AN ACCOUNT or ENGLISH LIBERALISM .

		* It is extremely convenient for the reviewer when the author of a book begins by a state - ment , in so many words , of what he is about ; for then all the reviewer has to do is to copy it out .

		Mr.
W. Lyon Blease	PERSON	, in his '' Short His - tory of English Liberalism , '' begins with such a statement . ''

		This book attempts to trace the varying but per - sistent course of Liberalism in British politics during the last hundred and fifty years .

		It is not so much a history of events as a reading of them in the light of a particular political philosophy ... The general vic - tory ... has been to Liberalism ; and the movement of the race , during the period with which the writer is concerned , is precisely measured by the degree in which the Liberal spirit has succeeded in modifying the estab - lishments of a preceding age .

		The object of this book is to investigate the course of that process of modifica - tion in politics . ''

		A victory usually implies a defeat ; and Mr.
Blease	PERSON	employs the word Toryism to signify what it is that Liberalism had defeated .

		How - ever , neither Liberalism nor Toryism is to be identified with a political party , or with any * A SHORT HISTORY OF ENGLISH LIBERALISM .

Lyon Blease	LOCATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 19 concrete policy ; each is rather a `` habit of mind . ''

		Liberalism is that settled habit of mind which induces a man to desire that every other man may '' have equal opportunity with himself for self-expression and fpr self-development . ''

		This desired end was once thought to be attained by reducing legal restrictions and the activity of government to a minimum ; but it is now known that Liberalism has its positive as well as its negative side .

		Not only does Liberalism concede that `` each is to be left to work out his own salvation , '' but it concedes that `` active steps '' must be taken `` to remove the artificial barriers which impede that development . ''

		It is possible , therefore , and quite proper indeed , to speak of the old and the new Liberalism , the Liberalism of the Manchester school and the `` collective Liberalism '' of Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	; and to speak of them , in spite of their marked differences , as pursuing the same end , as being alike '' in the desire to set free the individual from existing social bonds , and to procure him liberty of growth . ''

		Toryism , like Liberalism , is also a `` habit of mind , '' not to be identified with Conservatism or Unionism .

		It is the '' habit of mind which refuses to concede to others that right of free expression which it requires for itself , ... the egoistic mind which regards all others as at its disposal . ''

		The Tory habit of mind , it may be said at once , is a very bad habit , the Liberal habit a very good one .

		Mr.
Blease	PERSON	says , and one can well believe it , that the pure Tory or the pure Liberal is very rarely found ; his enumer - ation of the distinguishing characteristics of either leaves one inclined to remark , very nearly in the words of Desdemona , '' I do not believe there ever was such a man . ''

		And Mr.
Blease	PERSON	is free to admit that many members of the Tory or Conservative parties have worked for Liberal measures , and that there have been very few members of the Liberal Party who were Liberals without alloy .

		Fox and
Sheridan	PERSON	lacked much of being complete Liberals ;
John Bright	PERSON	was not a complete Liberal because he opposed Fac - tory Acts ; Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	is not a complete Liberal because he is opposed to woman 's suffrage ; Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	is under suspicion because , but I can not now recall just for what .

		The author does not say so , but I suspect that there is only one simon-pure Liberal , and that is Mr.
Blease	PERSON	himself .

		Still , one need not despair , for it is well known that ten righteous men can save a city .

		Mr.
Blease	PERSON	is very far from despair ; for the
Liberal Party	ORGANIZATION	, although some of its members may lag behind , is as a whole very nearly up to the mark ; and its policy of social reform as distinguished from Socialism , which the author rejects bids fair to put a kind of happy period to `` that movement of the race '' of which Mr.
Blease	PERSON	speaks .

		I infer this at least , because Mr.
Blease	PERSON	, although he does distin - guish Liberalism from Socialism as things fundamentally different , admits frankly that the present Liberal programme `` has borrowed largely from Socialism '' ; so that it is difficult to see how Liberalism can carry us much farther without handing us over as it were to the Socialists , which , however , he is clear will never do .

		Humanly speaking , therefore , the present Liberal programme is for him a kind of final thing , a test or standard by which to evaluate the ideas and events of the past ; and , in fact , Mr.
Blease	PERSON	has made a survey of English politics during the last century , in an interesting manner and with much knowledge indeed , much less from the point of view of a '' particular political philosophy '' than from the point of view of a particular political platform .

		From
Burke	PERSON	to Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	, he summons men and measures to submit to this test , ap - proving them in so far as they are found to be in accord with the ideas of the extreme left wing of the
Liberal Party	ORGANIZATION	, condemning them in so far as they fall short of these ideas .

		The author 's bias being thus in favor of a particular party almost as much as in favor of a particular philosophy , members of another party scarcely get due credit even when they momentarily fall into a Liberal way of acting .

		The Factory Acts of the fourth decade of the century -LRB- true Liberal measures according to Mr.
Blease	PERSON	-RRB- were better supported by Conservatives than by Whigs .

		But even the best Conserva - tives , in supporting legislation of this kind , were Unfortunately still actuated by the in - grained Tory habit of mind , `` their general readiness to dispose of the affairs of others '' ; so that it may be said even of the excellent Shaftesbury that as `` he refused to allow a Catholic or a Tractarian religious freedom , or the common people political freedom , so he refused to allow a cotton-spinner economic free - dom . ''

		You ca n't say much for the benighted Conservative , even when , by some chance , he does a Liberal deed , he does it in such a Tory manner !

		Suppose a fig should be found grow - ing on a thistle !

		One fig does n't make an orchard !

		Some Conservatives would doubtless be just perverse enough not to see why it is that when a 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	Liberal votes for a Factory Act he does so in order to make the workman more free , whereas when a Conservative votes for a Factory Act he does so in order to make the workman less free .

		And many an old Tory would probably say that a Factory Act is a Factory Act , that its effects are what they are , equally good or bad , whatever the motive which inspired men to get it passed into law .

		A discussion of such points might entangle us in the old controversy of grace and works , a controversy which I am by no means competent to determine .

		This much may be said , however : it will be found difficult at this late day to write a satisfactory history of English Liberalism on the fundamental assumption that certain men , inspired by an innate beneficent habit of mind , and belonging for the most part to one of the great political parties , have been the instruments of God 's purpose in the world ; whereas certain other men , inspired by an innate malevolent habit of mind , and belonging for the most part to the other great political party , have done the devil 's business .

		It is , however , on this assumption , quite possible to write a most skilful tract for the times .

		And that is indeed what Mr.
Blease	PERSON	has done .

		BECKER .

		CANADA OF TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW .

		* It is perhaps part of the world-wide craze for standardizing all things , and bringing them within the rigid lines of a system , that modern publishers bring out so many of their books in series .

		Doubtless , also , there is an economic side to the question .

		One volume in a series helps to sell the others ; and both individuals and public libraries are sometimes subject to the weakness of subscribing for a set of books , where one or two volumes are all they need , merely because of a vague but compelling im - pulse toward completeness .

		From the point of view of the reading public , the tendency can not generally be commended .

		It has resulted in a multitude of made-to-order books , based on the utterly false premise that radically different communities may be measured with the same foot-rule ; and in many cases , too , it has led to the duplication of books covering the same field from substantially the same point of view .

		A case in point is Mr.

		It is entertaining and readable , but otherwise scarcely worth while .

		Moreover , one finds in the book errors of fact or judgment which are rather inexcusable in a man of Mr.
Goodrich	PERSON	's standing .

		To cite but a few : The statement that
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	discovered Hudson Bay -LRB- p. 47 -RRB- will scarcely be endorsed by historical students familiar with all the docu - ments .

		The name
Kaministiquia	PERSON	-LRB- or
Kaminis	PERSON	- tikwia , as it is now spelled -RRB- has not `` disap - peared from our modern maps '' -LRB- p. 61 -RRB- .

		To describe the Upper Canadian Rebellion as '' in the nature of turbulent protest by the French Canadians , '' etc. -LRB- p. 95 -RRB- , is little short of ludi - crous .

		So far from the head of the
Department of External Affairs of Canada	ORGANIZATION	not being a Cabinet officer -LRB- p. 100 -RRB- , that portfolio is held by the Prime Minister .

		A statement on the same page reveals a very common misconcep - tion of the relative responsibilities of members of the cabinet in
Canada	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The Secretary of the Interior of the
United States	LOCATION	-LRB- to take an example -RRB- has no serious re - sponsibilities outside his own department .

		The Minister of the Interior of
Canada	LOCATION	, in addition to the work of his department , is a member of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, and for six or eight months of every year he must be in his seat in
Parliament	LOCATION	, taking part in debates , introducing legislation , defending the administration of which he is a member and especially his own partic - ular department .

		The former is responsible to the President alone ; the latter is responsible to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and to his constituents .

		The sug - gestion -LRB- p. 131 -RRB- of a canoe trip , as a
summer	DATE	's holiday , from
Winnipeg	LOCATION	to
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	, and back by way of
Hudson Straits	LOCATION	, the Labrador coast , and
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, leaves one gasping .

		Mr.
Goodrich	PERSON	says -LRB- p. 212 -RRB- , speaking of the glaciers in the Canadian Rockies , '' most of these Canadian ice-rivers are small . ''

		He can scarcely have heard of the
Lyell Glacier	ORGANIZATION	, eight miles in length , exceeding anything in the Alps ; or the vast
Columbia Ice-field	ORGANIZATION	two hundred square miles in extent and thirty miles long , with its circle of giant glaciers .

		Mount Assiniboine -LRB- p. 214 -RRB- was successfully climbed by
James Outram	PERSON	in

		Mr.

		A useful Bibliography is appended to the book , but even here one finds the need of some criticism .

		The `` Remarkable History of the Hudson 's Bay Company '' is by
George Bryce	PERSON	, not by
Bryce	PERSON	and
Campbell	PERSON	; and it was pub - lished in
1900	DATE	, not

		On the other hand , '' The Scotsman in

		It would have added to the value of the Bibliography if such superficial sketches as Copping 's ''
Canada	LOCATION	To-day and To-morrow '' and `` The Golden Land , ''
Vernede	PERSON	's `` The Fair Dominion , '' and
Talbot	PERSON	's `` New Garden of
Canada	LOCATION	'' had been omitted , and a number of books of more lasting value listed in their place .

		One notes , for instance , the omission of Bourinot 's ''

Canada	LOCATION	is Gov - erned '' ; of
Tracy	PERSON	's `` Tercentenary History of

		Masson 's '' Bourgeois de la Compagnie du Nordouest '' should have been included even in a brief bibliography ; also
Hornaday	PERSON	's '' Camp - fires in the Canadian Rockies '' and
Wheeler	PERSON	's '' The Selkirk Range . ''

		Gagnon 's '' Chansons Populaires '' is the standard work on the sub - ject , and very much more comprehensive than

		* The present season is a notable one for novel * of exceptional quality and interest , and its long list of important works of fiction includes no work more appealingly human than `` The Garden without Walls , '' by a new writer , Mr.
Coningsby Dawson	PERSON	.

		In form , it is an autobiography , beginning with those memories of early childhood that a few fortu - nate mortals are privileged to preserve undimmed through all the years .

		It was in a
London	LOCATION	suburb that the narrator first began `` to dream of a garden without walls . ''

		He had lost his mother in infancy , and lived with his father , a scholarly recluse , in a house with a closed garden .

		`` As I grew older I became curious , and fretted with the narrowness of my restraint .

		What happened over there in the great beyond ?

		Rumors came to me ; sometimes it was the roar of
London	LOCATION	to the southward ; some - times it was the sing-song of a mower traversing a neighbor 's lawn .

		I dreamt of an unwalled garden , through which a child might wander on forever an
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, where each step revealed a new beauty and a fresh surprise , where flowers grew always and there were no doors to lock . ''

		The life of
Dante Cardover	PERSON	, as he grew up , was a quest for this gar - den of heart 's desire .

		The quest began by a literal scaling of the home garden wall , and discovering

		Ruthita became annexed to the family when the elder Cardover married her widowed mother , and the two children grew up joyously together .

Jan. 1	DATE	falls irrevocably in love before he learns that she is married the child-wife of an American old enough to be her father .

		The mischief is done , for his love is returned , and he remains faithful to her for years , and all but persuades her to set society at defiance by deserting her husband for his sake .

		But her better nature prevails over her passion , and she returns to her
Massachusetts	LOCATION	home .

		Then
Dante	ORGANIZATION	becomes a wanderer , and in
Florence	LOCATION	meets
Fiesole	LOCATION	, a bewitching creature who had tried to flirt with him in his school-days , and who has grown into a creature all air and fire , prodigal of a love which his devotion to the impossible ideal which
Vi	ORGANIZATION	represents forces him to put aside .

		Then he goes to
America	LOCATION	, sees Vi once more , and parts from her when they both realize that renunciation is the only course open to them .

		Returning to En - gland ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	becomes a landed proprietor through the death of his grandfather , but his heart-hunger is still unappeased .

		Journeying to
Paris	LOCATION	, he redis - covers
Fiesole	LOCATION	, now become a famous actress , and realizes too late the treasure of the love that might have been his for the taking in the old Florentine days .

		A season of delirious companionship follows , and he thinks he has won her , when she turns her back upon him , and disappears from the scene .

		This is the inconclusive end of the story , for Ruthita , whom he has always regarded as a sister , and who might have brought him the happiness that has ever eluded his pursuit , has made a mar - iage de convenance , and is also lost to him .

		The life-story of
Dante Cardover	PERSON	is a pathetic record of failure , and the fruit of the only garden that he finds turns to ashes in his mouth .

		This sorry scheme of things entire has proved too much for him to cope with , and yet he is not without his compensating memories .

		He has twice known the full intoxication of love in its best sense the sense in which
Rossetti	PERSON	conceived it when he wrote of one '' Whose speech Truth knows not from her thought , Nor Love her body from her soul '' the love in which the spiritual and the sensuous are blended in perfect harmony .

		We feel throughout that this delicately-wrought and exquisite piece of fiction is the work of an artist with a conscience of a man who does not palter with the ethical verities or seek to make the worse appear the better reason , and yet of one who has the truest sympathy with the frailties of human nature and the deepest insight into human motive .

		In a word , he never permits us to forget that life is a thing of stern reality , no matter how beautifully-colored its imagined exterior .


Canon Hannay	PERSON	, having written the play of '' Gen - eral
John Regan	PERSON	, '' which has recently been produced for the delight of
New Yorkers	ORGANIZATION	and others , proceeded to convert it into a novel with the same title , a pro- ceeding rarely to be commended , but in this case proved by the result to have been entirely justifiable .

		The idea underlying both works is that of which Lady
Gregory	PERSON	made effective use in `` The Image '' the idea of erecting a statue to the memory of an im - aginary Irishman .

		A travelling American named
Horace P. Billing	PERSON	arrives one day in
Ballymoy	LOCATION	in his motor-car , and gets an impression of the place which he afterwards records in these vigorous terms : '' When I first set eyes on this town a month ago I thought I had bumped up against the most dead-alive , God-forsaken , one-horse settlement that
Europe	LOCATION	could boast . ''

		Thinking to start something , he asks to be directed to the statue of General
John Regan	PERSON	.

		No one can gratify his wish , for the excellent reasons that there is no such memorial and that no such person ever existed .

		So he goes on to explain that
Regan	PERSON	was a famous Irish patriot who had devoted his sword to the liberation of
Bolivia	LOCATION	, in which coun - try his name was enshrined in every heart , and that
Ballymoy	PERSON	, his native place , surely should have paid him some sort of monumental honor .

		At this juncture , it was Dr.
Lucius O'Grady	PERSON	who gave the townspeople their cue .

		It was clearly a case of `` Si Dieu n'existait pas , il faudraif Vinventer '' and Dr.
O'Grady	PERSON	at once improvised the necessary hero .

		He said , under the stimulus of an offered subscription of one hundred pounds from the American visitor , that plans for the statue were well under way , and that it would soon be ready for unveiling .

		So much good money should not be allowed to get away from
Ballymoy	LOCATION	, and so all the leading citizens lent themselves to the imposture , lying about the affair with the easy or expert grace of which only Irishmen are capable .

		The house in which
Regan	PERSON	was born is pointed out to the visitor , the site prepared for the statue is indicated , and
Mary Ellen	PERSON	, a drudge at the town tavern , is trotted out as the famous patriot 's nearest living relative .

		Dr.
O'Grady	PERSON	has some diffi - culties in getting all his allies into line , for Major Kent has scruples , the parish priest has fears lest
Regan	PERSON	may have been an atheist or a Jacobin ,
Thady Gallagher	PERSON	, the nationalist editor and agitator , has dark suspicions , and
Doyle	PERSON	, the publican , has to be persuaded that there is something in it for him .

		These difficulties are all overcome by Dr.
O'Grady	PERSON	's glib persuasiveness , and the preparations for the civic function go merrily on .


Doyle	PERSON	's nephew , a mortuary sculptor in
Dublin	LOCATION	, has an effigy on hand which , with slight alterations , will serve the purpose , and this is secured , to the profit of
Doyle	PERSON	and his nephew .

		The Lord-Lieutenant accepts an invitation to act as master of ceremonies , and all the delicate diplomatic problems of precedence are solved by the inventive
O'Grady	PERSON	.

		When the great day arrives , having discovered at the last moment that
Regan	PERSON	is a myth , he sends his aide-de-camp to represent him , and make an indignant demand for explanation of the imposture .

		This official is mere putty in
O'Grady	PERSON	's hands , who cajoles him into fulfilling his allotted function , and the ceremony goes off with great eclat .

		The question of music for the band to play is a seri - ous matter , but
O'Grady	PERSON	makes the lucky discovery that the government official does not know one tune from another , and so `` The Wearing of the Green '' is performed in place of '' Rule Britannia '' and '' God Save the King , '' thereby soothing the nationalist susceptibilities of the excitable

1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 23 who would otherwise have been quite capable of upsetting the whole affair .

		Billing turns up at the critical moment , and is much surprised to see what has grown out of the seed of his planting .

		But he proves a good sport , and more than fulfils his promises .

		This is one of the most joyous stories that
Canon Hannay	PERSON	has given us , and offers the most delightful entertainment imaginable .

		Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	overworks his vein .

		The rich ore becomes exhausted , and it is too evident that what he gives us afterward are tailings .

		It was so with the trilogy of Sanchia novels , each of which was thinner than the one before , and it is so again with '' Bendish , '' which continues the story of the group presented in `` Mrs.
Lancelot	PERSON	. ''

		It is true that
Bendish	PERSON	is a new figure , but
Georgiana	PERSON	and
Gervase Poore	PERSON	and the
Iron Duke	ORGANIZATION	are those upon which the author wellnigh exhausted his powers of analysis in the earlier novel .

		What he has to say of them now is either repetition or finical elaboration of what he said before .

		Of Bendish , it may be said at once that
Byron	PERSON	sat for his portrait a fact suffi - ciently obvious to all but the literal-minded who may urge that
Byron	PERSON	was dead at the time of the Reform Bill , and that , anyway , he never fought a duel with
Shelley	PERSON	.

		As the one original feature of the new novel , this character-study is all that saves it from futility .

		It is not wholly fair to the poet , because it places overmuch emphasis upon his weaknesses .

		After all , he was more than a , poseur , and his vapor - ings were more than the rhetorical exhibitions of an inordinate self-conceit .

		Considered as pure fiction , the characterization might fairly be described as masterly , but we are not permitted so to consider it as clearly a distortion of the features of a real man .

		In this novel , as in its predecessor , the
Duke of Devizes	ORGANIZATION	is the figure most sympathetically conceived , and we are always glad when he appears upon the scene .

		He represents the true type of aristocrat , as distinguished from the sham type personified by Bendish .

		`` The Dark Flower , '' according to Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	, is the flower of passionate love , which may blossom in the waste spaces of life at almost any age .

		In the life of
Mark Lennan	PERSON	, it bursts into bloom upon three occasions , the episodes being respectively labelled ''
spring	DATE	, '' ''
summer	DATE	, '' and `` autumn . ''

		This suggests the scheme of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's `` The Well-Beloved , '' although the three women in the present case are not in one line of descent .

		Mark 's first affair is with the wife of his Oxford tutor , a woman old enough to be his mother .

		The second ,
several years later	DATE	, is with a young married woman , the wife of a member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and she comes to a tragic end one night on the river , when the jealous husband breaks in upon their embraces .

		The third is an Irish girl , the daughter of an old-time comrade , who comes into the middle age of his life , and disturbs its tranquil flow with the appeal of her fresh youth and beauty very much as
Hilde	ORGANIZATION	stirred the emotions of Solness .

		This affair ends in the bitterness of an unavoidable renunciation .

		Besides the three women already mentioned , there is
Sylvia	LOCATION	, whom
Mark	PERSON	has married after his recovery from the tragic episode of ''
summer	DATE	. ''

		We mention Sylvia incidentally , because she does not count for much in the story of Mark 's emotional life , although she seems to be a lovely creature , and quite as good a wife as Mark deserves .

		The whole history is delicately told , with much subtle analysis , vivid exposition , and the charm of style in which few living writers equal Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		This writer never hesitates to play fast and loose with any of the conventions or institutions of ordered society , always finding in the claims of sentiment his ready justification , but , with all his artistry , he does not often succeed in being morally convincing .

		It seems to be almost impossible for our `` ad - vanced '' modern novelists to write a love story that is not based upon adultery .

		The honest love of a man for a woman appears to be too tame an affair to be deserving of their attention .

		For example , the narrator in `` The Passionate Friends , '' a novel in the first person by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, speaks thus of his illicit relation with another man 's wife : `` I wanted to be open and defiant , and she hesitated .

		She wanted to be secret .

		She wanted to keep me ; I sometimes think that she was moved to become my mistress because she wanted to keep me .

		But she wanted to keep everything else in her life , her position , her ample freedom and wealth and dignity .

		Our love was to be a secret cavern ,
Endymion	ORGANIZATION	's cave .

		I was ready enough to do what I could to please her , and for a time I served that secrecy , lied , pre - tended , agreed to false addresses , assumed names , and tangled myself in a net-work of furtive pro- ceedings .

		These are things that poison and con - sume honest love . ''

		The italics are ours .

		We use them for the purpose of emphasizing the nauseous cant by which such situations are defended .

		A little further on , we read that '' there is an invincible sense of wild Tightness about passionate love that no rea - soning and no training will ever altogether repudi - ate , '' and this is all the justification for immorality that the flabby ethics of the fashionable novelist seems to require .

		But we are constrained to believe that there is a reasoning and a training that will fortify the character against such sophistries ; if there were not , we should despair of education and , of society .

		The passionate `` friends '' of this story can not unite their lives legally because the man is too poor , and the woman too worldly to make the sacrifice of becoming his wife .

		That is the cold fact that underlies all this fine talk about the rights of the soul , and all these labored apologies for the sin in which the `` friends '' afterwards live .

		When they are discovered , the man goes to
South Africa	LOCATION	, distinguishes himself in the war , returns , and marries a girl who is much too good for him .

		But even then he can not escape from the obsession of his old passion , and the intrigue is ended only by the woman 's 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	suicide .

		There is a great deal of vaporing about some reorganized society of the future in which un - restrained individualism shall have the final word , but the author does not tell us how the integrity of the family and the stability of the social order are to be protected in that
Utopia	LOCATION	for the excellent reason that he does not know himself .

		The story is told in the form of a confession made for the guid - ance of the narrator 's son when he shall have grown to manhood , and is intolerably weighted with analy - sis and introspective philosophizing .

		It is a story that tingles with life and teems with ideas of a kind expressed in the striking and sometimes exalted style which the author has at his command .

		But we balk at the `` background of high idealism and prophecy of the future '' claimed for it in the publishers ' advertisements .

		Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	's '' Youth 's Encounter '' is a book that takes five hundred pages to tell the story of a boy 's life up to the age of twenty or there - abouts .

		It discusses in appalling detail his childhood and adolescence , taking him through his public school days and finally plumping him upon the world .

		We suppose that later volumes will carry on his story upon the same scale .

		He is an illegitimate child of the
Earl of Saxby	ORGANIZATION	, a fact that he first learns when his mother apprises him of it after his father 's death at the close of the work .

		During this boyhood life , he is thrown mainly upon his own resources -LRB- although he is materially well cared for -RRB- , owing to the fact that his mother spends most of her time abroad in her lover 's company .

		These unfortunate conditions seem to be carefully concealed from the world , and thus do not inure to his social disadvantage , as it might have been supposed that they would .

		This prefatory quotation from
Keats	PERSON	supplies a real guide to Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's aim in portraying the boy 's char - acter and development : '' The imagination of a boy is healthy , and the mature imagination of a man is healthy ; but there is a space of life between , in which the soul is in ferment ; the character unde - cided , the ambition thick-sighted . ''

		This condition of `` soul-ferment '' means , among other things , a certain measure of nasty suggestiveness in matters of sex , and the writer is unsparingly frank in deal - ing with these matters when they come up for men - tion , but they are not given an undue proportion of consideration , and for this we are thankful , thinking what might have been made of them .

		The book impresses us as an honest piece of artistic workman - ship , aiming at the exact truth of the adolescent period , and achieving that aim with much success .

		It has sustained interest at almost all points , despite its leisurely course and extreme particularity .

		Mr.
Louis Joseph Vance	PERSON	, hitherto known as a concocter of fantastic melodrama and a purveyor of breathless excitement , has turned over a new leaf .

		His previous novels have been almost beneath con - tempt ; his ``
Joan Thursday	PERSON	, '' now published , is a serious study of life and character which makes us marvel that the faculty here revealed should so long have remained latent .

		It is a real novel , of the kind that Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	, for example , writes , and demands to be judged by exacting critical standards .

		It is a story of the theatre , and Mr.
Vance	PERSON	brings to its writing a wide and intimate knowledge of the affairs of the stage in
New York	LOCATION	: he shows us the typical figures that move in that world apart from the rest of life , the theatrical boarding-house keeper , the manager and the pro- ducer , the ever-hopeful but oft disappointed play - wright , and the various derelicts of the profession itself .

		He gives us their tricks of speech and gesture , and imparts to us their outlook upon life .

		He does all this much as Mr.
Leonard Merrick	PERSON	does it for the English setting , and he gives it all the same surprising freshness of interest .

		His central figure is a full-length portrait of the girl who is determined to escape from sordid conditions , and fixes upon the stage as the means of emancipation .

		Joan is a shop-girl , vulgar and material , not immoral but unmoral , wishing to keep on the side of respecta - bility as far as outward appearances are concerned , but not unwilling to make secret terms with the devil .

		She has youthful freshness and beauty , but not genius , and it is through unwavering determi - nation and shrewdness in grasping opportunity that she so makes her way that we leave her in the end a recognized success .

		She has got what she wanted , but we feel that she has paid heavily for it , and that her character has steadily deteriorated as her professional prospects have brightened .

		Her love for the playwright who chivalrously came to her aid in her hour of distress might have been the means of her salvation if she had only cherished it ; instead , she chose to cast it aside for the sake of marriage to the cheap vaudeville actor with whom she becomes infatuated .

		When she takes this step , we feel that it is all over with her as far as our sympathies are concerned , and she becomes henceforth merely a curious object of study in the successive phases of her evolution .

		She remains interesting to us , be - cause she is always a little baffling , and because she is working out her career on the shifty and compromising lines which the average man or woman follows for lack of the anchor of a strong person - ality .

		Mr.
Vance	PERSON	's treatment of her does not seem to be ironic as we follow it , yet when we come to the last words , `` She was a success , '' we suddenly realize that his observation must have had the tinge of irony from the start .

		Joan 's men the play - wright , the vaudeville actor , the gilded youth about town , and the professional sensualist are all pho - tographically pictured and true to type .

		Such a gift for characterization as is here revealed is beyond anything that we had ever expected of Mr.
Vance	PERSON	. ''

		It was all too dreamy to put into words yet woman 's power , her bounty , her mystic valor , the tenderness and unconscious high behavior of un - known women everywhere , in whose hearts the sufferings of others find arable ground . ''

		In spite of this feeling -LRB- or conviction -RRB- , Mr.
Will Levington	PERSON	1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 25 Comfort does his best to put it into words , and with an ever-increasing power of expression .

		He has con - stituted himself the prophet of a very different sort of feminism from that which shrieks in the market - place and engages in a frantic scramble for a share of the goods and the functions that the instinct of the race has allotted to the stronger sex .

		It is the feminism which found its loveliest flowering in the age of chivalry , when it was woman 's chief glory to win and deserve the worship of man in the days before she had `` cheapen 'd Paradise , '' and had not forced poets to say of her regretfully : '' How given for nought her priceless gift , How spoil 'd the bread and spill 'd the wine , Which , spent with due respective thrift , Had made brutes men , and men divine ! ''

		Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	's '' Down among Men '' is the story of a man who , through the spiritual ministry of a high - souled woman , became almost divine , because he became filled with that deep compassion for his fel - lows which Christianity has always exalted as chief among the attributes of divinity .

		It is only through suffering and renunciation that this power may come to complete fruition , and
John Morning	ORGANIZATION	achieved it only at the cost of a woman 's love the love of the woman who is all the world to him .

		The sacrifice is forced upon him , in a way , for it is the woman who conceives the idea that it is her sacred obliga - tion , and who leaves him to work out his spiritual salvation in solitary anguish of soul .

		This is almost too poignant to be bearable , and that Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	should have deemed it necessary seems to us to de - note a strain of morbidity in his conception of life .

		It is the perversion of the Christian spirit which has been responsible for the excesses of puritanism and asceticism , and which developed the noble but un - natural ideal of celibacy in the practice of the church .

		Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	's thought needs a corrective , in the form of an infusion of hellenistic humanism , and if he does not care to go to the source for this remedy , we recommend to him a stiff course of Goethe .

		The opening of this novel is stirring and vivid , being based upon the author 's experience as a correspondent in the war between
Russia	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		His picture of the struggle in the field of Kao liang the Chinese millet out of which was born
Morning	ORGANIZATION	's great resolution , has the Tolstoyan handling , and the spirit of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	informs the subsequent developments of
Morning	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		How he gets his story through to
San Francisco	LOCATION	, how he meets the woman in the hospital , how he plunges into a debauch when he is left without her , how a renewal of her companion - ship restores his soul , and how , bereft of her by her supreme act of self-sacrifice , he finds himself com - pletely and learns the utmost meaning of consecra - tion , setting down in words that burn the true significance of war these are the things that follow the dramatic prologue , and are set forth with a sense of beauty and a power of conviction that are expres - sive of the author 's terrible earnestness and deep sincerity . ''

		It is a story of the path at our feet , of the Compassionates who draw near to speak , when we are brave enough to listen , of the women who walk beside us .

		A tale of the road as we go many are ahead , many behind but we do not travel this stretch again . '' ''

		Down among Men '' seems to us the most exalted and appealing story that Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	has thus far written .

		It is a new
Jack London	PERSON	who appeals to us as a preacher of the simple life in `` The Valley of the Moon . ''

		He does not appear in the disguise all at once , however , and for the first half of the story he is still familiar as the impassioned advocate of socialism and the exalter of men with red blood in their veins .

		His hero ,
Billy Roberts	PERSON	, is an Oak - land teamster , who does occasional stunts of prize - fighting `` on the side , '' and who is a singular compound of brutality and gentleness .

		His gentle side is displayed toward
Saxon Brown	PERSON	, a girl who works in a laundry , and it wins her love .

		When hard times come , and he is out of work in conse - quence of a strike , his brutal side is evidenced by his slugging `` scab '' teamsters and breaking their arms .

		When his own arms are broken by another plug-ugly on account of a mistaken identification , it strikes us as an example of righteous retribution .

		We are now midway in the narrative , and at this point the pair form a great resolution .

		They will forsake the city and turn to the soil for a living .

		They start out , all their worldly goods on their backs , in search of a new home .

		They tramp up and down
California	LOCATION	and
Oregon	LOCATION	, and are aston - ished at the opportunities the country offers to a man who is not afraid to work and this at the very time when men are maiming and killing each other in the frantic struggle for jobs in the city .

		They become so enamored of life in the open air that even the thought of moving pictures does not tempt them to seek the old ways of city life .

		They learn that there is such a thing as intensive cultiva - tion , and that a man may gain wealth from a very few acres if only he will deal with them intelligently .

		Finally , they find a small irrigated fruit farm in `` The Valley of the Moon , '' which exactly fits their needs , and they settle down upon it with every pros - pect of success and happiness .

		This seems to us to be the most wholesome book , as well as the most interesting , that Mr.
London	PERSON	has written , and his new gospel of '' back to nature '' is a far more accept - able one than the sordid and violent socialistic gos - pel that he has hitherto mainly dinned into our ears .

		The
Canadian Mounted Police	ORGANIZATION	force has often figured in works of fiction in the books of Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	and ``
Ralph Connor	PERSON	, '' for example but never before quite so effectively as in Mr.
G. B. Lancaster	PERSON	's `` The Law-Bringers . ''

		This story of life in the northern wilderness is marked by great powers of characterization and beauty of style as well as by swift dramatic movement and successful construction .

		It is the story of two officers of the force , close friends at heart , yet at odds with one another in vital matters .

		A half-breed woman , extraordinarily fascinating and the very incarnation 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	of primitive sensuous animality , becomes the object of a mad infatuation on the part of one of the men , whereupon the other lures her away , not in pursuance of his own desires which are irrevocably fixed upon another object of affection but to open his friend 's eyes and save him from himself .

		This re - sults in a series of tense situations , which are master - fully handled , and have for their setting the awful solitudes of the frozen north .

		The author brings to his task the most intimate knowledge of the scenes described and the most deeply human sympathies .

		All the way through the book we were conscious of something elusively familiar , and this consciousness eventually crystallized in the thought that it was just such a book as Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	might have written of these people and places .

		To say this is to bestow high praise indeed , but not higher , we think , than is deserved .

		The matter-of-fact stories of Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	become mere stage-carpentry in comparison with this powerful transcription of life , and even Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's work in this field , steeped in poetic feeling though it is , seems artificial melodrama .


Evan Blount	PERSON	, the only son of Senator
Blount	PERSON	of a western state which we may as well call
Nevada	LOCATION	as anything else , has been educated at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and is about to settle down in the
East	LOCATION	for the practice of the law when his father sends him a telegram suggesting that he might do worse than come West and grow up with his native state .

		When he acts upon this suggestion , he knows little of his father , having been away from home nearly all his life , and upon his return is surprised to find that the '' Sage-Brush Senator '' is not only a man of enormous wealth , but is also the undisputed `` boss '' of a huge political machine in his state , a man who exacts tribute from the corporations at his feet , and who dictates the outcome of elections with absolute authority .

		The young man has an equipment of fairly-seasoned moral ideals , and is startled by what he learns about his father 's methods and activities .

		It takes some time to open his eyes to the situation , and for a while he is fooled to the top of his bent , both by his father 's own henchmen , and by the officers of the railway corporation with which the senator is grappling .

		The struggle between the corporation and the political machine provides the book with its substance , and when
Evan	PERSON	discovers that he is being made a tool of the corrupt agencies at work , he revolts , and starts out to purify the state , although in taking this stand , he expects that the exposure he plans will disgrace his father and send him to the penitentiary .

		In the end , it does not turn out to be as bad as all that , and the sena - tor even receives a thin coating of whitewash , but the situation is tense with excitement for a while .

		`` The Honorable Senator Sage-Brush '' is the title of this romance of business , politics , and reform , and the story is told by Mr.
Francis Lynde	PERSON	with all the crispness and forcef ulness that he has taught us to expect .

		Its greatest success is in the portraiture of Senator
Blount	PERSON	shrewd , self-possessed , grimly humorous , and human enough to make us almost ready to condone his evil practices .

		Mr.
Reginald Wright Kaufman	PERSON	prefaces his new novel , `` The Spider 's Web , '' with an `` Ex - planation . ''

		In this document he tells us that he planned four years ago a cycle of four novels , `` all carrying forward a definite view of life . ''

		That view appears to be the Tolstoyan opinion that all com - pulsion is evil , but there is a good deal of question - begging in the author 's use of the word `` compul - sion . ''

		For example , it is the `` compulsion '' of inadequate wages that forces girls into the career so realistically described in `` The House of Bondage . ''

		In `` The Sentence of Silence , '' it is `` compulsion '' that keeps young people in ignorance of the facts of sex to their undoing .

		In `` Running Sands , '' the argument ran against `` compulsion by matrimony '' `` the forcing of wives to become mothers '' be - cause they have accepted the responsibilities of wed - lock .

		One might say something in behalf of duty in these cases , but this aspect of the subject Mr.
Kaufman	PERSON	conveniently ignores .

		In `` The Spider 's Web , '' the author inveighs against `` the sin of com - pulsion exerting itself against humanity in all the powers that conduct modern society ; in the owner - ship of men and things ; in our entire system of production and distribution , and in the creatures and ministers of that system : Government , Politics , Law , and what passes by the name of Religion . ''

		In this novel , the arch - villain , who is the `` spider , '' is unnamed , but designated simply as '' a man . ''

		This abstinence from indulgence in personality will not deceive any one , for in the character thus styled there are so many traits taken from the life of the late
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	that there is no difficulty in discovering the portrait to be a caricature of that eminent financier .

		No more wool is pulled over our eyes than was done in the case of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's Bendish , who is clearly
Byron	PERSON	projected into the years following his death .

		The protagonist in this fiction the undaunted
David	PERSON	who arms himself with a sling against this Goliath is our old friend the district attorney , who has done valiant battle against the powers of corruption in so many recent novels of the muck-raking type .

		The fact that he wages a losing fight , and is broken in the end , is the main differentiation in the present case , for Mr.
Kaufman	PERSON	will have none of the optimism implied by the happy ending , and preserves a consistently dismal outlook .

		The last words of the dying hero are these : '' God damn your system and your poli - tics !

		God damn your law and your government !

		God damn your god ! ''

		Mr.
Kaufman	PERSON	probably thinks that - this is strong writing , but it must be urged that there is nothing very constructive in such an attitude toward a social organization , which , however bad , is doubtless working its way darkly in the direction of the good .

		This crude and melo - dramatic anarchism is too emotional to be impres - sive , and too biassed to make any serious appeal to the rational mind .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL , 27 BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Reflections of a veteran naturalist .

		With the passing of the years Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	's contributions to the literature of natural history gain in richness and ripeness , showing in each successive volume an increased keenness of observation , an added literary charm , a wiser philosophy of life in its immeasurable wholeness and wonderfulness .

		That even now , in his eighth decade , his eye is not dim or his natural force abated , is made strikingly evident on every page of his latest hook , `` The Summit of the Years '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The personal , autobiographic note that sounds so pleasantly in many a paragraph is heard in the preface , in which he says : `` It seems as if one never could get to the end of all the delightful things there are to know , and to observe , and to speculate about in the world .

		Nature is always young , and there is no greater felicity than to share in her youth .

		I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think , all the walks I want to take , all the books I want to read , and all the friends I want to see . ''

		Again it is heard , and more clearly , in the opening chapter , which gives its title to the whole collection , and which reveals with charming frankness something of the innermost nature of the man .

		Another chapter , `` A Barn - Door Outlook , '' combines delight - fully both the intimately personal and the natural - historical quality .

		In certain richly suggestive reflections on `` The Hit-and-Miss Methods of Na - ture , '' the writer makes it clear even to an unsci - entific reader that no scheme of evolution , ideally perfect though it may be in theory , can claim exemption from an infinity of disconcerting limita - tions and modifications .

		In other words , the vast , inexplicable mystery , as well as the beauty and order , of the universe is made more undeniable as we turn the pages of this clear-eyed and thoughtful student of nature 's methods .

		With the vexed question of animal intelligence he promises his readers that he will never again trouble either them or himself .

		One can not but query whether the whole controversy has not arisen from an imperfect initial agreement on what intelligence really is as distinguished from instinct .

		A few more chapter - headings may serve here to whet still further the reader 's desire .

		`` A Hay-Barn Idyl , '' `` In the Noon of Science , '' `` Untaught Wisdom , '' `` The Round World , '' `` In Field and Wood , '' and `` The Bow in the Clouds '' might be named as among the book 's best chapters , were it not nearer the truth to say that its contents are uniformly excellent .

		A good portrait of the author in an environment at once appropriate and picturesque appears as fron - tispiece .

		A new series The third volume of Mr.
Edwin	PERSON	of strindbera 's
Bjorkman	PERSON	's translation of
Strind	LOCATION	- translatedplavs .

		berg > 8 playg -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is not the least interesting of the series .

		In the words of Mr.
BjOrkman	PERSON	, this collection `` is unusually representa - tive , giving what might be called a cross-section of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's development as a dramatist from his naturalistic revolt in the middle eighties , to his final arrival at resigned mysticism and Swedenborgian symbolism . ''

		The reader travels from
1888	DATE	to
1907	DATE	, and from
Nietzsche	LOCATION	to
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
Sweden	LOCATION	- borg , a sufficient journey for anyone to make between the two covers of a book .

		`` Swanwhite , '' the long fairy tale given the place of honor in this volume , is to us the least interesting of all .

		Strind - berg was avowedly inspired by
Maeterlinck	PERSON	to dig for this tale in his own mines ; and while the influ - ence of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	is everywhere apparent , there is not as much allegorical consistency even as in the Belgian 's tales .

		And there is immeasurably less appeal to children about it .

		As a fairy-tale , `` Advent '' -LRB- here described as `` a miracle play '' -RRB- is much better .

		Despite elements and details of un - questioned power , the dream-current of sheer fancy and the rather ostentatious strain of religious senti - mentalism break up repeatedly both imaginative and reflective thought .

		`` Simoon '' is a single-act piece of great power .

		Its exhibition of the relentless force of suggestion on a human mind , and the work - ing of an implacable hatred , is probably unsurpassed in literature .

		As a drama , `` Debit and Credit '' bears the palm .

		This is an attempt to embody the Nietzschean idea of a super-man .

		We doubt if a single act ever before involved and evolved such a tangled skein of life .

		On the whole , the sympathies of the spectator incline to the super-man , but with many a puzzled glance at the other actors in the little play .


Strindberg	LOCATION	's intellectual fairness and his almost uncanny power of showing both sides of the truth are nowhere shown to better advantage .

		`` The Thunder Storm '' and `` After the Fire '' are largely autobiographic .

		The former records the pathos of the effort to find peace in old age .

		The hero is of course not strictly a hero , and the curtain falls amidst a depth of unrelieved gloom .

		If one were to take `` After the Fire '' at its face value , one would conclude that
Strindberg	LOCATION	believed every family history to be rotten to the core , a heap of putres - cent lies .

		Perhaps in reading the whole of
Strind	LOCATION	- berg 's work at a stretch one would get the proper balance for such a play as this .

		But an artist can - not make this demand ; he must content himself with an hour of our time .

		Thus it is that `` After the Fire '' can not fail to depress beyond words .

		Outlines of
America	LOCATION	is a fruitful field for the -
United States	LOCATION	historian , and continues to be worked !

		history .

		and often re-worked .

		Professor
John Spencer Bassett	PERSON	's `` Short History of the
United	ORGANIZATION	' States '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the latest volume to court the favor of educators and general readers .

		The author 's sense of proportion is fairly good , though there is a slight tendency toward too mnch military history , especially in dealing with the Civil and Spanish wars .

		The newer idea in the writing of history has become too strong to be ignored , and its influence is seen here in the amount of space devoted ^ 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	to economic and social conditions .

		Yet the real bear - ing of these conditions is not always made plain .

		For example , the financial and commercial disorders following the Revolution are briefly described , some - what after the manner of Fiske ; but the real connec - tion of the moneyed and commercial classes with the movement for a stronger national government is not made unmistakably clear .

		When the reader learns that many of the most active leaders in the
Conven	LOCATION	- tion of
1787	DATE	held securities , he will better appreciate their desire for a government with power to collect taxes and pay its debts in none but good money .

		The remark of
Gerry	PERSON	, that
New England	LOCATION	would never join the
Union	ORGANIZATION	unless
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was clothed with power to pass a Navigation Act , makes clear the commercial ends of that section .

		The members of the Society of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, and other holders of western lands , wanted to see the value of their lands enhanced , and so they supported the Constitution .

		Professor
Bassett	PERSON	says that the men of the Rev - olution hated nothing more than monarchy and aris - tocracy .

		But their hatred of these forms was only equalled by their fear of democracy , and so they pro- ceeded to curb democracy by creating a new form of aristocracy entrenched with privileges .

		To break the force of this , which has retreated from one strong - hold to another , has been the main task of democ - racy ever since .

		In its treatment of the latest phase of this struggle , the book is somewhat disappointing .

		It tells briefly of the growth of the trusts , railroad building and railroad stealing , the attempts at con - servation of natural resources -LRB- though little about their rape -RRB- , pension graft , etc. ; but there is little about the movements of democracy , beyond a record of legislative enactments -LRB- the connection of which with economic conditions is not always made clear -RRB- having for their end the recovery of its own .

		Pos - sibly the limitations of space had something to do with this , as intimated in the Preface ; but one is not sure that Professor
Bassett	PERSON	really understands the deeper significance of economic and social move - ments and their relation to that political and con - stitutional history of which he is still a devotee .

		However , as historical writing now goes , he has given us a reasonably good book , indeed , one that is better than most of its predecessors of like compass .

		`` Loiterer 's Harvest '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , b y Mr - E - v -
Lucas	PERSON	> p resents in book-form a considerable variety of entertaining trifles , chiefly reprinted , with varia - tions , from `` Punch , '' `` The Pall Mall Gazette , '' and `` The Guardian . ''

		Like
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, with whom Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's name is so inseparably associated in most readers ' minds , the author of '' A Little of Everything '' and '' One Day and Another '' is at his best in the short essay of semi-humorous , semi - serious , and often whimsical character ; and to this class of writing his latest book distinctly belongs .

		Especially characteristic is the little paper on `` In - sulence '' not Insolence which might almost have come from the pen that wrote `` Imperfect Sympathies . ''

		The word `` insulence , '' Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	explains , perhaps superfluously , is an invention of his own , `` a blend of ` insular ' and ` insolence , ' and it was coined to describe that habit and carriage of Englishmen abroad which are found so objec - tionable by Continentals who have not our island heritage of security and liberty . ''

		Another notable chapter treats of ''
Thackeray	PERSON	at the
Punch Table	LOCATION	, '' being based on the unpublished '' Dinner Diary '' of
Henry Silver	ORGANIZATION	.

		Still another eminently Elian essay describes the form in which the monthly bills of an exceptionally honest provision-dealer , evidently gifted with a sense of humor , are made out .

		Here are two items , worded with a strict regard to the customer 's orders : `` 1 really tender duckling -LRB- the last was n't -RRB- , 4s . ''

		`` 1 pork-pie , 2 lb. , not the kind with crust like plaster of
Paris	LOCATION	, but a soft short crust , into which the flavour of the meat has found its way , 2s .

		4d . ''

		Truly , a pork pie fit for the palate of the author of '' A Dissertation upon Roast Pig '' !

		Drawings by Mr.
George Morrow	PERSON	, one of Mr.
Punch	PERSON	's artists , accompany a short sketch penned in his praise -LRB- G. M. 's , that is -RRB- , and a view of '' The
White House	ORGANIZATION	at Chelsea '' appears in pho - togravure as frontispiece .

		The industries A book of undeniable `` human in - ofmediceval terest , '' and far less technical than
England	LOCATION	.

		the title would suggest , is Mr.
L. F. Salzmann	PERSON	's '' English Industries of the Middle Ages '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Whether the reader be an antiquarian , or a member of the
I. W. W.	PERSON	, or a mere unclassified layman , he will find distinctly absorbing and instruc - tive matter in this volume .

		The chapters discuss Mining , Quarrying , Metal - Working , Pottery , Cloth - Making , Leather - Working , and
Brewing	ORGANIZATION	, with a final word on `` The Control of Industry . ''

		The author 's method is '' to treat the leading mediaeval industries one by one , showing as far as possible their chief centres , their chronological development , the condi - tions and the methods of working . ''

		He appeals frankly to '' the general reader , equipped with in - terest in the history of his country . ''

		The book is authoritative , precise , based upon careful study of documentary evidence , and is surprisingly compre - hensive .

		There is no lack of specific facts and figures , yet these are all presented in an engagingly lucid style , entirely free from any tendency to apotheosize statistics .

		Important questions regarding labor are discussed ; and little matters of custom , honest and dishonest , are revealed .

		The reader feels that the author has selected and arranged his material with great economy , never missing a significant item , or failing to perceive the varied appeals that small facts may make .

		The account of glass-making , for in - stance , will interest artists , tourists , and students of literature , as well as craftsmen .

		Whether by design or by accident , almost no references to the contem - porary literature of the Middle Ages are included , although readers familiar with that period will find this volume an illuminating commentary on many passages .

		There are pages in the book where refer -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 29 ences to `` Piers Plowman '' would have been valu - able , for instance : on page 155 , where the ne - farious practice of stretching cloth overmuch is described , an apt comparison may be made with ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, '' B text , Passus V , lines 212-14 .

		It is to be hoped that Mr.
Salzmann	PERSON	will continue to publish his researches in economic fields , for he has the gift of knowing what is significant .

		, , Several years ago that modern Conquering the J & greatest of
Munchausen	LOCATION	, Dr. .

		b. A. book , pub - American peaks . -RSB-

		i 8ne d a circumstantial account of his adventures in climbing to the summit of
Mount McKinley	ORGANIZATION	.

		His book , `` The Top of Our
Conti	PERSON	- nent , '' even contains some quite impressive pictures of the peak , with
Cook	ORGANIZATION	's companion
Barrill	PERSON	gallantly waving a flag from the topmost crag .

		Mr.
Belmore Browne	PERSON	has been unkind enough to turn
Cook	PERSON	's nar - rative into a fairy tale .

		In his `` Conquest of Mount McKinley '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , he proves conclusively , not merely by the dry testimony of facts , but by dupli - cating
Cook	PERSON	's photographs on the spot , that that en - terprising explorer was twenty miles from the peak he pretended to have climbed , and that the scene he describes as `` The Top of Our Continent the
Summit of Mount McKinley	ORGANIZATION	, the highest mountain of
North America	LOCATION	Altitude 20,390 feet , '' is in reality an excellent photograph of an outcrop of rock in a snow-field , about 5300 feet above sea - level , So are the mighty fallen !

		This , however , is only an incident in an exceedingly interesting narrative of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's attempts to reach the summit of
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	, attempts which were finally crowned with success , in
July , 1912	DATE	, after a series of adven - tures that must have daunted the heart of any less plucky and determined an explorer .

		The actual summit was not reached , the explorers being driven back by a wild blizzard when within a few hundred feet of the top ; but to all intents and purposes Mr.
Browne	PERSON	is perfectly justified in claiming the con - quest of
Mount McKinley	ORGANIZATION	.

		The remaining distance consisted of a perfectly easy slope ; and nothing but the extraordinary weather conditions , which made it suicidal to continue , prevented him and his com - panion , Professor
Parker	PERSON	, from pushing on to the summit .

		The book is splendidly illustrated with a series of photographs taken by the explorers on their several trips to and from
Mount McKinley	ORGANIZATION	.

		The nature of hvsteria .

		Dr.
Charles D. Fox	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	has brought together under the title , `` The Psycho-pathology of Hys - teria '' -LRB- Badger -RRB- , a presentation which , in addition to its direct usefulness to the medical profession , may well influence the views of a larger public .

		Hysteria has claims to be considered as one of the most significant terms in the language .

		It is readily abused , both within the medical profession and out - side it .

		The physician is prone to consider too closely the unusual and the morbid ; and the layman fights shy of the word for fear of implying more than he is ready to admit .

		Dr.
Fox	PERSON	's book has the advantage of incorporating the newer phases of mental disease in which the psychic factor is more comprehensively recognized than ever before .

		The importance of suggestion is paramount ; and it becomes clear that many of the symptoms which earlier medical men discovered as characteristic of hysteria were really suggested by them .

		With the present understand - ing of the scope of suggestion , it becomes indeed difficult to define the symptoms of the disease .

		The focus is clear , but the form and range of the orbit are rather vague .

		None the less , despite the diffi - culty of description and the common danger of lay - ing too much stress upon extreme , if interesting cases , there emerges a generic conception of the hysteric vagaries definite enough to guide the practitioner in his treatment , and illuminating for the general student of mind .

		This double purpose inevitably produces the usual difficulty of serving two masters , with a consequent occasional neglect of the interests of the one or the other .

		Admitting this drawback , the book yet advances the facilities for adequate acquaintance with one of the most interesting fields of modern research in mental pathology .

		Humorous , whimsical , witty , but , per - ha P s more tha .

		n all < mildlv 8atiri .

		cal and gently cynical are the twenty-nine short papers written by Mr.
Robert J. Shores	PERSON	and published under the collective title , `` New Brooms '' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is not so much the efficacy of the new broom that the little essays in some instances , at least , not all inculcate as the tran - sitoriness of that efficacy .

		New brooms sweep clean , but their newness is gone when sweeping day next comes around .

		As a sad-eyed friend of the present reviewer recently expressed it , '' everything peters out . ''

		At the end of the book , a supposed author of middle age , who signs his name , ''
Hackett A. Long	PERSON	, '' says in reviewing his professional experi - ence : '' My first novel has left me with a reputation , a two-years lease of an expensive apartment , a load of debts , an angry wife , a scrap-book filled with favorable reviews , an unsalable manuscript , and a prospect of bankruptcy . ''

		And he advises all hack writers who may cherish an ambition similar to the one that has caused his own undoing to remain con - tent with their comfortable obscurity .

		Unlike the contents of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's short-lived periodical , these modern essays addressed `` to the Editor of ` The Idler ' '' are delightfully spirited , written each in a single brisk dash of the pen , the frolicsome offspring of a nimble fancy , and so not in the least labored or ponderous or wearisome .

		They are heartily enjoyable in both substance and style .

		Ingenious and amusing are the names assigned to the supposed correspondents of `` The Idler . ''

		A letter on poetic license is signed , `` P. Rose '' ; one on certain modern tendencies in poetry is from ''
Anna	PERSON	Pest '' ; one on the abuses of adversity is subscribed , `` Edward Easyman '' ; a protest against the use of 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	tobacco is offered by ''
B. Z. Body	PERSON	'' ; and a rather sour epistle from a spinster is the composition of `` Sarah Shelf worn . ''

		There is no little `` bite '' in the book , and it will bring delight to all but the irreclaimable optimist .

		Enoiish water - Mr - C - E -
Hughes	PERSON	' * little book on color artists of `` Early English Water Colour o centurv ago .

		-LRB- McClurg -RRB- contains thirty-seven ex - cellent reproductions of eighteenth and early nine - teenth century water - colors , the work mainly of the landscape school which prepared the way for and surrounded
Turner	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author , himself a collector , seems especially interested in the passing over of one kind of technique into another .

		He attempts , for instance , to trace the influence of steel and copper engraving on the first water-colorists , an influence which he finds evidenced by a certain hardness of line and limitation of tone values or dryness of color in the painting of such men as
Francis Towne	PERSON	.

		Technique , however , is not the only phase of the subject that interests him .

		In the old color-prints and their originals he discovers social documents of importance , and shows among other things the place taken by `` gentlemen 's houses '' and the compli - mentary representation of them in the evolution of landscape art , a curious side-light , by the way , on the custom of noble patronage in the eighteenth cen - tury .

		Supporting these suggestions of the significant tendencies in his theme , Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	brings together a great many biographical details concerning the men he discusses , thus illuminating the genesis of their masterpieces .

		The effect of the whole is to give Turner a place merely as one of a group of interesting painters rather than , as
Ruskin	PERSON	aimed to prove , the sole peak in the British art of his time .

		Joteph Pulitzer That our Country is now enjoying a and his fair degree of prosperity , at peace `` World . ''

		within her borders and at war with no external power , and witnessing the pleasing spec - tacle of a national government representing the popular vote in both executive and legislative depart - ments , might seem to a reader of '' The Story of a Page '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
John L. Heaton	PERSON	, to be chiefly due to the powerful agency of the
New York	LOCATION	'' World . ''

		After a brief review of
Joseph Pulitzer	PERSON	's previous record in newspaper affairs , the book re - hearses , in some detail and with frequent quotations from the `` World 's '' editorial page , the policy of that influential journal from the day when it ceased to wear , as a contemporary expressed it , '' the sar - donic leer and avaricious grin of Mr.
Jay Gould	PERSON	, '' to the day when , as Mr.
Heaton	PERSON	tells us , '' the fruit of thirty years of fighting since
Joseph Pulitzer	PERSON	re - established ` The World ' seemed fair upon the tree .

		For the first time since the civil war the people had taken control of their own government . ''

		In other words , the book is a review , a most vivid and read - able review , of American political history from
May , 1883	DATE	, to
November , 1912	DATE	; and if its viewpoint is not that of one absolutely free from bias and separated by centuries of time and oceans of space from the events and scenes depicted , its style is undoubtedly by so much the gainer in respect to warmth and color and other qualities that help to arrest the reader 's attention and hold it to the end .

		Sargent 's portrait of Mr.
Pulitzer	PERSON	is reproduced for the frontispiece .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Having resided in
China	LOCATION	during his youth , and having held for a time a professorship in the Imperial Uni - versity in
Kyoto	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, Mr.
Joseph K. Goodrich	PERSON	pos - sesses the sort of first-hand knowledge of the Orient which is essential to a satisfactory discussion of any of the peoples and problems of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		This personal acquaintance with the Chinese people renders his little volume , '' Our Neighbors the Chinese '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , very readable and informing .

		For the hasty reader it is one of the best treatises available .

		The book is , unfortunately , devoid of any charm of style , but it is packed with the kind of information one wishes to secure in regard to human beings somewhat unlike ourselves .

		Mr.
William S. Walsh	PERSON	's '' A Handy-Book of Curious Information '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is a successor to two similar works , and includes much matter that it would be diffi - cult to find elsewhere .

		Sometimes the information is misinformation , as when we are told that marble dust and sulphuric acid are the chief ingredients of soda - water , and that high pressure makes them '' wholesome and palatable in combination . ''

		The trouble with reference-books of this character is that they index matters which no one would think of looking for , such as '' Twenty-three and Skidoo , '' and that they do not often contain the things one wishes to learn about .

		But for reading pure and simple , without the intention of research , they are both instructive and entertaining .

		That
Giosue Carducci	PERSON	was , with the single exception of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, the '' greatest -LSB- poet -RSB- alive in
Europe	LOCATION	at the opening of the twentieth century '' is a fact beyond question .

		It is surprising how little knowledge of him is available to English readers , and Mr.
G. L. Bickersteth	PERSON	has done us a valuable service by preparing the volume which has '' Carducci '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- for its simple title .

		The contents include three essays on his life , his poetry , and his metrics ; a bibliography and some notes , and over two hundred pages of the poems themselves the original Italian and the English trans - lation facing each other on opposite pages .

		We are extremely grateful for this work , which should do much to make
Carducci	PERSON	a reality , rather than a great name merely , to English readers .

		We wish that every college student in the country might read and take to heart the collection of '' Essays for College Men '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- which has recently been put together by a committee of instructors in the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		The essays are fourteen in number , among the most notable being classical examples from
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Tyndall	LOCATION	,
Newman	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, and
Harrison	PERSON	, be - sides more recent papers of American origin .

		The latter include President
Wilson	PERSON	on '' The
College Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, ''
William James	PERSON	on '' The Social Value of the College-Bred , '' Professor
G. E. Woodberry	PERSON	on `` First Principles , '' and President
Meiklejohn	PERSON	's recent inaug - ural address .

		All these essays are specimens both of good writing and of good counsel , and no young man reading them could fail to be the better for the task .

SILAS WEIR MITCHELL	PERSON	.

		The last thing that could be said of Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	was that he lagged superfluous on the stage .

		When he came to
Chicago	LOCATION	year before last , as the guest of the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	, he made the impression of a man who , despite some of the physical signs of advanced age , had all the mental alertness of a man in his prime .

		His zest in living was certainly not impaired , and the evident fact that he was a sage did not mean for him aloofness from human interests , or any dulling of the genial personality which made him one of the most companionable of men .

		He enjoyed the society of his fellows quite as keenly as they enjoyed their intercourse with him .

		His vast interest in humanity kept him mentally alive , and made him the central figure of any group which in - cluded him in its numbers ; although he might well have rested on his octogenarian laurels , and been content with the tribute of admiration which the younger generations were so ready to pay him .

		His novel of last year was perhaps the best he ever gave us , firm in its marshalling of material , incisive in its characterization , and having about it no suggestion of senility .

		It might have been the work of a man of forty , except for the comprehensiveness of its survey and the ripeness of its wisdom .

		Lowell once spoke of an acquaintance as `` quite literary for a Philadelphian . ''

		This humorous aspersion upon the culture of the
Quaker City	ORGANIZATION	loses its point when we take stock of the total contribution of Philadelphians to our literature , and the name of Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	alone would suffice to put it out of court .

		In years alone , he was the dean of our letters , and he might have filled that office in a more sub - stantial sense if he had not given half a century of life to science before he took up the calling of the literary artist .

		It is said that when a young man , his mind was balanced between choosing medicine -LRB- his father 's profession -RRB- and literature for his life work , and that he chose the former upon the advice of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, who was equally distinguished in both callings .

		The Autocrat s advice was for medicine first , with letters as an avocation or reserve resource , and the young student accepted it .

		He made for himself a world - wide fame as a physician , and 46 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Jan. 16 then	DATE	, past fifty , at an age when most men are content to rest on their oars , he began the career which is now the reason of our mourning in his death the loss of one of our foremost poets and novelists .

		It is one of the most extraordi - nary life-histories in our annals .

		The creative impulse is usually spent at the age when Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	first yielded himself to its mastery , but in his case the new task was taken up with all the vigorous delight of youth , and with the added power that comes from wide experience of life , and the ripe wisdom that the years alone can give .

		Upwards of a score of novels , and several collections of poems , all written since
1880	DATE	, attest the fertility of his genius , and add an - other example to the list given in
Longfellow	LOCATION	's '' Morituri Salutamus '' of those who have shown '' How far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow Into the arctic regions of our lives , Where little else than life itself survives . ''


Mitchell	PERSON	was born in
Philadelphia	LOCATION
February 15 , 1829	DATE	, and when he died , on the fourth of this month , he was within six weeks of complet - ing his eighty-fifth year .

		His college education was cut short by illness , but the degree which he thus failed to obtain was made up for him many times over by the professional and honorary degrees bestowed upon him in after life .

		For over a quarter of a century he stifled his literary aspirations , and devoted himself assiduously to the practice of his profession , gaining a world - wide reputation as a specialist in nervous dis - eases .

		This period included a term of service as an army surgeon in the Civil War .

		His con - tributions to the technical literature of his pro- fession number a hundred or more , and include research studies of the most important descrip - tion .

		A few of the more important titles are : ''
Gunshot Wounds	ORGANIZATION	and Other Injuries of the Nerves , '' `` Rest in the Treatment of Disease , '' `` Researches on the Venom of Poisonous Ser - pents , '' '' Relations of Nervous Disorders in Women to Pelvic Disease , '' and `` Rest Treat - ment and Psychic Medicine . ''

		These profes - sional writings were continued far down into the period of his literary authorship , and he never wholly abandoned his practice .

		He once gave this explanation of his dual life as a writer : '' When success in my profession gave me the free - dom of long
summer	DATE	holidays the despotism of my habits of work would have made entire idleness mere ennui .

		I turned to what except for stern need would have been my life-long work from youth literature and bored by idleness wrote my first novel .

		There is a lesson for you never to be idle . ''

		In any land but this such an experiment as a suc - cessful novel would have injuriously affected the pro- fessional career of a medical consultant , or so I was told by an eminent English physician .

		I need not say that this is not the American way of looking at life .

		If you give your best to medicine and the law , you may write novels or verse , or play golf or ride the wildest colt of hobbies . ''

		The first of
Mitchell	PERSON	's long list of novels was `` Hepzibah Guiness '' -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , which was fol - lowed by `` Roland Blake '' -LRB- 1884 -RRB- , `` Far in the Forest '' -LRB- 1888 -RRB- , and several others not mentioned .

		Then came , in
1898	DATE	, his great suc - cess of ``
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	, '' probably the best novel of the American Revolution ever written , which placed him in the foremost rank of our novelists .

		In
1907	DATE	came `` The
Red City	LOCATION	, '' a companion piece to ``
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	, '' and only a few weeks ago '' Westways , '' a great novel of the Civil War .

		A few other notable works of fiction of the later period are : '' Dr. North and His Friends , '' `` The Adventures of
Francis	PERSON	, '' ``
Constance Trescot	PERSON	, '' and ``
John Sherwood	PERSON	. ''

		The two Revolutionary fictions and the one based upon the Civil War represent his highest achievement , and best illustrate what may be called his ecological treatment of character and incident .

		He knew his backgrounds as few novelists have ever known them , and he always kept environment in view as a penetrating and shaping influence upon life .

		To quote from the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' : '' He had almost literally lived in the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	of the days of
Andrews Meschianza	PERSON	and
Washington	LOCATION	's
Valley Forge	ORGANIZATION	.

		He knew from delving here and there just what buildings had antedated the prim brick and marble fronts of his day ; how the passers in the streets were dressed , of what they talked , and whither they were bound .

		So he came to his writing .

		He was per - sonally acquainted with Revolutionary days and doings , one might say . ''

		It goes without saying that the specialist in the pathology of the mind , the physician who was the repository of thousands of the most intimate personal confessions , was also extraordinarily well-equipped on the psychological or analytical side to become a master of fiction , and the power and truth of
Mitchell	ORGANIZATION	's creative work rest upon the twin pillars of knowledge above outlined .


Mitchell	PERSON	's connection with the stage is illus - trated by '' The Miser , '' a brief morality which was in
Wilson Barrett	PERSON	's repertoire , and by a dramatization , made by his son , of '' The Adven - tures of Francois . ''

		As a poet ,
Mitchell	PERSON	earned high distinction ; the collected edition of
1896	DATE	included ``
Francis Drake	PERSON	, '' ``
Philip Vernon	PERSON	, '' `` The Cup of Youth , '' and '' Fran ?

		ois Villon , '' all of which had previously had separate pub - lication , and enough other pieces , exhibiting such variety of form and treatment as to rank
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 47 their author with such men as
Taylor	PERSON	,
Gilder	PERSON	, and
Stoddard	PERSON	.

		A new edition is soon to be pub - lished , to include his later work also .

		His '' Ode on a Lycian Tomb , '' a recent lyric , has been greatly admired , and may perhaps be taken as an example of his fine achievement . ''

		What gracious nunnery of grief is here !

		One woman garbed in sorrow 's every mood ; Each sad presentment celled apart , in fear Lest that herself upon herself intrude , And break some tender dream of sorrow 's day .

		Here cloistered lonely , set in marble gray . ''

		O pale procession of immortal love , Forever married to immortal grief !

		All of life 's childlike sorrow far above .

		Past help of time 's compassionate relief ; These changeless stones are treasuries of regret And mock the term by time for sorrow set . ''

		Cold mourners set in stone so long ago , Too much my thoughts have dwelt with thee apart .

		Again my grief is young ; full well I know The pang reborn , that mocked my feeble art With that too human wail in pain expressed , The parent cry above the empty nest . ''

		ELLEN KEY : IDEALIST .

		Always since the Galilean lived his revolutionary message to reform man and not methods , every step in the world 's ethical and moral progress has been inspired by the standard-bearer of a new ideal - ism .

		With the wane of each century , the idealism which demanded the ascetic renunciation of earthly joys has been more sternly challenged , until a higher conception of true life-values is leading us back to the Greek ideal of beauty and happiness as the basis of a life-giving harmony .


Ellen Key	PERSON	's credo , u the enhancement of life through love , joy , and beauty in things small and great , '' implies much more than the joy of living .

		To her , happiness means `` to love , work , think , suffer , and enjoy on an ever higher plane . ''

		She expounds her gospel in a glowingly picturesque and even start - ling way , and those who read coming events in to-day 's idealistic tendencies believe that she has established the three truths on which our moral future will be based : 1 , The futility of legislation and economic readjustments for bringing about the regeneration of the race ; 2 , The wisdom of courageous truth - telling as regards vital issues ; 3 , A truer recognition of the sacredness of human relations .

		As a forerunner in urging the vital reforms for which we are fighting to-day ,
Ellen Key	PERSON	has always insisted on freedom for the new type of beings who are developing as a result of the transvaluation of moral standards that must eventually bring about a betterment of the species .

		The closing sentence in her most indignantly contested book , '' Love and Marriage , '' proves her intent to let her theories be a stepping-stone to changed and bettered marriage conditions , and not a plan for immediate action : '' Those who believe in a humanity perfected by love must learn to count in thousands of years , not in centuries , much less in decades . ''

		Why , then , do we hear all this hue and cry about
Ellen Key	PERSON	's `` immoral '' precepts ?

		To see danger in her reversal of accepted standards in sexual ethics is as misleading as was the popular interpretation of the high-handed exit of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's
Nora	LOCATION	.

		It would be just as absurd to accuse her of suggesting free love as a solution for marital tangles as it was to blame
Ibsen	PERSON	for the panacea which `` misunderstood women '' found in his open-door theory .

		Both these idealists are counting in `` thousands of years '' for the consummation of their hope of social advance through the ennoblement of natural impulses .

		In demanding new forms ,
Ellen Key	PERSON	asks free - dom `` for the only love worthy the name , '' the sanctified , self-sacrificing love that is life 's highest spiritual expression : self-sacrificing only in the sense of giving and demanding the highest happi - ness in love .

		All other love she considers dese - cration , whether in marriage or out of it . ''

		Her greatest victory is that pure-minded young men have made their own her demands of true morality , '' said one admirer on the occasion of her sixtieth birthday .

		The new type of woman which is being evolved from this supreme test of her theories will be the corner-stone upon which the new creed of a higher freedom for both man and woman will rest .

		Fewer Priscillas , ever ready to bear the marriage yoke , will worship man as the lord of creation , and more Brunhildes will defend the fiery wall of newly-won privileges which protects the cherished freedom of their personality .

		On the other hand ,
Ellen Key	PERSON	proves the possi - bility of making practical ideals fit to-day 's needs in her plea for the rights of the child .

		What a neglected factor the child has been in our demand for the right to develop our own individuality !

		We are only beginning to concede his right to be well born and well equipped , physically and morally , for the task of finding his true place in the great scheme of existence .

		What the dreamer
Rousseau	PERSON	began , the centuries are slowly bringing to a splendid fruition .

		With two inspired women like
Maria Montessori	PERSON	, who is freeing children 's souls , and
Ellen Key	PERSON	, fighting against our effete conception of the moral law , in the vanguard , we are slowly realizing our possibilities in making the most perfect development of the indi - vidual the basis of social advancement .

		In `` The Century of the Child , '' a powerful leaven in the great social upheaval now going on ,
Ellen Key	PERSON	bases her plea for less training and more opportunity for free action on the premise that mankind can rise to its highest fulfillment only through the most perfect development of human impulses and the best training of the faculties .

		To this end she would change
Froebel	PERSON	's dictum , `` Let us live for the children , '' to the admonition , '' Give the children a chance to live . ''

		`` Aim to leave your child in peace , interfere as little as possible , try to remove all im - 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	pure impressions , but above all else perfect yourself and let your personality , aided by reality in all its rude simplicity , become a factor in the child 's de - velopment . ''

		Nietzsche expresses this essence of the educational wisdom of the ages more tersely : `` See that through thee the race progresses , not continues only .

		Let a true marriage help thee to this end . ''


Ellen Key	PERSON	's arraignment of our present method of predigested instruction , of artificial spurs to en - deavor , and of over-vigilance and protective pam - pering is a strong negative plea for more natural methods of training children .

		She thinks an adult person would lose his reason if some Titan should try to train him by the methods ordinarily employed with children .

		Like all right-minded people , she considers corporal punishment detrimental to the development of courage , energy , and self-reliance .

		She quotes the opinion of an educator who claims that many nervous little liars simply need good nourishment and outdoor life ; and she holds the '' good '' school , with its over-insistence on versatility , responsible for the nervousness of our day .

		The child should be trained to exercise his own powers : trained , not allowed to exercise them as he wills .

		Herein lies the misconception that leads many ultra-modern parents to give the reins into the child 's own hands .

		We are in danger now of passing the Scylla of restrictive methods only to founder on the Charybdis of unrestricted liberty .

		Even the radical
Ellen Key	PERSON	advises strict discipline for young children `` as a pre-condition to a higher training . ''

		During the first and most important formative period she insists upon absolute obedience .

		Our present system of training often limits the natural capacities of the child and shields him from life 's real experiences .

		In answer to the assertion that splendid men and women have grown up under a system of repression and punishment , she argues that parents were consistent and unbending in earlier days : not over-indulgent and severe by turns , guided by nerves and moods , as are many parents of to-day .

		`` We need new homes , new schools , new mar - riages , new social relations for those new souls who are to feel , love , and suffer in ways infinitely numer - ous , that we now can not even name , '' is her insistent plea .

		Home influence , its settled , quiet order , and its call for tasks conducive to the happiness and the comfort of the family , is underestimated as an edu - cational factor of great value .

		As soon as humanity awakens to the consciousness of `` the holiness of generation , ''
Ellen Key	PERSON	's ideal of a better parent - hood will be realized .

		The mothers of the future must live according to her eugenic creed : to enhance life and to create higher forms .

		To this end she would consecrate woman as the priestess of life , who regards motherhood as a vocation of high worth , not as an incident or as an irksome task to be avoided .

		In '' Motherliness and Education for Mother - hood , '' she asks woman to concentrate her divergent interests in order to make herself more efficient for her most important duties , and she urges reform measures to so aid the working mother that she may devote more attention to her children .

		Another suggestion , to make a course in caring for children , in health culture and nursing , obligatory for girls , is a more rational demand than the European law for compulsory military duty , and would surely be productive of better results .

		The ethical as well as the practical value of efficiency is being recognized in the business world , in professional and educa - tional life .

		Why not in the highest of all vocations parenthood ? ''

		The Woman Movement '' challenges those of
Ellen Key	PERSON	's adversaries who claim that she opposes woman 's emancipation : for her the most important woman question is the highest development of the individual woman .

		`` Motherhood , '' she assures us , `` will exact all the legal rights without which woman can not , in the full sense of the word , be either child mother or community worker . ''

		Her glowing faith in the perfectibility of human nature , her courage in braving false interpretations of her creed , and her prophetic understanding of our most urgent spiritual needs give her the right to shed a blinding light on matters tabooed by those who fear the truth .

		She is not a disillusionist for courageous souls .

		Anyone who reads `` Life Lines '' under - standingly is impressed by the author 's tremendous sense of righteousness , and by the optimism of her prophecies .

		In her biographies of noted women the forward - seeking vision in their lives and in their work is a typically modern note .


Rahel Varnhagen	PERSON	has never before been drawn with the ultra-modern touch that reveals her aspiring soul as a strong influence in spurring on great men to unusual deeds of intellectual valor .

		A humanitarian in the widest sense ,
Ellen Key	PERSON	disapproves of many forms of charity , while she insists upon the right of every human being to develop his best possibilities through an inspiring environment and a chance to express himself in his work .

		She once heard a young working-girl say : `` It is not your better food and finer clothes we mostly envy , but it is the many intellectual enjoy - ments which are so much more within your reach than ours . ''

		The organization of the Tolstjerna circles was the result of this plaint .

		Women of wealth and culture , with a sympathetic understand - ing , met working girls on terms of equality .

		Ellen Key 's beautiful home will belong to these girls in the future .

		Only four of them are to occupy it at one time ; she wants them to be honored members of a family , not dwellers in an institution .

		The home is her sanctuary .

		All her `` revolutionary '' doctrines are directed towards its perfection by making men and women better able to guard its sacred flame and render it worthy to be the cradle of a new race of beings and a nobler civilization .

		The maintenance of Greek in the high school is our tribute of loyalty to the spiritual ancestry of our culture .

		The time is come when we too of
Virginia	LOCATION	and the South can afford to pay such reverence to the ideal interests of life . ''

		Not long ago an English author of the widest popularity and influence was heard to say , in conversation with a young woman , '' We are living in the present ; why go on constantly dwelling on the past ? ''

		And this was from him who wrote the poem whose refrain , `` Lest we forget , '' lays emphasis on the wholesome steadying influence of the past and reminds us that what is best in the present strikes its roots into that past .

		The chief reason why we `` go on constantly dwelling on the past '' is that we are not savages , who , as has been well said , have no past and -LRB- largely for that reason -RRB- no future , but only the inappreciable instant of time called the present ; and we cherish especially that portion of the past rendered illustrious by
Greece	LOCATION	because , to name no other reasons , we value the Platonic virtues enumerated in the `` Phaedo , '' where the soul is depicted as `` arrayed in her own proper jewels , which are temperance and justice and cour - age and nobility and truth . ''

		THE VERSATILE AND CHARMING JlILES CLARETIE , whose death in late
December	DATE	deprived
France	LOCATION	of a gifted and widely-read author , and took from the Academy one of its most distinguished mem - bers , gave the best years of his maturity to the management of the Theatre fran ^ ais , of which he was appointed director in
1885	DATE	, and which he tried to keep true to its traditional high standards even while it was suffering such losses as the withdrawal of actors like the elder Coquelin , Le Bargy , and
Madame Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	.

		But his endeavors were not eminently successful , and two months before his death he resigned his post .

		He was born at
Limoges	LOCATION	,
December 3 , 1840	DATE	, educated at the Lyce * e
Bonaparte	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and served his apprentice - ship in letters as dramatic critic to the `` Figaro '' and the '' Opinion Nationale , '' and as war correspond - ent in
Italy	LOCATION	in
1866	DATE	and at
Metz	ORGANIZATION	in
1870	DATE	.

		He was also a staff officer of the
National Guard	ORGANIZATION	during the Commune .

		His election to the French Academy took place in
1888	DATE	, and he was seated in
February	DATE	of the following year , being received by
Renan	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his long list of published works , including plays , novels , histories , biographies , critical essays , and miscellanies , note should be made of such consider - able productions as his five-volume '' Histoire de la Revolution de 1870-1871 , '' and his study of
Alsace	LOCATION	and
Lorraine	PERSON	five years after their annexation to
Germany	LOCATION	; his history of French literature from 900 to
1900	DATE	A. D. , and his life of Moliere .

		Of his work in fiction , `` La Cigarrette '' attained especial popularity and served as the basis of the opera , `` La Navarraise , '' which Claretie helped to set to the music of Massenet .

		Outside his own country he is probably best known for those annual volumes in which he was wont to collect the shorter writings -LRB- essays and criticisms -RRB- that he had contributed to newspapers and magazines , and in which his facility and charm showed themselves to the best advantage .

		THE REASON OF AN EDITORIAL , long or short , literary , political , industrial , hortatory , objurgatory , or of whatever character , is that most of us like not only to know what is going on , whether in the world of letters or in that of affairs , but also to know what others are thinking about it , and even , sometimes , to be told what we ought to think about it .

		We fail to grasp the full significance of an event until we see it through one or more pairs of eyes beside our own ; and even then all the possible aspects of the subject are seldom exhausted .

		One of our ablest and best - known journalists , Mr.
Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	, has told us , in his vivid account of his life , how on at least one occasion when editorial honors and responsibilities were offered him he preferred to remain a plain reporter and chronicle what was going on about him , leaving it to others to tell lies about it .

		That was a rather harsh estimate of the value of editorial writing ; but it was an estimate held , not many years ago , by more than one person , and was doubtless partly re - sponsible for the decline , at that time , in the editorial department of many journals .

		Not a few country newspapers greatly curtailed or wholly discontinued their editorial section .

		But now there is a fortunate rebound in the opposite direction .

		A recent issue of '' The American Press '' declares that in the last five years the amount of space devoted to editorial discussion of current events has increased threefold .

		A well-considered , well-written , more or less learn - edly illuminative , and even somewhat ornately rhetorical presentation of a topic of the times is found by most readers to be far more intellectually nutritious and mentally stimulating than a bare rec - ord of the topic as an item of news .

		Therefore let us hope that the prestige of the `` leader , '' as it was known in our fathers ' and grandfathers ' time , may be revived .

		... A '' DAILY OF DAILIES '' is but the logical continu - ation of the series of what might be called -LRB- without disrespect -RRB- `` scissors and paste '' publications which began in
1890	DATE	with the monthly `` Review of Re - views , '' and was soon continued and amplified in a number of weekly periodicals of excellence and use - fulness .

		With the opening of this year there begins 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	in
Berlin	LOCATION	, under the direction of Dr.
Arthur Kirch	PERSON	- hoff , the daily issue of a `` Zeitung der Zeitungen , '' which purposes to give a `` tagliche Weltiibersicht der internationalen Politik ,
Kultur	PERSON	und Wirtschaft . ''

		By an alphabetical arrangement under continents and countries the principal diurnal events of inter - national interest are so grouped , in the form of brief telegraphic despatches , that the eye of even a hasty reader can easily catch what is of interest to him , and a full perusal of the sheet -LRB- a folio printed only on one side , '' to facilitate clippings '' -RRB- would occupy but a fraction of an hour .

		`` About two hundred dailies , '' it is announced , '' and other periodical publi - cations from all parts of the globe will regularly be followed up day by day in about twenty languages for the ` Zeitung der Zeitungen . ' ''

		An impressive list of more or less eminent men giving the undertaking their moral support appears in the prospectus sent out by the publishers .

		A fortnightly issue of `` European Letters , '' from competent pens , contain - ing '' a review of the most important economic , polit - ical , industrial , scientific , and technical occurrences in
Europe	LOCATION	, '' also begins with the launching of the larger enterprise , and these letters will eventually , it is expected , be issued weekly .

		WHAT EVERY SCHOOLBOY SHOULD KNOW , if he be in the high school , and at the same time what every schoolgirl of equal advancement should know , will be found neatly and conveniently indicated in a pamphlet compiled by Miss
Florence M. Hopkins	PERSON	, librarian at the
Detroit Central High School	ORGANIZATION	, and entitled , `` Allusions Which Every High School Student Should Know . ''

		The allusions are from the domains of philosophy , religion , mythology , sociology , philology , science , useful arts , fine arts , literature , history , and general information , and are arranged alphabetically , to the number of eight hundred and thirty-seven , with alternate blank pages for additions , and with indications as to the grade , or class , to which each topic onght to wear a famil - iar aspect .

		The numbers , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and the letter G -LRB- graduate student -RRB- are used for this purpose .

		Let us quote a few of these allusions , to show how intelligent the
Detroit	LOCATION	high - school pupils and graduates are supposed to be , or ought to be .

		We find , for example , Balder ,
Baliol College	ORGANIZATION	,
Baucis	LOCATION	, Bay Psalm Book ,
Bodleian Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Bouguereau	PERSON	, Calydonian Hunt ,
Comus	ORGANIZATION	,
Cuvier	PERSON	,
Dirce	ORGANIZATION	,
Erech	LOCATION	- theum ,
Eurydice	ORGANIZATION	, Excalibur ,
Freya	LOCATION	,
Gautama	LOCATION	,
Haggai	LOCATION	,
Hegira	LOCATION	,

Loki	LOCATION	,
Obadiah	PERSON	,
Odin	PERSON	,
Pyrrha	LOCATION	, Ur of the Chaldees ,
Zeitgeist	LOCATION	,
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	, and
Zephaniah	PERSON	.

		Not every college graduate could pass a perfect examina - tion on even the few random allusions here quoted .

		Miss
Hopkins	PERSON	sets no mean standard for her high - school pupils , but it is far better to aim too high than too low . ''

		THE FATHER OF AMERICAN HISTORY , '' Dl 1 .


David Ramsay	PERSON	, was recalled in one of the letters received at the recent testimonial dinner tendered to Professor
McMaster	PERSON	, the writer drawing an in - teresting comparison between the two historians .


Ramsay	PERSON	, like
McMaster	PERSON	, was of Scotch descent .

		McMaster taught in early life at
Princeton	LOCATION	, where
Ramsay	PERSON	graduated in
1765	DATE	.

		McMaster for many years has filled the chair of American history at the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, of whose medical school the famous Dr.
Benjamin Rush	PERSON	said
Ramsay	PERSON	was the most distinguished graduate .


Ramsay	PERSON	was a member of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	from
South Carolina	LOCATION	, whither he removed from his native state ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	; he was a surgeon in the armies of the Colonies , prisoner of war at
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, and member of the `` Old
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		His `` History of the American Revolution '' was published in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia ,
London	LOCATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, and
Trenton	LOCATION	, and in French , Dutch , and German .

		His `` Life of
Washington	LOCATION	'' was published at
New York	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Balti	LOCATION	- more , and
Ithaca	LOCATION	; it appeared in
Paris	LOCATION	in French and Spanish , and at
Barcelona	LOCATION	.

		Twenty-one editions of these two books were issued from American and European presses between the years
1789	DATE	and
1842	DATE	.

		The late
Frederick D. Stone	PERSON	, librarian of the
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania Historical Society , thought
Ramsay	PERSON	's the best narrative of the Revolution that had ever been written .

		His book was one of the few read by the young
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		While tribute was being paid to the living
McMaster	PERSON	,
Ramsay	PERSON	's monument , tumbled over by the earthquake , still lay prostrate in the yard of the
Presbyterian Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Charleston	LOCATION	.

		A NEW STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL began its useful existence with the beginning of this year .

		Its sit - uation , on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , clears it at the outset from any charge of desiring to enter into competi - tion with already established schools of the same kind .

		From the latest issue of `` News Notes of
California	LOCATION	Libraries '' we quote : `` To meet an in - creasing demand for librarians and library assistants who have had the benefit of technical training as well as experience , the
California State Library	ORGANIZATION	has planned to establish in
January , 1914	DATE	, a library school .

		The purpose of this school is to offer to carefully selected candidates a one-year course in library economy , which is designed to qualify the students for library service .

		For this training the
California State Library	ORGANIZATION	offers a well - equipped laboratory , having a library of about 165,000 vol - umes , including its law library ; the collection of federal , state , and municipal documents ; the collec - tion of books for the blind ; and the special collection in the
California	LOCATION	Department . ''

		Examinations under the supervision of the
California State Civil Service Commission	ORGANIZATION	are held for the purpose of selecting the limited few who shall enjoy the privileges of the school , and no tuition fees will be charged a noticeable item .

		That the new school may live to rival in usefulness and reputation that other State
1914	DATE	-RSB- 51 institution of like character at the eastern verge of the continent , will be the hope and wish of all inter - ested in the growth of our public library system .

		SHAKESPEARE PRESENTED BY AMATEURS seldom or never equals Shakespeare as presented by the best professionals ; but the value of the performance to those behind the footlights may be none the less considerable .

		An eminent
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	actor no less a one , in fact , than Sir
Johnston Forbes	PERSON	-
Robertson	PERSON	is thus , in part , reported on the subject in the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	`` News '' -LRB- one would not dare affirm the exact verbal accuracy of the report -RRB- : '' Presenting Shakespeare 's plays in college has several advan - tages .

		The main one is that Shakespeare demands of his actors good elocution and articulation the greatest assets in acting .

		Modern dramas do not demand this to the same extent .

		For instance , the average modern play usually has its characters rep - resenting types who do not necessarily speak well , and thus there is not so much demand on the actor for good speaking .

		On the contrary , however ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	compels his actors to speak with far greater care , Of course
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's dramas need much more skilful acting than the modern , but they are of high educational value .

		There is no neces - sity for giving the great tragedies , for most of his comedies are well adapted to college use .

		In fact , I have seen some of the more rarely staged ones , like ` The Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	' and ` All 's Well That Ends Well , ' given in college with great success . ''

		The seeming implication that none of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's clowns and grave-diggers and con - stables and tavern roisterers ever express themselves in carelessly-articulated colloquialisms , is of course easily disputable ; but the colloquialisms of three centuries ago are sufficiently unlike our own to re - quire some study and elocutionary practice for their mastery and effective oral rendering which we take to be the English actor 's meaning .

		THE PRICE OF ORDERLINESS IN THE LIBRARY , asserts Miss
Bertha Marx	PERSON	, head of the
Sheboygan	LOCATION	-LRB-
Wis.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library , `` is eternal vigilance on the part of the librarian , coupled with a sense of order - liness on the part of the staff , and untiring , consci - entious work on the part of a good janitor '' ; and the model neatness of the institution under her care offers conclusive proof that litter and literature , so often found dwelling together in a sort of sluttish content , are not .

		necessarily one and inseparable .

		To the question whether the public is not repelled by the aspect of such preternatural tidiness as she describes in a paper printed in the ``
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin , '' she makes reply : `` I shall answer by saying that we circulated three thousand more books this year than last , and that we number among our regular patrons the grimy men of the coal yards , the odoriferous tannery workers , and hundreds of factory men . ''


John Wesley	PERSON	's famous pulpit utter - ance here comes to mind , but shall not be quoted ; also a part -LRB- but not all -RRB- of the poet
Vaughan	PERSON	's counsel to the growing seed might be fitly cited : '' Then bless thy secret growth , nor catch At noise , hut thrive unseen and dumb ; Keep clean , be as fruit , earn life , and watch Till the white-winged reapers come . ''

		* > '' THE LAUREATE 'S FIRST OFFICIAL POEM , '' Christ - mas Eve , '' was sent to the
King two days before Christmas	DATE	, and was at his request published in `` The Times . ''

		In the stately dignity of its antique mode some irreverent modern critics may find matter for sport and mockery , and certain of its unrhymed lines where the rhythm is somewhat less obstrusely apparent than in `` Yankee Doodle '' may seem , to the frivolous , to invite the application of that ex - pressive term some time ago applied to the produc - tions of a poet less eminent than Dr. Bridges , `` jerked English . ''

		But to the few who retain even a faint memory of the archaic charm of `` Piers the Plowman '' this bit of twentieth-century revival of fourteenth-century poetic art will give pleasure .

		To convey an idea of its gentle manner we quote a few of its lines as they have reached us : '' Now blessed be the towers that crown
England	LOCATION	so fair , That stand up strong in prayer unto God for our souls ; Blessed be their founders , said I , and our countryfolk Who are ringing for Christ in the belfries to-night With arms lifted to clutch the rattling ropes that race Into the dark above and the mad romping din . ''

		A TOPSY-TURVY METHOD OF LANGUAGE-TEACHING seems to have been adopted in the night schools of
Richmond	LOCATION	, where the wholly unliterary tongue known as Esperanto is taught as Latin and Greek have so long been taught , by practice in translation from the alien into the native tongue though the adjec - tive `` alien '' is perhaps hardly applicable to so anomalous a linguistic phenomenon as Esperanto .

		Not long ago an eminent language-teacher from
England	LOCATION	was in this country , demonstrating to us the feasibility of imparting a knowledge of a dead language by the conversational method so fruitful in giving a command of a living and spoken tongue ; and now , by a curious reversal of the plan , a lan - guage invented for conversational and epistolary use , chiefly in commerce and travel , and consequently with no literature or history back of it , is treated as if its origin went back to the
Tower of Babel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Who would have thought the dictionary - and - grammar habit to be so ingrained anywhere in twentieth - century
America	LOCATION	?

		Or have the
Richmond	LOCATION	night schools been grossly slandered ?

		MAGAZINE COVERS , tastefully and modestly de - signed -LRB- the one , of course , implies the other -RRB- win for themselves , as the slow seasons roll , a certain fond - ness on the reader 's part that makes him averse to any change even for what may be artistically better .

		Amid the ravages wrought by cover - designers among our long-established monthlies ravages that have robbed us of the good old ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' cover with its familiar stars and stripes , and have ruthlessly 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	removed from the venerable `` Harper '' its opulent cornucopias and chubby cherubs there remains , sturdily resistant to frivolous innovation , the original dress of `` Blackwood 's Magazine '' as
Blackwood	PERSON	founded it almost a century ago .

		`` Maga '' puts to shame the frivolity of Mr.
Punch	PERSON	in running after new modes and bedizening his borders with divers innovations in color , and she thus , in a recent num - ber , expresses her disapproval -LRB- we quote only a few of the lines -RRB- : ' It is a shame to spoil The page of
Dicky Doyle	PERSON	, Or , at best , waste of toil , Painting the lily .

		Do n't let the lust for change , For something new and strange , All your old charms derange We think it silly . ''

		LITERARY MAGIC , as employed by a master magician , can often transform a repulsive theme to something comely often deceptively and seduc - tively comely in its outer aspect .

		This is a prop - osition that needs no demonstration here , but the truth of it is quite harmlessly and very entertain - ingly illustrated just at this time by the appearance in English of Professor
Henri Fabre	PERSON	's delightful treatise on that common carrier of disease , that pest of the home , that shameless disturber of bodily and mental peace , the house-fly .

		It is to be hoped that this charming book , `` The Life of the Fly , '' will be responsible for no truce in the modern war on the Argus-eyed insect so difficult to be caught napping by even the most wary and alert fly-exterminator .

		Charmed with the marvels of the abstract fly , we must nevertheless harden ourselves to the pitiless extinction of the insect in its concrete manifestations loving the sinner , but hating more the sin .

		THE LITERATURE OF FEMINISM , a topic only recently come into prominent notice -LRB- under its present name , at least -RRB- is already far from incon - siderable in quantity or negligible as to quality .

		At the
John Crerar Library of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, for example , as we learn from an excellent historical account of that library issued in pamphlet form by order of its board of directors , there is a '' distinct collection of nearly 6,000 volumes and pamphlets on the social , political , and legal status of women .

		A cata - logue of this part of the collection , under the title La femme et le feminisme , complete to
1900	DATE	, was exhibited at the
Paris	LOCATION	Exposition of that year and received a diploma of honor . ''

		It is safe to predict that , with the increasing public activities of the twentieth-century woman , the literature of feminism and the
John Crerar	PERSON	collection of that literature will undergo considerable and rapid augmentation .

		LINCOLN LITERARY RELICS of much interest are at this time -LRB-
Jan. 14	DATE	, 15 , 16 -RRB- passing under the auc - tioneer 's hammer into the hands of fortunate pos - sessors .

		The late
William H. Lambert	PERSON	's collection of
Lincolniana	LOCATION	, after being for two weeks on exhi - bition at the Anderson Galleries in
New York	LOCATION	, now suffers the fate of most collections and is dispersed .

		Among items of especial value there are mentioned thirteen volumes from
Lincoln	LOCATION	's library ; one of the fifty copies of the
Emancipation Proclamation	ORGANIZATION	signed by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	and
Seward	PERSON	; one of the three copies of the Thirteenth Amendment signed by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	,
Hamlin	PERSON	, and
Colfax	LOCATION	; a copy of the play-bill issued at
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre the day of the assassination ; many letters , legal papers , and other documents written or signed by
Lincoln	LOCATION	; a leaf from his sum-book , dated
1824	DATE	; a discharge signed by Lincoln as captain in
1832	DATE	; and the original manuscript of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's plan of campaign ,
1861	DATE	.

		Other papers , with relics of a different sort , are enumerated altogether a re - markable collection .

		MR. CARNEGIE 'S LIBRARY GIFTS FOR
1913	DATE	amount to three hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars , his total benefactions for the same period being some - what over
fourteen million dollars	MONEY	.

		Apparently he is not specializing quite so much in libraries as for - merly , although a third of a million for one year 's outlay in this branch of charity would be for most men royal munificence .

		Of this amount , the
Allegheny City Library	ORGANIZATION	, the first of the

		CONCERNING `` YE '' AND `` AMPERSAND . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAJL . -RRB-

		While I believe Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	has performed a distinct service by calling attention to the common but absurd pronunciation of the early Modern English represen - tation of `` the , '' I am constrained to differ with him in the matter of the origin of this symbol . ''

		The only apparent reason for mistaking the character is , '' he says , `` that two centuries ago the letter < h ' was usually written with a tail below the line , and with a razeed top , which made it look like our ' y. ' '' On the contrary , I regard the character not merely as looking like '' y , '' but as actually being '' y , '' though introduced through confusion with the Old and Middle English letter p , and intended , of course , to be pronounced like p.
John Earle	PERSON	says on this point -LRB- '' The Philology of the English Tongue , '' fourth edition , pp. 103-104 -RRB- : '' The words the and that continued after the close of the fifteenth cen - tury to be written pe and pat or p l .

		This habit lasted on long after its original meaning was forgotten .

		The p got confused with the character y at a time when the y was closed a-top , and then people wrote ' ye ' for the and < yat ' or ' y * ' for that .

		This has lasted down close to our own times ; and the practice has not entirely ceased even now . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Agreeing with , and wishing to emphasize , what your correspondent writes in your issue of
December 16	DATE	upon the modern use of '' ye '' for '' the , '' may I add that the use of the letter `` y '' in the spelling of `` the '' and `` that '' originated in the adoption by the early English printers of the runic letter '' thorn '' which very closely resem - bles the black-letter '' y '' ; hence when the black-letter began to be replaced by the Roman type forms , the '' y '' was retained , though at first the '' e '' was placed above the line and thus a distinction between '' ye '' and '' the '' was maintained .

		Later the '' e '' dropped down to the line , and '' ye '' was for a long time used by printers for `` the '' ; there are some writers who still use it as an abbreviated form of '' the '' without realizing whence they got it .

		The `` short and '' is a monogram of `` et '' used by the mediaeval scribes , of which the earliest type found - ers made use .

		It is further corrupted into the plus sign + .

		It was in the early printing offices that it gained the name of '' ampersand , '' which is a corrup - tion of '' and-per-se-and '' or '' and-by-itself-and . ''

		MILTON 'S '' STARRE-YPOINTED PYRAMID . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I will put a few facts before your readers which will dispose once and for all of the imaginations of your cor - respondent Mr.
Samuel A. Tannenbaum	PERSON	, as expressed in your issue of
November 16	DATE	last .

		In my unique library are quite a number of books in which engravings of a Beacon will be found to inform those capable of understanding that
Bacon	PERSON	is the real author of works to which his name has not yet been attached .

		But as I am now dealing with
Milton	PERSON	's Epitaph , I will refer only to the engraving which shows a Pyramid , a Beacon , a
Bacon	LOCATION	, upon which is in - scribed '' Holy-Relique , '' with the meaning of literary works which are described as '' these Divine pure Beau - ties of the Minde . ''

		All writers are agreed that '' Para - dise Lost '' shows that
Milton	PERSON	was much indebted to ``
Joshua Sylvester	PERSON	's Translation of Du Bartas , His Divine
Weekes	PERSON	and Wordes , '' which was first published in
1605	DATE	.

		In this book we find on B2 -LRB- a page which appears to have no possible connection with
Sylvester	PERSON	's work -RRB- a Pyramid , a Beacon , a
Bacon	LOCATION	, surmounted by a pheon -LRB- the heraldic name for an engrailed broad arrow -RRB- , which is the arms of Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	.

		Below this on the pyramid itself is
Bacon	LOCATION	's crest , the Wild Boar , in the proper heraldic attitude .

		But round its neck is a cord with a slip-knot to show us that it is a '' Hanged - Hog , '' which Mrs. Quickly , on the first page 53 in the First Folio of the Shakespeare plays -LRB- 1623 -RRB- , tells us means ''
Bacon	PERSON	, '' the reason why being supplied in the 36th of
Bacon	LOCATION	's Apophthegms first printed in
1671	DATE	.

		This Hanged-Hog is , however , clothed in a porcupine 's skin -LRB-
Sidney	PERSON	's crest is a porcupine -RRB- .

		Below this is a set of verses which are printed so as to follow the outline of the pyramid .

		They are as follows : '' ENGLAND 'S Apelles -LRB- rather OUK APOLLO -RRB- WORLD ' s-wonder SIDNEY , that rare more-than-man , This LOVELY VENUS first to LIMNE beganne , With such a PENCILL as no PENNE dares follow : How then shold I in Wit and Art so shallow , Attempt the Task which yet none other can ?

		Far be the thought that mine unlearned hand His heavenly Labour shold so much unhallow , Yet least -LRB- that Holy RELIQUE being shrin 'd In some High-Place , close lockt from common light -RRB- My Country-men should bee debar 'd the sight Of these DIVINE pure Beauties of the Minde : Not daring meddle with APELLES TABLE This have I muddled as my MUSE was able . ''

		To the uninformed these words seem to be addressed to
Sidney	PERSON	, whose name appears in large capital letters in the centre .

		The poem is , however , a grand panegyric on
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		It commences with ''
England	ORGANIZATION	's Apelles '' and `` apelles '' means `` without a skin . ''

		We must there - fore skin off the pheon and lo !

		a Beacon , a
Bacon	LOCATION	, stands revealed ; and we must skin off the porcupine 's quills from the '' Hanged-Hog '' and again we see that '' Bacon '' stands revealed .

		We therefore perceive that we are told that
Bacon	PERSON	wrote under the skin , the garment , the weed , the disguise , the pseudonym of
Sidney	PERSON	.

		This fact is likewise revealed in various books in my library .

		Then we read '' This lovely
Venus	PERSON	first to limne began . ''

		This refers to
Bacon	PERSON	's '' Venus & Adonis , '' which he says is '' the first heire of my invention . ''

		Scholars never guessed that the real meaning of this is that it is the first heir of his invention of the pseudonym
William Shakespeare	PERSON	.

		But to explain half of the meaning of this wonderful pyramid would take far too much of your space .

		Suffice it to point out that in these verses we find `` Holy-Relique '' with the meaning of `` literary works , '' `` these Divine pure Beauties of the Minde , '' ex - actly as
Milton	PERSON	in his Epitaph uses `` hallow 'd Reliques '' with the meaning of the plays , etc. .

		If your readers will carefully study
Milton	PERSON	's Epitaph , which commences , '' What neede my Shakespeare for his honour 'd bones , The labour of an Age , in piled stones Or that his hallow 'd Reliques should be hid Under a starre-ypointed Pyramid ?

		Dear

FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE	LOCATION	.

		* For half a century or more the name of
Florence Nightingale	LOCATION	, the angel of mercy to wounded soldiers in the Crimean War , was as the name of a mythological character or a mediaeval saint about whom all sorts of fables and traditions had clustered , and of whose real personality it was difficult to form any clear conception unless one belonged to the favored few admitted to the invalid chamber whence for forty-five years she scarcely stirred .

		References to her in contemporary memoirs , with an occa - sional inadequate sketch of her life , would ap - pear from time to time ; but for years before her death in
the summer of 1910	DATE	there was only the vaguest popular impression whether she was still living , and , if so , where , and what were the things that interested her in her retirement , if indeed she was still capable of cherishing any interests whatever .

		Now , however , with Sir
Edward Cook	PERSON	's two - volume `` Life of Florence Nightingale '' before one , it becomes plainly evident that the founder of modern nursing , one of the most heroic characters of her time ^ or of all time , was a very human mortal and a very womanly woman ; that she had a wealth of mental and moral endowment that fitted her to excel in any one of many callings she might have chosen ; and that the choice she did finally make was not arrived at without spiritual and intellectual conflict of the sharpest sort , and opposition from family and friends and public opinion such as it required the most resolute will to overcome .

		In this day and generation , when a young woman 's decision to become a trained nurse excites as little comment as does a young man 's choice of medicine as a profession , it is well - nigh impossible to imagine the formidable front of popular disapproval encountered by a gently - nurtured girl who , three-quarters of a century ago , dared to entertain a longing to give her life to the service of the sick in hospitals .

		The impropriety of such a course seemed more shock - ing , in some respects , than to go on the stage .

		That a woman of Miss
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	's position and antecedents should have , with all her other notable qualities , both the desire to devote her - self to so unheard-of a cause and the tenacity of purpose to realize her desire , marks her as a * THB LIFE OF

		character well worthy of more than a cursory study ; and in the two ample volumes of the present biography will be found sufficient de - scriptive and autobiographic material to place the reader on a footing of rather intimate ac - quaintance with her richly gifted personality .

		Born on the twentieth day of
May , 1820	DATE	, in the city that gave her her baptismal name ,
Florence Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	enjoyed from the begin - ning all the advantages that wealth , culture , the best society , and frequent travel could confer .

		Her father , a serious - minded gentleman of leis - ure , took an active interest in his two daughters ' education , and records remain of the school - room tasks he set them .

		Miss
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	's early notebooks show that before she was out of her teens she had acquired some mastery of Latin and Greek , that she had analyzed the `` Tusculan Disputations , '' translated parts of the '' Phsedo , '' the '' Crito , '' and the '' Apology , '' studied Roman , German , Italian , and Turkish history , and critically dissected
Dugald Stewart	PERSON	's `` Philosophy of the Human Mind . ''


Mathe	PERSON	- matics also engaged her interest and claimed many hours of earnest application .

		She took music-lessons in
Florence	LOCATION	, and in
London	LOCATION	pur - sued these studies under German and Italian masters , acquiring some proficiency in both singing and playing , attending the opera with passionate enjoyment , and becoming , as she expressed it , `` music-mad . ''

		In fact , so varied and also so pronounced were her successive or simultaneous enthusiasms that , so far as one can see , there was no reason why , with a little tip - ping of the balance at any time , she might not have distinguished herself as a writer , a musi - cian , a classical scholar , an egyptologist , a society leader , a follower of the religious life , or a model wife and mother .

		Temptations and aptitudes were not wanting in all these and probably still other directions , but nothing seemed perma - nently worth while that did not tend to the alle - viation of the hard lot of suffering humanity . ''

		I feel my sympathies are with Ignorance and Poverty , '' she wrote to a friend in
1846	DATE	.

		`` My imagination is so filled with the misery of this world that the only thing in which to labour brings any return , seems to me helping and sympathizing there ; and all that poets sing of the glories of this world appears to me untrue : all the people I see are eaten up with care or poverty or disease . ''


Three years later	DATE	, when she was doing charity work in
London	LOCATION	, she wrote in her diary these significant words : '' Ought not one 's externals to be as nearly as possi - ble an incarnation of what life really is ?

		Life is not a
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 55 green pasture and a still water , as our homes make it .

		Life is to some a forty days ' fasting , moral or physical , in the wilderness ; to some it is a fainting under the carrying of the cross ; to some it is a crucifixion ; to all , a struggle for truth , for safety .

		Life is seen in a much truer form in
London	LOCATION	than in the country .

		In an En - glish country place everything that is painful is so care - fully removed out of sight , behind those fine trees , to a village three miles off .

		In
London	LOCATION	, at all events if you open your eyes , you can not help seeing in the next street that life is not as it has been made for you .

		You can not get out of a carriage at a party without seeing what is in the faces making the lane on either side , and without feeling tempted to rush back and say , ' Those are my brothers and sisters . ' ''

		Again and again her family and friends exerted themselves in vain to win back
Florence Nightingale	LOCATION	to the safe and comfortable con - ventions of her social station , and every fresh trial left her increasingly dissatisfied with the hollowness and heartlessness and sham that seemed all-sufficient to those about her .

		At last , when she had attained the comparative maturity and confidence of thirty-one years , she succeeded in making her will prevail .

		She gained admission as a nurse at the Kaiserswerth hospital founded by
Pastor Fliedner	PERSON	, and fol - lowed up this useful apprenticeship with a term of similar service in the
Maison de la Provi	ORGANIZATION	- dence belonging to the
Sisters of Charity	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	, after which , and as her last work before entering upon her great undertaking in the
East	LOCATION	, she acted as superintendent of an '' Estab - lishment for Gentlewomen during Illness , '' in Upper Harley Street ,
London	LOCATION	.

		The autumn of
1854	DATE	brought a call to larger and more self - sacrificing usefulness , and it was promptly answered .

		As head of a small volunteer band of nurses ,
Miss Nightingale	LOCATION	left home for the distant seat of war , and there displayed pro- fessional and administrative abilities that won the applause of the world .

		In addition to pros - trating illness and other interruptions to the prosecution of her great work , there were the vexations of official hostility to her beneficent activities , and all the petty annoyance of red tape and a multitude of miscellaneous worri - ments .

		Her biographer gives a glimpse of these discouraging conditions in the following passage : '' Miss
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	's work in the
Crimea	LOCATION	was attended by ceaseless worry .

		She had to fight her way into full authority .

		She knew that she would win , but her enemies were active , and were for the moment in pos - session of the field . '

		There is not an official , ' she said , ' who would not burn me like
Joan	PERSON	of Arc if he could , but they know that the War Office can not turn me out because the country is with me . '

		She was beset with jealousies in the
Crimea	LOCATION	, both in military and in medical quarters ; and to make matters worse , religious , and even racial animosities mixed themselves up in the disputes .

		Lord Raglan , who believed in her and always supported her , was now dead ; and by some strange omission , the instructions which had been sent to him from
London	LOCATION	at the time of her original appointment were unknown to his successors in the command . ''

		She returned to
England	LOCATION	hopelessly shattered in health , and from an invalid 's chair entered upon that long and noble labor for the reform of nursing and sanitation methods to which her field experiences in the
Crimea	LOCATION	had been only a starting point .

		Of these later philanthropic labors , and her many writings in furtherance of the causes that claimed her aid , there is here no space to give even a brief account .

		Let us rather present a picture of her in her
London	LOCATION	home , in
South Street	LOCATION	, when the more memorable achievements of her heroic life were over and she was enter - ing upon the philosophic calm of her honored old age .

		After referring to her brilliance in conversation and to
Madame Mohl	PERSON	's description of her talk as `` most nourishing , '' the author continues : '' But for the most part Miss
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	's talk was rather earnest , inquiring , sometimes searching , than sparkling or eloquent . '

		She is worse than a
Royal Commission	ORGANIZATION	to answer , ' said Colonel Yule ; ' and , in the most gracious , charming manner possible , immediately finds out all I do n't know . '

		Younger visitors some - times felt in awe of her ; she could flash out a searching question upon a rash generalization as formidably as Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	himself .

		She was interested in everything except what was trivial .

		Her intellectual vitality was remarkable ; visitors who knew nothing of her special interests or pursuits were yet delighted by the stimu - lating freshness of her talk ... The humour which was characteristic of Miss
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	came more readily perhaps to her pen than to her tongue ; but she always enjoyed a joke in conversation even , as we have heard already from one of her nursing friends , at her own expense .

		Sometimes she was teasing .

		A High Church young lady once went to South Street .

		She was delighted with her interview , but
Miss Nightingale	LOCATION	, she said , ' laughed at
High Church	ORGANIZATION	curates a good deal : she said they had no foreheads . '

		She sometimes quizzed even her greatest friends .

		She used to talk with humor - ous indignation of Mr.
Jowett	PERSON	's God as a ' man-jelly , ' in contrast with the future life of work which she looked forward to . ''

		For the preparation of this full and authori - tative account of a most notable and noble life the author has had placed at his disposal by Miss
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	's executors the great mass of correspondence preserved by her , and also many other papers of hers , while her numerous pub - lished writings have of course contributed much of value .

		Portraits , bibliography , and index are not lacking to the book 's equipment .

		It is in every respect an excellent and unusually important work .

		56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	GUIDES TO THE CONTEMPORARY DRAMA .

		* What with the publication of plays in book form , the `` readings '' innumerable from stage successes of present and earlier seasons , the tabloid reproductions of the `` movies , '' the dra - matic gossip and digests and criticisms of the newspapers and magazines , and the critical and appreciative works on the drama , the dweller of to-day in village or hamlet may know as much of the theatre as his metropolitan cousin .

		The books by Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	and Professor
Burton	PERSON	belong to an ever-increasing list of works on things dramatic , and provide guides , one to the modern British and American drama , the other to the American only .

		Both are admirably ad - apted for those who read more often than they see plays .

		Quite pertinently , therefore , Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	warns his readers that `` modern plays should be read as plays , with the eye of the imagination fixed upon their actual perform - ance , and not measured by old-fashioned literary standards . ''

		The student of the drama will not find in either volume any very fresh material .

		Indeed , Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	frankly admits that '' little effort has been made to shed any new light upon the topics discussed ; the attempt has been rather to present in small compass accurate general in - formation as to the leaders of the modern stage and their work , and to offer , in passing , some opinions as to the prospects and tendencies of dramatic art in our day . ''

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's some - what more pretentious aim is '' to put before the reader in synthetic fashion the native movement of our time in drama , placing emphasis upon what seem significant tendencies and illustrative personalities . ''

		Not only has each author lived up to his professions , but each has produced a well ordered and highly readable book .

		Both writers preface their main treatment by chapters on the general matter of the drama , with discussion more or less familiar even to the bucolic lover of the theatre , as , for instance , the eternal subject of giving the people what they want , the matter of morals , the spread of inter - est in the theatre , the '' tired business man , '' and the Syndicate , in Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's book ; and a set of definitions covering dramatic types , plot , characterization , and stage conventions , in Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	's work .

		Mr.

Thomas Y. Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		chapter on realism and the literary drama , cor - responding to Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's on the poetic drama , which latter is one of the sub-topics of his main treatment .

		The discussion as to whether there is or should be such a thing to-day as the literary drama , seems to be largely due to a confusion of terms .

		There is a tendency to regard `` lit - erary '' and `` poetic '' as synonymous expres - sions , and to conceive of literary drama only as that which is decked out in the flowing robes of blank verse .

		There is surely no need of falling back upon Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	's comfortable doctrine : `` The best way out of the difficulty is to ac - knowledge what grows more obvious day by day , that drama , perhaps beginning in , or at least early combining with , literature , has evolved into a separate art , still relying on literary ele - ments , doubtless , but by no means exclusively , or even principally . ''

		Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	's statement seems much more reasonable : '' If you have faithfully and searchingly studied your fellow-citizens ; if you have selected from amongst them those characters that are interesting in themselves , and that also possess an enduring human interest ; if , in study - ing these interesting personalities , you have severely selected , from the mass of their sayings and doings and impulses , those words and deeds and tendencies which mark them at once as individuals and as types ; if you have then recast and reimagined all the materials ; if you have cunningly shaped them into a story of pro- gressive and accumulative action ; if you have done all this , though you may not have used a single word but what is spoken in ordinary American intercourse to-day , I will venture to say that you have written a piece of live American literature , that is , you have written something that will not only be interesting on the boards of the theatre , but that can be read with pleasure in your library ; can be discussed , argued about , tested , and digested as literature . ''

		As Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	epitomizes all this , `` truly literary drama is essentially neither poetical nor rhetorical , but simply good drama drama raised to the nth power . ''

		It is not a matter of verse form ; dialogue wanting the accomplish - ment of verse may be as fully charged with poetic spirit as some dialogue not in that form , as anyone can illustrate at his pleasure from Shake - speare or any other really literary dramatist .

		Indeed ,
Lear	PERSON	's faltering cry , '' Do not laugh at me , For as I am a man , I think this lady To be my child
Cordelia	PERSON	, '' is as simple as anything in prose dialogue , and as far removed from the exalted blank verse which in the popular mind is associated with the poetic drama as is the veriest prose of a modern play , and yet it is the quintessence of poetry .

		The real difference between such dialogue and
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 57 that of the poetic play of to-day is in the degree to which common speech has been raised , in the one case to the nth power , in the other to the square .


Goldsmith	PERSON	and
Sheridan	PERSON	wrote lit - erary dramas , as did
Congreve	PERSON	and
Farquhar	PERSON	; but they did not use blank verse or any other poetic form .

		That poetic drama , strictly so called , is not always dramatic or , for that matter , always poetic does not argue against the essential verity of the type .

		Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	,
Miss Peabody	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- whom Mr.
Burton	PERSON	triply de - signates as `` Peabody , '' `` Miss Peabody , '' and `` Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	, '' to the confusion of the unso - phisticated reader -RRB- , and Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	have made brave beginnings , which it is reason - able enough to suppose will lead to even greater accomplishment .

		There is nothing inherently impossible in Wall Street 's finding voice in a poetic drama ; already we are hearing of the `` romance of Wall Street . ''

		After Mr.
Mac	PERSON	-
Kaye	PERSON	's '' To-morrow , '' a fairly successful drama , throughout suggestive of the poetic , on the sub - ject of eugenics , nothing is impossible to a dra - matist with the gift of poetic expression .

		Of course , the poetic drama can not be written by a playwright whose genius runs only to scissors and paste .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	has faith in the future of the poetic drama , he says he '' must disagree with those who hold that verse is no longer ac - ceptable in our modern theatre and particularly de trop in ' practical
America	LOCATION	. ' ''

		The whole discussion parallels the dispute as to whether Pope is a poet or not .

		Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	's criticisms of plays and play - wrights are , on the whole , discerning and just .

		Occasionally in his desire to say as much as possible in the fewest words he appears super - ficial and even unfair .

		Thus he remarks of Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	's '' To-morrow '' that '' the central situation wherein the hero , to save the heroine from her infatuation for the unwholesome lover she has selected , hurls him over a cliff into the sea ... does not grow at all logically out of the characters . ''

		Why not ?

		This act is but the explosion of the volcano in the hero 's breast , which was mentioned earlier , and surely the motive for this explosion was furnished in the events .

		Likewise when Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	says of Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's '' The Pigeon '' that it shows '' the futility of charity for the submerged tenth , '' he ignores what is really back of the resultant fact , that social conditions have reduced the submerged tenth to a state where such lenitive measures as charity fail to remedy the disease ; the depth to which the evil has sunk into the social state is the subject of the play .

		So again , Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	does not do justice to
Synge	PERSON	's '' In the Shadow of the Glen '' when he says , in briefly outlining the plot of the play : '' Luckily there is a tramp at hand , who carries her -LSB- the wife -RSB- away with him . ''

		The tramp is the actual embodiment of the liberty that the woman has all her life longed for and that her husband has denied her ; now it comes to her , and in a sweep of feeling she sees in the tramp a messenger from a better and a brighter world .

		Nor does '' Riders to the Sea '' merely depict `` the quiet sorrow of a mother whose six sons have one by one become the victims of the remorseless sea . ''

		It portrays the utter desolation which overtakes a woman when all hope and all fear are gone together .

		Curiously in this treatment of Synge there is no mention of ''
Deirdre	PERSON	of the Sorrows , '' that most poignant of all his plays , the one which gives him his greatest claim to immortality .

		Both Mr.
Burton	PERSON	and Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	have fine hopes for the future of the American drama now in its infancy , and a constant faith born of knowledge .

		The significant fact emphasized by both men is the constant endeavor of Amer - ican dramatists to be true to American condi - tions , no longer to forage afield for plots but to get them at home , where they exist so abun - dantly .

		And Mr.
Burton	PERSON	admirably shows how well the young dramatist is exploring these fertile regions , the fields of American busi - ness life , of social conditions , of humor , of romance , of sheer idealism .

		There is a search for an idea , not a mere patching together of a set of scenes that will make out an evening 's entertainment for a jaded intellect .

		Mr.
Bur	PERSON	- ton , with splendid confidence in the future , declares that `` the higher instinct is astir , as never before ; that more intelligent activity has begun ; that the well-wishers of the theatre are everywhere fast consolidating for effective work of many kinds . ''

		58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	moral codes .

		A similar revolution is taking place in the reciprocal relations of
State	ORGANIZATION	and citizen , society and the individual .

		In books not fifty years old the expression `` social duties '' means the obligations of the individual to soci - ety .

		To-day it means just the reverse : the obligations of society to the individual .

		The old-fashioned citizen was supposed to exist , ethi - cally , for the
State	ORGANIZATION	; the new-fashioned
State	ORGANIZATION	is supposed to exist for the citizen .

		In former days , he was a coward and a traitor who was unwilling to die for the
State	ORGANIZATION	, if such sacrifice were demanded .

		The contemporary
State	ORGANIZATION	may perish under the weight of the burdens social reformers would place upon it ; but in the bright light of to-day it is clear that there is no worthier end for
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a people we have not yet become fully adjusted to this new order of ideas .

		American life has been prevailingly rural ; and agricul - ture , so we are told by the economic interpreters of the human soul , creates a patriarchal habit of mind .

		American thought has , further , been powerfully influenced by the accessibility of a frontier of no-man 's land , where the young and strong and resolute might build homes and for - tunes , where the weak and vacillating might beat crooked paths leading nowhere , after the pat - terns of their souls .

		Hence an individualism developed , which was not confined to a prosper - ous middle class , as in
England	LOCATION	and other coun - tries of
Europe	LOCATION	, but permeated all levels of old American society .

		The pioneer American viewed his good fortune complacently as the pro- duct of his own unaided exertions , even though he did , with feigned modesty , impute it to his good luck , or gave perfunctory thanks to God for it .

		In misfortune he cursed his luck ; but the first shock over , he `` took his medicine , '' and set resolutely about reconstructing his hopes .

		And if the misfortune involved his death , he closed his eyes in the pride of dying '' with his boots on . ''

		We have travelled far from those brave days of individualism ; but their spirit still haunts us .

		In an abstract way we know that the con - ditions of American life are rapidly becoming assimilated to those of the Old World , and that consequently the institutions that recommend themselves to the Old World should recommend themselves to us also .

		The Old World has found it necessary for the
State	ORGANIZATION	to assume a constantly increasing portion of the burden of accident , disease , old age , and unemployment .

		Super - ficial historians have informed us that this movement received its impetus from
Bismarck	LOCATION	's attempts to `` back-fire '' Socialism ; but this , as Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	proves conclusively , is an error .

		Social insurance in
Europe	LOCATION	grew out of the con - ditions of modern industralism ; consequently we know that it must develop iu
America	LOCATION	also .

		With most American students , however , sup - port of social insurance is still a matter of intel - lectual conviction , not a matter of feeling , a fact that manifests itself in the colorless char - acter of their writings .

		Such writings have not been lacking in number or in scientific merit , but we had nothing approaching a spirited and authoritative treatment of social insurance until Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	published his important work .

		Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	's qualifications for the compo - sition of a work of this kind are numerous .

		He was born in
Russia	LOCATION	, and emigrated to
America	LOCATION	in his eighteenth year .

		Since his arrival in this country he has lived , for the most part , in the centres of industry and com - merce of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard , and thus has been kept immune from the old American spirit of individualism .

		He is a highly trained statistician one of the best of the country , and possesses an indefatigable zeal for research .

		For three years he was employed as a statistical expert in the
United States Bureau of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, and devoted his entire time to the preparation of the Report of the
Commissioner of Labor	ORGANIZATION	on `` Workmen 's Insurance and Compensation Systems in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Further , Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	is a propagandist by instinct ; it is his ideal to produce a convincing argument , not a scientific treatise of an exhaustive and stupefying char - acter .

		Accordingly , while the scientific quality of his book is unimpeachable , this is not its chief merit .

		What especially distinguishes the work is the keen interest it excites .

		The mass of facts presented is enormous , but the material is so well organized that even the reader who prides himself upon his contempt for facts will cry `` More ! ''

		The book will be welcomed by the trained economist as the most competent treatment of the subject in English and the most convenient treatment in any language .

		The general reader should welcome it still more warmly as the one work that provides him with all the elements necessary for a rational opinion on this important subject .

		What do we know of the need for social in - surance in the
United States	LOCATION	?

		Very little .

		For many years the subject of industrial accidents has been prominent in public discussion , but we do not know even the number of such accidents .

		Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	estimates the annual number of fatal accidents at 30,000 , about a third more
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAJL 59 than occur in the whole of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The num - ber of accidents resulting in permanent disabil - ities he estimates at 200,000 , of which 60,000 are mutilations .

		To these may be added tem - porary disabilities lasting three months or more , estimated at 170,000 .

		Such figures convey little meaning to the mind , but we shall under - stand them better if we translate them into terms of a war of the machine upon our own workingmen , a war vastly more destructive of life , vastly more fruitful in suffering , than the war of factions across the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	.

		Still less do we know of the extent in which our working class is afflicted with diseases originating in the conditions of their employ - ment .

		The money loss from industrial disease must be enormous .

		Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	estimates it at
$ 650,000,000	MONEY	.

		Whatever the worth of the estimate , all will agree that such figures tend to minimize rather than exaggerate the extent of the evil .

		What is lost is not a few hundred millions that might have been spent for com - forts and luxuries , but medicine and nursing for a million invalids , bread and clothing for a million little children .

		Everyone is familiar with the pathetic spec - tacle of the superannuated workman , forced to eat the bitter bread of charity , or by right of kin to place the burden of his support upon the frail budget of some workingman 's household .

		How many of them are there in the
United States	LOCATION	?

		We do not know .

		In thrifty
France	LOCATION	fifty-seven per cent of all persons seventy years of age and over qualified in
1910	DATE	for pensions to aged dependents .

		In
England	LOCATION	seventy-five per cent of the same age group are now receiving pensions , by title of need .

		Even in agricul - tural
New Zealand	LOCATION	and
Australia	LOCATION	between thirty-five and forty per cent of all persons over sixty-five have proved their need for pen - sions .

		Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	accepts as conservative
Squier	PERSON	's estimate that we have a million and
a quarter	DATE	of persons over sixty-five supported by charity , public and private .

		And these are not men who have led idle and dissolute lives ; since such men do not commonly grow old .

		They are men whose services have merited a serene old age .

		Accident , disease , and superannuation are among the inevitable incidents of human life .

		What is not inevitable is the destitution that so often accompanies them .

		We have relied upon the natural adjustment of wages to pro- vide a fund out of which the costs of occupa - tional risk and disease might be met .

		In vain ; wages are not higher in dangerous and unsan - itary trades than in others .

		We have relied upon private thrift to make provision for old age .

		Again , in vain .

		A great proportion of our industrial workers receive wages that barely suffice for current living .

		Mutual associations to meet the costs of accident and disease have been organized in every industrial country ; great efforts have been made to extend the scope of their activities , but their achievements have been of slight consequence .

		The only solution of these problems must be attained through state action .

		To this conclusion Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	's argument must force even the reader of a decidedly individualistic habit of mind .

		For all the untoward accidents of the worker 's life Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	's formula is insurance , with the costs borne either wholly or in part by the industry .

		For accidents the industry should bear the whole burden .

		If every 200,000 tons of coal costs a human life , surely the incidental economic loss should be borne , not by the dependents of the victim , but by the employer who profits from the mine or by the house - holder who buys the coal .

		No one will dissent from this conclusion , if such accidents are due to the fault of the employer , or are inevitably bound up with the industry .

		But suppose the accident results from the victim 's own negli - gence .

		Suppose it results from his intoxication .

		Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	regards all inquiry into the dis - tribution of blame as vicious .

		The employer has a right to dismiss careless and dissipated workmen .

		This , Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	argues , is the proper penalty , not forfeiture of accident benefits .

		For the protection of the worker against the costs of sickness , Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	supports the plan whereby the employer and employee both contribute to the expense of insurance .

		It is obvious that in so far as sickness arises out of occupational conditions , there is every reason why indemnification should be at the expense of the employer , or , in the last analysis , of the industry .

		It is worthy of note , however , that Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	makes no attempt to distribute the cost between employer and employee on such a basis .

		His criterion of excellence is solely one of the proportionate sharing of the cost : the more the employer pays the better the system .

		For the relief of old age , two methods are employed , insurance as typified in the German system , and pensions as typified in the British system .

		Most individualists prefer the plan of insurance , since it places at least a part of the burden on the beneficiary , and hence savors less of charity .

		Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	prefers this plan 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	also , but for different reasons .

		By the insurance plan the employer can be made to contribute , and thus each industry is saddled with super - annuation costs , as well as with the costs of sickness and accident .

		Furthermore , this plan admits of differentiation .

		The highly paid worker receives a larger superannuation benefit than the ill paid worker ; and thus differences in standards may be maintained even in old age .

		To the reviewer neither argument seems cogent .

		If we should penalize an industry for exposing its workers to accident and disease , there seems to be no good reason why we should penalize it for permitting them to survive to old age .

		It can not be said that it is the exploitation of the laborer by the industry employing him that is chiefly responsible for his arriving at old age in penury .

		Low wages may have the effect of increasing the profits of an industry , or they may have the effect of cheapening its products ; in the latter case the responsibility for exploit - ation is diffused throughout society .

		Further - more , exploitation may take the form , not of low wages , but of a low purchasing power of money , resulting from the acts of the retailer who gives short weight and charges full price ; the landlord who extorts the highest profits from the poorest tenements , the
State	ORGANIZATION	which levies the heaviest burdens upon its weakest citizens .

		Where the responsibility begins and ends no one knows ; it is therefore unreasonable to apportion the burden in any other way than through ordinary taxation .

		As for the differentiation of benefits , we may accept the plan as desirable in case of temporary disability , through accident or sickness .

		If the skilled laborer is temporarily disabled , he should not he forced down to the standard of the un - skilled laborer , lest he accept such a standard and lose motive for regaining his former earning power .

		This ground for differentiation of insur - ance benefits is wanting in the case of old age .

		Here it would appear wisest to assure a reason - able minimum of subsistence to all the aged ; if any persons desire higher standards in old age than others , let them be free to establish such standards through their personal ^ thrift .

		Because a man has once belonged to an aristocracy of labor is no good reason why the
State	ORGANIZATION	should constitute for his benefit an aristocracy of the superannuated .

		But what of the stigma of charity , if all are pensioned alike ?

		Dr.
Kubinow	PERSON	, like the indi - vidualists , supposes that the pension system necessarily implies an inquiry into the means of the pensioners , and the limitation of benefits to the very poor .

		It is doubtful whether such limitation is advisable .

		If three-fourths of the aged in
Great Britain	LOCATION	are able to qualify for pensions under the present act , four-fifths , at least , are so poor that a truly just
State	ORGANIZATION	would pension them .

		Of the remaining fifth , who do not need the pension , some would doubtless apply for it and receive it .

		This , however , is a matter of no great importance ; if the aged rich demand their stipend , the State can later recover the funds through an inheritance tax .

		Such costs as would result from an all-embracing pension scheme would be amply compensated by the removal from the pensioner of the stigma of charity .

		A combination of insurance and pensions appears to be the only adequate means of meet - ing the just claims of labor under modern indus - trialism .

		This is the view of Dr.
Rubinow	PERSON	; and we may accept it , reserving the right to retrace for ourselves the boundary line between the two systems .

		With the assumption by
the State	ORGANIZATION	of such a relation to labor , the economic distress now attendant upon personal misfortune would be much abated .

		Would the incentive to personal industry and thrift disappear ?

		No ;
the State	ORGANIZATION	can never guarantee more than a minimum ; all the motives that spur men on to attain a position of superiority would remain .

		Would the springs of charity be dried up , with the disappearance of hopeless poverty ?

		No ; private charity would have abundant field for exercise in assistance to those who are seeking to rise from a lower to a higher plane .

		There is reason to believe that the sight of the irre - mediable poverty of those who are permanently incapacitated tends to produce callousness , rather than to call forth charity .

		Private charity thrives when it may help men to help themselves ; and opportunity for such charity will always remain .

		Will the burden crush the State ?

		No .

		There is no modern
State	ORGANIZATION	which could not assume it , and still raise rev - enues ample for all its legitimate needs in time of peace .

		But the burden will none the less be heavy so heavy that no State that has once assumed it will seek to enter upon competition with its neighbors in the arming of men or the building of forts or Dreadnoughts .

		MR.
GEORGE MOORE	PERSON	'S `` Hail and Farewell Vale ! '

		the concluding volume of the three which he has de - voted to his reminiscences of

Appleton	PERSON	.

		It is understood that the author deals even more faithfully with some of his con - temporaries than in the former volumes .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 61 MORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNKNOWABLE .

		* Although
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's new book , '' Our Eternity , '' is of much interest , it would be an impervious worshipper who could assert on read - ing it that the '' poet of mysticism '' speaks with the same authority when he turns out-and-out philosopher as when he remains at home en - veloped in mystic vapors .

		The chapters on `` The Theosophical Hypo - thesis '' and `` The Neospiritualistic Hypothesis '' are admirable , on the whole , for their adequacy of treatment and for their fairness .

		A spiritist could not object to the author 's leniency ; and at the same time a skeptic would find his analysis rigorous enough .

		This part of the book is valu - able to the honest inquirer who lacks time to go through the wealth , or wilderness , of spirit - istic evidence , indeed , it is the only part that possesses absolute value to a fact-seeker and positive thinker .

		The key to the whole is in this final sentence : '' In any case , I would not wish my worst enemy , were his understanding a thousandfold loftier and a thousandfold mightier than mine , to be condemned eternally to inhabit a world of which he had surprised an essential secret and of which , as a man , he had begun to grasp the least atom . ''

		Maeterlinck as a mystic naturally wishes the world to be the greatest conceivable mystery the greater the better for mysticism , which loves to lose itself in an '' O Altitude . ''

		It would seem that he had a slight suspicion that in this age of super-active inquiry someone was likely to sur - prise a small secret from the universe , and he writes his book in the attempt to head off such a catastrophe .

		He rejects all possible solutions , including the religious ones , with a dogmatism not supported by completeness of logic or evi - dence ; and the conclusion is the most unsettled and agnostic imaginable , except in one vital point , the absolute certainty with which he endows his negative conclusions .

		Knowing so little of the universe as
Maeterlinck	PERSON	pretends to know , it ought to be clear to him that he can not know that it is impossible to know anything .

		Perhaps anything and everything is true , than which I can conceive of no greater mystery .

		The secret of the universe may be too simple and near for the philosopher ; it may be that the random and hazy notion of the man in the street is right ; it may be that every good and every bad instinct , every good and every bad * OuB ETERNITY .

Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		world - view , is a true interpretation .

		This would appear to come nearer the meaning of an earlier and wiser book of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's , '' The Treasure of the Humble . ''

		At any cost to his pet theory ,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	should not commit logical suicide by condemning any , even the absurdest , hypo - thesis .

		But this is the common squirrel-cage in which all agnostics revolve .

		I cite two instances of assumptions that no one should make , certainly not an agnostic .

		This is the first : '' Total annihilation is impossible .

		We are the pris - oners of an infinity without outlet , wherein nothing perishes , wherein everything is dispersed , but nothing lost ... To be able to do away with a thing , that is to say , to fling it into nothingness , nothingness would have to exist ; and if it exists , under whatever form , it is no longer nothingness . ''

		With the indefensible remark that '' total anni - hilation is impossible '' the author assumes that he has disposed of one of the `` four and no more '' solutions .

		For argument he creates a concrete `` nothingness '' into which he says matter would have to be flung .

		But is it not possible to conceive of a species of annihilation whereby consciousness ceases ?

		Consciousness is a stream , as seen by modern psychologists , existing not in space but in time .

		So it may stop .

		The consciousness of wicked people , who have not worked out a soul worthy of everlast - ing life , why should it not `` cease upon the midnight , with no pain '' rather than go on to vitiate the cosmic consciousness ?

		Without doubt , that is an imaginable view , and one that may hereafter gain some standing .

		The second assumption is seen in the fol - lowing extracts : '' I repeat , if we do not admit that thousands of worlds , similar in all points to our own , in spite of the billions of adverse chances , have always existed and still exist to-day , we are sapping the foundations of the only possible conception of the universe or of infinity . '' ''

		Whatever the ultimate truth may be , whether we admit the abstract , absolute and perfect infinity the changeless , immovable infinity which has attained per - fection and which knows everything , to which our rea - son tends or whether we prefer that offered to us by the evidence , undeniable here below , of our senses the infinity which seeks itself , which is still evolving and not yet established it behoves us above all to foresee in it our fate , which , for that matter , must in either case end by absorption in that very infinity . ''

		In all this it will be noticed that the author is very certain of infinity .

		To be sure , in the second quotation , there are two kinds of infin - ity , but we are forced to accept one or the other .

		The suspicion that the universe may not be infinite never crosses his mind .

		Yet finity 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	is not unthinkable ; in fact there are certain mathematical considerations that make it more and more worthy of examination .

		The ortho - dox argument for infinity , that it is impossible to conceive of finity ,
Poe	PERSON	shattered in his ''
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- reka '' long ago .

		As between impossibles , he said , there can be no greater or lesser .

		Finity and infinity are two incomprehensibles ; it would be silly to risk our all on the one before we have fully investigated the other .

		Yet in this book of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's , `` finity '' is assumed out of court : the word is only a counter wherewith to define infinity .

		One curious and striking hint of the drift of current thought is the indifference with which the author regards religion , and the utter neg - ligibility which he assigns to its solution . ''

		Let us lose no time in putting from our minds all that the positive religions have left there .

		Let us remember only that it is not for us to prove that they are not proved , but for them to establish that they are true . '' ''

		If this God punishes us for not having blindly fol - lowed a faith that does not force itself irresistibly upon the intelligence which He gave us ; if He chastises us for not having made , in the presence of the great enigma with which He confronts us , a choice which is rejected by that best and most divine part which He has implanted in us , we have nothing left to reply ; we are the dupes of a cruel and incomprehensible sport , we are the victims of a terrible snare and an immense injustice ; and whatever the torments wherewith that injustice may load us , they will be less intolerable than the eternal presence of its author . ''

		Of all the javelins hurled against the various '' solutions , '' this against religion is the deadliest .

		It will come as a shock to the devout churchman who knows that
Maeterlinck	PERSON	has much of the prophet in him and is hailed by many as the most important of living writers .

		It will of course occasion little surprise to the student of the signs of the times .

		Many straws have been blowing in that direction , and recently have come some mighty puffs from such widely different men as
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	,
George San	PERSON	- tayana , and
Rudolph Eucken	PERSON	.

		Socialism has long been blowing a hot breath against the cold and senseless pillars of an institutional religion .

		However , it is worthy of more than passing interest for anyone to find mysticism and relig - ion at such odds . ''

		It is well to acquire by degrees the habit of understanding nothing . ''

		If we interpret this statement generously enough , there is much pith and poetry hidden herein .

		Mysticism and won - der are fine cures for the weariness of a blase intellect .

PERCIVAL BEYER	PERSON	.

		THE STUDY or SHAKESPEARE 'S STAGE - CRAFT : A CLIMAX .

		* Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	is well qualified , in certain respects , to be the judicial
summer	DATE	- up of that busy study of the Elizabethan stage and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's stagecraft which has been in progress for some years .

		His new book wears a climactic air .

		But while fully appreci - ating its several excellences , one must also feel that the work as a whole fails to present adequately the Shakespeare one finds either in reading the plays or in watching them pre - sented on the stage .

		One explanation is that the author endeavors , consciously or not , to fulfil two purposes which , when looked into , reveal themselves as cross-purposes .

		Primarily , as he himself suggests , the book `` is a study of his -LSB-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's -RSB- stagecraft . ''

		But it pursues also , and from a critical standpoint , Shake - speare 's general dramatic development , taking up the plays in roughly chronological order f and presenting a characterization of each .

		This method of procedure the author was led to adopt partly , as he intimates , by the analogy of his earlier critical biography of Moliere ; and per - haps partly also by the predilection , widespread at the present time , for tracing the `` evolution '' of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, as of other organisms .

		The case of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, however , presents a problem quite different from that presented by his great predecessor ; and on the whole easier .

		Furthermore , Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's original contribution , in the case of Shakespeare or more exactly , the extent to which he has fused old and new ideas about
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in the heat of an original treatment is not sufficient to justify so ambitious a review of the general subject ; especially as this subject had already been handled , after much the same fashion , in Professor
Baker	PERSON	's book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	as a dramatist .

		And finally ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's stage - craft , in so far as it may be distinguished from his art in toto , is after all a thing of particulars .

		It may therefore be best presented after a method analogous to that in which Professor
Moulton	PERSON	treated
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's story-weaving artistry : namely , through a scientific analysis of underlying principles , illustrated by a de - * SHAKSPEBB AS A PLAYWRIGHT .

		By
Brander Matthews	PERSON	'
New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		t On pages 85 and 89 it is stated , as though an ascertained fact , that Shakespeare finished '' Titus Andronicus '' before writing his four early comedies , and these before turning to ''
Richard III.	PERSON	, '' ``
Richard II.	PERSON	, '' and `` King
John	PERSON	. ''

		It might here be added that on page 79 the parts of the lovers in ''
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream '' are mixed .

		1914 -RSB- 63 tailed examination of a limited number of plays .

		The succession of fleeting glimpses which Professor
Matthews	PERSON	gives us of Shake - speare 's work fails to open up for us its dra - maturgic meaning .

		This deficiency , to be sure , does not prevent the book 's being frequently interesting and sug - gestive in the matter of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's technique .

		The author 's knowledge of the drama in general , and of Molidre in particular , enables him to give us many a stimulating comparison .

		From his knowledge of stage history and tradition he reconstructs for us , though very hypothetically , the intimate relationship which must have existed between
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's work and the actors who originally '' created '' the roles .

		A commonplace chapter on the Elizabethan audience is compen - sated for by an excellent chapter on Shake - speare 's theatre and another on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's work as reviser and imitator .

		The main features of these two subjects which the reader of Shake - speare can really profit by , are nicely disen - tangled from the mass of pointless details which investigation has piled up .

		It is when the author gets farthest from those aspects of his subject which are closely related to the stage , that what he has to say is most lacking in fresh interest .

		For example , his discussion of the characters of Falstaff and Hamlet , which strikes the reader as distinctly digressive , is also thoroughly trite , and fre - quently clogged with encomiastic statements of a surprisingly conventional nature .

		It should here be remarked , too , that in a book which professes to deal with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's obvious , dramaturgic motives , rather than with those attributed to him by critics , it is not pardonable to assert that Hamlet delays his vengeance be - cause '' some means must be found to expose the guilt of
Claudius	PERSON	and to make his death not a mere assassination but a righteous execution . ''

		This motive is of course what Werder and other determinedly palpable critics have discovered between the lines ; an audience does not feel it .

		Indeed , Professor
Matthews	PERSON	not infrequently makes a quick transit from the theatre to his library , or study .

		For instance , we feel that his imagination is entirely with the audience when he shows us that the sublimity of ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' '' which stood out stark upon the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan stage , is sadly diminished , not to say obscured , by the elaborate scenery , the compli - cated trappings , and the multitudinous effects , with which it is perforce represented to-day . ''

		But almost every other point which he has to make concerning the sublimity of this drama has already been better made by Professor
Bradley	PERSON	in his volume on '' Shakespearean Tragedy . ''

		On the whole , we are indebted to Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's work for fully demonstrating two useful truths .

		First , the study of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's stagecraft will have had a corrective effect upon the currents of Shakespearean criticism re - ducing some romantic bubblings and opening up certain shallow channels which had been neglected .

		Second , critical comprehension of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's stagecraft can not , by any means , be distended into Shakespearean criticism ; since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's most characteristic work is , after all , essentially poetic in conception , like that of Sophocles , and not merely excellent drama poeti - cally adorned , as the nai 've reader might gather from the present work .

		And since these two truths are just what the '' Shakespearean stage movement , '' if it may so be called , has all along tended to demonstrate , surely Professor Mat - thews 's book may fittingly be designated the climax of that movement .

		It is impossible , indeed , to conceive that the public will require still another book of the same general nature .

		64 DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	'' Lyrics and Dramas '' now published , in which vol - ume the spontaneous lyrical quality is sadly to seek .

		Now and then it may still be detected , as in `` An
October	DATE	Day '' : '' Through dry and hurrying leaves Golden our way ; Sound of the wind , south-west From the wild day ! ''

		Wild all thy loosened hair , Blown in my eyes ; Till thou dost seem a part Of autumn skies . ''

		Wild from the setting sun Rushes the rain ; Ah , be it true or false , Thy kiss again . ''

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	endeavors to be timely , but it is at the cost of being poetical , as when he says of `` The Aeroplane '' : '' Whate'er the silly crowd enjoys , Our Progress is but stench and noise , We scream and shout and grasp but toys .

		Leave us the air ! ''

		The earth is blackened from our eyes , And filled with dismal hoots and cries , Spare to profane the holier skies ; Leave us the air ! '' ''

		The Submarine '' likewise proves deficient as a lyrical text : '' What clamour of old ocean-war , What thunder belched at
Trafalgar	ORGANIZATION	, Matches in terror the unseen Stab of the silent Submarine ? ''

		So , late in time has come to be This man-built menace of die sea ; God gave no monster to the main To make the works of man so vain . ''

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	had better leave these themes to
Signer Marinetti	PERSON	and his anarchistic gang .

		Most of these pieces seem tasks that the author has set himself , and the utterance is without the inner compulsion of true poetry .

		The '' dramas '' of this collection are three short pieces , not particularly significant , that occupy the latter half of the volume .

		A generous half of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's new volume is taken up by ''
Helen Redeemed	PERSON	, '' a narrative poem in couplets , with many dramatic episodes , dealing with the siege and sack of Troy .

		We may illustrate its quality by a passage from the last `` stave , '' after the stratagem of the wooden horse has made the invaders free of the city : '' But now is crying fear abroad and wins The very household of the shameful lover ; Now are the streets alive , for worse in cover Like a trapt rat to die than fight the odds Under the sky .

		Now women shriek to the Gods , And men run witlessly , and in and out The Greeks press , burning , slaying , and the rout
Screameth to Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		As at sea the mews Pack , their wings battling , when some fresh wrack strews The tideway , and in greater haste to stop Others from prey , will let their morsel drop , And all the while make harsh lament so here The avid spoilers bickered in their fear To be manoeuvred out of robbery , And tore the spoil , and mangled shamefully Bodies of men to strip them , and in haste To forestall ravishers left the victims chaste .

		Ares , the yelling God , and Ate '' white Swept like a snow-storm over Troy that night ; And towers rockt , and in the naked glare Of fire the smoke climbed to the upper air ; And clamour was as of the dead broke loose . ''

		Shorter poems upon classical themes '' Hypsipyle , '' `` Oreithyia , '' `` Clyde '' , '' `` The Argive Women '' follow this epic , and round out the volume , with the addition of some sonnets and epigrams .

		We quote the lovely sonnet , ''
Quel Giorno	PERSON	Piu '' : '' That day it was the last of many days , Nor could we know when such days might be given Again we read how
Dante	ORGANIZATION	trod the ways Of utmost Hell , and how his heart was riven By sad
Francesca	LOCATION	, where sin was forgiven So far that , on her Paolo fixing gaze She supt on his again , and thought it Heaven , She knew her gentler fate and felt it praise . ''

		We read that lovers ' tale ; each lookt at each ; But one was fearless , innocent of guile ; So did the other learn what she could teach : We read no more , we kins 'd not , but a smile Of proud possession flasht , hover 'd a while ` Twixt soul and soul .

		A Symphony , '' by Mr.
Arthur E. J. Legge	PERSON	, is a long philosophical poem of the soul 's quest for a solution of the unfathomable mystery of existence . ''

		The dust of his endeavour Is blown about the world .

		Time works to rend and sever The symbols that are hurled Down from each ruined altar And shattered temple roof , To bid devotion falter , And worship own reproof .

		Inscrutable and solemn The ironies that cling To splintered shaft and column And stone-work , harbouring Remembrance of the glory That crowned a passing creed , Dead chapters in the story Of Man 's immortal need . ''

		This extract is from the opening `` andante , '' and is only one of the great variety of metres employed in the four movements , through the languid `` adagio '' and the tripping `` scherzo '' to the long roll of the final `` allegro . ''

		As an example of Mr.
Legge	PERSON	's shorter pieces , we give these stanzas on '' Spring '' a theme not unfamiliar to poets : '' The first faint note of
Spring	DATE	Hums through the air , and surges Fiercely in troubled veins , With a mutinous ache that urges Our souls to go over the mountain-ring And view the uncharted plains . ''

		We know not whose the call That stirs in the blood , and maddens With hope and a strange desire ; Even though the vague thought saddens , How early the blossoming dreams will fall And Autumn veil Life 's fire .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 65 '' But the voice , to shame our doubt , Murmurs a song of nesting , Ancient before our birth , An anthem of Power unresting , That forges the re-born harmony out From the old , orchestral Earth . ''

		We can not say that Mr.
Legge	PERSON	's verse is stirring , but it is thoughtfully wrought , and pleasing to the refined sense .

		`` What weakling urges that the starry nights In woodland wanton with the joyous sprites , In meadow peopled with the tripping fays , '' Have fled forever , and our souls are borne In endless circuit of the streets forlorn ?

		Who sings a requiem for the golden days ? ''

		Though now no longer amid alleys green Brave hearts go riding , and the kisses keen Of sun and tempest uncomplaining share , '' Though doubts delude us , and by deadly rote We learn Life 's lesson , in stray hearts remote The sylvan secret lingers unaware . ''

		Thus opens the `` Valediction '' of ``
England	LOCATION	's Gar - land , '' by Mr.
George Bartram	PERSON	, a sheaf of verses dedicated to the memory of Borrow and '' composed afield , in that abiding-place of beauty and romance , the remoter South of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		These are outdoor songs in praise of the vagabond life , and inspired by memories of
England	LOCATION	's historical and poetical past .

		They are dated -LRB- in spirit -RRB- all the way from the fourteenth century to the nineteenth , and evoke the ghosts of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethans , of
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	, and
Cromwell	PERSON	, and
Cobbett	PERSON	.

		The following verses express the spirit in which the author has written : '' Oh , yield not this that stirs thy sanguine heart , To the dull rabble 's shallow scrutiny : That jaded tribe can have no part with thee , Thy thorn-fenced nosegays , or thy rugged art . ''

		Seek thon no welcome from that alien crew , Leave thy poor posy to the cautious test Of English only , yet of
England	LOCATION	's best : The tardy verdict of the royal few .

		. ''

		See that thy bantling wear a sober dress Good English homespun of the ancient time , For much that masketh it as modern rime Is tangled fustian , utter weariness . ''

		Snatch thou from yore the stout simplicities And humours strange -LRB- then
England	LOCATION	but drew breath By love of life and valiant scorn of death -RRB- , Be thy quaint garland woven all of these . '' ''

		Lonicera '' is a long dramatic lyric in which a man and a woman disinter their dead love , and indulge in mutual recrimination , which leads to a better understanding and a sort of forced reconcilia - tion .

		It is written in such blank verse as this : '' There is no heaven lovers may not climb With the strong pulse of two-fold passion blent In psychic pinions Godward , nor no hell So deep that Love may hide his dead away Among its nadir-night of mocking stars , That haunt like ghosts what love might else have been ... Such reverence as man may give was yours Freely , I knew no higher God than Love , Nor needed any .

		Now is Reverence Done to such death as no dog ever died .

		And when you lied against my love there died Something , in flower , that will not bloom again . ''

		This is the first of a group of long pieces which fill about one-half of Mr.
John Helston	PERSON	's volume , '' Aphrodite and Other Poems . ''

		The love which is license seems to be their central theme .

		They are followed by an elegy upon
Swinburne	PERSON	, from which one section is here quoted : '' I hear thine echoes round , as though the world Fills her own flight with paeans through the spheres Whilst dying creeds as rotting leaves are swirled Along the dust of the decaying years , Till all the tree of Priestcraft 's faith be bare Of fruit or any blossom as of leaves : Yea , as a god in whom no man believes Shall surely perish , faith shall perish there .

		Before man was were only Truth and Song .

		Yea , singer , seer , and prophet , Master thou !

		Who sawest the future clearly come to pass , As from some far serene beyond the brow Of Morning , and God mirrored in a glass Wherein are Love and Truth where Fears are now .

		When man at last shall fare forth true and strong Of his own spirit , Truth shall right the wrong , The light of very God , that Falsehood mars : Still shall be heartened
April	DATE	into song , And there be heard old music in the stars . ''

		This tribute may fairly be grouped with those of Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	and Mr.
Arthur Ficke	PERSON	upon the same theme .

		There is a fine touch of indignation in the lines to
Shelley	LOCATION	, suggested by
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's mon - strously inept criticism : '' They say it : ' Beautiful and Ineffectual ' thou .

		Then is the sun all potent save of fire , Growth , and the might to swing the spheres and swing Through their eternal courses night and day . ''

		From the shorter poems that follow , we select these gravely beautiful lines `` In Autumn '' : '' I see the sun grow old , Grow grey and old , and full of quiet , creep From the still slopes and chasmed ways of clouds That fill the frontiers of his place of sleep : Wan suns , that bleach the shadows cast On stubble-fields all day with mist of gold , Where evenings each one earlier than the last From golden mist prepare their paler shrouds .

		As nightfall gathers stars with viewless hand , So death goes wide and gathers in the dusks : The sharp white breath of morning on the land Gleams whiter for the empty chestnut husks . ''

		At present Mr.
Helston	PERSON	seems to be classifiable as a neo-Swinburnian .

		But he is a young man , and he may in time acquire his own accent .

		This is to be hoped for , since his poetical gift is clearly out of the common .

		Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	's `` Salt - Water Ballads '' sing of '' The sailor , the stoker of steamers , the man with the clout , The chantyman bent at the halliards putting a tune to the shout , The drowsy man at the wheel and the tired lookout . ''

		These poems are avowedly youthful compositions , now reissued without much change from their orig - inal form .

		`` Hell 's Pavement '' is a characteristic specimen : 66 THE DIAL
Jan. 16	DATE	'' ' When I ' m discharged in
Liverpool	LOCATION	'n' draws my bit o ' pay , I wo n't come to sea no more .

		I '11 court a pretty little lass 'n have a weddin ' day , 'N' settle somewhere down ashore .

		I '11 never fare to sea again a-temptin '
Davy Jones	PERSON	, A-hearkenin ' to the cruel sharks a-hungerin ' for my bones ; I '11 run a blushin ' dairy-farm or go a-crackin ' stones , Or buy 'n' keep a little liquor-store , So he said . ''

		They towed her into
Liverpool	LOCATION	, we made the hooker fast , And the copper-bound officials paid the crew , An '
Billy	PERSON	drew his money , but the money did n't last , For he painted the alongshore blue , It was rum for Poll , and rum for Nan , and gin for
Jolly Jack	PERSON	. ''

		He shipped a week later in the clothes upon his back , He had to pinch a little straw , he had to beg a sack To sleep on , when his watch was through , So he did . ''

		Mr.
Roger Heath	PERSON	is a poet whose imagination has a cosmic quality .

		He sings pleasantly of `` The Great Bear '' as through the aeons the constellation views the pageant of the ascent of man from the brute .

		He even sings of the
Fourth Dimension	ORGANIZATION	as a possible future revealer of `` new loveliness for man to make his own . ''

		A fine poem called '' The Resurrection of the Gods '' has the following opening : '' The world went out in blood and fire When the power of the gods was broken .

		Then came an age of starless night , A night of dreams and slow desire , And a little glimmer of ancient light Was left it for a token .

		And the eyes of a watcher might have traced A little stirring in the waste . ''

		So much for the past .

		The closing poem in the volume is called `` Futurity , '' and sings of the return of the golden years in such strains as these : '' God shall close This book of life and turn the final page Of the old record that is written there , And the new Universe shall be unfurled .

		He shall inaugurate the golden age , The tearless aeon , and in all the world The wilderness shall blossom as the rose , And we shall enter , and the stars above Shall sing a paean for our victory .

		And then at last God 's spirit shall descend Into our hearts , and earthly love shall be A perfect copy of that perfect Love That made us fellow-workers for the End . ''

		`` Beginnings '' is the title of this modest little book of song that comes to us from the city of the dreaming spires .

		A second modest little volume that hails from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is `` The Quiet Spirit , '' by Mr.
John Spencer Muirhead	PERSON	.

		He opens with a deprecatory note : '' For I have known only of light
April	DATE	weather , Quick tears and quick laughter all mingled together , And nothing have known of a sorrow abiding Nor feared very greatly what darkness is hiding . ''

		He sings of `` The Poet '' in such dialogue as this : '' Who is he that is girdled with
summer	DATE	, Whose veil is the grey night 's woof ?

		That hath made the winds his pavilion and the ageless stars his roof ?

		It is I whose robe is the
summer	DATE	, The night is in mine eyes , I know the couch of the North Wind And the lair where the West Wind lies , And the stars are ever about me , and the flame of them never dies . ''

		Here is a charming picture of '' Night '' : '' Upon the web of night the dewed stars lie , And the cowled trees stand watching on the height To guard thy sleep , my soul ; in jewelled flight A myriad planets swim the seas on high little lake that breafchest every star , Mirror of sleep , from the broad-petalled sky On thee the star-lit fragrance softly ran , That tipped thy waves with opal and afar Silvered thy lilies ; O that hence might I Drink Lethe of thee and with waiting eyes Dream through the long , long nights of Paradise . ''

		Paraphrases from
Catullus	LOCATION	and from the French poets of love make up the bulk of Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	's `` Knave of Hearts . ''

		The original pieces are wistful , passionate strains of the kind that he has made familiar in earlier collections of his work .

		`` The Spirit and the Bride '' represents him at his best : '' If , when the Spirit and the Bride say Come !

		1 yet be found lingering by the way , Even as I linger while it is to-day , Wait thou , my God !

		although I journey from My home on earth and from thy other home , I will remember at the last , and say : Thou who wast near when I was far away , Take me : the Spirit and the Bride say Come ! ''

		Thou hast held me in the hollow of thy hand , And I have fought against thy power ; thou hast kept Thy watch over my spirit while it slept , Dreaming against thy wisdom ; I have planned Ways of escape , but thou hast overswept , Like loving water , all my dykes of sand . ''

		There is a close kinship between the muse of Mr.
Symons	PERSON	and the muse of Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	, as the following poem , placed side by side with the one just quoted , will show : '' The bloom upon the grape I ask no more , Nor pampered fragrance of the soft-lipped rose , I only ask of Him who keeps the Door To open it for one who fearless goes Into the dark , from which , reluctant , came His innocent heart , a little laughing flame ; I only ask that He who gave me sight , Who gave me hearing and who gave me breath , Give me the last gift in His flaming hand The holy gift of Death . ''

		We are always a little doubtful concerning the sin - cerity of these songs of satiety ; the pose is so easy for the young poet , and so unnatural .

		It takes a
Meredith	LOCATION	, in the ripeness of his wisdom , to sing convincingly of a yearning for the grave .

		Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's volume is entitled `` The Lonely Dancer , and Other Poems . ''

		Its contents are grace - ful lyrics of love and nature , with here and there an emergence of the note of human brotherhood .

		The following tribute to the poet 's present wife is very ingenious ; it reminds us of the lines written by
Aldrich	PERSON	to similar effect , explaining to his wife that all his earlier love lyrics were really veiled tributes to '' You dear , you , just you '' :
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 67 '' I thought , before my sunlit twentieth year , That I knew Love , and Death that goes with it ; And my young broken heart in little songs , Dew-like , I poured , and waited for my end Wildly and waited being then nineteen .

		I walked a little longer on my way , Alive , ` gainst expectation and desire , And , being then past twenty , I beheld The face of all the faces in the world Dewily opening on its stem for me .

		Ah , so it seemed , and , each succeeding year , Thus hath some woman blossom of the divine Flowered in my path , and made a frail delay In my true journey to my home in thee . ''

		The confession is so human that it almost disarms cynicism .

		It is the way of man to discover his '' Flos JEvorum '' at the close of a long series of amourettes and tendr esses .

		Tuneful twitterings , neatly scored in a variety of lyrical measures , are given us in `` A Wand and Strings , '' by Mr.
Benjamin R. C. Low	PERSON	.

		There is nothing very arresting or magical about these songs , but their technique is good , and their thought clean - cut .

		A little more weighty in thought than the others is the `` Rough-Hew Them How We Will , '' of which these are the opening stanzas : '' Far-flying warders turn and tell Of thunders in the dreadful hills ; Pale prophets of destruction swell Beneath our darkened window-sills ; Virtue is dead , they say , and song ; And civic pride is sore beset ; Riches are right , and honor , wrong ; The world remembers to forget . ''

		How are the walls of Babylon Tumbled and moulderous and gray !

		And how her ruined Parthenon The soul of
Athens	LOCATION	bears away !

		Slow-moving as a mist of sleep , The tides of destiny befall ; Sand cities reared heap on heap ; The ocean overruns them all . ''

		Yet are the pinnacles of gold Beleaguered by our heart 's desire , And still the hands of mortals hold The anguish of immortal fire : Death over death , the ramparts rise , And life on life , the builders go ; The spirit in the coral dies , The splendors of the coral grow . ''

		This is from `` The Apology of an Opium-Eater , '' found in Mr.
Julius West	PERSON	's `` Atlantis , and Other Poems '' : '' You ask if I feel conscience-pangs !

		You never hung where the moon hangs , You never rode in the Sun-God 's car Or ever became a flaming star , Tossed headlong into the heights of space To hold with comets a fiery race ... '' The courts of Heaven you never trod , Or heard the symphonies of God , Great sounds that massed and broke and tore You with them down a breathless shore , And breaking , colours bright became , And each a fierce vibrating flame , Rainbows that interwove and made A living net of every shade . ''

		There is imagination in these poems , and originality , especially in the long one which reshapes the legend of Atlantis .

		This picture of `` The Haunted Ship '' is striking : '' They are not men that walk her deck , She is no ship , but a shell ... For long years she has been a wreck , And those faint forms that move , as in a spell They once were men , and sailors of the sea , But now are flickers of the flames of hell Doomed to drift unceasingly Until an end shall come When the seas shall be still and winds be dumb , And to and fro she sways , And her torn rigging idly swings ... And a chill silence follows all her ways , ... Curst symbol of lost things . ''

		We like particularly this song of `` The Nun Re - leased '' : '' The convent bells do toll , do toll , For Sister
Anne	PERSON	died yesterday , And on the winds they say her soul Rides to its holiday . ''

		They toll because her body lies Within the chapel , on its bier , Stained-glass colours round her eyes , She seems to smile , yet somehow drear . ''

		For forty years , the Lord alone She served , and never looked on men , And trusted she had this wise sown Rare flowers of grace in God 's garden . ''

		But wrongly , for the truth , man knows , Though all are lost the soul who kill , God 's deepest anger falls on those Who leave the body living still . ''

		Reserving all his highest hate For those who make the flesh a tomb , For they His temple desecrate .

		For them He deals no easy doom . ''

		The convent bells are tolling For Sister Anne in
Heaven	LOCATION	; Though death is Life consoling To them who are forgiven , '' No soul has been set free by death , Though the bells are tolling slow ; Only her body lacks its breath , Her soul died long ago . ''

		Another volume gives us this : '' I would not be a dogmatist , Banging a heavy , hairy fist To crack the pint-pots on the table .

		But I would dream as I am able And noose God 's wonders in a twist Of quaintest thoughts and rippled rhyme ; By happy turns of fortunate phrase Would capture Faith , and teach stern Time To mend his ways . ''

		Thus discourses Mr.
William Rose Bene	PERSON	* t , in `` Mer - chants from Cathay . ''

		He is certainly a master of `` quaintest thought and rippled rhyme , '' although the `` happy turns of fortunate phrase '' seem to elude him .

		Gifted with an opulent imagination , and bearing a staggering load of the stuff of poetry on his shoulders , he makes us a little too conscious of the burden , and does not quite succeed in so ordering his expression as to escape turgidity .

		Now 68 THE DIAL -LSB- Jau .

		16 and then he achieves restraint and clean-cut form , as in the sonnet on `` The Guests of Phineus '' : '' Man hungers long .

		Into his cup is poured Wine of pearled brilliance or of flaming dyes From gold and silvern ewers of the skies The sun and moon .

		And on his banquet-board Rich lands of romance , glamorous seas , afford His vision viands .

		Yet with upturned eyes Like to poor Phineus , he still descries The shadows overhead , the birds abhorred . ''

		Ye dark enigmas of this universe , Cloud not my feast !

		God , give me thoughts to face And rend despair , as did the winged twain Who soared above the baffled guests of
Thrace	LOCATION	And hurled the harpies of Jove 's ancient curse To whirlwind ruin o'er the Ionian main ! ''

		Mr.
Bendt	PERSON	is fond of classical themes , but he usually handles them in the wildest romantic manner .

		The realms of phantasy are his province , and he delights in the imaginings of
Baron Munchausen	PERSON	and Sir .

		John
Mandeville	LOCATION	.

		It is not every poet who would be daring enough to write a chanty in Kiplingese for the Argonauts to sing as they plied the oar : '' Lemnos lies behind us And ladies of good grace , Home , bring home the oars again and lift the coasts of
Thrace	LOCATION	!

		Nor yet the Clashing Islands find , Nor stark Promethean highlands find , But here , of far or nigh lands , find Adventure 's very place Adventure 's splendid , terrible , and dear and dafting face ! ''

		Then ,
Orpheus	LOCATION	, strike harp for us !

		Oh ,
Talking Head	ORGANIZATION	, speak true for us !

		Lynceus , look you sharp for us !

		And ,
Tiphys	LOCATION	, steer her through for us !

		May Colchis curse the dawn o ' day when first she thundered free And our golden captain ,
Jason	PERSON	, in glory put to sea . ''

		Ragged and swinging measures are Mr. BeneYs favorites , and they force his volume into a special format for their accommodation .

		But even the widened page is not wide enough , and a small type has to he used which is a serious obstacle to pleas - urable reading .

		This is the opening of the titular poem : '' Their heels slapped their bumping mules ; their fat chaps glowed .

		Glory unto
Mary	PERSON	, each seemed to wear a crown !

		Like sunset their robes were on the wide , white road : So we saw these mad merchants come dusting into town ! ''

		Two paunchy beasts they rode on and two they drove before .

		May the Saints all help us , the tiger-stripes they had !

		And the panniers upon them swelled full of stuffs and ore !

		The square buzzed and jostled at a sight so mad . ''

		They bawled in their beards , and their turbans they wried .

		They stopped by the stalls with curvetting and clatter .

		As bronze as the bracken their necks and faces dyed And a stave they set singing to tell us of the matter .

		u For your silks to Sugarmago !

		For your dyes , to
Isfahan	LOCATION	!

		Weird fruits from the Isle o ' Lamaree !

		But for magic merchandise For treasure-trove and spice , Here 's a catch and a carol to the great , grand Chan , The King of all the Kings across the sea .

		Here 's a catch and a carol to the great , grand Chan ; For we won through the deserts to his sunset barbican ; And the mountains of the palace no
Titan	ORGANIZATION	's reach may span Where he wields his seignorie !

		This is quite in the spirit of the rollicking ballads of Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, but just misses the magic of `` Forty Singing Seamen , '' for example .

		Many of Mr.
BeneYs	PERSON	poems are marred by infelicitous words and halting rhythms , but sometimes he achieves something approaching perfection of form .

		There is probably no finer poem in the volume than `` The Rival Celestial '' : '' God , wilt Thou never leave my love alone ?

		Thou comest when she first draws breath in sleep , Thy cloak blue night , glittering with stars of gold .

		Thou standest in her doorway to intone The promise of Thy troth that she must keep , The wonders of Thy heaven she shall behold . ''

		Her little room is filled with blinding light , And past the darkness of her window-pane The faces of glad angels closely press , Gesturing for her to join their host
this night	TIME	, Mount with their cavalcade for Thy domain !

		Then darkness .

		... But Thy work is done no less . ''

		For she hath looked on Thee , and when on me Her blue eyes turn by day , they pass me by .

		All offerings ev 'n my heart slip from her hands .

		She moves in dreams of utter bliss to be , Longs for what not of earth may satisfy .

		My heart breaks as I clutch love 's breaking strands . ''

		I clutch they part to the wide winds are blown , And she stands gazing on a cloud , a star , Blind to earth 's heart of love where heaven lies furled .

		God , wilt Thou never leave my love alone ?

		Thou hast all powers , dominions , worlds that are ; And she is all my world is all my world ! ''

		From '' Wood Dreams , '' the opening poem in Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's `` Minions of the Moon , '' we quote the first two stanzas and the last : '' About the time when bluebells swing Their elfin belfries for the bee , And in the fragrant
House of Spring Wild Music	ORGANIZATION	moves ; and Fantasy Sits weaving webs of witchery : And Beauty 's self in silence leans Above the brook and through her hair Beholds her face reflected there , And wonders what the vision means About the time when bluebells swing . ''

		I found a path of glooms and gleams , A way that Childhood oft has gone , That leads into the
Wood of Dreams	ORGANIZATION	, Where , as of old , dwell Fay and Faun , And Faerie dances until dawn ; And
Elfland	PERSON	calls from her blue cave , Or , starbright , on her snow-white steed , Rides blowing on a silver reed That Magic follows like a slave I found a path of glooms and gleams . ''

		For what we dream is never lost , Dreams mold the soul within the clay , The rapture and the pentecost Of beauty shape our lives some way : They are the beam , the guiding ray , That Nature dowers us with at birth , And , like the light upon the crown Of some dark hill , that towers down , Point us to Heaven , not to
Earth	LOCATION	, Above the world where dreams are lost . ''

		1914 -RSB- 69 The '' way that childhood oft has gone '' is the way into the magical realm of fairyland , and here we dwell with Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	in a world of delicate fancies and fantastic imaginings which is made almost a real world by the poet 's power of minute observation .

		He knows flowers and birds and trees with a loving intimacy that the professional naturalist may well envy him , and he enshrines and spiritualizes them in song so exquisite as to class him with
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		The volume is filled with joyous beauty from cover to cover , and it is with regret for the completion of the offering that we come to the Epilogue : `` There is a world Life dreams of , long since lost : Invisible save only to the heart ; That spreads its cloudy islands , without chart , Above the
Earth	LOCATION	, ` mid oceans none has crossed : Far Fairylands , that have become a part Of mortal longings ; that , through difficult art , Man strives to realize to the uttermost . ''

		Could we attain that Land of Faerie Here in the flesh , what starry certitudes Of loveliness were ours !

		what mastery Of beauty and the dream that still eludes !

		What clearer vision !

		Ours were than the key To Mystery , that Nature jealously Locks in her heart of hearts among the woods . ''

		Other poets may voice the spiritual issues of our national life with richer expression and greater au - thority , but none of them can surpass Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	as an interpreter of the beauty that lies at the heart of natural things .

		`` The Theban Eagle , and Other Poems '' is by Mr.
Chester Allyn Reed	PERSON	.

		The titular piece calls Pindar a
Philistine	LOCATION	, and reproaches him because he did not write as a sentimentalist .

		A poem on u
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	'' describes the sea-conquests of the Portuguese : '' Until the day when
Diaz	PERSON	in the cold Passed the great
Cape	LOCATION	, and , lo , the way was free .

		Then at a touch the eastern kingdoms old Sprang from their long unbroken mystery And the far Indian Ocean was aflame With splendor of the new invading name , '' and then goes on to describe the wonderful voyage which proved to the most skeptical the sphericity of the earth .

		Of his verses `` Off Viareggio '' a tribute to Shelley the author says : '' These are for those who love him , who have felt His presence deep within their fondest thought As when across a desert 's burning belt The song of birds is brought . ''

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	's verses are thoughtful , neat in form , but not exactly inspired , revealing the poetic sense rather than the poetic faculty .


Paul Mariett	PERSON	, a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduate who died a year or more ago of a malignant tumor , at the age of twenty-four , was a true poet in the making , as the small posthumous volume of his work attests .

		Reading what the two friends who have edited this volume say of him , we are reminded again and again of
Moody	ORGANIZATION	, who was cut off , his renown unful - filled , by a similar stroke of fate . ''

		For all the con - ventional attitudinizing of the poet over sweetness and light he had a bitter scorn ; he could hate with zest ; he believed that hate was a good robust virtue .

		To all kinds of softness
Paul	PERSON	was a hard bed indeed , and to muffled personalities and finicky souls he was a cleansing gale . ''

		Thus one of the two friends ; the other has this to say : '' He endeavored to extract the intrinsic from the accidental in love and beauty , in life and death .

		With all his joyous virility there runs through his work , almost from the beginning , an impending melancholy , that is neither the immature cheerlessness of skeptical youth nor the unrealizable unreality of a dreamer , but some - thing unaccountably sinister , and premonitory , a quality that pervades his most powerful and poignant lyrics , flashing out finally , nakedly mystical , in the poem , ' The Grateful Dead . ' ''

		We may as well transcribe this poem as another : '' The grateful dead , they say lie snug and close Under the smooth , soft sloping of the grass .

		Grateful indeed because above them pass No other steps than those of wind or bird No other sound is heard . ''

		For without eyes we see , and earless hear ; Sweeter is this than nights of restless mood , Sweeter than nights of blank infinitude , Sweeter than ghostly pageants of a dream , Half-caught , of things that seem . ''

		Another life have we than those who live , Another death have we than those who die .

		Mortal and ghost and angel pass us by - Mortal and ghost and angel have one breath Die , would ye learn of death . ''

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Beasts of the past .

		The portrayal of the main pattern in the web of life as it has been woven in the
Western	LOCATION	world by the forces of evolution in past geologic ages is the main purpose of Professor
W. B. Scott	PERSON	's `` History of Land Mammals in the
Western Hemisphere	LOCATION	-LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		It is , however , with the evolution only of the highest types of animal life , the mammals , that the author deals , tracing their increasing diversifi - cation and modification from the small and primi - tive types of the
Paleocene Period of Tertiary Epoch	ORGANIZATION	through the remarkable faunas of the
Upper Tertiary	ORGANIZATION	to the much reduced mammalian fauna of to-day .

		The organization of scientific exploration by
the State	ORGANIZATION	and its advancement by private endow - ments , the unifying influence of common language , and of educational and scientific organization , and of the single political control of the greater part of a continent , have made possible in this country , as in no where else in the world , the disclosing of the secrets of the past life of a continent and thanks to the able work of an enthusiastic group of
Latin	LOCATION	- American palaeontologists of
Argentina	LOCATION	of a hemisphere .

		No small element in the success of this project has been the discovery in
America	LOCATION	of 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	remarkable beds of fossils in the
Great Plains of Nebraska	LOCATION	and
Wyoming	LOCATION	, in the John Day region of
Oregon	LOCATION	, and in that unique death trap of the ages , the tar-pits of
Rancho La Brea	ORGANIZATION	, from which the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	has recently exhumed a most complete and superbly preserved representa - tion of the fauna of Pleistocene times .

		The author thus has at his disposal an exceptionally complete record of the past .

		His book is written for the general reader , and for the biologist who is not versed in palaeontological lore .

		The relations of the successive phases of life to geological time and to environmental conditions are in evidence through - out , and the details of teeth and skeletal structure upon which the palaeontologist constructs his con - ception of the ancient beast , of which he may pos - sess but a fragment , are correlated with those of the better known mammals of to-day .

		Indeed , both for biologist and for lay reader , one of the most instructive features of the work is the remarkable series of reconstructions , against typical environ - mental backgrounds , of these ancient mammals .

		A choice series of original photographs of living mammals , for purposes of comparison , heightens the value of these reconstructions .

		Professor
Scott	PERSON	and the artist , Mr.
Horsfall	PERSON	, have succeeded admir - ably in making these dry bones live again .

		How - ever large the element of conjecture in these recon - structed portraits , they are both interesting and instructive .

		The closing chapter , upon the modes of mammalian evolution , is brief , cautious , and tenta - tive , the author stating the various conceptions of the factors and their modes of operating .

		He lends some support to the view that the change from one species to the next in a line of descent was by small though abrupt mutations rather than by a series of gradual transitions .

		The chapter upon the primates perforce excludes the evolution of the human type , since there is as yet no critical evidence that primitive man originated in this hemisphere .

		Abundant and excellent illustrations , logical development of the subject , clear-cut and critical presentation of the data , and breadth of view characterize this standard work of reference on American mammalian palaeontology .

		A new textbook of American literature .

		Mr - iam
J. Long	ORGANIZATION	's volume on `` American Literature '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is to be comme nded for its full treatment of the colonial and Revolutionary times , its bibliographical material and suggestions for study , and in most cases for its biographical sketches of authors .

		Its usefulness as a text for secondary schools may be impaired by the fact that it seems to be the work of an iconoclast with occasional enthusiasms and a theory .

		The theory may be inferred from this statement : '' There are no
Mason	PERSON	- and-Dixon lines , no political or geographical divis - ions in the national consciousness .


Bradford	PERSON	and
Byrd	PERSON	,
Cooper	PERSON	and
Simms	PERSON	,
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Lanier	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Bret Harte	PERSON	are here studied side by side in their respective periods , not as repre - sentative of North or South or East or West , but as so many different reflections of the same life and the same spirit . ''

		What `` national consciousness ''
Bradford	PERSON	and
Byrd	PERSON	expressed the author does not say ; and the critic who refuses to see the peculiarly
New England	LOCATION	characteristics in
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, or the peculiarly Southern elements in
Simms	PERSON	not only ignores much that is necessary to the understanding of individual authors , but fails to trace the impres - sive unification of American literature during the years since the War .

		On the whole , however , the theory does less harm than it threatens in the preface .

		More striking are numerous interpreta - tions and critical judgments that challenge discus - sion .

		Only a few may be cited .

		That
Lowell	PERSON	is the '' only successor '' of Cotton Mather -LRB- p. 349 -RRB- , and that
Hawthorne	PERSON	seems '' more akin to
Wigglesworth	PERSON	than to any other writer '' -LRB- p. 405 -RRB- , may be defen - sible propositions , but are likely to be perplexing or misleading to students who have not yet acquired a sense of relative values .

		So the remarks that the conception of nature in '' Thanatopsis '' `` seems to us hardly more poetic than that of the Alaskan Indians , who say that the earth is a huge animal , vegetation is its fur , and men and animals are para - sites on its back -LRB- p. 202 -RRB- ; that
Poe	PERSON	's verse is `` beautiful but apparently meaningless , '' and
Poe	PERSON	's theory is `` to the mature mind ... an abnormal , a diseased conception of poetry '' -LRB- p. 239 -RRB- ; that in ''
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	'' '' the hero is essentially a liar , one who makes a virtue of falsehood ; and his adven - tures are of a kind to make the thoughtless laugh and the judicious grieve '' -LRB- p. 466 -RRB- ; that Uncle Remus is '' in some respects the most natural and lovable character that has ever appeared in Amer - ican fiction '' -LRB- p. 468 -RRB- , these and many similar opinions will arouse interesting discussions among those competent to discuss .

		In view , however , of the tendency of pupils to accept textbook state - ments without question , the presence of so many de - batable utterances in a book for secondary schools may be a disadvantage .

		Even more harmful than these opinions are apparent mis-statements of inter - pretation and content , e. g. , the remark -LRB- p. 237 -RRB- that in '' The Fall of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Usher '' Poe '' makes use of a favorite theory , or hallucination , that the will survives for a time in the body of a person after death . ''

		The case against In '' Government Ownership of Rail - state ownership ways '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a large and im - of our railroads .

		portan t question of public policy is discussed by Mr.
Samuel 0	PERSON	.


Dunn	PERSON	, editor of `` The Railway Age Gazette '' and already well known as the author of a book entitled `` The American Transportation Question . ''

		Mr.
Dunn	PERSON	ventures the opinion that '' no more important question confronts the people of the
United States	LOCATION	than the question of what policy they shall pursue in the future in dealing with the railroads of the country . ''

		He examines in a seemingly fair and judicial spirit the various arguments for and against government ownership of railroads , and reviews the experience
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 71 of other countries in which the railroads are owned and operated by the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		His conclusions are dis - tinctly adverse to the policy of government owner - ship in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He reviews the more flagrant abuses that have attended the system of private ownership in the
United States	LOCATION	, and dwells upon the attempt to remove these abuses through the policy of public regulation .

		The argument for government ownership drawn from the experience of other countries is , he thinks , by no means conclu - sive , because the conditions in countries like
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	where government ownership has been most successful are entirely different from conditions in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He asserts that the railways of the
United States	LOCATION	are , considering all things , as economically managed as any in the world ; under private ownership their development has gone for - ward at a rate which , until recent years , has not been equalled in any other country ; the quality of the freight and passenger service is in most respects equal or superior to that of any other country , although it is admitted that the accident record is rather appalling ; passenger rates in
America	LOCATION	are probably no higher than in most countries for simi - lar services ; the average freight rate per ton mile is the lowest in the world ; the condition of the labor employed on American railways is relatively as good as that of any other country ; and the experience of other countries , where the railways are owned by the
State	ORGANIZATION	, would seem to indicate that government management in this country would tend to corrupt rather than to purify politics .

		Therefore the better alternative , according to Mr.
Dunn	PERSON	, is to leave the ownership and management of railways in private hands , and at the same time to develop and perfect the present system of public regulation .

		The founder of Miss Estelle w - Stead 's filial tribute `` The Review to the memory of the late W. T. of Reviws . ''

		g tea -LRB- j j s appropriately entitled , '' My Father , '' and is further described by the fitting sub - title , '' Personal and Spiritual Reminiscences . ''

		The striking qualities of the man , and his activities in building what he believed to be a '' bridge '' between this world and that of discarnate spirits , are vividly and lovingly presented .

		Also the notable work he did as a great journalistic force for social righteous - ness is reviewed in such a manner as to command our willing admiration and to intensify our regret that so enlightened and energetic a reformer should have been removed by so untimely and tragic a fate from the scene of his beneficent labors .

		His birth in
1849	DATE	in the little manse at
Embleton	LOCATION	, his early life in that north country , his editorship of `` The Northern Echo '' at twenty - two , followed by that of '' The Pall Mall Gazette '' in
1884	DATE	, and the found - ing of '' The Review of Reviews '' in
1890	DATE	, with a necessarily incomplete account of the many good causes championed by him , all enlivened by frequent extracts from Mr.
Stead	PERSON	's personal reminiscences and other writings , are well and interestingly set forth in the book 's thirty brief chapters .

		Of course the once rather famous '' Julia '' and her '' bureau '' and her alleged '' communications '' receive due men - tion , as also sundry other matters that appeal to a love of the marvellous .

		But perhaps not the least extraordinary incident recorded in the book is the following in reference to the founding of the maga - zine with which Mr.
Stead	PERSON	's name is inseparably associated .

		A memorandum from his own pen reads as follows : '' The Pope , if up to date , ought to publish the
Review of Reviews	ORGANIZATION	, which is an attempt to render accessible to all the best thoughts to be found in the periodical literature of the world .

		Before founding the Review I went to
Rome	LOCATION	to see what chance there was of the Pope undertaking the task .

		Finding there was none , I did it myself . ''

		Many portraits and other illustrations add to the book 's attractiveness .

		, , .

		, TT - r A u u j English history .

		His father had been an unrelenting opponent of the Stuarts and was one of the chief members of the Whig '' organization '' in the days of
William III.	PERSON	, and young Lord
Philip	PERSON	should have inherited a large measure of political influence along with titles and wealth ; but he threw away his future while still a youth , and took up the cause of the
Stuart Pretender	PERSON	.

		This act in time led to outlawry , deep poverty , and finally to death in a Franciscan monastery .

		At the time of his death he was only in his thirty-third year ; but he had made a profound , though not entirely favorable , impression on the men of his time both in
England	LOCATION	and on the Continent .

		Alexander Pope characterized him as `` the scorn and wonder of our days '' ; he appears as Lorenzo in Young 's '' Night Thoughts , '' and as Love - lace in
Richardson	PERSON	's ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	'' ;
Hogarth	PERSON	introduced him into one of his paintings .

		It is this career that Mr.
Lewis Melville	PERSON	has traced in his latest work , `` The Life and .

		Writings of
Philip	LOCATION	, Duke of Wharton '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		We may agree with the author that `` a character more interesting ... does not often fall to the lot of a biographer '' ; but the reviewer would like to express a doubt as to whether it is really worth while to produce a detailed study of a life that was a failure in every way and that left no impress on the history of the time .

		The author , however , has done his work well ; he devotes most of his space to
Wharton	LOCATION	's public career , but does not neglect the private life of his subject .

		No attempt is made to gloss over the moral and financial ex - travagance of the man , though Mr.
Melville	PERSON	does think that the worst thing about the '' Hell - fire Club , '' of which
Wharton	PERSON	was president , was its name .

		The permanent value of the work will be found chiefly in the documents that the author has collected , the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's efforts at poetry , some of his letters and speeches , and various other documents that belong to his personal history or to that of the
Wharton	PERSON	family .

		The volume also contains seventeen excel - lent illustrations , chiefly portraits of the men who made history during the early eighteenth century .

		72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	Miscellanies
Ladv Ritchie	PERSON	has a store of notable bv
Thackeray	PERSON	's memories to draw upon whenever she daughter .

		chooses to put pen to paper for the delectation of her readers , and it is largely with such memories that her new volume of collected papers , '' From the Porch '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , entertainingly deals .

		First comes '' A Discourse on Modern Sibyls '' namely ,
George Eliot	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	,
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, and Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	all of whom the writer knew and admired in their time ; then a reminiscent fragment on
Charles Dickens	PERSON	, after which follows another retrospective piece , `` A Dream of
Kensing	PERSON	- ton Gardens '' ; next we have a half-dozen `` mono - graphs , '' on
Sainte Jeanne of Chantal	ORGANIZATION	,
Anna Seward	PERSON	, known as `` the Swan of Lichfield , '' Mrs.
John Taylor	PERSON	of
Norwich	LOCATION	, the art of being a grand - parent , the painter
Morland	LOCATION	at
Freshwater Bay	LOCATION	, and another painter , of a later generation ,
Alfred Stevens	PERSON	.

		Finally , a smaller sheaf of papers is offered , having to do with the beginnings of `` The Cornhill Maga - zine , '' and sundry other matters more personal to the writer .

		Where Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	does not write from her own memories she usually has unpublished letters or other special sources of information to give fresh - ness and vitality to her narrative .

		Even the now somewhat mythical '' Swan of Lichfield '' is made to live again in the packet of letters quoted from by Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	.

		We see her writing to a corre - spondent -LRB- from whom the letter , with others , passed to
Thackeray	PERSON	's daughter -RRB- '' with the vilest pen that ever scored , '' and still persisting , `` though night creeps on apace , and the drowsie hour steals upon me .

		I should have written before to express my gratitude , but that I had promised to work Mr.
Charles Buckeridge	PERSON	a waistcoat by the next As - sembly . ''

		A reference to '' a well-known critic , an American lady , Miss Fanny Repplier , '' still goes un - corrected in the re-edited form of the essay .

		A por - trait of the writer appears as frontispiece , and a view of '' the porch '' later in the volume .

		called the No .

		The feeling for the transitoriness of life runs like a leitmotiv through the old Japanese lyrical dramas `` The dew remains until the wind doth blow !

		The dew remains until the wind doth blow !

		My own life fleeting 1 as a drop of dew , What will become of me as time doth pass ^ ? ''

		Plots and characters are alike developed just far enough to bring out through them the Buddhistic belief that `` life is a dome of many-colored glass '' from the agonizing delusions of which it is only possible to escape by regarding all actual facts and experiences as inessential and indeed unreal : ' * If only thou wouldst once but cast away The clouds of thy delusions , thou wouldst be Freed from thy many sins and from all ills . ''

		Such at least is the impression left by
Miss M. C. Stopes	PERSON	's exquisite translations of the No , and her comments on this fast-fading relic of mediaeval Jap - anese feudalism -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		All the sensitiveness to design , the delicacy of rhythm and color , that we associate with Japanese paintings and prints are to be found in these texts ; with , in the actual repre - sentations themselves , as the editor tells us , the addi - tional beauties of an elaborate conventional acting and posture and a peculiar chanting by protagonists and chorus , all emphasizing aesthetically the religi - ous character of the drama .

		The effect is not unlike what one imagines the ancient religious drama of the Greeks to have been ; there is the same brevity of plot , the same limited number of actors , all men , the same use of masks and symbolic scenery and costume .

		The No suggests a further classical com - parison through the myth of its origin in a sacred dance .

		The best of the Greek priests and philoso - phers , moreover , would have taken pleasure in recognizing the mystic idea shadowed forth in this portrayal of life ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	would surely have under - stood its emphasis on Eternal Being and its subordi - nation of the passing accidentals of life to its essence .

		No one to-day who is at all interested either in phil - osophy or drama or Japanese civilization can afford to miss this illuminating and sympathetic treatment of a subject so difficult for westerners to learn about and to understand .

		The beautiful illustrations from color-prints add great value to the text .

		Speeches of c H ect i n of addresses by Lord a British
Milner	PERSON	published under the title imperialist .

		The N at i on an -LRB- j t h e Empire '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- comprises seventy-eight speeches , deliv - ered since the eve of his departure for
South Africa	LOCATION	in
1897	DATE	, and of these twenty-two were made in the latter country during his historic service as High Commissioner .

		Since his return in
1905	DATE	his interest in the concerns of
South Africa	LOCATION	has been keen , and many of the other addresses deal in whole or in part with problems of the new
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Second in number are the speeches devoted to
Imperial Unity	ORGANIZATION	, and on this subject his ideas are well presented in six addresses given in
Canada	LOCATION	in
1908	DATE	.

		Other sub - jects dealt with are tariff reform , national service , and social progress .

		Lord
Milner	PERSON	to-day stands as a leader of the British Imperialists .

		And yet he realizes the unfortunate connotation of the term . ''

		When we , who call ourselves Imperialists , talk of the British Empire , we think of a group of states , independent of one another in their local affairs , but bound together for the defence of their common interests , and the development of a common civili - zation , and so bound , not in an alliance , for alli - ances can be made and unmade , and are never more than nominally lasting , but in a permanent organic union .

		Of such a union , we fully admit , the domin - ions of our sovereign , as they exist to-day , are only the raw material .

		Our ideal is still distant , but we are firmly convinced that it is not visionary nor unattainable . ''

		And in another place this ideal is described as `` that of a great and continuous national life , shared by us with our kinsmen , who have built up new communities in distant parts of the earth , 1914J THE DIAL 73 enabling them and us together to uphold our tradi - tional principles of freedom , order and justice , and to discharge with ever-increasing efficiency our duty as guardians of the more backward races who have come under our sway . ''

		Toward the attainment of this ideal , Lord
Milner	PERSON	's public addresses have doubtless done much , and the present collection will be welcomed by his fellow-workers throughout the Empire ... , It is gratifying to note that
Jane	PERSON	A summary of i 11 jane
Austen	PERSON	's
Austen	PERSON	has at last been accorded a life and work .

		p i ace j n tne excellent `` English Men of Letters '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .


George Eliot	PERSON	,
Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	, and
Fanny Burney	PERSON	were already represented in the series ; the volume on
Jane Austen	PERSON	is just published ; and , happily , one on Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	is announced as `` in press . ''

		The author of the work now in hand , Mr.
Francis Warre Cor	PERSON	- nish , Vice Provost of
Eton College	ORGANIZATION	, has , in his fifty-four pages of condensed biography , closely fol - lowed Messrs.
Austen-Leigh	PERSON	's recent book , ``
Jane Austen	PERSON	: Her Life and Letters . ''

		* He finds but meagre data for a biography of the novelist ; and is able to add , in fact , nothing to the material already provided .

		The novels of
Jane Austen	PERSON	are summa - rized rather fully in the succeeding chapters of the book ; the critical comment is comparatively slight .

		The author is sympathetic with his subject , and conventional in his estimate .

		His closing chapter gives a summary of the novelist 's attributes .

		He considers her style not remarkably distinguished , and her plots neither original nor striking .

		`` She has little idealism , little romance , tenderness , poetry , or religion ... and yet she stands by the side of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, unsurpassed among writers of prose and poetry , within the limits which she imposed on herself , for clear and sympathetic vision of human character . ''

		What might be called a sequel to or rural contL amplification of her '' Mountain Play - mates '' is offered to her readers by Mrs.
John Albee	PERSON	-LRB-
Helen R. Albee	PERSON	-RRB- in her latest vol - ume , '' A Kingdom of Two '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Described on the title-page as `` a true romance of country life , '' it shows us the wholesome , simple pleasures of
New England	LOCATION	country life in a succession of essays in which the embroidery of imagination and fancy is deftly added to the central pattern of homely real - ism and somewhat stern actuality .

		For life is no continuous holiday on the rock-ribbed hillsides of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	where -LRB- in the little town of Pe - quaket -RRB- the Albees have their secluded home .

		Such chapter-headings as `` The Cow , '' `` A
May Morning	DATE	, '' '' An Old House Site , '' '' A Garden Tragedy , '' and `` The Magic of Daily Life '' will indicate the nature of the book 's contents .

		The critical feader will note , on an early page , Mrs.
Albee	PERSON	's rather unfortunate attempt to form from the familiar ipse dixit a Latin motto which shall mean , '' She Now Speaks . '' ''

		Ipsa Nunc Diftet '' is the result of her efforts , with `` dicet '' * See THE DIAL ,
Oct. 16 , 1913	DATE	.

		twice repeated to make plain that it is no mere misprint .

		Beautiful rural scenes , reproduced from photographs , illustrate the book .

		Its tone and style will not disappoint those who have already found pleasure in Mrs.
Albee	PERSON	's writings .

		Captain
Andrew W. Nelson	PERSON	, who has Yarns of a followed the sea from boyhood , and Swedish sailor ... .

		j has kept a diary of his adventures - from the beginning , turns author in his later years and proposes to chronicle his life on the ocean wave y '' one cruise at a time , '' for the benefit of those who find relish in the salty savor of this kind of liter - ature and they are surely not few in number .

		`` Yankee Swanson '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is th initial number of the series , and takes its name from the first mate of the `` Forsette , '' a Swedish vessel on which the author made his first acquaintance with seafaring at the age of thirteen , and with which he remained for ten months of momentous import to him and full of incidents not uninteresting to others .

		Perhaps one might prefer a little less minuteness of unimportant detail .

		Continuing his autobiographic narrative on the present plan ,
Captain Nelson	ORGANIZATION	will give to the world a chronicle more voluminous than the history of '' Jean-Christophe . ''

		In his story one can not see the ocean for the ripples .

		A portrait of the author appears as frontispiece , and other illus - trations are provided .

		We wonder why the Captain did not retain his good Swedish name of
Nilsson	PERSON	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
Allen C. Thomas	PERSON	adds a new '' History of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to the long list of admirable manuals that compete for the favor of instructors in secondary schools .

		These books , with all the modern improve - ments , make us wonder that we ever put up with the miserable texts thatalone were available a generation ago .

		A valuable feature of this work is the appendix giving a condensed history of the Continent down to
1648	DATE	.

		Hazlitt is a critic who is too little read in these days , and yet no student of English literature can afford to neglect him .

		It is for the use of such students that Dr.
Jacob Zeitlin	PERSON	has compiled the volume which he calls ''
Hazlitt	PERSON	on English Literature , '' now published at the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selections form - a running commentary on our literature all the way from the Elizabethans to
Byron	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	.

		The intro - ductory essay on
Hazlitt	PERSON	is an admirable piece of criti - cism , and the notes are ample and informing .

		In the series of '' Riverside Press Editions '' Messrs.
Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	have now included a re print of '' The Diamond Necklace , '' one of the most brilliant and vivid of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's historical essays , and one that has not heretofore appeared in separate form .

		The volume is a small octavo , printed on French hand - made paper , and decorated with several exquisite vignettes in the
18th century	DATE	French manner .

		Another late addition to the same series is a quarto reprint of
Washington	LOCATION	's
Farewell Address	ORGANIZATION	, printed on French hand-made paper , the external setting being admirably attuned to the impressive dignity of the text .

		The appearance of these new volumes tempts us to repeat 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	what we have more than once said in the past , that taken as a whole this series of '' Riverside Press Edi - tions '' constitutes the most interesting and praiseworthy achievement in the field of fine book-making that this country has to show .

		Several recent additions to the admirable `` Oxford Editions '' include
William Morris	PERSON	's poems and prose tales published previously to 1870 ;
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	's poems and translations , 1850-1870 , including `` Hand and Soul '' and `` The New Life '' ;
Blake	PERSON	's poetical works , with some matter hitherto unpublished , the whole laboriously edited from original sources by Mr.
John Sampson	PERSON	; and '' A Century of Parody and Imitation , '' an excellent anthology compiled by Messrs.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	and
R. M. Leonard	PERSON	.

		Painstakingly edited , faultlessly printed , and substantially bound , the books in this series excel any others that we know of , at anything like the same price .

		`` English Prose '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , edited by Drs.
F. W. Roe and G. R. Elliott	PERSON	, is a volume '' designed primarily for the discussion and practice in college classes of the art of composition . ''

		Its contents are representative examples of the best English prose writing , arranged in nine related groups .

		Some of the groups are '' The Personal Life , '' `` Public Affairs , '' `` Education , '' and `` Literature and Art . ''

		Each group comprises several longish examples , the first-named giving us Emerson on '' Self-Reliance , '' Lamb 's '' Old
China	LOCATION	, '' an extract from
Ruskin	PERSON	's '' Prseterita , '' and one from Mill 's ''
Autobi	PERSON	- ography . ''

		The book provides the best of reading , quite aside from its purpose for the technical instruction of students .

		During the
last two decades	DATE	of the nineteenth cen - tury , Mr.
Thorn	PERSON	as
Hardy	ORGANIZATION	published in various periodicals a dozen '' minor novels '' which have grown unfamiliar to the public because not included in the standard sets of his writings .

		These are now collected by the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	in a volume entitled `` A Changed Man , The Waiting
Supper	DATE	, and Other Tales . ''

		The last of the twelve , '' The Romantic Adventures of a Milkmaid , '' is perhaps better known than the others to present-day readers .

		It is also much the longest .

		Now that Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	remains in unquestioned solitary preeminence among living English writers , it is particularly desirable that his more fugitive work should be made easily accessible , and for that reason , and others , we give this volume a cordial welcome .

		The twelfth volume in the '' Art of Life '' series -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- is entitled '' The Use of Leisure , '' and con - siders its theme under a threefold division , '' Wanted Leisure , '' `` The Right Use of Leisure , '' and '' Work , the Creator . ''

		After a spirited invective against drudgery and the industrial conditions that have made drudgery an apparent necessity for most of the world , the writer , Mr.
Temple Scott	PERSON	, points the way to the right use of our free time , telling us that there are two essentials to such right use , the getting of health and keeping it , and the getting of a mind and using it .

		The final section deals with that fruitful and enjoyable activity which is work in its best sense , as distinguished from soulless drudgery .

		Incidentally , the office of the poet is extolled , and the increasing present need of his services is pointed out .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's pages are aglow with fervor , and one can not but wish his book might usher in a millennium of rightly used leisure .

		It will at least plant a fertile seed here and there in soil pre - pared for its reception .

		There is no finer work being done for civiliza - tion than that undertaken by the distinguished individuals and the organized agencies for the promotion of a better understanding between the more advanced peoples of the world .

		The cultivation of international good feeling between the great powers may in time provide a solvent medium through whose influence armaments shall crumble and jealous prejudices disappear .

		The present wasting of the resources of the world upon navies and huge standing armies is the greatest economic and ethical scandal of the age ; it makes a mockery of Christianity , sets unnecessary obstacles in the path of progress , and forces philosophers to throw up their hands , exclaiming in despair , `` A mad world , my mas - ters ! ''

		The madness seems to be growing rather than decreasing , to the superficial view , and there is no feature of the entire situation more disheartening than the deliberate repudiation by our own country of the old-time ideals which gave Americans of the nineteenth century good reason to be prouder of their birthright than the citizens of any other country on earth .

		It is not surprising that the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	should be reluctant to beat their swords into plowshares , for their swords have largely made them what they are ; but it is amazing beyond words that we , having known and practised the better way for so long , should have taken up with their bad example , and the '' rags and shards regilded '' which are the wretched sym - bols of a past based upon force rather than upon the amity which has its sure foundations in mutual respect and sympathetic understand - ing .

		The true missionaries of civilization are the men who go forth into other lands than their own to invite and express good will and to soften the asperities which selfish diplomacy and irresponsible journalism and the spirit of blatant chauvinism so wantonly engender in international relations .

		Such men as Lord
Haldane	PERSON	,
Viscount Bryce	PERSON	,
Baron	PERSON	d'Estournelles de Constant , the recipients -LRB- with one exception -RRB- of the Nobel peace prize , and the exchange professors on the various foundations established between this country and
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Denmark	LOCATION	, should do much to inaugurate the dawn of a new era in which the 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	armed hostility of civilized peoples should be - come monstrous and unthinkable .

		Such relations of friendliness and mutual comprehension have already become firmly grounded between this country and the mother that gave it birth , and have existed for over a century between us and the power that allied itself with our precarious fortunes in the dark
winter	DATE	of
Valley Forge	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was
France	LOCATION	that quickened our budding national life with the ideals of democracy long before she learned how to apply to her own case the teachings of her po - litical philosophers , and it is with
France	LOCATION	that we have had friendly , and even affectionate , relations longer than with any other foreign nation .

		A recent sign of this friendship is the establishment of the
Comite France-Amerique	ORGANIZATION	.

		under whose auspices a series of addresses have been made in
Paris	LOCATION	during the past year , concerned with the historic , artistic , and social relations of the two countries , these addresses being now pub - lished -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Alcan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in a volume entitled `` Les Etats-Unis et la
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Ten writers contrib - ute to this collection , four Frenchmen and six Americans , the latter being Messrs.
J. H. Hyde	PERSON	,
Paul W. Bartlett	PERSON	,
Walter V. R. Berry	PERSON	,
J. Mark Baldwin	PERSON	,
W. Morton Fullerton	PERSON	, and
David J. Hill	PERSON	.

		These American contributions discuss the relations between the sculpture of the two coun - tries , their social life , their historical bonds , their politics , their national ideals in the broader sense , and the effects that the
Panama Canal	LOCATION	may be expected to have upon their future intercourse .

		These are all valuable studies , which both Frenchmen and Americans may read with profit , making , as they do , for a better understanding between the two nations .

		It is to the introductory paper upon `` La Pensee Americaine et la Pensee Francaise , '' contributed by
M. Ernile Boutroux	PERSON	, that we wish especially to direct attention .

		The author seeks to discover the formula of American thought as it presents itself to the philosophical observer , much as Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	, in the essay which we discussed a recent issue , has sought to determine that formula from the standpoint of the American novelist .

		It remains somewhat vague in both cases , because of the immense variety of the material which has to be synthe - sized , and
M. Boutroux	PERSON	's treatment must be described as informed and amiable rather than as searching and profound .

		The author 's con - clusions are thus summarized : '' The human ideal which she endeavors to realize is conceived by
America	LOCATION	as a synthesis , made up of all the forms of humankind that nature creates , in such manner that each of them , thus brought into universal unity , preserves its own character and its own autonomy .

		French thought , for its part , springing from the original medium which is constituted by French society , makes out of the ideal man a sort of Platonic idea , which is the outcome of neither analysis nor synthesis , but ap - pears as a kind of creation .

		The American idea of humanity is the richest possible ; the French idea has for its content human nature in its purest and loftiest guise . ''

		Restated , this dictum seems to mean that the American ideal is empirical , and the French ideal rational , which may be allowed as a state - ment of the present-day attitude , although the American ideal of the fathers had a strictly rationalistic French origin .

		In any case , the idealism of a people must be judged by the best forms that its expression assumes . ''

		Let us not be afraid to consider , in both French and American thought , the noblest manifestations , those most worthy of esteem and admiration .

		True sincerity for the individual , is to bring his life into conformity with the best that is in him , with his deepest and purest ego .

		Likewise , the true thought of a people is found in the expression of its loftiest conception of its genius and of its mission in the world .

		For what it wills , ultimately , amidst its confused efforts in all directions , is to realize all the perfection of which it is capable . ''

		This is the guiding prin - ciple of
M. Boutroux	PERSON	in his discussion , and its employment clears the air wonderfully .

		Look - ing at us more in detail , he finds in our national life great mobility , an intensely practical turn of mind , the conception of man as a creative force rather than as a puppet of his environment .

		The American is easily seduced by eccentric and fantastic theories , but it is not merely as novel - ties that he takes them up , for he aims always at making out of their elements an ever broader and more coherent philosophy of life .

		If he seems too much devoted to the pursuit of the dollar , it is because its possession means higher efficiency in the accomplishment of the real pur - poses of civilization .

		It is a favorite plaint of our humanitarian sentimentalists that our laws and institutions exalt the dollar above the man , but this is one of the emptiest of distinctions .

		To protect property is one of the most essential methods of protecting all those things of which wealth is but the means , and a nation which becomes lax in safeguarding the legitimate possessions of the individual is in danger of weakening the very foundations of character .

		Although his object is to draw a comparison , and discover what valid distinctions may be made between French and American thought ,
M. Boutroux	PERSON	is forced to admit a fundamental identity in all the essentials , although he finds
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 91 a marked difference in the orientation of thought in the two countries . ''

		On both sides , '' he says , '' the same democratic spirit , the same sense of human dignity , the same devotion to political liberty and the principle of national sovereignty , the same natural tastes , cordiality , and simplicity in distinction , the same preoccupation with fine human ideals . ''

		This is the sum total of his conclusions , a more important judgment , we should say , than that expressed in the long passage above quoted , in which the difference in the orientation of thought is stated in abstract philosophical terms .

		CAS UA L COMMENT .

		THE ANGLICITY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE -LRB- the strange word has the sanction of the
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	's editor -RRB- is menaced by various corrupt - ing influences .

		Pronunciation , idiom , vocabulary , spelling , all are in danger , and the time seems to be approaching when the language of Shakespeare and the
Bible	LOCATION	will be as strange to their infrequent readers as is that of Chaucer and
Wyclif	PERSON	to the present generation .

		An effort to postpone that evil day is put forth by the new Society for Pure En - glish , which has recently issued its first pamphlet in furtherance of its laudable purpose , formulating certain basic principles and urging a return to dia - lectic naturalness and raciness of expression .

		Words and idioms that smack of the soil whence they sprang are to be revived and cherished , while the artificialities of urban speech need to be repressed .

		Not only does the thoughtless multitude require guidance and correction in this matter , but it is probable that the educated and the careful are doing their part , often unconsciously , toward break - ing up the uniformity and purity of our English tongue .

		The arts and sciences are flooding the dictionary with new and in many instances ill - constructed terms , journalists are familiarizing us with modes of expression not always worthy of adoption , innovators in spelling are perniciously active , and the foreign languages spoken within our borders add an alien tinge to our speech .

		Mean - time , too , there is the ever-present tendency toward a divorce between the literary and the colloquial medium of communication .

		As formerly with Latin and other literary languages now dead , book-English is hardly the language of daily conversation , though the divergence is happily not yet far advanced .

		When
Canning	ORGANIZATION	wrote on
Pitt	PERSON	's monument in the Guildhall the inscription , `` He died poor , '' a pom - pous alderman objected to the simplicity of the language and wished to substitute , `` He expired in indigent circumstances '' a fitting companion - piece to Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's Latinized emendation of the pure Anglo-Saxon that once escaped him .

		It is only popular education and constant vigilance , the diffusion of good literature and the intelligent activities of such societies as the aforementioned , that can rescue our language from the various perils menacing it and hand down to posterity something that shall resemble the pure and simple speech of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's
Gettysburg	LOCATION	oration and at the same time be both the language of literature and the language of daily life .

		STOLEN READING-TIME has often been put to such good use as to justify the theft .

		Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	has told us how , commanded by his father to go to bed soon after supper , and obtaining his consent to use the
early morning	TIME	hours as he chose , he arose morn - ing after morning at one o'clock to apply himself to such studies and other pursuits as took his fancy ; and in his case it seems to have been time well stolen from sleep .

		Where there is an imperious thirst for the knowledge that books give , time will be found for reading .

		Sir
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	has a semi - autobiographical chapter on '' Learning to Read '' in his '' Bookman 's Letters , '' recently published .

		Near the beginning he says : `` I have heard very many say that they regret extremely that they have never been able to read as much as they would like .

		They never have had sufficient time .

		As a matter of fact , no one who really cared for reading was ever de - terred from it by want of time ; in fact , I make bold to say that only a small proportion of people have learned in the proper sense how to read , ... I am afraid that those persons who have learned to read in the sense that they can discriminate between what is good and bad , and that they read the best with delight and relish , are few , and this is surely a great misfortune . ''

		The plea that one has no time to read really means , nine times out of ten , and per - haps also the tenth time , that one has no real desire to read , no ravenous hunger for books .

		The writer quoted above gives some interesting reminiscences of his own reading , and it is amusing to learn that he used formerly to name as his favorite novelist , '' the Rev.
C. B. Greatrex	PERSON	, '' author of a tale entitled `` Memoranda of a Marine Officer , '' which ran through several successive volumes of ``
Hogg	PERSON	's In - structor , '' and seems to have made a lasting impres - sion on the boy
Nicoll	PERSON	.

		It was '' my favorite story , '' writes the man , `` and , to be perfectly candid , I think it is my favorite story still . ''

		MEDICATED LITERATURE , a term used by Sir
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	in discussing the writings of Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	and Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, is not so forbidding as it sounds .

		Not sterilized or disin - fected or sick-room reading is meant by the essayist , but that kind of writing that shows an intimate acquaintance with the tragedies of disease and suf - fering , and a recognition of the mysterious connec - tion between spirit and flesh .

		It may also betray unusual insight into human nature , an insight gained by years of daily encounter with the weakness and the fortitude , the pettiness and the greatness , the selfishness and the magnanimity of men and women .

		If he were writing on this subject to-day , the editor of `` The British Weekly '' would probably include 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	one other distinguished author-physician in his list , the lately deceased Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	.

		What he says of
Brown	PERSON	's and
Holmes	PERSON	's late rise to literary celeb - rity is equally true of the gifted Philadelphian , whose special study of nerve diseases gave him opportunities for studying abnormalities and eccen - tricities of human nature not offered to the general practitioner .

		A few ` sentences from the essay referred to will be of interest here .

		`` To say that Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	writes from the standpoint of a physician , that his works are medicated , is to pay him a very high compliment .

		There are few medi - cal men who can lay aside the professional man - ner in addressing the public .


John Brown	PERSON	and
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	succeeded in doing this , and yet the wisdom , the experience , and the pity of the physician appear in all they say ... For the most part they avoid technicalities , but they never forget the connection of the mind with the body , and the lessons which long nearness to suffering hu - manity teach the merciful and the humble . ''

		We recall with some amusement the ominous shake of the head with which , years ago , a certain
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia doctor assured us that his friend
Mitchell	PERSON	was hurting his reputation by trifling with literature .

		ODDITIES AND OBSTINACIES OF SCHOLARS are notorious .

		Living so much in a world of their own , men of stupendous learning and profound thought seem often to lose the faculty of responding to out - side appeals ; and thus what has at last become a psychological impossibility to them is regarded by onlookers as deliberate wilf ulness .

		It is told of the late
Henry Bradshaw	PERSON	, librarian at
Cambridge Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , that he could rarely be induced to write a letter .

		Certain business correspondence he must have attended to , but beyond that he was inexorably mum , in the epistolary sense .

		Once a friend , know - ing his peculiarity , wrote him an invitation to a week - end outing in the country , and enclosed two addressed postcards , one containing a form of acceptance , the other a declination .


Bradshaw	PERSON	was asked to mail the card suitable to the occasion .

		He mailed them both .

		The late
Steingrimur Stefa	PERSON	`` nsson , of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, a native of
Iceland	LOCATION	and a scholar of vast learning , which he delighted to place at the disposal of others , is interestingly portrayed in Dr.
Putnam	PERSON	's current official report .

		One who knew him well there says of him : '' Whether due to a certain heritage from his Viking ancestors or merely to personal obstinacy , not an uncommon characteristic of the Norse , he could never be prevailed upon to contribute from his immense fund of knowledge to library , bib - liographical , or other journals , to take part in library meetings or public activities .

		He must live his life as he saw it , and , like
Peer Gynt	ORGANIZATION	, be always himself .

		This seemed essential to his happiness . ''

		There are enough of us who are afflicted with the cacoethes scribendi and the cacoethes loquendi , so that we are glad to pay a tribute of admiration and respect to this silent scholar , whose services as head reviser of the catalogue division at the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	were invaluable , and the fruits of whose labors have , in part , become known to those using the catalogue cards sent out from
Washington	LOCATION	.

		NEW IDEALS OF LITERARY CRITICISM displace the old ; jejune pedantry gives way to stimulating and vitalizing methods of interpreting and illuminating the masterpieces of poetry and drama and essay and fiction .

		Those whose fortune it was to pursue literary studies at one or more German universities a quarter-century ago will probably be able to recall at least one professor whose exposition of a great author was a masterpiece of microscopic scholar - ship and learned dulness , and who might have evoked from his hearers some such couplet as the one scratched on a desk in the lecture-room of the renowned theologian
Dillmann	PERSON	, in
Berlin	LOCATION	, '' Wenn schlafen will man , so hOre man
Dillmann	PERSON	. ''

		Pro- fessor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	chanced upon this inscription , as he tells us in his recent book of reminiscences , and unhesitatingly declares : '' I can not say that I found the lectures in
Berlin	LOCATION	twenty-five years ago very stimulating or interesting .

		Before the end of the semester the number of attendants would drop down almost to nothing .

		The bare rooms , the cold , dark mornings of winter , the monotonous delivery of many of the lectures , the listless attitude of the students , all was far from inspiring enthusiasm . ''

		At the late meeting of modern language teachers in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	Professor
Goebel	PERSON	, of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, pointed to the failure to find successors to
Erich Schmidt	PERSON	and
Jacob Minor	PERSON	in the chairs of German literature at the universities of
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Vienna	LOCATION	, and gave as a reason the passing of the old school of literary criticism in
Germany	LOCATION	, the school built up by
Scherer	PERSON	in the last generation and nota - ble for its attention to the formal and the scholastic .

		At present the tendency is to seek the mainsprings of an author 's work and to recover something of the life imperfectly expressed by that author .

		We are no longer content to regard literature as a defunct `` specimen '' preserved in alcohol .

		LITERARY AID TO THE IMMIGRANT who desires , or ought to desire , to become a good American , is often more beneficial to him than a gift of money .

		Mr.
John Foster Carr	PERSON	's `` Immigrant 's Guide , '' published in several languages , has already been approvingly mentioned by us as a most useful book .

		Also attention has been called to recent
Massachu	PERSON	- setts library legislation in the interest of the immi - grant .

		An '' educational director , '' working in cooperation with the
Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, is now exerting every effort to make the foreigner feel more at home in the public library , and to show him how to profit by its resources , while the libra - ry 's equipment in foreign literature suited to the needs of our polyglot population is receiving addi - tions .

		The
Bay State	ORGANIZATION	, with its many factory towns , stands in especial need of just such service as the present incumbent of the new office ,
Miss J. M. Campbell	PERSON	, is at present so zealously rendering .

		In the town of
Beverly	LOCATION	, for instance , it is said that
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 93 twenty different languages are spoken ; and books in many of these foreign tongues are now to be had at the local library .

		Particular attention is given to familiarizing the alien with the manners and customs and laws and institutions of his adoptive land through the medium of printed matter in his own language .

		It is noteworthy that many of these immigrants are said to have been drawn to this country by
Miss Antin	PERSON	's glowing descriptions of `` the promised land . ''

		To them it is a land of opportunity , and
Miss Campbell	LOCATION	is doing her best to enable them to profit by the opportunity .

		THE RESCUE OF DISAPPEARING BALL ADS among our people has been undertaken by the national
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, aided by Dr.
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	,
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	Professor of English in the Uni - versity of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		When Professor Child compiled his great work , '' The English and Scottish Popular Ballads , '' he found that seventeen of the three hun - dred and live ballads there given were current in various parts of this country .

		Later researches have added about forty more to this number , and it is proposed to continue the investigation , with the help of school-teachers , librarians , and all others who are willing to lend a hand , until the total number of old ballads and fragments of ballads brought into this country from the mother - land shall have been as nearly as possible ascertained .

		This is a work that must be prosecuted now , and vigorously , if it is to succeed ; for the many agencies operating to oblit - erate the last traces of survival in this domain of popular poetry will not halt for the convenience of research parties .

		`` State organizations , '' says Pro- fessor
Smith	PERSON	, in a circular sent out by the
Burean of Education	ORGANIZATION	, `` will be found most efficient in this rescue work .

		Not until each
State	ORGANIZATION	feels itself re - sponsible for the collection of the ballads surviving in its own borders will the search be even approxi - mately complete or the results at all satisfactory .

		But when each
State	ORGANIZATION	joins in a sort of cooperative ballad union , a work may be written that shall prove not less significant and certainly not less interesting to Americans than
Professor Child	ORGANIZATION	's great work itself . ''

		Printed instructions for the guidance of those disposed to aid in this enterprise may be had from the
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	, at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		DURABILITY IN BOOKBINDING is an item of the first importance , especially in public libraries .

		It is worthy of note that the material now used for this purpose in the reading-room of our national library is buckram .

		Last year nearly six thousand volumes were bound in buckram for that collection , and thus far the results have been satisfactory .

		A few words from the annual report of the assistant in charge of this work are here in place .

		`` The buckram now in stock is the very best . ''

		he says .

		`` It is equal if not superior to the common leathers and may be safely used for all ordinary work , excepting for the larger and heavier books , which it is probably best to bind in half leather .

		We lace in the boards all books bound in buckram , except the very thin ones , in the same way as for a leather binding , and theoretically this binding should prove almost as strong as the ordinary leather one . ''

		The `` almost '' we should venture to strike out , remem - bering the inevitable crumbling tendencies of leather where it serves as hinge to the book-cover .

		Some strong woven fabric , such as canvas , for elephant folios , would certainly outlast the best of leathers .

		Continuing his report , Mr.
Kimball	PERSON	says : '' We have tried to exert an influence toward the more general adoption of buckram binding , but with only partial success , owing to a general feeling , still surviving , that the use of any kind of a cloth bind - ing is derogatory to the book .

		Ornamental features , such as marbled edges , the use of marbled board papers , and headbands , are omitted , and the cost of material is generally somewhat less . ''

		Many of us can remember the time when a silk cover with all sorts of foolish filigree work was considered neces - sary for a book of poems or a volume of elegant extracts ; but this notion has passed , as will , no doubt , in a few years , the prejudice in favor of leather as the only dignified binding for large and dignified books .

		... AN UNAPPRECIATED NEPENTHE , offered to those whose weight of sorrowful memories it would re - move or materially lighten , is a wasted gift indeed .

		What securer refuge from the pursuing cares of the irrevocable past could there be than a good book ?

		And yet we are told by an ex-convict from Sing Sing , who contributes to the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' some reminiscences of his `` carceral endur - ance '' -LRB- as old
John Foxe	PERSON	would put it -RRB- , that only a minority of the inmates of that famous penal insti - tution make any use of the library placed at the dis - posal of them all .

		To be sure , he describes this library as `` a poor affair , '' but it can not be so poor as to be without a considerable number of readable books , and with the encouragement of appreciative use the authorities might feel moved to increase that number .

		Sing Sing has been much in public notice of late , in connection with the alternative plans of addition to the present building or a trans - fer of its occupants to a rural environment better adapted to the proper work of reformation .

		The last effort of the late
Samuel J. Barrows	PERSON	's life was an unavailing attempt to secure less rigorous condi - tions for the unfortunates at Sing Sing .

		Not the least of the needed improvements there one surmises to be a better and a more intelligently-administered library , which might help to make the institution what our ex-convict well says it ought to be , `` a training-school for the development of strength of character , instead of being what it is at present , a finishing school for beginners in crime . ''

		THE INSCRUTABILITY OF GENIUS not infrequently extends even to so subordinate a detail as hand - writing .


Horace Greeley	PERSON	's scrawl became notorious for illegibility , and the story is well known of his angry upbraiding of a compositor for misinterpret - ing his manuscript in the columns of the `` Tribune , '' -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	but when he was confronted with his own hiero - glyphics he became as thoroughly bewildered as had been the manipulator of the types .

		A like anecdote of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	is recounted by his son , Count
Elie Tolstoy	PERSON	, in the '' Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		In describing his mother 's trials and tribulations as amanuensis to her author-husband the son says -LRB- the translation only has reached us -RRB- : `` Being very short-sighted , my mother had to bring her eyes close to the paper to decipher my father 's frightful scrawl .

		The work often took her the whole evening , and kept her busy until long after the rest of the household had gone to bed .

		When she found a passage which was quite illegible she used to go to papa and ask him to explain it .

		But that seldom happened , for she was very reluctant to disturb him .

		When she did so he took the manuscript from her and asked , with evident irritation : ` Well ?

		What is it that you ca n't understand ? '

		Then he would begin to read it him - self , but when he arrived at the puzzling passage he was invariably pulled up and had the greatest difficulty in even guessing what he had written . ''

		Nevertheless , no cultivation of illegibility in hand - writing will make one a genius , literary or other ; and some men of genius , notably
Thackeray	PERSON	, have written the most beautifully legible hand .

		THE GEOGRAPHICAL CENTRE OF OUR PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM has never been ascertained with mathematical precision , and it would no sooner be found than it would shift its position a mile or two westward , with our population-centre ; for it is prob - able that the two imaginary points are not many hundred miles apart , and are tending more and more to coincide .

		The librarian at
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, wrote a letter the other day , to be read before the
Council of the American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, urging the removal of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	's headquarters from
Chicago	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	, and venturing the assertion that `` ten times as many library workers , printers , authors , students , publishers , booksellers , and jour - nalists are found within say three hours ' ride of
New York	LOCATION	as are found within the same distance from
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		This may be so , or it may be an exces - sive estimate ; but in any case it is an Atlantic-coast view of the matter , and the rapid spread of our library system over the great central and western regions of the country will in the near future reduce the rela - tive importance of
Newark	LOCATION	or even
New York	LOCATION	in the scheme of things bibliothecal .

		Moreover , as Mr.
Dana	PERSON	freely admits ,
Chicago	LOCATION	`` gives and is to be praised therefore good rooms , rent free , and
New York	LOCATION	offers nothing . ''

		He volunteers to be one to try to raise a fund with which to lure the headquarters back again to the edge of the continent .

		THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF COSMOPOLITAN CUL - TURE goes on apace .

		International exchange of university professors is accompanied by a like swap - ping of students ,
Germany	LOCATION	,

		And now there is proposed by
the University of Chili	ORGANIZATION	, through the Chilian Minister at
Washington	LOCATION	, an interchange of similar courtesies between that institution and Har - vard , with a limited number of students included in the scheme of give and take .

		Also one hears of a like plan proposed by Dr.
Carlos de Pena	PERSON	, Uruguayan envoy to this country , on behalf of the
National Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity of
Uruguay	LOCATION	, and the prospect now is that these South American exchanges will be effected next year .

		REVIVIFYING THE CLASSIC LANGUAGES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Evidently two quite different but not necessarily opposing purposes obtain in the acquirement of the so - called classic languages : one signifies discipline , the other intellectual pleasure .

		Our pleasure-loving age shuns discipline ; and one proof of this statement is to be found in the universal complaint made by the teachers of Latin and Greek that not only fewer pupils take up the study of those languages but also that those doing so seem to find it harder to master them .

		I believe thoroughly in intellectual discipline , but not in wasted energy .

		A mental discipline which keeps immature boys for years in studying the elements of Latin and Greek and ends by making them detest the classics , largely because the purpose of their discipline has been to give them the skeleton of the language and even the flesh of it but not the vital spirit the very term '' dead languages '' proves that they are treated as corpses to be dissected and not as splendidly living literatures , seems to me a wicked waste of time .

		There are exceptional instances where a boy , like young
Sidis	PERSON	, takes to Greek because , being interested in history , he wanted to read Thucydides and
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	in the original ; but it would be far wiser for most chil - dren under the age of twenty to begin with French or German or even Italian , in which languages there is a copious literature suitable for every epoch of a child 's life .

		I am not original in this claim .


Ben Franklin	PERSON	in his Autobiography says : '' I have thought there is some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages .

		We are told that it is proper to begin first with the Latin , and having acquired that , it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are derived from it ; and yet we do not begin with the Greek , in order more easily to acquire the Latin '' ; and he proceeds to query whether it would not be better '' to begin with the French and then take up the classic languages . ''


John Milton	PERSON	also -LRB- in his glorious essay on Education -RRB- , in speaking of the many mistakes which have made learning so unpleasing and so unsuccessful , says : '' We do amiss to spend seven or eight years merely in scrap - ing together so much miserable Latin and Greek as might be learned otherwise easily and delightfully in one year . ''

		And further on he adds : '' These are not matters to be wrung out of poor striplings like blood out of the nose or the plucking of untimely fruit . ''

		And
John Locke	PERSON	, in his wise and noble '' Thoughts concerning Education , '' says of the boy : `` As soon as
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 95 he can speak English , it is time for him to learn some other language : this nobody doubts of , when French is proposed .

		And the reason is because people are accus - t tomed to the right way of teaching that language , which is by talking it into children in constant conversation and not by grammatical rules ... When he can read and speak French well , which in this method is usually in a year or two , he should proceed to
Latin	LOCATION	, which it is a wonder parents , when they have had the experi - ment in French , should not think ought to be learned the same way by talking and reading ... Latin I look upon as absolutely necessary to a gentleman ; and indeed custom , which prevails over everything , has made it so much a part of education , that even those children are whipped to it and made spend many hours of their precious time uneasily in
Latin	LOCATION	, who after they are once gone from school , are never to have any more to do with it , as long as they live . ''

		And the wise old Du Bellay , in the sixteenth century , anticipated President Eliot in placing less emphasis on the `` humanities . ''

		He said : '' Car si le terns que nous consumons h apprendre ces dictes langues -LSB- Latin and Greek -RSB- estoit employe '' a 1 ` estude des sciences la Nature certes n'est point devenue si brehaigne -LSB- sterile -RSB- qu'elle n'enfastast de notre terns des Platons et des Aristotes . ''

		I have no objection to a man spending a life-time on a Greek particle or in finding the esoteric significance of the careless writing to be found in Plato or Csesar , if he can get pleasure or profit from such puerilities ; but it makes my blood boil with indignation to see our pre - paratory schools go on , generation after generation , in the same old stupid course , keeping boys and girls for years on what are called the elements of the classic languages , and , as
Milton	PERSON	says , growing '' into hatred and contempt of learning , '' or , as
Locke	PERSON	says , abhorring them '' for the ill usage it procured '' them .

		For thousands of years makers of needles put the eye into the shank ; suddenly a man came along and put the eye into the neck just above the point , and the sewing - machine was invented .

		Still the grammars teach stu - dents the declensions perpendicularly from nominative singular to ablative plural ; whereas if the cases were learned horizontally , it would in two minutes ' time save six months of blundering .

		Every English objective plural ends either in s or , in the case of neuters -LRB- like phenom - ena -RRB- , in a. By putting the five vowels , a , e , i , o , and u , before this final s , one learns in about a minute to recog - nize practically all the accusatives plural , both nouns and adjectives , in all Latin literature ; by changing the s to m one likewise , though of course not quite so as - suredly , gets most of the accusatives singular .

		The meaningless distinction of
First and Second Declensions	ORGANIZATION	and the like , resolves into a reasonable vowel sequence .

		In a similar way the conjugations are learned by the natural divisions of time .

		Every imperfect has the ba , -LRB- a sister of the English was but more regular -RRB- with the almost invariable raus , we , nt , they , t , he or she or it , according to the context .

		The addition of ur makes almost any verb passive .

		This is only a hint of what steps one may take in learning Latin .

		I once taught a young woman Latin so that in ten or twelve lessons she was reading Spinoza in the original .

		I agree that it might take years to acquire a thorough scientifically-grammatical knowledge of either Greek or Latin , but I would guarantee that any mature person in a week 's time might without great strain lay a sufficient basis of Latin and Greek to take the keenest delight in
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	or
Ovid	LOCATION	, in
Euripides	LOCATION	or Plato .

		Of course I would not ignore what we in college used to call '' trots , '' for a literal translation is only a simplified dictionary .

		This is merely the application of common sense to the use of brains .

		The spirit of any language may be to a large de - gree understood and entered into by reading the Gospels or the Psalms , with which one is presupposed to have some degree of familiarity .

		The pronunciation is per - fectly simple .

		The Greek alphabet may be learned in half an hour , by selecting out the letters like and unlike our own and writing the unfamiliar ones down with their equivalents a few times .

		Let me say again , this is wholly and solely for the sake of the literary value of Greek and Latin litera - ture , and for the intense delight which it gives .

		I try to read a little Greek every day , and the mere sound of the words , the rhymes and alliterations , the musical rhythms , come to the ear of my eye , if I may use such a term , with a sensuous intoxicating exhilaration which I believe even the Greeks themselves , perhaps overfamiliar with the words , could scarcely feel .

		That is the glory of acquiring a new language the new words are like newly-minted coins , with the design and the inscription not as yet worn away by familiar use .

		Of course pedantic and academic scholars and pro- fessors , still bound in the shackles of convention , fight against these theories ; and they have been strong enough to resist the suggestions of
Milton	LOCATION	and
Locke	PERSON	and our own wise and sensible Franklin so that the schools and colleges are still following the well - worn , dusty , vegetationless paths to the grave-yards where the dead languages are buried .

		Armed with mediaeval pick and spade they burrow in the valley of dry bones , and the result is that live people detest their methods and are bored to death with articulated skeletons jug - gled into a sort of punchiuello semblance of activity by a stupid apparatus of clumsy strings .

		The cone of education stands on its apex instead of resting on its good broad base .

		I should like to see a revolution turn out the whole system and begin again .

		Then we should have a Renaissance in literature , and a vast multitude kindled with enthusiasm for the classics , both ancient and modern .

		AN AUXILIARY LANGUAGE FOR INTERCOMMUNICATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The solution of the problem of intercommunication in its broadest sense , the international and unrestricted exchange of useful information , has always been con - fronted by the barrier of language .

		There is no apriori reason why the quintessence of the modern European tongues might not be extracted , as it were , and made to do good service to civilization in a world daily grow - ing smaller .

		The writer will not attempt to discuss in detail any of the projects for a purely artificial language .

		There have indeed been many failures in that field of human ingenuity ; but those failures , or the aggregate thereof , have served to point out the way to ultimate success .

		The auxiliary language which will sooner or later come into fairly universal use as an economic factor will undoubtedly be based upon maximum inter - nationality as governed by regularity and facility .

		It has been impossible until very recently to approach this question in any way except as a partisan or an opponent of some particular project .

		Happily , the problem is now being given consideration from a much 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	more nearly neutral standpoint , and in a way which promises its removal to the plane of recognized author - ity .

		It is high time that this be done , not only to end the controversy and keen rivalry between various pro- jects , but also , what is far more important , to give the world some definite assurance of a way to prevent the fearful economic waste of time , energy , and money involved in the current and so far unavoidable practice of using three or more official languages in every inter - national congress .

		This practice entails much tedious repetition of remarks and resolutions , and much expense for separate editions of publications , etc. .

		It should suffice that the proceedings of such international con - ventions be conducted and published in the language of the country in which the meeting occurs , with an interleaved or separate translation in the official auxil - iary language for all the rest of the world .

		Such a plan , which is not at all impossible of fulfilment , would often have the further great advantage that the speak - ers or authors themselves would write or personally approve the translation .

		This would go far toward the prevention of serious inaccuracies and preserve the exact meaning of the author , which is so difficult to do when translations are made by another who may have very little knowledge of the technical subject involved .

		Not only in the international congresses would all con - cerned receive substantial and lasting benefits from the world-wide adoption and use of a common auxiliary language , but the advantages would be scarcely less important when accruing also to commerce and to tourist travel . ''

		But , '' says the patient reader , '' this very pleasing prospect seems to be based on only an assumption that some international language will really become officially adopted by the governments .

		Languages are the result of growth and must have a long history .

		It is impos - sible to conceive of spontaneous expression in any but a living language , such as English or French , for example .

		To use a conventional language , created by fiat , governmental or otherwise , would mean a loss of comprehensiveness , of flexibility , and of precision .

		It would mean a limited and stilted manner of expression of thought , which would be quite inadequate and unsat - isfactory .

		It can never be . ''

		If the good reader has allowed himself thus to be blinded by his prejudice , his pre-judgment , he is griev - ously mistaken .

		Let him awake and look around .

		If he can not see the signs of the times , let him put his ear to the ground and listen to the mighty rumble of the gathering legions of internationalism , those vast armies of peace which are marching forward valiantly to a glorious victory for humanity , and to the destruc - tion of barriers between peoples and peoples , man and man .

		The barrier of language will not and can not be broken down by the adoption of English or any other living tongue , whether brought about by commercial supremacy or any other means .

		That would give far too great an advantage to the nation whose mother tongue was thus favored .

		Equity , mutual fairness , and the necessities of the case demand the adoption , not of a purely artificial idiom , but of the quintessence of the modern languages of western and southern
Europe	LOCATION	, not a mere mixture , but a composite , logically devel - oped by the collaboration of scholars .

		In this state of affairs , therefore , it is but natural and appropriate that at the
Eighth International Congress of Students	ORGANIZATION	held in
Ithaca	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	,
August 29	DATE	to Septem - ber
3 , 1913	DATE	, which was attended by two hundred repre - sentatives of thirty countries , the following resolution was adopted : '' The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	declares itself heartily in favor of an auxiliary language and expresses the earnest hope that the adherents of Esperanto and Ido -LRB- reformed Esperanto -RRB- may unite in a common effort to secure the appointment of an official commission for the purpose of thoroughly studying the problem , and adopting an official international auxiliary language . ''

		This resolution may , and quite possibly will , bear fruit even sooner than its framers anticipated .

		The Association for the creation of a
Universal Language Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, founded in
Berne	LOCATION	on
February 27 , 1911	DATE	, and entered in the Commercial Register , has for its imme - diate object the presentation of an address to the
Swiss Federal Council	ORGANIZATION	, in which the latter is to be requested to send a confidential inquiry to other governments as to whether or not they are willing to give their support to the summoning of an official provisional conference .

		This conference will undertake preliminaries with re - gard to combining together as many governments as possible into a
Universal Language Union	ORGANIZATION	, similar to the
Universal Postal Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The foundation of this Uni - versal
Language Union	ORGANIZATION	and the creation of a
Universal Language Bureau	ORGANIZATION	are then reserved for an official congress of the governments concerned .

		This congress will have to form the definite conclusions which will be based upon the preliminary labors of the provisional conference .

		As a foundation for the step to be taken by the
Swiss Federal Council	ORGANIZATION	and for the labors of the provisional conference ,
the Association	ORGANIZATION	will undertake , with the help of experts , a draft of an international treaty for the introduction of a universal language , and incorporate such draft in their memorial .

		On the other hand , the choice of the international auxiliary language which is to be proposed for official recognition will be left to the international conference .

		The
Association	ORGANIZATION	is perfectly neutral in regard to the vari - ous systems of universal language .

		The officers of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	are as follows : Honorary President : Colonel
EMIL FREY	PERSON	, Ex - Federal Councillor , Director of the
International Bureau of the Telegraph-Union	ORGANIZATION	in
Berne	LOCATION	.

		President : Dr.
A. GOBAT	PERSON	, National Councillor ,
Direc	PERSON	- tor of the
International Peace Bureau	ORGANIZATION	in
Berne	LOCATION	.

		Vice - Presidents : Professor
WILHELM OSTWALD	PERSON	, Privy Councillor , member of the
Royal Saxon Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Gross-Bothen ,
Leipzig	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		ANTON
WALTIS	PERSON	-
BUHL	ORGANIZATION	, Manufacturer -LRB-
Zurich	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		ARISTIDE ROLLIER , Judge -LRB-

		Secretary :
H. BEHRMANN	PERSON	, Director of the
Official Information Bureau	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-

		Treasurers :

		SALIS , Banker -LRB-
Berne	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		ERNST WITSCHI , of the firm of
Eugen v. Biiren & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Berne	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		While
the Association	ORGANIZATION	is absolutely neutral in its attitude toward the various projects for an auxiliary language , it is nevertheless interesting to receive from another quarter some indication as to the general char - acter of what may become the strongest candidate for selection .

		On this point some light is thrown by the following extracts from '' The Scientific American '' Supplements , as cited : `` The result is a language -LRB- Ido -RRB- which maybe mastered readily by anybody and which has this advantage over other artificial languages , that it is based on rational , scientific , technical principles , and therefore is not exposed to the danger of being supplanted by the creation of a still better
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 97 and materially different language . ''

		-LRB- Supplement
1795	DATE	,
May 28 , 1910	DATE	, page 346 . -RRB- ''

		Esperanto has suffered because it has fallen into the hands of scientifically untrained persons , and sometimes into the hands of fanatics . ''

		-LRB- Supplement
1798	DATE	,
June 18 , 1910	DATE	, page 398 . -RRB-

		`` The language of the Delegation -LRB- Ido -RRB- is very capable of expressing difficult passages with all possible fidelity '' -LRB- Ibid , page 399 -RRB- This whole question , therefore , certainly seems at last to have entered the realm of practical life and serious - ness to the extent that it is entitled to very careful consideration .

		Indeed , the
Swedish Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in
Stockholm	LOCATION	, about three years ago , gave some consideration to a proposition which contemplated the making of an official investi - gation , by the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, of the whole question of an international language .

		Very lively interest was aroused in the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and the proposition as presented was finally defeated by a very narrow margin with a minority vote of ninety or more members , or nearly fifty per cent , which certainly constituted a very respectable support for the plan .

		Numerous other nations have found them - selves and their literature more or less isolated from the world at large owing to the fact that their mother tongues were not widely understood .

		This is a serious handicap against scientific study and research , and particularly against the publication of new discoveries of a technical nature , because the publisher has at best only a limited clientele to which to present a work of scientific or technical character when printed in any other than one of the languages of wide circulation , such as English , French , or German .

		If , on the contrary , a publisher of scientific works could appeal to the entire world for support of such a book printed in an auxiliary language generally understood , it would incalculably advance the cause of education .

		Some little progress has already been made in the compilation of an international lexicon of commercial terms ; which , if made available for general use by the world of commerce , would be of inestimable value .

		It is true that to
Switzerland	LOCATION	, as the home of inter - nationalism , belongs the privilege of taking the initiative in the formation of a
Universal Language Union and Bureau	ORGANIZATION	; but at the same time , without detracting in the least from the honor which belongs to
Switzerland	LOCATION	, it remains for some great nation to secure the almost equal honor of being the first to support the initial steps , which no doubt will be taken in
Berne	LOCATION	.

		One can easily foresee the renaissance of that glorious time when scientists were able to intercommunicate by means of a language common to all .

		That language will not be Latin , but the international language , which ought to be the quintessence of the modern European tongues .

		It will not be truly artificial , but essentially natural , founded upon the principle of maximum inter - nationality , governed by regularity and facility .

		`` TAINTED '' BOOK REVIEWS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A newspaper publisher in a town in the
Middle West	LOCATION	whom I recently visited told me an astonishing thing .

		He said he was one of eight men similarly employed in towns from
Baltimore	LOCATION	to
Des Moines	LOCATION	who have entered into an agreement with a
New York	LOCATION	advertis - ing concern to print syndicated book-reviews sent out by this concern from
New York	LOCATION	in consideration of receiving advertising from a number of book-publishers , including some of the leading houses of the country .

		My friend did not seem to see anything wrong in this arrangement .

		On the contrary , he thought it an excel - lent idea .

		He was guaranteed a greater amount of advertising , and he was going to dispense with his book critic , or at least transfer him to another department .

		As a book-buyer this seems to me a sinister move .

		I have always read book reviews where they seemed to be unbiassed ; and I have frequently bought books , par - ticularly fiction , on the recommendation of reviewers upon whose judgment I had come to rely .

		I have always thought book reviews a natural service for a newspaper of repute , just as is theatrical criticism or editorial comment .

		But if literary criticism in the daily press is to depend on book advertising , and is to be furnished , not by a local critic whose taste and judgment you perhaps know personally to be honest , but by a hired corps of men in
New York	LOCATION	who are paid , practically , by the publishers , I should like to ask , in the idiom of the day , '' Where do we get off ? ''

		Some years ago a hue-and-cry was raised by the ex - posure of the fact that certain trusts , then under investi - gation by the government , maintained expensive pub - licity bureaus which put forth matter favorable to the companies and got it published in newspapers on the corporations ' payroll .

		This was called '' tainted news . ''

		It was bad enough ; but now we have tainted book reviews !

		This may be too small a matter to excite the indigna - tion of the public , but I consider it only the first step towards the debauching of the press .

		I am informed that there is a movement already on foot to organize theatrical criticism on the same basis .

		Editorial comment will probably come next .

		It is true that this affair , so far , only touches eight cities of the second class ; but if it succeeds , and both parties to the agreement appear to be satisfied of its success already , how long will it be before it reaches out and envelops the chief cities of the union ?

		A PROTEST .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As a friend of THE DIAL , may I venture to express my surprise that you should have allowed to be printed the wholly uncalled for animadversion upon the
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	contained in a review of the work of
T. B. Read	ORGANIZATION	in your issue of
January 1	DATE	?

		Your reviewer believes that the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	doctrine seems in practice `` capable of creating more whited sepulchres than any other creed ever known , '' and in evidence devotes nearly half a column to the story of a case somebody told him about .

		The dictum of your reviewer may or may not be true , he would be hard put to prove it ; but what has it to do with the discussion of a poet who was neither a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	nor a whited sepulchre ?

		The reputation of the small Christian body impugned , whose influence in the humanitarian progress of the race is well known , is not likely to be noticeably affected by the aspersions referred to ; but it seems to me that the injection of such irrelevant , personal matter into reviews is neither just nor politic , and unworthy of THE DIAL 'S unique standing as an American journal of criticism .

FRANCIS THOMPSON	PERSON	: His LIFE AND His WORK .

		* With Mr ,
Everard	PERSON	MeynelFs Life of
Francis Thompson	PERSON	we are given probably the last tribute from a family whose devotion to a great singer would , of itself , ensure that family a memor - able place in the history of English poetry .

		Many a young poet will envy
Thompson	PERSON	this devotion , sublimated as it is with a fine harmony of reticence and frankness , strong as it is with a loyalty so sincere , so enduring , so clear-eyed .

		And the biography comes as no anti-climax .

		In the most approved manner of modern biography , and with the characteristic self-effacement of his family , Mr.
Everard Meynell	PERSON	allows the singer to reveal himself , as far as may be , in innumerable passages of prose and poetry , pub - lished and unpublished , which are chosen and inserted with a creative sureness which everyone will enjoy but which will be fully appreciated only by those who know from experience the extreme difficulty of achieving a literary portrait that is also a work of art .

		In addition , the book is opulent with verbal snap-shots and reminis - cent sketches from scores of people who knew the poet .

		When it becomes necessary , as it often does , for the biographer to come forward and speak in his own person , he is obviously con - fronted by a great responsibility .

		No one who can not himself write prose with distinction should dare to dally with the Promethean fire of quo - tation .

		But Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	has set the jewels of the poet and his circle into a rich and vigorous metal that glows in warm and perfect harmony .

		This book , furthermore , takes its place among certain critical studies still rare because they require epical toil and vision , but increasing steadily in number because they mark the be - ginnings of a new Fine Art that irresistibly brings more and more strenuous and lofty writ - ers to emulate its first representations .

		This kind of estimate , which has been called `` col - lective criticism '' by Professor
W. T. Brewster	PERSON	and others , was perhaps first effectively worked out by Mr.
John Mackinnon Eobertson	PERSON	in his essay on
Poe	PERSON	.

		It withdraws much of the over - emphasis now placed on sources and analogues to approach the author through a large body of his critics , and , by catching each evasive light * THE LIFE OF
FRANCIS THOMPSON	PERSON	.

		By
Everard Meynell	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE WORKS OF
FRANCIS THOMPSON	PERSON	.

		In three volumes .

		With portraits .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		from the myriad facets of personalities , environ - ments , and epochs of an army of writers , impres - sionistic , historical , and judicial , it gradually finds the full vision wherewith to build a great temple , at once impersonal and finely personal , which will stand solid and stately and indestruc - tible in the storm centre of whims and moods , of fierce vituperation and frantic eulogy .

		Even in the case of
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, a singer of our own generation , such a method brings aston - ishing perspective under the impartial and art - ful hands of Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	.

		Shrewd thrusts and irresistible lauds , dyspeptic attacks and blind praises , conventional whims and keen prophecies swarm through these pages cheek by jowl .

		We hear the voices of a motley but most represen - tative company :
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	, with his prophecies and his arrogance , leaves his new celestial comrades ,
Elijah	PERSON	,
Isaiah	PERSON	, and
Jeremiah	PERSON	, to return to us as though in the flesh ;
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	, in the midst of his slums and his agony of indulgence , reveals in his verses faint and lovely echoes of
Thompson	ORGANIZATION	's diction ; Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	greets warmly a distant but a fellow dreamer ; the leading reviews snarl and patronize ; Miss
Agnes Tobin	PERSON	turns from her Petrarch to the lover of the
Virgin Mary	ORGANIZATION	; that stirring old des - pot
Henley	ORGANIZATION	flings the biting gibe and capricious but precious praise ;
George Meredith	PERSON	banters like a Titan and quotes with hearty joy to the shy singer himself some of the awed and fragile and imperishable lines out of `` Love in Dian 's Lap . ''

		As we read of
Cardinal Manning	ORGANIZATION	and
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	, of
Arthur Symons	PERSON	and
Aubrey De Vere	PERSON	, of
Norman Gale	PERSON	and
William Archer	PERSON	, of
Robert Browning	PERSON	and
John David	PERSON	- son , our new perspective will at least dispel the superstition of cult-worship that hounded
Thompson	PERSON	from the beginning to the end of his literary career .

		* If Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	is generous and sensible in his inclusion of animadversions on
Thompson	PERSON	's poetry , he is no less frank in his revelation of the facts of the man 's life .

		And he is certainly * Since this review is to be frankly eulogistic , and since the essays of the moment still make the threadbare remark first made in the nineties that
Thompson	PERSON	has been cursed by the overpraise of a narrow cult , it may be well for me to fol - low briefly Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's suggestion in '' Essays Towards a Critical Method '' and give the reader a brief account of myself .

		For the present purpose a few negative remarks will do .

		I am not a Roman Catholic .

		I do not know ` the Meynells .

		I am not a Thompsonian faddist , but discovered ; he poet for myself when I was a sophomore in college in the year
1903	DATE	, long before the hue and cry over
Thompson	PERSON	and
Defore	PERSON	any of my friends had heard of him .

		I take the liberty of adding that though I have my own little quarrels with
Thompson	PERSON	, I find , after having read a good many recent reviews on him , that I shall perforce be too busy with eulogy o find space or inclination to touch upon my grievances .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAJL 99 no less sensible .

		For the facts reveal , not that
Max Nordau	PERSON	and his followers are right about genius , but simply that
Francis Thompson	PERSON	was a saint .

		His whole life was a superb and pious and immortal protest against our present formula that life is -LRB- and should be -RRB- a struggle for exist - ence .

		A friend of mine puts it very happily in a letter written after reading the biography : '' Instead of being a divine vagrant ,
Thompson	PERSON	might have been a chubby and tidy person of irreproachable habits ; but he could n't be both at once .

		When the records are cast up , I think it is the chubby and tidy people who will stand most in need of apologies , rather than such men as
Thompson	PERSON	. ''

		In the hardest and most unspiritual decades of the nineteenth century , the decades against which
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	had raised his voice almost in vain ,
Thompson	PERSON	's life was the life of an untheatrical martyr , a perfect refutation of ueo-aristocracy , the aristocracy of family trees -LRB- generally dying at the top -RRB- , the aristocracy of wealth , the aristocracy of efficiency , all the shallow and ugly sophistries that have grown up about the profound truth of the survival of the fittest .


Francis Thompson	PERSON	, who never dreamed an injury and never looked at a cudgel , the con - sumptive who almost literally vanished slowly from the earth , will go down to fame as the deadly and irresistible foe of the noisy heroes of our age .

		He was the anti-superman .

		We must allow space for two glimpses of
Thompson	ORGANIZATION	's life as revealed in the biography .

		When , like De
Quincey	PERSON	, the poet wandered in agony and poverty and helplessness , a runaway outcast , through the long , gaunt streets of Lon - don , he found , like De Quincey , his Ann .

		`` This girl gave out of her scant and pitiable opu - lence , consisting of a room , warmth , and food , and a cab thereto .

		When the streets were no longer crowded with shameful possibilities she would think of the only tryst that her heart regarded and , a sister of charity , would take her beggar into her vehicle at the appointed place and cherish him with an affection maidenly and motherly , and passionate in both these capacities .

		Two outcasts , they sat marvelling that there were joys for them to unbury and to share .

		Then , in a
Chelsea	LOCATION	room such as that of
Rossetti	PERSON	's poem would they sit : '' Your lamp , my
Jenny	PERSON	, kept alight , Like a wise virgin 's , all one night !

		And in the alcove coolly spread Glimmers with dawn your empty bed . ''

		Weakness and confidence , humility and reverence , were gifts unknown to her except at his hands , and she repaid them with graces as lovely as a child 's , and as unhesitating as a saint 's .

		In his address to a child , in a later year , he remembers this poor girl 's childishness : '' Forlorn , and faint , and stark I had endured through watches of the dark The abashless inquisition of each star , Yea , was the outcast mark Of all those heavenly passers ' scrutiny ; Stood bound and helplessly For Time to shoot his barbe 'd minutes at me ; Suffered the trampling hoof of every hour In night 's slow-wheele 'd car ; Until the tardy dawn dragged me at length From under those dread wheels ; and , bled of strength , I waited the inevitable last .

		Then there came past A child ; like thee , a spring-flower ; but a flower Fallen from the budded coronal of
Spring	DATE	, And through the city-streets blown withering .

		She passed , O brave , sad , lovingest , tender thing !

		And of her own scant pittance did she give , That I might eat and live : Then fled , a swift and trackless fugitive .

		Therefore I kissed in thee The heart of Childhood , so divine for me ; And her , through what sore ways And what uuchildish days .

		Borne from me now , as then , a trackless fugitive .

		Therefore I kissed in thee Her , Child !

		and innocency . ''

		Her sacrifice was to fly from him : learning he had found friends , she said that he must go to them and leave her .

		After his first interview with my father he had taken her his news . '

		They will not understand our friendship , ' she said , and then , ' I always knew you were a genius . '

		And so she strangled the opportunity ; she killed again the child , the sister ; the mother had come to life within her she went away .

		Without warning she went to unknown lodgings and was lost to him .

		In ` the mighty labyrinths of
London	LOCATION	' he lay in wait for her , nor would he leave the streets , thinking that in doing so he would make a final severance .

		Like De
Quincey 's Ann	PERSON	, she was sought , but never found , along the pavements at the place where she had been used to find him . ''

		When Mr.
Wilfrid Meynell	PERSON	pulled some dirty manuscripts from a pigeon-hole of his desk and found that they were the work of genius he des - patched letters in vain , and finally went to seek the unknown author at a chemist 's shop to which the poet had directed him to send his mail . ''

		-LSB- Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	's -RSB- obvious eagerness prompted a query from the man behind the counter : ' Are you a relative ?

		he owes me three-and-ninepence . '

		With that paid and a promise of ten-and-sixpence if he produced the poet , he agreed to do his best , and , many days after , my father , being in his workroom , was told that Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	wished to see him . '

		Show him up , ' he said , and was left alone . ''

		Then the door opened , and a strange hand was thrust in .

		The door closed , but
Thompson	PERSON	had not entered .

		Again it opened , again it shut .

		At the third attempt a waif of a man came in .

		No such figure had ever been looked for ; more ragged and unkempt than the average beggar , with no shirt beneath his coat and bare feet in broken shoes , he found my father at a loss for words . '

		You must have had access to many books when you wrote that essay , ' was what he said . '

		That , ' said
Thompson	PERSON	, his shyness at once replaced by an acer - bity that afterwards became one of the most familiar of his never-to-be-resented mannerisms , ` that is pre - cisely where the essay fails .

		I had no books by me at the time save JSschylus and
Blake	PERSON	. '

		There was little 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	to be done for him at that interview save the extraction of a promise to call again .

		He made none of the con - fidences characteristic of a man seeking sympathy and alms .

		He was secretive and with no eagerness for plans for his benefit , and refused the offer of a small weekly sum that would enable him to sleep in a bed and sit at a table .

		I know of no man , and can imagine none , to whom another can so easily unburden himself of uneasi - ness and formalities as to my father .

		To him the poor and the rich are , as the fishes and the flames to St.
Francis	PERSON	, his brothers and his friends at sight , even if these are shy as fishes and sightless as flame .

		But the im - pression of the visit on my father was of a meeting that did not end in great usefulness so much was indicated by a manner schooled in concealments .

		But
Francis	PERSON	came again , and again , and then to my father 's house in
Kensington	LOCATION	.

		Of the falsity of the impression given by his manner , his poetry in the address to his host 's little girl is the proof : '' Yet is there more , whereat none guesseth , love !

		Upon the ending of my deadly night -LRB- Whereof thou hast not the surmise , and slight Is all that any mortal knows thereof -RRB- , Thou wert to me that earnest of day 's light , When , like the back of a gold-maile 'd saurian Heaving its slow length from Nilotic slime , The first long gleaming fissure runs Aurorian Athwart the yet dun firmament of prime .

		Stretched on the margin of the cruel sea Whence they had rescued me , With faint and painful pulses was I lying ; Not yet discerning well If 1 had ` scaped , or were an icicle , Whose thawing is its dying .

		Like one who sweats before a despot 's gate , Summoned by some presaging scroll of fate , And knows not whether kiss or dagger wait ; And all so sickened is his countenance The courtiers buzz , ' Lo , doomed ! '

		and look at him askance : At fate 's dread portal then Even so stood I , I ken , Even so stood I , between a joy and fear , And said to mine own heart , Now , if the end be here ! ' ''

		So it came about that the anti-superman was armed even at the close of the nineteenth century with the armor of pure charity , like
Bunyan	PERSON	's Christian , for a mighty battle with the most sinister forces of modern life .


Thompson	PERSON	's prose , now first authoritatively selected in the three-volume edition of the '' Works , '' gives me more courage than any - thing I have seen since the happy day when I first read the lovely sentences of Professor
Mackail	PERSON	's latest volumes .

		This prose of
Thomp	PERSON	- son 's , since it is the prose of a poet , will be of inestimable value to us in this generation , de - bauched as we are by the quickstep of journal - ism .

		There is another influence against which it will react , I think , with good effect , an influ - ence which one is supposed to mention nowadays in an awed whisper the influence of French prose .

		Arnold certainly did a great service in calling our attention to what we could learn from the marvellously supple prose across the channel .

		And to those who can relish
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's irony , there will be at least one quality evident in proof of the value of
Arnold	LOCATION	's taste for him - self .

		Yet , strangely enough , the most perfect passages in
Arnold	LOCATION	, such as the famous sen - tences about Oxford `` spreading her gardens to the moonlight '' and the haunting prelude to the essay on
Emerson	LOCATION	, those passages in what Professor Gates called
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's fourth manner , `` intimate , rich in color , intense in feeling , almost lyrical in tone , '' those passages so pa - thetically infrequent in the work of this too stern self - inquisitor , are the very passages which owe nothing whatever to French prose .

		To whom , then , do they owe the most ?

		Cer - tainly not to
OUP	ORGANIZATION	eighteenth century prosemen , whom some uphold as our greatest , as rivals , even if humble rivals , of the French .

		Undoubt - edly
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's fourth manner was inspired by the man who was celebrated in one of those very passages
John Henry Newman	PERSON	.

		And who taught
Newman	PERSON	to write prose ?

		To a great extent , De Quincey .

		And De
Quincey	PERSON	learned the secrets of his mighty rhythms and his imperial opulence from the ornate English writers of the seventeenth century .

		Is it not true that when we survey the greatest prose of
England	LOCATION	we find at least a fourth written by our poets ; about half of it written by prose - writers who were really very fervid poets in spirit ,
Malory	LOCATION	,
Hooker	ORGANIZATION	,
Taylor	PERSON	, the King James translators ,
Browne	PERSON	,
Burke	PERSON	, De Quincey ,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Newman	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Pater	PERSON	-LRB- for all his half-true protestations of French lineage -RRB- ; and , finally , do we not find that barely a fourth has been written by men like Swift ?

		The ornate style is the English style , our heritage from the spacious days of the English renaissance .

		And , though the purer currents of the simpler eighteenth cen - tury prose and the wonderful cadences from
France	LOCATION	are a most wholesome interblending , we should not forget our imperatorial birth - right .


Francis Thompson	PERSON	, in an age when our prose-writers , though still phrasing bril - liantly , were beginning to lose their grasp of rhythm , wrote the true English prose .

		A fair characterization of his own style and an excel - lent example of it may be found in a sentence that he wrote on
Sidney	PERSON	's prose : '' It is a prose full of young joy , and young power , and young inexperience , and young melancholy , which is the wilfulness of joy ; full of young fertility ,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 101 wantoning in its own excess . ''

		And , lest some readers draw unjust inferences , lest they doubt the sound sense of
Thompson	PERSON	, let me add another example of his prose and an admirable example of his fine critical acumen , a sen - tence on his beloved De Quincey : '' A little , wrinkly , high-foreheaded , dress-as-you - please man ; a meandering , inhumanly intellectual man , shy as a hermit-crab , and as given to shifting his lodg - ings ; much-enduring , inconceivable of way , sweet - hearted , fine-natured , small-spited , uncanny as a sprite begotten of libraries ; something of a bore to many , by reason of talking like a book in coat and breeches undeniably clever and wonderful talk none the less ; master of a great , unequal , seductive , and irritating style ; author of sixteen delightful and intolerable vol - umes , part of which can never die , and much of which can never live : that is De Quincey . ''


Thompson	PERSON	's prose in the collected Works and the hitherto unpublished fragments in the Life will also be of great value in giving pause to many who have been content to mouth certain commonplaces of criticism against him which have been continuously current since
1894	DATE	.

		We learn now that his reviewers have been right in pointing out that there were echoes from Pat - more ,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Crashaw	PERSON	, and an army of others .

		Indeed , Mr.
Everard Meynell	PERSON	is very glad to supplement the notions of the critics not only with confessions from
Thompson	PERSON	but with some most suggestive parallel passages and observa - tions of his own .

		Nevertheless , with all this in mind , the wary critic as he rereads the poems will , it is hoped , learn a lesson of supreme im - portance to his generation .

		Let him reread also the poetry of
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	and note that , while both poets can change like the chameleon , as the iridescent memories of a hundred singers surge through them ,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	was insincere and therefore -LRB- except in a few master poems -RRB- only a very interesting workman , but
Francis Thomp	PERSON	- son was sincere and therefore a great poet .

		The wary critic will then reflect that , in spite of the futurists , a man may , without going to the old extremes prescribed by some eighteenth-century critics , follow certain immortal models .

		The wary critic will remember that
Milton	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	PERSON	, and Chaucer unblushingly did just this .

		And he will perhaps come to the conclusion that some of our modern artists have confused new - ness with originality .

		He will , in fine , observe that few supreme artists have cared much whether what they sought to do had been done before , but rather they have trembled with convictions that flamed out from the midst of their groping comrades like the fierce jet of a huge forge in a grim city at night .

		One other comment that was once thought an easy truism will be uttered less sweepingly when we have pondered this new prose and reread the poems , namely , the old jeer at
Thompson	ORGANIZATION	's diction .

		In this matter , too , since
1894	DATE	,
Thompson	PERSON	has been attacked for archa - isms , coinages , and sacerdotalisms .

		Without the assistance of an Academy of wiseacres , Anglo-Saxondom has always contrived to be ponderously suspicious of archaisms , even when these have been drawn almost straight from a
Cynewulfian Northumbria	LOCATION	or an
Alfredian Wessex	ORGANIZATION	.

		As for Latinisms anathema !

		lam inclined to think that if the dream of an En - glish
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, a dream indulged in from at least the days of old
Spratt	PERSON	, the biographer of
Cowley	ORGANIZATION	, to the days of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's great essay , were to come true , this
Academy	ORGANIZATION	would know enough to take the opposite view from the French Academy , which , for the sake of its tran - quil and silvery and softly musical language , is judiciously cautious : this English Academy would , I believe , be very tolerant of archaisms in our restless oceanic language .

		After many years spent in the study of
Edmund Spenser	PERSON	, who has been a storm-centre on this matter from
1579	DATE	to
1914	DATE	, I find much solace in murmur - ing to myself the words of shrewd old
Thomas Fuller	PERSON	on the poet 's poet : `` And though some blame his Writings for the many Chaucerisms used by him , yet to the Learned they are known not to be blemishes but rather beauties to his Book . ''

		Archaisms and coinages generally go together , see Spenser and
Milton	PERSON	.

		We should be a little less tolerant of coinages than of archaisms .

		And of course we must remember always the rules of
Horace	LOCATION	, which are perfectly sound and quite invaluable and absolutely im - possible .

		Our multifarious , questing English language will pause over these rules occasion - ally , just long enough to keep from going mad ; but our language is , unlike all other
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	institutions , absolutely without stolidity .

		As for the sacerdotalisms , they are often very beautiful when one finds out what they mean .

		Ecclesiastico-mania is doubtless bad enough , but it is a venial sin compared with the vice popular among many of
Thompson	PERSON	's critics , ecclesiastico-phobia .

		I am not averse to read - ing a poet , for a while , with a dictionary at my elbow .

		And as far as
Thompson	PERSON	is concerned , I never read him without resolving to plunder him some day of those same beautiful sacerdo - talisms .

		Finally , now that his prose works and biography are in my hands , I shall be very 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	careful about using the rapier on a man who can weigh his words as nicely as the following passage indicates : '' Of ' nervure ' ; I should not , in a like passage , use cuticle of a flower or leaf : because it is a streaky word its two k sounds and mouse-shrewd u make it like a wire tweaked by a plectrum .

		The u of nervure is not only unaccented , therefore unprominent in sound , but the soft v and u quite alter its effect from that it has when combined with & 's and parchment-tight t 's . ''

		And a friendly critic of
Thompson	PERSON	writes as follows : '' The labour , the art , the studious vocabulary are locked together within the strenuous grasp of the man 's sincerity .

		There is no dissociating , no disintegrating , such poems as these ; and
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's heart beats in the words ' roseal , ' ' cymars , ' ` frore , ' ' amiced , ' ' lamped , ' and so forth . ''

		With these passages in mind I recall an extraordinary sentence in an English essay on
Thompson	PERSON	not yet a year old : '' His thought is conventional , it is the diarrhcetical flux of language which mystifies , which shrieks and hisses by its persistent shock and turgidity , by its linguistic nodes and rugosities . ''

		Imagine the unholy joy with which a provincial English weekly would hail such a sentence from an American !

		Doubtless its writer would ac - cuse me of lacking a sense of humor ; but I must confess that my impresssion is of a little man with a cracked voice trying to roar down his intended victim , in the manner of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, or essaying , with petty irritation , the tremen - dous guffaw of Rabelais .

		Finally ,
Thompson	PERSON	's poems , reread with the prose in our minds and the chapter in the biog - raphy on '' Mysticism and Imagination '' open before us , teach us that it is wrong to accuse
Thompson	PERSON	's thought of conventionality .

		The world is full of mystics to-day .

		There are , first of all , the new-fangled mystical cults founded mainly by honest but rather shallow people , who , having conned the A B C of an attitude older than the oldest forests of
India	LOCATION	, put forward their results as a new religion and draw many equally honest and rather more shallow people in their muddy wake .

		Yet , on the whole , good will come from them .

		Then there is the school celebrated in Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	's masterly volume on `` The Symbolist Movement . ''

		Most of the people of this school are really materialists , but they cover , generally with perfect sincerity , their materialism with a thin and leprous and alluring veil that they call mysticism .

		I believe that some of these people will leave , for all their decadence , works of art that are enduring , but never supreme .


Francis Thompson	PERSON	was a true mystic , and to him a few thinkers will go for many centuries .

		Nor will they who go to him all be Catholics .

		For some of them will be steeped in the philosophy of ancient
India	LOCATION	, and more of them will be Platonists who will know him '' by a secret sign . ''

		But most brotherly of all will be those who can gather out of all of these the perfect flowers of wisdom .

		They will know
Thompson	PERSON	's faults better than any other critics have known them ; but , quite naturally , they will choose to be silent .

		SOUTH AMERICAN WILDS .

		* As a veteran explorer , Mr.
A. Henry Savage Landor	PERSON	needs no introduction to the reader of works on travel .

		Since his thrilling experiences in Thibet sixteen years ago , he has penetrated supposedly inaccessible parts of
Persia	LOCATION	, Afghan - istan , and
Africa	LOCATION	; yet it is doubtful if the account of any of his past achievements can approach in variety of incident or perils encoun - tered the narrative of his journey just completed through the wildest portion of
South America	LOCATION	.

		A detailed account of Mr.
Savage Lander	PERSON	's latest explorations would obviously fall outside the scope of this review ; yet some indication may be given of the magnitude of his task and of the results attained .

		In all , the author travelled over thirteen thousand miles in
South America	LOCATION	, and of this enormous distance some five thousand miles were through regions in
Brazil	LOCATION	hitherto either unknown or but little explored .

		His itinerary led him from
Rio de Janeiro	ORGANIZATION	, & a general northwesterly direction , through the interior states of
Goyaz	LOCATION	,
Matto Grosso	PERSON	, and Amazonas , regions watered by the great rivers
Xingu	LOCATION	,
Tapajoz	LOCATION	, and
Madeira	LOCATION	.

		The object of the expedition was to study the geography and geology of this vast area , much of it uncharted ; to learn something definite about the Indians of central
Brazil	LOCATION	; and to investigate the economic resources of a territory still largely unexploited .

		From the first , the journey was fraught with hardships and peril .

		It was found all but im - possible to persuade anyone in
Brazil	LOCATION	to embark on the expedition ; and as a last resort the author was forced to employ , at ridiculously high wages , six ex-convicts as his companions .

		The journey begun with such unfavorable aus - pices repeatedly threatened to end in disaster .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 103 Again and again Mr.
Savage Landor	PERSON	had to quell a mutiny , and on several occasions his life was in imminent danger .

		But even more re - markable than the successive escapes from his followers was his triumph over natural obstacles .

		His original intention was to pass through the very heart of
Brazil	LOCATION	, riding from the terminus of the railway in
Minas Geraes	LOCATION	to
Manaos	LOCATION	, the capital of Amazonas , a distance of between three and four thousand miles .

		But after eight hundred miles had been traversed he discovered that his worthless companions , in order to force him to retrace his steps , had thrown away most of his large stock of provisions .

		To escape starvation , the party made a detour to the south , and reached the ancient settlement of Diamantino , the last frontier post of civiliza - tion in central
Brazil	LOCATION	.

		With what supplies he could purchase , Mr.
Savage Landor	PERSON	now deter - mined to descend from its source the great
Tapajos River	LOCATION	, one of the most powerful tribu - taries of the
Amazon	LOCATION	.

		The account of the journey down the hitherto unexplored portions of this stream is thrilling in the highest degree .

		Perilous waterfalls , treacherous whirlpools , deadly rapids , `` in comparison with which those of Niagara are child 's play , '' taxed the skill and endurance of the party to the utmost .

		At times they were even obliged to drag the two-thousand-pound canoe over low mountain ranges , after blazing a trail through the native forest .

		The last stage of Mr.
Savage Lander	PERSON	's explo - rations in
Brazil	LOCATION	not only surpassed in hardship and suffering everything that had preceded , but seemed fated to end in tragedy .

		Since the canoe , by this time unserviceable , had to be abandoned at a government station , the author heroically insisted on pushing forward on foot , through the unexplored region between Tapajos and
Madeira Rivers	ORGANIZATION	.

		But again his plans were balked by the perfidy of his followers .

		Sup - plies intended to last many months were sur - reptitiously destroyed , until at length the little party , entirely cut off from civilization , passed sixteen days practically without food .

		Further attempts to cut a path through the forest were impossible owing to the weakness of the men ; escape by water seemed out of the question , as the native timbers were all too heavy to float .

		The ingenious expedient by which Mr.
Savage Landor	PERSON	succeeded in rescuing himself and his companions from this frightful impasse may best be described in his own words : '' We felt in such a plight that we lay helpless upon the floor of the hut , quite unable to move , so exhausted were we .

		In turning my head around I discovered tea large demijohns , some two and one-half feet high and about two feet in diameter , of thick green glass .

		They were the usual demijohns garajfons , as they were called used all over
Brazil	LOCATION	for ' fire-water . '

		I at once conceived the idea of using them as floats in the construction of a raft . ''

		My men grinned contemptuously at the idea when I mentioned it to them .

		They said that all was over .

		It was no use trying to get away .

		The Almighty wanted us to die , and we must only lie there and await our end , which was not far off .

		Benedicto struggled to his knees and prayed to the Almighty and the Virgin , sobbing bitterly all the time . ''

		I struggled up on my feet and proceeded to carry the big vessels to the river bank , where I intended to construct the raft .

		The effort to take each heavy bottle those few metres seemed almost beyond me in my ex - hausted state .

		At last I proceeded to strip the floor of the hut , which had been made with split assahy palms , in order that I might make a frame to which I could fasten the bottles .

		With a great deal of persuasion I got Filippe and
Benedicto	PERSON	to help me .

		The long pieces of assahy were too heavy for our purpose , and we had the additional trouble of splitting each piece into four .

		It was most trying work in our worn-out condition .

		Then we had to go into the forest and collect some small liane so that we could tie the pieces together , as we had no nails and no rope . ''

		The lassitude with which we did our work , and tore down part of the hut in order to build that raft , our only way of salvation , was too pitiful to watch .

		We abso - lutely had no strength at all .

		When we pulled the liane to fasten together the different pieces of palm wood , we were more exhausted than if we had lifted a weight of 200 pounds .

		As it was , we could not fasten the pieces of wood properly , and when the raft was fin - ished it was indeed a shaky affair . ''

		On this unstable craft the starving men con - trived to drift down stream , until they found food and safety in the camp of a rubber collect - ing expedition .

		The remaining experiences of the author , though highly interesting , were in no wise unique .

		He ascended the
Amazon	LOCATION	to its source , crossed the Andes by a little-travelled route , traversed the highlands of
Peru	LOCATION	and
Bolivia	LOCATION	, and finally returned to
Europe	LOCATION	via
Santiago	LOCATION	and
Buenos Aires	ORGANIZATION	.

		It would be a grave injustice to Mr.
Savage Landor	PERSON	to assume that he has written merely a chronicle of adventure .

		From the standpoint of science alone , his work is a storehouse of results and discoveries of real importance , par - ticularly in the field of ethnology .

		Hitherto little-known Indian tribes , especially the Boro - ros , inhabiting the interior of
Matto Grosso	PERSON	, were carefully studied , and elaborate vocabula - ries were prepared of their language .

		At the same time our knowledge of the geology and geography of
Central Brazil	LOCATION	has been materially increased through the author 's methodical and 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	tireless observations .

		Even the account of the vast economic possibilities of this virgin terri - tory makes fascinating reading .

		In fact , so highly did the Brazilian government value the results of this expedition , that it honored Mr.
Savage Landor	PERSON	with a grant of four thousand dollars .

		In all details of the bookmaker 's art , these two handsome volumes leave little to be desired .

		Several of the author 's own wonderful color studies are reproduced , while the two hundred excellent illustrations from photographs enable the reader to follow the party throughout every stage of its remarkable journey .

		SALEM IN ITS HABIT AS IT LIVED .

		* | More than fifty years ago ,
George Nichols	PERSON	, of Salem , then eighty years old , dictated his autobiography to his daughter ,
Lydia Ropes Nichols	PERSON	.

		Now Miss
Martha Nichols	PERSON	publishes her grandfather 's recollections under the title , ''
George Nichols	PERSON	,
Salein Shipmaster	PERSON	and Mer - chant . ''

		The autobiography is an account at first hand of Salem shipping at
the turn of the eighteenth century	DATE	, when the ships of Salem were known in all the great ports of the world .


George Nichols	PERSON	was born
July 4 , 1778	DATE	, in what is now the oldest brick house in
Salem	LOCATION	, in
Derby	LOCATION	street near the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	.

		When about a year old his father moved to Ports - mouth ,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, and the recollections tell an entertaining story of schoolboy life in that old town .

		It began at `` not more than two years of age , when I was sent to an old woman named
Molly Shaw	PERSON	, and my cradle was sent with me . ''

		Another dame school was fol - lowed by two boys ' schools , which he remem - bered chiefly as places where he was cruelly flogged and learned nothing .

		Naturally he preferred to drive the cow to pasture , to feed the pigs , or to work in the garden .

		Various pranks recall
Tom Bailey	PERSON	, the classic bad boy of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.

		On one occasion when the schoolmaster caught his younger brother ,
Icha	PERSON	- bod , by the ear , `` pulling it very violently , ''
George	PERSON	says he could hardly refrain from throw - ing a large Bible he had in his hand at the master 's head .

		He did not throw the
Bible	LOCATION	, but he cried out in school , `` You are a set of fools altogether . ''

		By
Martha Nichols	PERSON	.

		Salem :
The Salem Press Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		the lad under the influence of
Benjamin Abbott	PERSON	, to whom he says he owed much of his success in life .


Benjamin Abbott	PERSON	was a great teacher , who conducted
Phillips Exeter	ORGANIZATION	for fifty years .

		Some of his boys were
Daniel Webster	PERSON	,
Edward Everett	PERSON	,
Jared Sparks	PERSON	, and
George Bancroft	PERSON	.

		At thirteen
George Nichols	PERSON	became a clerk in his father 's grocery store , and his school days were over .

		In
1793	DATE	, the father ,
Ichabod Nichols	PERSON	, returned to Salem and went into the shipping business .

		An experience of a year or so as a shipping clerk whetted the boy 's wish `` to see the world , '' and in his seventeenth year he made his first voyage , to
Copenhagen	LOCATION	and
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	.

		The most interesting part of the autobi - ography is the account of nine voyages made between
1795	DATE	and
1803	DATE	, eight years full of work and adventure for the young sailor , who rose rapidly from joint super-cargo to be master of his own ship , the `` Active . ''

		Captain
Nichols	PERSON	's business notes throw light on economic condi - tions in the first quarter-century of the Republic .

		The Salem shipping masters were international carriers ; they built ships and manned them , and fetched and carried goods wherever they found profitable markets .

		An American cargo was usually tobacco , sugar , and coffee .

		Captain
Nichols	PERSON	made one coast-wise voyage to
Virginia	LOCATION	, for tobacco to carry to the north of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		But
Virginia	LOCATION	did not furnish all the tobacco of American cargoes , for the year before ,
1797	DATE	, he went to
Alexandria	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	, for flour and tobacco , which he sold in the Isle of
France	LOCATION	, and bought sugar and coffee to carry back to Salem .

		On another voyage he took tobacco , sugar , and coffee to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, and brought back from
Russia	LOCATION	hemp , iron , and manufactures .

		In
1802	DATE	, he sailed to
Sumatra	LOCATION	for a cargo of pepper , which he sold in
Manila	LOCATION	, and bought sugar and indigo .

		Sailing for
Falmouth	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, he went to Lon - don , where he learned that
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	were on the verge of war .

		He sailed at once for
Rotterdam	LOCATION	, and there cannily waited three weeks until war was declared , when he sold his cargo at an advance of fifty per cent on peace prices .

		In
December , 1799	DATE	, Captain
Nichols	PERSON	set sail in the ship `` Active '' on what he describes as '' one of the greatest voyages , considering all the circumstances , ever made by a Salem vessel . ''

		He carried about 115,000 in specie to
Bombay	LOCATION	to buy cotton , which he took to
London	LOCATION	and sold to the
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	at more than three hundred per cent profit .

		Reloading in
London	LOCATION	, he went back to
Madras	LOCATION	with a cargo of English 1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 105 goods and some
$ 40,000	MONEY	in specie .

		He re - turned to Salem in
1801	DATE	, after an absence of about twenty months , with bills of exchange on
Boston	LOCATION	for
$ 65,000	MONEY	, together with bills of lading for a cargo worth
$ 10,000	MONEY	.

		He was twenty - three years old in that year .

		The old sea captain 's interests were mainly of a business character , but we get a glimpse of
London	LOCATION	in
1800	DATE	.

		It is the
London	LOCATION	of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, who was then a clerk in the service of the
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		One evening Captain
Nichols	PERSON	went to see
George Frederick Cooke	PERSON	play Shylock at `` the Covent Garden Theatre , where I saw the Royal family
George the Third	PERSON	, his wife and two or three daughters ; one of whom ,
Princess Elizabeth	PERSON	, was very handsome , reminding me very much of Dolly Tread well . ''

		Another
London	LOCATION	experience is of interest to those who happen to own a Tobias watch .

		Telling his `` watch story , '' Captain
Nichols	PERSON	relates : `` My next watch adventure was in
London	LOCATION	, where I had a gold watch made by one
Tobias	PERSON	, a Jew , very much thought of by Americans , but an unprincipled man .

		It cost me
$ 120	MONEY	. ''

		There is a certain Tobias watch that has been keeping time in one family for nearly sixty years .

		It came into the family in part payment of a debt , so that it has an earlier and unknown history .

		It was carried in a soldier 's pocket through the Civil War .

		It went around the world and told time for the
U. S. Transit of Venus	ORGANIZATION	expedition in 1874-5 .

		It now keeps up with the intricacies of a college schedule .

		A high principled watch , surely !

		When the War of
1812	DATE	broke out , Captain
Nichols	PERSON	says he was worth
$ 40,000	MONEY	and was `` quite a rich man for those times . ''

		One of the results of that war was the decline of the port of Salem , brought about by the loss of its ships to British privateers .

		The experience of Captain
Nichols	PERSON	illustrates how effectually
England	LOCATION	drove American commerce off the high seas .

		Every ship in which he was inter - ested was captured .

		Salem never recovered its commercial leadership .

		In
1826	DATE	, both
George Nichols	PERSON	and his father-in-law became bankrupt .

		He had married , in
1801	DATE	, his cousin ,
Sally Peirce	PERSON	, daughter of
Jerathmiel Peirce	PERSON	, also a shipping master , and grandfather of
Benja	LOCATION	- min
Peirce	PERSON	, the mathematician .

		The marriage took place '' in my Father
Peirce	PERSON	's great eastern room .

		Sally 's dress was a beautiful striped muslin , very delicate , made in
Bombay	LOCATION	for some distinguished person .

		I purchased it of
Nasser Vanji	PERSON	, at
five dollars	MONEY	per yard .

		This muslin
Sally	PERSON	wore over white silk .

		Her head-dress was a white lace veil put on turban fashion .

		Her cake , of which she had a great quantity , was made in a great bread tray by
Nellie Masury	PERSON	, a sister of the late Deacon Punchard . ''


Nasser Vanji	PERSON	was a Parsee , of
Bombay	LOCATION	.

		The Parsees are described as '' some of the most intelligent people I have ever known , rich and very honor - able in their dealings .

		The merchant ,
Nasser Vanji Monackjee	PERSON	, was a very fine man . ''

		A charming story illustrates the character of
Sally Peirce Nichols	PERSON	. ''

		I shall never forgot the beautiful smile upon my wife 's countenance when I told her I was bankrupt .

		She said : ' Is that all ?

		I feared from your manner that you had something dreadful to communicate . ' ''


Sally Peirce Nichols	PERSON	inherited the house built in
1782	DATE	by her father ,
Jerathmiel Peirce	PERSON	, and designed by
Samuel Mclntyre	PERSON	.

		This house , with its hospitable gateway and door , its beau - ful hall , handsome drawing-room , and terraced garden behind , is one of the finest and best - preserved colonial houses in
New England	LOCATION	.

		At the close of his well-told story , Captain
Nichols	PERSON	says , with some pride , that he could recall the names of all the men who had ever sailed with him , both before and after he was master , and the names of all the persons with whom he did business abroad .

		To this good memory , we owe the preservation of the follow - ing old ballad , which was sung by one of the sailors from '' down east '' to cheer the men when the ship was becalmed : SWEET WILLIAM . ''

		Sweet
William	PERSON	, he married a wife ,
Gentle Jenny	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, To be the sweet comfort of his life , As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . '

		Jenny could n't card , nor
Jenny	PERSON	could n't spin ,
Gentle Jenny	ORGANIZATION	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, For fear of hurting her gay gold ring , As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		Jenny could n't brew , nor
Jenny	PERSON	could n't bake , Gentle
Jennie	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, For fear of soiling her white apron tape , As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		Jenny could n't into the kitchen to go , Gentle
Jenny	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, For fear of hurting her high-heeled shoe , As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		Sweet
William	PERSON	came whistling in from plaow ,
Gentle Jenny	LOCATION	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, And , ' Oh , my dear wife , is my dinner ready , naow ? '

		As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		She called him a dirty , paltry whelp , Gentle
Jenny	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, If you want any dinner , go get it yourself , ' As the dew flies over the mulberry tree .

		106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	'' Then to the sheepfold quickly he did go ,
Gentle Jenny	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, And out a fat wether from there did pull , As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		Then down on his knees he began for to stick ,
Gentle Jenny	ORGANIZATION	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, And from the sheep 's back the skin did strip , As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		He laid the skin upon his wife 's back ,
Gentle Jenny	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, And with a good stick he went whicketty whack , As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . '' '

		I '11 tell me fayther and all me kin , ' Gentle
Jenny	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, How still the quarrel you 've begun , ' As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . '

		You may tell your fayther and all your kin , ' Gentle
Jenny	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, ' How I have thrashed my fat wether 's skin , ' As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		Sweet
William	PERSON	came whistling in from plaow ,
Gentle Jenny	LOCATION	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, And ' Oh , my dear wife , is my dinner ready naow ? '

		As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		She drew her table and spread her board ,
Gentle Jenny	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, And ' Oh , my dear husband , ' was every word , As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		And now they live free from all care and all strife ,
Gentle Jenny	PERSON	, cried
Rose Marie	PERSON	, And now she makes
William	PERSON	a very good wife , As the dew flies over the mulberry tree . ''

		This sailor 's song is an American variant of `` The Wife Wrapt in Wether 's Skin , '' No. 277 of
Francis J. Child	PERSON	's `` English and Scottish Ballads , '' there described as a ballad based on the old Tudor prose tale of the '' Wife Lapped in
Morrel	LOCATION	's Skin . ''

		The American song is clearly derived from extant Scottish versions , one of which is called '' Sweet
Robin	PERSON	. ''

		I may add that Captain
Nichols	PERSON	not only remembered the words of his sailor 's song , but he could sing it .

		One of the choicest gems of my collection of American ballads and songs is the quaint eighteenth century melody of '' Sweet William . ''

		MARY
AUGUSTA SCOTT	ORGANIZATION	.

		HERR
HERMAN BEHR	PERSON	, a German-American , has de - voted his leisure hours to the translation into German of choice specimens of English poetry , and now publishes the result -LRB- together with some pieces of his own -RRB- in a vol - ume called ''
Perlen Englischer Dichtung	PERSON	in Deutscher Fassung . ''

		Some of the pieces from
Shelley	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	, in particular , are very beautifully done , and the volume shows once more how finely receptive the German lan - guage is of the poems of other tongues .

		A NEW HISTORY OF
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* It is necessary to rewrite the history of a people at intervals , not only in order to bring the record of its achievements nearer to the present , but also in order to present any modi - fication in point of view which a more critical examination of the sources of information may afford .

		Moreover , a restatement of the facts and conclusions of historical compositions be - longing to a decade or more in the past is called for by changes that have taken place in the vocabulary and forms of expression of the lan - guage .

		New terms and new connotations of old terms make a rephrasing of the events of the past desirable from time to time , in order that their significance may fit with greater freedom the changes in the consciousness of the popular mind .

		In some measure all of these considerations justify the appearance of Mr.
Arthur D. Innes	PERSON	's new History of
England	LOCATION	.

		Like its classic predecessor by
J. R. Green	PERSON	, this volume of a thousand pages is not a text-book in the ordi - nary sense .

		It is designed for those who , out - side the restrictions of the school , love to read the history of a great people for what it shows of human achievement and for what it inspires by its portraiture of a great national spirit .

		Mr.
Innes	PERSON	very appropriately recognizes
Green	ORGANIZATION	's '' Short History '' as '' incomparable in its kind . ''

		With this judgment most readers will agree .

		Green possessed , beyond the endowment of most professional historians , the literary talent .

		His personal correspondence , like that of a Lowell or a
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	, is charged with the elan of a true man of letters .

		His story of the English , expanding under the impulse of their native Teutonic energy , is so sympathetically human that it touches the springs of apprecia - tion even in those who are accustomed to regard history as dry .

		Green , too , stands alone in his expression of the feeling that the development of their literature has been a part of the life history of the English people as inevitable and characteristic as their religion and politics .

		Mr.
Innes	PERSON	's aim has been different from
Green	ORGANIZATION	's both in method and treatment .

		His purpose has been to write the history of the British nation , not the life of the English peo - ple .

		Green wrote his history in ten chapters , concluding his story proper with the defeat of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	at
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 107 paragraphs he carries the narrative hurriedly forward to
1873	DATE	.

		Mr.
Innes	PERSON	, apparently for very logical reasons , handles the history of the nation under a division of seven books .

		The subject of Book I. is `` Nation Making , '' and ex - tends the narrative as far as
1272	DATE	, a period which
Green	ORGANIZATION	covers in his first three chapters .

		Roman
Britain	LOCATION	, which
Green	ORGANIZATION	incidentally notices in three paragraphs , occupies the first five pages of Mr.
Innes	PERSON	's work .

		His treatment of events culminating in
Magna Charta	LOCATION	and the subse - quent contest between
Henry III	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Simon de Montfort	PERSON	prepares the reader for Book II. , on `` National Consolidation . ''

		The period of the Tudors , which
Green	ORGANIZATION	interprets in two fine chapters on `` The New Monarchy '' and `` The Reformation , '' is the theme of Mr.
Innes	PERSON	's third book , a period which he regards as `` The Age of Transition . ''

		The weakness and retro - gression of the two reigns between
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		and
Elizabeth	PERSON	are presented under the title of `` In Deep Waters . ''

		Book IV .

		embraces the seventeenth century controversy between the Puritans and the
Stuart	PERSON	faction , the story of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, and the reign of
William III	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chapter XIX. , entitled '' Nemesis , '' is one of the most spirited in the book .

		Under three divisions , playfully christened ''
Quern	PERSON	Deus vult perdere , '' `` Prius dementat , '' and `` Fulfilment , '' we are told of the incapacity , the fatuity , and the over - throw of James II .

		In Book V. the author moves forward to the consideration of '' The British Em - pire . ''

		Great events are blended with great per - sonalities .

		Marlborough inherits the foreign policy of
William III	ORGANIZATION	.

		;
Walpole	LOCATION	, the '' inevitable minister , '' develops his `` system '' of managing for twenty years the parliamentary constituen - cies ;
Clive	PERSON	and Dupleix fight out the English and French conflict for the control of
India	LOCATION	;
Pitt	PERSON	supports an alliance with
Frederick the Great	PERSON	and wins
New France	LOCATION	;
George III	ORGANIZATION	.

		and his Tory supporters triumph over the Whig sym - pathizers of
Burke	PERSON	and
Chatham	LOCATION	and split off the
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	from the Empire .

		The author 's account of this last event , though lack - ing the philosophic vision with which
Green	ORGANIZATION	views the American revolt , probably states the case of the contest with fairness of judgment .

		Speaking of the situation precipitated by the British defeat at
Saratoga	LOCATION	, he says : '' There was nothing in itself irretrievable about the disaster .

		A
Chatham	LOCATION	, bent on a vigorous prosecution of the war , would have found troops and officers numer - ous and capable enough to vanquish the Americans in the field in the simple duel .

		But after Saratoga the war ceased to be a duel .

		It became a struggle between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and a group of combatants who joined together for her destruction .

		She had sown the wind in the long years of incompetent and wrong-headed admin - istration ; now she was to reap the whirlwind .

		The Peace of
Paris	LOCATION	had left her with no friend in
Europe	LOCATION	and with one implacable foe .

		That foe ,
France	LOCATION	, ... desired nothing better than an opportunity of striking a blow at the rival who had defeated her . ''

		The author approaches the '' Era of Revolu - tions , '' in Book VI. , by a clear exposition of the economic and social reforms which
William Pitt	PERSON	sought to introduce .

		England was the first State of
Europe	LOCATION	to become receptive to liberal ideas of taxation and reciprocal trade benefits .


Adam Smith	PERSON	had shown that taxation operates to restrain trade ; that , therefore , taxation should be imposed exclusively for revenue .

		In the face of an enormous war debt ,
Pitt	PERSON	, as prime minister , had the courage to propose the sur - render of the age-old policy of heavy trade re - strictions , and trust to the theory of lowered duties as a means of replenishing the impover - ished finances of the country .

		English inventive genius was displacing the old domestic methods of manufacture with the factory system , and
Pitt	PERSON	saw that
England	LOCATION	might greatly profit by the cultivation , through milder duties , of a foreign market for her machine-made goods . ''

		The passing of the old ideas of commercial policy was illustrated when
Pitt	PERSON	negotiated a commercial treaty with
France	LOCATION	in
1786	DATE	.

		Each country had hitherto fol - lowed a policy of excluding the other 's goods .

		No one since
1713	DATE	had attempted in practice to traverse that principle ... Fox denounced the treaty on the ground that
France	LOCATION	, our hereditary foe , would profit by it .

		A few years later Fox was less ready to denounce our hereditary foe .

		The French denounced the treaty because they profited by it a good deal less than the British . ''


Pitt	PERSON	, the pioneer of free trade , was thwarted in his plans for fiscal and political reform by the exigency of war .

		It was reserved to
William Huskinson	PERSON	, another disciple of
Adam Smith	PERSON	, to press upon the nation the application of free trade principles .

		His `` Reciprocity of Duties Act , '' in
1823	DATE	, led within six years to the con - clusion of as many as fifteen reciprocity treaties with foreign countries , and the old Navigation laws were doomed .

		Huskinson stimulated En - glish manufactures and the national wealth by beginning the admission of raw material at greatly reduced duties .

		The policy of free trade , completed by the budgets of Mr.
Glad	PERSON	- stone in
1860	DATE	, has maintained itself as English tariff orthodoxy ever since .

		The only serious challenge it has received was the proposal of
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	, in
1903	DATE	, to stimulate im - perial consolidation by means of a preferential market for colonial goods , a proposal that was not approved at the polls , and has not succeeded 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	in making a serious place for itself in party politics .

		Mr.
Innes	PERSON	's exposition of British political parties is straightforward and lucid : '' Modern party terminology makes it difficult to employ necessary words and phrases without conveying misapprehension .

		Two great parties have appropriated to themselves respectively the complimentary epithets of Liberal and Conservative , although there is no sort of opposition between Conservatism and Liberalism .

		Leaders of the Liberal party have been men of essen - tially conservative mind ; leaders of the Conservative party have been men of the broadest sympathies . ''

		This is a good characterization .

		The genius of British party politics lies in the historic balance of agreement that remains after all party dif - ferences have been given their proper weight .

		Canning , as the author points out , a disciple of
Pitt	PERSON	and
Burke	PERSON	, opposed parliamentary reform to the end of his life .

		Peel 's early conservatism gradually developed into the most liberal sym - pathies , culminating in his complete conversion to free trade and the ultimate fusion of the Peelites with the Liberal party .

		This evolu - tionary spirit of British political life is likewise illustrated by the career of
Peel	ORGANIZATION	's great disciple ,
Gladstone	PERSON	, who is thus characterized : '' Like his master ,
Peel	PERSON	, he spent his life in assimi - lating one after another ideas to which he had at first been strongly antagonistic .

		His weakness lay in that excessive subtlety which made it very easy for him to persuade himself that what he had come to regard as morally right was demonstrably expedient , and that what he realized as expedient was warranted by the highest moral sanctions .

		... It will always be recog - nized that he imported into politics an insistence upon the doctrine that the highest morality is always the highest expediency , which has given him a unique position among the practical politicians of history . ''

		Mr.
Innes	PERSON	incorporates within his narrative fairly adequate accounts of the progress of the several British colonies , of
Canada	LOCATION	and
South Africa	LOCATION	in particular .

		The recent development of
Australia	LOCATION	and
New Zealand	LOCATION	is scarcely noticed .

		His readers will be pleased with the short but well-written chapters on the industrial advance of the English people .

		For the success of this phase of the work the appearance of the author 's excellent little book on ``
England	LOCATION	's Industrial Development '' a year ago was a sufficient guar - antee .

		Unlike Green , he is not uniformly sat - isfactory in his sections which deal with the progress of
England	LOCATION	's literature .

		His remarks on English writers are not so interesting as
Gardiner	PERSON	's .

		His best characterization is that of Chaucer ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	should have had a more adequate treatment .

		Tennyson is given a short but fairly representative critical estimate .

		Browning is merely mentioned as
Tennyson	PERSON	's rival , who had to wait many years for `` popular recognition . ''

		An Epilogue gives an outline of parliamentary enactments up to
1911	DATE	.

		The reader is given a very satisfactory notion of the present tendencies of British social politics under the lead of Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	and Premier
Asquith	PERSON	.

		In its wealth of illustrations this new history of the British surpasses any of its predecessors .

		These illustrations are well chosen for their purpose of deepening the impression of contem - porary life and events .

		The author maintains a uniformity of style , which is that of a discrim - inating historical student whose object is to pre - sent the story of those events that make up the best part of British history , without any attempt to adorn the story .

		The nearness of events which it includes , as well as its modern tone , will make the book a welcome addition to the library of the general reader .


L. E. ROBINSON	PERSON	.

		A DIPLOMATIST 'S WIFE IN
ITALY	LOCATION	.

		* Mrs.
Hugh Fraser	PERSON	is as passionately in love with
Rome	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, where her early life was passed , as was her brother , the late
Francis Marion Crawford	PERSON	; and , like him , she knows how to write with understanding and an infec - tious enthusiasm about the
Eternal City	LOCATION	, its history and legends , its storied haunts and its perennial charm .

		In her latest work , '' Italian Yesterdays , '' issued in two generous volumes , she continues and amplifies the early memories partly rehearsed in her `` Reminiscences of a Diplomatist 's Wife , '' and interweaves there - with a good deal of ancient and mediaeval and modern history and tradition .

		In fact , these interwoven threads of historic research make up considerably more of the total fabric than does the warp of personal reminiscence for which the reader is inclined to search with espe - cial eagerness .

		One follows with keener interest her stories of childhood , her accounts of things seen , her impressions of
Rome	LOCATION	and its environs , than her sketch of the founding of the city -LRB- '' on that memorable 21st of
April	DATE	, 754 B. c. '' our schoolbooks used to give the date as 753 -RRB- , her dissertation on the deities of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, her chapter on the last days of the apostles , her epitome of the life of
St. Gregory	LOCATION	, or even her entertaining pages on Queen
Joan	PERSON	of
Naples	LOCATION	.

New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 109 word , and if this space - filling matter , rather good of its sort , to be sure , did not compose the bulk of the book .

		Even a subject so seemingly remote from Mrs.
Eraser	PERSON	's own `` yesterdays '' as the Man in the Iron Mask is dragged in and made to furnish substance for two chapters , while the
Bravi	PERSON	of
Venice	LOCATION	, picturesque person - ages , it is true , supply material for another .

		But as long as these miscellaneous topics interest our author , we are willing to renew our own interest in them under the impulse of their attractiveness to her and the freshness of her manner of handling them .

		As in her immediately preceding book , so in this there is occasional interesting mention of her gifted brother , and in all such mention her admiration and sisterly adoration of him are manifest .

		The story of his acquisition of the castle of
San Nicola	LOCATION	, on the rocky coast of
Calabria	LOCATION	, where many of his novels were writ - ten , is told at some length and with details not lacking in local color .

		The purchase seems to have been made on the spur of the moment and with little computation of the property 's real value in money ; for , as the narrator says of her brother , he `` could never resist the call of fortressed solitudes . ''

		The conclusion of the whole affair is thus put into a single paragraph : `` To tell the truth it was not the money side of the matter which distressed my sister-in-law so much as the prospect of being required to come and pass weeks at a time in this grim dungeon , without a single convenience of life , twelve miles from a market town , and of course lashed to the battlements by every
Mediterranean	LOCATION	storm .

		It took her some days to reconcile herself to the new acquisition poor girl but
Marion	PERSON	had not made a mistake , after all .

		The family was not invited to
San Nicola	LOCATION	till he had made several journeys thither himself , with carpenters and materials , and when they did come they found that the lonely keep had been transformed internally to a quite possible dwelling though certainly an inconveniently isolated one .

		Generally , however , he went there alone , to rest from everything connected with modern life , and he found it a fine , quiet place for writing , at any rate . ''

		Mrs.
Eraser	PERSON	knows her
Italy	LOCATION	from
Piedmont	LOCATION	to
Apulia	LOCATION	, and her pictures of its people and their varying characteristics in different regions show her to be an observing traveller .

		The following is worth quoting in this connection . ''

		As one travels southward the character of the people changes , and in the later years of my life I have felt more at home with my fellow-beings of the South than with the inhabitants of
Romagna	LOCATION	.

		Their outlook is simpler , more indulgent , and their religious faith far more fervent .

		I think the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	custom of going on pilgrimages was a very valuable one to the contadini of the ' Regno . '

		It used to be rare to find middle-aged people of the labouring class in the province , who had not travelled a little in that way and thus learnt that the world was not confined to their own small town or hamlet .

		I - suppose the good custom will die out in time , like so many others , but it will not suffer much diminution while such wonderful new centres of attrac - tion
spring	DATE	up as , for instance , the ' Santuario ' of
New Pompeii	LOCATION	, which I described in a former book -LSB- '
Remi	PERSON	- niscences of a Diplomatist 's Wife ' -RSB- .

		But many an un - forgotten shrine in the remote hills has , like La Men - torana in the
Sabines	LOCATION	, its one day or night of glory in the year , when the peasants come in great bands , even from far away , and the chants and litanies go up all night long in and around some dim old Church .

		Such a festival takes place at
San Salvatore	LOCATION	in the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	, in the late
summer	DATE	, and is the scene of a great gather - ing of the people of the
Penisola Sarrcutina	LOCATION	. ''

		As will have been surmised from the fore - going , the religious faith of the Italian people , their Church and all it means to them , fail not to impress Mrs.
Eraser	PERSON	.

		In a passing reference to her own spiritual experience , she says : '' I remember writing to the great French Prelate who received me into the Church , that I felt like a beggar suddenly admitted into the palace of his King , dazzled with the warmth and splen - dour , yet utterly ignorant of which way to turn or how to comport himself in those
august	DATE	sur - roundings . ''

		She regrets that '' so many , indeed , are utterly unconscious that there is anything to know beyond the few distorted facts doled out in non-Catholic schools , that even the most un - assuming effort to share these riches with them may be useful and welcome . ''

		It is evident , then , in spite of a little lack of clearness in her mode of expression , that the writer is in the proper mental attitude to receive and to transmit to her sympathetic readers the impression of the mys - tery , the charm , '' the holy glory , '' as she words it , of
Catholic Rome	LOCATION	.

		In her backward glance at the life of '' our blessed
Pius IX.	PERSON	, '' she dwells with fondness on his kindness and generosity to the poor , and is pleased to believe that `` justice had nothing to blush for in the
Rome	LOCATION	of those days , and the poor could obtain it as promptly and easily as the rich . ''

		Here is a little anecdote of that blissful period : '' One day the Holy Father , walking in the
Quirinal Gardens	LOCATION	, passed a sentry on duty .

		The man silently held out a loaf of bread for his inspection .

		Pius took it , examined it , and asked one question , Do you always get bread as bad as this ? ' '

		Always ,
Santo Padre	ORGANIZATION	, ' was the reply .

		A sudden descent on the Commissariat de - partment showed that he had spoken the truth .

		When the sun rose again the cheating commissary was repent - ing of his sins in prison .

		There is a beautifully practical side to autocratic government ! ''

		As a further example of the writer 's style in summoning up the past for our instruction or entertainment , or both , we quote a passage from her chapter on ``
Naples	LOCATION	under Murat '' : '' For
Naples	LOCATION	was gay in those days .

		People saw light 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	ahead after the years of gloom .

		Hunger had vanished ; real hunger , at any rate .

		The King 's public works gave employment .

		Uniforms glittered everywhere .

		To their minds ,
Naples	LOCATION	was a
Paris	LOCATION	in miniature , so the lights shone and the world danced and played on , music lay over the place in a rainbow web of sound , and the blue sea smiled at the stars . ''

		Rather for her pages of personal experience than for her divagations into various eras of the Italian past do we , as already indicated , value Mrs.
Fraser	PERSON	's book .

		As the wife of a diplomat subject to transfer at any time from one quarter of the globe to another , she has seen much of the world and the world 's celebrities , and when she writes of her past she seldom fails to command the reader 's attention .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		XEW STUDIES OF THE MONROE DOCTRINE .

		* The recent revival of interest in the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine has called into existence two noteworthy contributions to the literature of this , the oldest and most cherished of our foreign policies .

		The first of these , Professor
Hiram Bingham	PERSON	's '' The
Monroe	PERSON	Doctrine : An Obsolete Shibboleth , '' is a vigorous attack upon a traditional policy which President
Cleveland	LOCATION	once declared in his
Venezuela	LOCATION	message to be `` important to our peace and safety as a nation and essential to the integrity of our free institutions and the tranquil maintenance of our distinctive form of government . ''

		As the result of a long and careful study of Latin - American conditions , both from reading and extensive travel , Mr.
Bingham	PERSON	has reached the conclusion that the
United States	LOCATION	has out - grown the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine , and should therefore abandon its principles .

		After a brief description of the origin and early applications of this doc - trine as a legitimate means of protection against European aggression and land hunger , the author turns his attention to what he calls the '' new
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine . ''

		The application of the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine to the Venezuelan boundary dispute , the frequent acts of interference in the domestic quarrels of South American republics , the receivership in
San Domingo	LOCATION	, the coup d'etat in
Panama	LOCATION	, and the Lodge Resolution of
1912	DATE	, are cited as examples of the extent to which the doctrine has been enlarged beyond its original intent and purpose to mean a policy of interven - * THE MONROE DOCTRINE : An Obsolete Shibboleth .

		tion and interference , and also as showing the degree to which Latin - Americans are justified in regarding this policy as an attempt of the
United States	LOCATION	to establish a suzerainty over the Western hemisphere .

		Professor
Bingham	PERSON	emphasizes with striking clearness the fact that
Argentina	LOCATION	,
Brazil	LOCATION	, and
Chile	LOCATION	have within the past decade experienced a remarkable economic and political growth , the importance of which is realized by few citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Consequently , these powers are no longer in need of our `` patronizing we-will-protect-you-from -
Europe	LOCATION	attitude '' ; a feeling of deep resentment and ill-concealed antagonism has been aroused among the Latin Americans ; while the leading countries of
South America	LOCATION	'' are already on the road toward a kind of triple alliance with the definite object of opposing the encroachments of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Perhaps the most effective argument for the abandonment of this `` anti- quated policy '' is that it places a great respon - sibility upon the
United States	LOCATION	, and of necessity involves a disregard for the most generally ac - cepted rules of international law .

		By letting it be known to
Europe	LOCATION	that we will not permit any interference in American affairs , our government virtually assumes all the responsibility , and be - comes the international policeman for the Latin part of the Western hemisphere .

		Adherence to this '' obsolete shibboleth '' is likewise a draw - back to American commerce , for international trade is largely a matter of sentiment , and it is difficult to sell goods to those who distrust and dislike you .

		Finally , from the standpoint of the world 's peace and happiness , and for the advancement of civilization in the
New World	LOCATION	, the policy of the
United States	LOCATION	should be one of cooperation , rather than of tutelage and inter - vention .

		With the abandonment of the
Monroe	PERSON	doc - trine , Professor
Bingham	PERSON	suggests that the
United States	LOCATION	should take every possible step to assure the South Americans of our friendship and goodwill ; and that for the preservation of order and for protection against European ag - gressiveness , the policy of the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine should give way to a settlement of these common matters by a congress of leading American powers .

		Professor
Bingham	PERSON	has spent much time on the
Southern Continent	ORGANIZATION	, and he has made a careful study of Latin-American gov - ernments and peoples .

		For this reason he is peculiarly well fitted to set forth the ideas of those American citizens who are coming to feel that there is little justification for the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine , at least in its present form .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL ill The second contribution is a treatise entitled `` Die
Monroe Doktrin	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
Herbert Kraus	PERSON	, a German scholar who prosecuted his studies at
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	and whose work is dedi - cated to Professor
J. B. Moore	PERSON	, now Counsellor of the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		This treatise is the most comprehensive , scientific , and schol - arly study that has ever been made of the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine , and is an excellent example of what German patience and scholarship can accomplish .

		It is somewhat singular , if not dis - creditable to American scholarship , that the most careful study dealing with the greatest of Amer - ican foreign policies should have been done by a foreigner .

		Most American studies of the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine have either been of a popular character or they have dealt with particular phases of the subject .

		This is the first treatise which deals with the historical development of the policy from its beginnings during
Washington	LOCATION	's administra - tion to its latest application by the Lodge Resolution of
1912	DATE	in regard to
Magdalena Bay	LOCATION	, and which considers the subject in all its bearings and ramifications .

		The chapter on '' The
Monroe	PERSON	Doctrine of the Present '' contains a keen analysis of the meaning of the policy ; and the discussion of the relation of the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine to international law presents it in a light in which Americans do not often see it .

		The whole work shows abundant evidence that the author has consulted an enormous mass of documentary materials , and the bibliograph - ical apparatus which he furnishes will be a valuable guide for the use of students .

		The name of the author ,
Sir W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, is enough to ensure the quality of the book at the outset , and repeated borings into the literary mine never fail to bring up rich ore .

		Among themes wisely and wittily treated are the sub - ject of biography , the centenary of
Emerson	PERSON	and the secret of
Emerson	LOCATION	, memories of
Meredith	LOCATION	, the ques - tion whether
Thackeray	PERSON	was a cynic , the conversa - tion of

Trevelyan	PERSON	's `` Macaulay , ''

Morley	PERSON	's ''

		He throws out
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's `` Life of Sterling '' because `` it deals with a hopelessly second-rate man '' ; but the imper - ishable charm of the biography remains unaffected by
Sterling	ORGANIZATION	's failure to achieve greatness , while on the other hand not even
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's commanding genius can make us overlook
Froude	PERSON	's misleading and often deliberately false presentation of the mate - rials of his biography .

		Gravy , such as
Dickens	PERSON	knew so well how to provide , thick and savoury , Sir
Rob	PERSON	- ertson
Nicoll	PERSON	regrets to find furnished too scantily by modern authors , though he praises some of them for being at the same time never unctuous and never dry and wooden .

		There is a rich store of good read - ing , especially for bookmen , in these '' Bookman 's Letters , '' a few of which , it should be added , are from other sources than the above-named .

		Quebec and its people .

		Mr.
Beckles Willson	PERSON	, already the author of several readable books on various phases of Canadian life or history , now gives us an account of `` Quebec : The Laurentian Province '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The book is dis - tinctly devoted to
Quebec	LOCATION	and its people of to-day , and in the main may be accepted as a reasonably accurate statement of the life and problems of the French province .

		As with most other writers on the subject , Mr.
Willson	PERSON	pauses on the threshold to mar - vel at the fecundity of the French - Canadians , who began their career as an isolated community within the British Empire in
1763	DATE	with a population of 69,000 souls , and solely by natural increase have expanded to a total of 1,600,000 within the province , and at least half a million more outside
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		Surely the French-Canadians are a people after
Colonel Roosevelt	PERSON	's own heart !

		One notices an occa - sional mistake in the book , such as the confusion between the Governor-General of
Canada	LOCATION	per se and what is known as the Governor-General-in-Council .

		The Lieutenant-Governor of
Quebec	LOCATION	, and the judges of the superior , district , and county courts , are not appointed by the Governor-General , as stated on page 5 , but by the Governor-General-in-Council .

		The Governor-General , as the
King	PERSON	's representative , has no more power of appointment , beyond his own house - hold , than the
King	ORGANIZATION	possesses in
England	LOCATION	.

		When he signs the commission of a provincial governor or a judge he does it , theoretically on the advice of his cabinet , but practically merely as their figurehead , and in that sense he is spoken of as the Governor - General-in-Council .

		The point is an important one , as it involves the vital question of self-government in
Canada	LOCATION	, very generally misunderstood outside the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.

		The actual head of the government in
Canada	LOCATION	is not the Governor-General , but the Prime Minister .

		For all practical purposes
Canada	LOCATION	is an independent nation , with a Prime Minister as her 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	ruler .

		Mr.
Willson	PERSON	also , in his anxiety to deal im - partially with the extremely delicate point of the relations between French and English in the Prov - ince of
Quebec	LOCATION	, contradicts himself , and scarcely does justice to the attitude of the English minority .

		Apart from these points , however , the book is a fair and satisfactory treatment of the subject .

		Mr.
Lewis Leopold	PERSON	, a new writer , has aV made a specially fortunate choice of subject .

		The conception of his book on `` Prestige '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is itself a deserving act of the creative imagination in realizing that the theme is worthy of a volume , presumably the only volume bearing this title .

		The sub-title is '' A Psychological Study of Social Estimates . ''

		The work is most un - evenly written , its fundamental difficulty being the absence of a sufficiently definite plan of procedure and an equal absence of the fundamental descriptive data upon which the interpretation depends .

		Ac - cordingly the work is maintained on too abstract a level , and without the knitting of chapter to chapter necessary to the unity of texture of a complex pro- duct .

		In considering the economic values of prestige , the author more nearly meets these requirements than elsewhere .

		No chapter is devoid of suggestive principles and clever applications , though frequently marred by irrelevant matter and by the statement of conclusions without relations to their supporting premises .

		Despite this discursive and in a measure disconnected method of presentation , the general impression of the volume carries a distinct appre - ciation of the theme in its manifold relations .

		The fact that prestige represents a psychic asset ; that it seems to be one of the first creations of primitive society , where , indeed , it was often maintained with a drastic severity ; that in course of time it takes on an elaboration of pomp and ceremony ; that it fur - nishes the central motive to social ambition ; that it keeps apart class and class ; that it plays an enormous role in the development of the diplomacy of nations and in the narrower diplomacy of family affiliations ; that it finds other expressions in hero-worship and in fields so different as those of love and of religion , of economics and of reputation , of credit and even of crime , all these aspects serve to round out the conception of the comprehensive influences for which the word stands .

		It is interesting to recall that the etymology of the word points back to the conjuring type of imposition in which appearance replaces reality .

		That prestige may be utilized to govern by pretence in the absence of the usual qualities whose reward it represents , is not the least suggestive principle in its psychology .

New York	LOCATION	`` Times '' on the occasion of her third visit to this country , in the
autumn of 1912	DATE	.

		It makes a good companion volume to Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's ' `` Your
United States	LOCATION	, '' neither book being likely to generate head-aches by reason of excessive seriousne & s or depth of thought .

		Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	's amiable manner is somewhat of the slap - dash , exaggerative , popularly effective variety , with occasional resort to that rather cheap appeal to the eye which consists in excessive subdivision of the page into paragraphs .

		Americans in gen - eral and Americans in particular , as seen in
New York	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and
Washington	LOCATION	, furnish matter for the bulk of her volume , and her disposi - tion to be pleased with whatever and whomsoever she encounters endears her to the cis-Atlantic reader .

		It is gratifying to be assured by her that `` American voices are improving , '' that `` in another generation that old twang will have entirely disap - peared , '' and that `` many of the modern American voices are charming . ''

		And it is wholesome to read her ridicule of the American
Sunday	DATE	newspaper , even though she does go to excess in asserting that `` if one bought three of them at a railway sta - tion today , it would require a wheelbarrow to trundle them along the platform . ''

		Four things struck her particularly in
Chicago	LOCATION	, `` its size , its women 's clubs , its stockyards , and its grime . ''

		But she calls the city `` cultured
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' and praises especially the Art Institute .

		For
Boston	LOCATION	, too , she has a good word , but she goes astray in representing it as `` built on piles like
Chicago	LOCATION	'' ;
Back Bay	LOCATION	is not all of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Many illustrations accompany her lively narrative .

		was one o f ^ ne remarkable political movements of the nineteenth century ; and the late Professor
Sidgwick	PERSON	once predicted that we would see a further extension of the system in
Europe	LOCATION	, where it has already gained a foothold in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		It was the opinion of
John Fiske	PERSON	that it was the only kind of government which , according to modern ideas , is applicable to a whole continent .

		Already it embraces a portion of the globe equal to three times the area of
Europe	LOCATION	, and is now to be found in one form or another in Ger - many ,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, various Latin-American coun - tries , the
United States	LOCATION	, the Dominion of
Canada	LOCATION	,
South Africa	LOCATION	, and
Australia	LOCATION	.

		In a work entitled `` The Federal Systems of the
United States	LOCATION	and the British Empire '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Arthur P. Poley	PERSON	, an English barrister , has attempted to give an account of the federal systems of the four countries last mentioned , and to point out the ele - ments of difference and resemblance which distin - guish each from the others .

		His sketch of the American government embraces more than one - third of his treatise ; and while it is not without value , it can not be regarded as authoritative .

		The author falls into many errors , as foreign students of our institutions frequently do .

		He detects striking THE DIAL 113 resemblances between our federal system and some of the Greek federations of ancient times , and thinks that the '' Federalist '' affords evidence that the framers of our constitution were consciously affected by the Greek experiments .

		Of more value to American students are his chapters on the
Cana	LOCATION	- dian , Australian , and South African federal sys - tems , although tliese chapters too are more or less sketchy and elementary .

		He bestows high praise upon the Australian Constitution , which he char - acterizes as a work of the greatest skill , and which more than any of the other English federations is modelled upon that of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		That greatest of arts , the art of life , counsel on can never be too much written about the art of life .

		ty those who understand its difficul - ties and problems .

		Hence the never-failing time - liness of such books of ripe reflection and wise counsel as the volume by Miss
Agnes Edwards	PERSON	entitled `` Our Common Road '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This universal highway is viewed in a fourfold aspect , as leading '' to the fountain of joy , '' '' to the house of friendship , '' `` to gray hills and green , '' and `` to the land of reflection . ''

		Under these headings the matter is grouped in subordinate sections , each with its appropriate caption .

		Anyone ought to get benefit from pondering the following : `` Critics tell us that the purest art is that which moves within the strictest limitations .

		Too many advantages may be the greatest of disadvantages , and difficul - ties may prove blessings .

		If you spend your life looking for favorable circumstances , you will have no life to live when you find them .

		But if you give your life generously and nobly through whatever channel is opened , you will be a success .

		For success lies in endeavor as much as in achiev - ing . ''

		Good advice on tact and presence of mind is to be found in the writer 's well-considered pages .

		One way not to show tact is thus illustrated : '' The well-intentioned woman who remarked at a dinner that she had always heard that twins were not so bright as other people , experienced a most painful moment when her right-hand neighbor gravely turned his eyes upon her and said with unmistak - able clearness : ' I am a twin . ' ''

		As the writer remarks , `` the only person who can save the situa - tion is the person whom it hits . ''

		Despite the questionable aptness of this metaphor , the style of the book is generally excellent , and it is a pleasure to commend it .

		_ A sketch of sense ^ a P ast ^ 8 rapidly finding psychological expression in the literature of psy - history .

		chology .

		Within a single year two handbooks surveying its history have been trans - lated from the German ; and a third work is now added in Dr.
James Mark Baldwin	PERSON	's `` History of Psychology '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , comprising two small vol - umes of a series devoted to the history of the sciences .

		Locke forms the point of division between the vol - umes devoted to ancient and to modern psychology respectively .

		The treatment has many points of merit , and better represents the perspective of inter - est in the line of thought central to English-speaking students than either of the translated works of
Klemm	PERSON	or Dessoir .

		Had the work been designated as a his - tory of psychological theory it would have deserved a fuller commendation than can be extended to it as an account of the story of the science of the mind .

		Frankly reviewed in the former aspect , it succeeds in setting forth an illuminating conception of the growth from a primitive accounting in terms of animistic conceptions , to the rationalized scientific statement of problems and the development of methods for their solution .

		The course enters sev - eral stages and emerges from them with the diffi - culties attending schools and theories , entangled with vital views of ethics , philosophy , and religion . ''

		Subjective and Objective , '' '' Spiritual and Mate - rial , '' `` Faculties and Processes , '' these are some of the titles suggesting the emphasis of view and of explanation .

		The science of the soul loses the soul and regains it in altered form , the most compre - hensive transformation being that affected by the introduction of the evolutionary conception .

		As a brief and readable guide to this domain , Dr.
Bald	PERSON	- win 's work will meet the needs of the student .

		It is weakened by the selection of points of emphasis according to the special interests of the writer , and by an irrelevant insistence upon the novelty of the positions taken .

		Its field is the philosophical aspect of psychological theory .

		While including the more strictly psychological problems , the exposition does not make these problems central or at times even vital .

Newfoundland	LOCATION	Caribou '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		For several summers Mr.
Dugmore	PERSON	has stalked these majestic beasts in the forests and uplands of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, creeping into their most secret haunts and recording their form and action on the sensitive plate of the camera .

		The photographs , over seventy in number , are a revelation of the suc - cess attainable by skill and indomitable patience in the rare sport of hunting with the camera .

		They are also valuable contributions to natural history , for they portray without exaggeration , omission , or prej - udice the details of appearance and form , the nat - ural habitat , and the normal attitudes and poses of these handsome animals .

		There is plenty of life and action in many of the pictures , for not infre - quently the photograph could only be taken as the startled beasts were dashing away .

		The prize photograph records a battle royal between two well - matched fighting stags .

		The author deals rather fully with the scientific aspects of his subject , recording with fine discrimination many observations on the life and habits of the caribou , in especial the peculiar but very limited migrations which , in common with their more widely ranging relatives of the great 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	Barren Grounds of the north , they regularly carry out each recurring
spring	DATE	and autumn , on the island of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		The camper and sportsman will find practical suggestions for his use , and a digest of the game laws for his warning and guidance .

		A good map , numerous sketches , and a well-constructed index add to the usefulness of the book .

		A classic of the early
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The heroic death in battle of Theo - dore
Winthrop	LOCATION	, in the bright promise of his early manhood , imparts a romantic interest to his writings , among which his narrative of northwestern adventure , entitled by him `` Klalam and Klickatat , '' but re-named by his publishers `` The Canoe and the Saddle , '' is not the least important , being indeed comparable with
Parkman	PERSON	's `` Oregon Trail '' as a picture of native life and primitive conditions in what was then an almost untrodden wilderness .

		This work , with its Indian name restored as sub-title , is now re-issued in elaborate illustrated and annotated form by Mr.
John H. Williams	PERSON	, of
Tacoma	LOCATION	.

		As both editor and publisher , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	deserves high credit for the diligence and study he has put into the work , securing for its enrichment the author 's western journal and letters -LRB- the former never before made public , the latter now first published in full -RRB- , and getting camera views and old prints and some fine colored illustrations to add to the book 's attractive - ness .

		Winthrop 's narrative , which appeared half a century ago , and , after running through a number of editions in the next thirty years , has now for some time been out of print , is republished in its original form , save for a few corrections of typo - graphical and other minor errors , and fills about three-quarters of Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's octavo volume ; the journal and letters , under the heading ''
Cali	PERSON	- fornia and the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, '' occupying , with some notable appended matter , the remaining quarter .

		In its handsome binding , with vellum back and the
Winthrop	PERSON	coat of arms on the cover , this greatly enriched re-issue of a noteworthy book makes an impressive appearance , and must be accounted a work of no small importance .

		A new man y years ago the American development public joined in a universal smile over the assertion of a life insurance magnate that the business which he represented was essentially a form of philanthropy .

		We refused to pay serious attention to the assertion , not because of any intrinsic absurdity discernible in it , but because the magnate had waxed inordinately fat in the prac - tice of his chosen philanthropy .

		After all , it is only a survival of asceticism that leads us to assume that there is a necessary connection between the love of man and emaciation .

		If the life insurance business is philanthropy in a new form , the life insurance agent is a new kind of ethical teacher .

		Few of us have recognized him in this character ; yet have we not felt , upon his approach , much as a wicked king of
Israel	LOCATION	must have felt upon the approach of an inspired prophet ?

		Our troubled souls should have given us the clue to his true nature .

		The matter is now made clear in a passage in Professor
W. F. Gephart	PERSON	's `` Insurance and the State '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- : `` The individual -LSB- any one of us -RSB- must be solicited , either to inform him what his duty is or to persuade him to do his known duty . ''

		This looks like a `` Thou Shalt , '' put in the impersonal form of a German police regulation .

		The object of Professor
Gephart	PERSON	's book is not , of course , the exposition of the ethical character of the insurance business .

		What the author seeks to do is to point out the advantages and dis - advantages of
State	ORGANIZATION	interference in the various fields of insurance , either through regulation or through direct conduct of the business .

		The reading of this judicious little book will leave one with no foolish enthusiasm for any particular form of insurance , whether public or private , but with a resolute zeal for insurance in general .

		As for the position of the author himself , he might safely have offered a reward to anyone who should be able to determine it with precision .

		_ Everything that contributes to a bet - ter understanding of the art of an - cient
Egypt	LOCATION	is to be heartily welcomed by all students of antiquity .

		Sir
Gaston Maspero	PERSON	's '' Egyptian Art '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- gathers up that savant 's essays `` written during a period of more than thirty years , and published at intervals of varying lengths . ''

		They were never intended for the eye of experts , but for the general public .

		Twenty-five such papers , most of them brief , compose the volume ; and each is descriptive of one or more pieces of Egyptian sculpture or other art-work here reproduced in superb half-tone plates .

		Such a compilation of course lacks the element of unity , and some of the material is repeated in two or more chapters .

		The real contribution which the author wishes to make is to prove that the art of
Egypt	LOCATION	was not one unique type , identical from one end of the valley to the other , but that there were a half-dozen local schools , each with its own traditions and its own principles and methods , though divided into several studios .

		For some years Sir
Gaston	PERSON	has advanced this hy - pothesis ; and , with the multiplicity of new finds , is slowly proving the truth of his theory .

		The most prolific sources of his illustrations are the Museum of
Cairo	LOCATION	, of which he is the head , and the
Louvre	LOCATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Though in no sense a new work , the author has so marshalled his material as to make it both cumulative in force and attractive in form .

		Northern
Italy	LOCATION	has won the homage ara of manv Devoted hearts ; but few of her lovers are so eloquent and so zealous as Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	.

		In his latest volume he carries the reader to some two score sites within the picturesque and storied field suggested by the title , `` The Cities of Romagna and the Marches '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Naturally the interest is not uniform throughout , and only the most faithful can be ex - pected to follow Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's footsteps into every
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 115 church and share his pleasure before every painting ; but , on the whole , the book is delightful .

		The Introduction assumes the form of a human-hearted tale about the untutored people of a remote moun - tain hamlet who took a wandering painter for the `` Signore '' ; and particularly about a child who hated him because his second coming meant the burning and spoiling of all that was dear to the childish heart .

		And in the rest of the book , despite dutiful cata - loguing of shrines and pictures , the author himself obviously finds his deepest joy in the hearts of the people , in the human aspects of their history and faring , in the charm of hill and sea and sky .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	is not afraid to see with his own eyes , and one is very thankful for the trait ; but the present reviewer would give something to know why such an ardent lover of art fails even to mention the superb
Athena	ORGANIZATION	at
Bologna	LOCATION	, which is worth a score of the things he eulogizes , indeed , it is one of the world 's joys .

		But why should one seem to desire a quarrel with a book one is glad to recommend ?

		There are twelve pleasing illustrations in color , and a goodly number in monotone , as well as a sensible map .

M. Anatole France	PERSON	, and is enriched with the names of many other celebrities met with and more or less intimately known by the writer in the course of her professional travels on two conti - nents .

		The story of her accidental discovery of her peculiar talent is interesting , and the account she gives of her de * but in
New York	LOCATION	as a dancer is char - acteristic .

		`` When the audience discovered , '' she tells us , `` that the new dancer was its old favourite comedian , the little soubrette of a former day , it gave me an ovation such as , I suppose , never another human being has received . ''

		Miss Fuller 's artless ex - ultation in her terpsichorean triumphs adds vivacity and charm to her narrative , which is one of the most eventful and entertaining of its kind .

		Pictures of the dancer in various professional poses , with other appropriate illustrations , are supplied in abundance .

		Mrs.
Anne C. E. Allinson	PERSON	's '' Roads from
Rome	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a very successful application of the informed imagination to certain personalities of Roman literature and phases of Roman civilization .

		If the title has any special justification it is that these sketches reveal the connecting pathways by which constant traits of human character have passed from the ancient Roman environment to that of the present day .

		Lucretius and
Virgil	PERSON	,
Catullus	LOCATION	,
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Propertius	PERSON	, and the younger Pliny are the more prominent characters brought upon the stage , and the words put into their mouths prove Mrs.
Allinson	PERSON	's thorough acquaintance with their writings and her delicate appreciation of their respective mental and moral traits .

		We may add that no special knowledge of Roman history or literature is required to make the book intelligible .

		One of the last pieces of work done by
William Foster Apthorp	PERSON	, who died a few months ago , was to edit for the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	a selection of `` Forty Songs by
Adolph Jensen	PERSON	'' -LRB- 1837-1880 -RRB- , the volume now appearing in the '' Musicians ' Library . ''


Jensen	PERSON	's work is well deserving of this mark of appreciation , since he stands very close to
Schumann	LOCATION	,
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	, and Franz among the masters of German song .

		Mr.
Apthorp	PERSON	's introductory essay is mainly biographical , and leans somewhat heavily upon
Niggli	PERSON	's book on
Jensen	PERSON	.

		The editor has taken the liberty of altering two of the compositions to make them fit the English words of the Scott lyrics which the composer used in a German translation .

		Long ago it seemed as though
Canon Rawnsley	PERSON	, in his succession of volumes on the English Lakes , had exhausted nearly every possible aspect of the subject .

		But apparently some odds and ends still remained over , and these are utilized in his latest book , '' Chapters at the English Lakes '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For the most part , these twelve chapters seem of little more than merely local interest .

		An exception , however , must be made in the case of the opening paper , on `` The Life and Death of
John Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' originally delivered as an address on the occasion of the unveiling of a tombstone to the memory of this noble man in
Grasmere	LOCATION	churchyard .

		Several well-reproduced photographs from scenery in the
Lake Country	LOCATION	adorn
Canon Rawnsley	ORGANIZATION	's volume .

		Different places have different moods or tempera - ments , distinguishable to the visitor of fine sensibilities .

		Mr.
Verner Z. Reed	PERSON	even affirms that they have souls , and his book , '' The Soul of
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , seeks to portray this spiritual quality characteristic of the French capital and of other places with which he is familiar .

		Following the chapter that gives its name to the book are eight others , on various haunts of men and solitudes of nature , all treated with a reverent love and a deep sym - pathy that show the author to be no mere holiday tourist turning the jottings of his notebook to literary account .

		Mr.
Ernest Peixotto	PERSON	, whose art needs no appreciative comment from us , illustrates the book with nine beau - tiful drawings .

		Two of Mr.
Reed	PERSON	's chapters have already found favor in `` The Atlantic Monthly '' ; the others are new .

		Franqois-Xavier
Garneau	PERSON	's '' Histoire du
Canada	LOCATION	, '' published for the first time in
1845	DATE	, remains to-day on the whole the best history of the country from the French point of view .

		Garneau 's attitude on some points has not always commended itself to English-Canadian readers , but on the whole he wrote with reasonable impartiality even upon topics which in his day were almost too recent and too instinct with racial feeling to be handled with safety .

		His work covers the history of the country from the earliest times down to the
Union of 1840	ORGANIZATION	.

		It ran through three editions in his own life - time ; a fourth edition appeared in
Montreal	LOCATION	in
1882	DATE	, after his death , the text occupying three volumes , while a fourth was of a memorial character containing tributes to the historian by his friends .

Feb. 16 , 1914	DATE	THE TRUTH ABOUT THE PHILIPPINES JUST PUBLISHED The Hon. DEAN C.
WORCESTER	LOCATION	'S New Book PAST and PRESENT THE PHILIPPINES By
DEAN C. WORCESTER	PERSON	, Secretary of the
Interior	ORGANIZATION	,
Philippine Insular Government	ORGANIZATION	, 1901-1913 , author of `` The Philippine Islands and Their People , '' etc. .

		THIS new book may be justly described as the only really valuable , up-to-date and authoritative work on the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	.

		It is a work that everyone inter - ested in our insular possessions and in the future of our Nation should read , especially as the new administration just appointed has once more brought up sharply the whole question of our policy with regard to the
Philippines	LOCATION	.

		To bring home to the American people the truth as to the situation in the
Phillipines	LOCATION	, is the primary object of the
Hon. Dean C. Worcester	ORGANIZATION	's new book on our
South Pacific Archipelago	LOCATION	, and this work will answer more questions on the subject than any other .

		The
New York	LOCATION	EVENING POST says : '' Timeliness in a double sense adheres to Dean C.
Worcester	LOCATION	's '
The Philippines	LOCATION	. '

		The question of
the Philippines	LOCATION	is undoubtedly one which the
Wilson Adminis	PERSON	- tration will be concerned with when the more pressing problems of domestic legislation and foreign policy are disposed of .

		About the person of Dean
C. Worcester	PERSON	, who is now on the lecture platform in this country , lively controversy has arisen , Mr.
Worcester	PERSON	being at the present moment a most active advocate of the retention of the status quo in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		His knowledge of
the Philippines	LOCATION	goes back more than twenty-five years , to
1887	DATE	, when he was a member of a scientific expedition to the islands .

		He made a second visit in
1890	DATE	.

		From
1899	DATE	to
1901	DATE	he was a member of the
Philippine Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and from
1901	DATE	to
1913	DATE	was Secretary of the Interior to the
Insular Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1899	DATE	he published '' ' The Philippine Islands and Their People . ''

		This , a record of personal observation and experience , with a short summary of the more important facts in the history of the archipelago , has ever since been the acknowl - edged standard work of information concerning the Islands .

		In Mr.
Worcester	PERSON	's valuable new work , past and present conditions are minutely reviewed with regard for strict accuracy of statement .

		The author 's position giving him free access to all the government records , much of the information thus made available has never been before made public .

		With practically unlimited material on which to draw in the way of illustrations , very fine and rare photographs intimately related with the text emphasize the lessons which they are respectively intended to teach .

		The result is a work of the greatest importance as well as of the greatest interest to all concerned as to the future possibilities of
the Philippines	LOCATION	and as to the course the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	should pursue in the interest of the several peoples of the Islands .

		BRIEFER MENTION 150 NOTES 150 LIST OF NEW BOOKS ... 151 THE CINEMATOGRAPH CRAZE .

		An amateur statistician announced the other day that the patronage of the moving picture theatres in
Chicago	LOCATION	numbered three-quarters of a million persons every twenty - four hours .

		This figure was computed by the rather nai 've pro- cess of multiplying the number of seats in all the places which provide this species of enter - tainment by the number of performances given each day , calmly assuming that all the seats were occupied all the time .

		The conclusion may well give us pause , since it means that one-third of the entire population of the city seek this form of recreation every day , or , on the other hand , that every man , woman , and child , on the average , goes to one of these theatres more than twice a week .

		But even when we make a liberal discount , the numbers to which this entertainment appeals must be very large , and the phenomenon which they offer is worthy of serious consideration .

		It is a mushroom growth that has developed almost over night , and we have not yet had time to view it in all its bearings .

		That this new interest is of world - wide extent is obvious to every travelled observer , and is attested by reports from all the countries of the globe .

		The `` cinema '' unalloyed , or shown in connection with vaudeville attachments , affords everywhere one of the most popular means of whiling away a leisure hour at almost any time of day , and attracts , by its cheapness and variety , larger numbers of visitors than can be held by any other form of paid entertainment .

		It is making terrific inroads upon the support of the regular theatre , which is not surprising when we consider that a single seat in the latter costs as much as from twenty to fifty admissions to the former .

		This condition should operate in time to modify the inflated pretensions of the play - houses , and to reduce the grossly unreasonable scale upon which they are now conducted .

		The current charges for dramatic performances , viewed in relation to the quality of the enter - tainment offered , constitute a bare-faced impo - sition upon the public , and any influence tending to abate these demands is to be wel - comed .

		In its social and educational aspects , the moving-picture theatre offers several interesting 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	view-angles , and is a tempting subject for the philosophical observer .

		Without bringing any of the heavy artillery of philosophy to bear upon the subject , certain interesting reflections result from its contemplation .

		It is , in a sense , the culmination of the process of substituting pic - tures for words , of actual images for the images which the stimulated mind creates , which was inaugurated when the photographic illustration began to invade our magazines and to disfigure our newspapers .

		It shows in a very striking way the demoralizing modern tendency to seek lines of least resistance in every form of activity , to convert education into amusement , and work into play , without giving the least thought to the way in which the process softens the mental fibre and saps the character .

		Gen - erally speaking , the picture performs its proper function when it supplements the word , printed or spoken , and perverts its function when it would become a substitute .

		For the picture never can really be a substitute for the word , which is equivalent to calling it a substitute for thought , and the intuitional elements which it supplies to the mental process are a poor exchange for the analytical elements of logical interpretation which reading and listening demand .

		A great deal of nonsense has been written about the moving picture as an educational agency .

		If kept strictly in its place as an ad - junct to the methods that demand application and concentration , it may serve a useful sub - ordinate purpose .

		The historical scene as realized from a close study of the sources may be vivified by this form of dramatic presenta - tion , although the setting and the action are necessarily `` faked . ''

		What the imaginative picture in the school text does for the child may be done for him more realistically by the pro- jection of the film on the screen .

		But all that he will get from it at best is a series of fleeting impressions , and no opportunity is offered him to study the details of scenery and costume and architecture .

		The fleeting impression , however , can never make a serious contribution to the work of education .

		We have seen some highly instructive scientific films , exhibiting the mar - vels of life as revealed by the microscope , or the unfolding of the flower from the bud , or the transformations of the insect from larva to imago , but to view such projections intelligently requires antecedent experience gained in the old plodding way in accordance with the time - schedule of nature .

		When one has this experi - ence already , it becomes interesting to see it epitomized on the magic screen , and one gets a more synthetic conception of the whole process .

		But without such antecedent knowledge , the pictured display is bewildering and inadequate .

		The unnatural character given to these exhibi - tions by the `` speeding-up '' which seems to be necessary robs them of a great part of their usefulness as educational helps .

		For the reproduction of impressions de voyage , the cinematograph has much value .

		By its means , one may become a travelled ob - server with a minimum of effort , and its success is attested by the large use which the travel - lecturers make of it .

		The real traveller , of course , finds his delight in leisurely contempla - tion of the foreign scene , dwelling at length upon its details , and giving the impression time to fix itself upon the memory .

		The arm-chair traveller in the picture play-house can do nothing like this , and can retain but a jumbled recollec - tion of what has been shown him .

		But even such travel is better than none at all , and , be - sides , none of us can go everywhere in the flesh ; so we may well be grateful to those who do the physical part of travelling for us , and entertain us with the records taken by their cameras .

		Those who have seen the films which visualize the story of the Scott Antarctic expedition will realize the extraordinarily valuable service that may be done for us , on occasion , by this marvel of modern mechanical invention .

		Another service that seems to us very valu - able is that of illustrating the masterpieces of literature .

		When this is done in the artistic spirit and with unlimited resources in the way of stage material , it becomes an efficient aid to the imagination .

		If we lose something , we gain a great deal more , when we witness an adequate stage-performance of '' Hamlet '' or ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' and even a cinematograph production of one of these tragedies may help us to read new meanings into the printed text .

		The '' Les Miserables `` films recently exhibited were excep - tionally well made , and gave to the lovers of that masterpiece a better understanding of many of its episodes than they had ever got from even the most sumptuously illustrated edition .

		And the films prepared at such great expense for the illustration of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's '' Inferno '' were , on the whole , of high artistic merit , and proved gratify - ing to the most austere worshippers of the sub - lime Florentine .

		Literature offers a boundless field for this new kind of illustration , and its exploitation , guided by the artistic conscience , may add much to our enjoyment of the great works of fiction and poetry .

		We do not know that ``
Don Quixote	PERSON	'' has been done as yet ,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 131 but what an opportunity it offers for effective staging and characterization !

		The opportunities offered by the moving - picture theatre for ministering to vulgar and depraved tastes are so obvious , and so attested by reports from countries in which license is unchecked , that some sort of censorship is de - manded by the interests of public morality .

		Some form of legal restraint is operative in most of our large cities , whether in the hands of the police , or in those of commissions spe - cially designated for the purpose .

		Censorship as an official institution is never an unmixed good , and is capable of developing into a greater evil than any it seeks to avert , as we have seen in the cases of the English licensing of plays and the Russian treatment of the press .

		The present danger in this country seems to lie in the sort of official stupidity which lays down general rules , and then applies them undevia - tingly in all cases a procedure which would have the ludicrous result of placing Shake - speare 's ''
Julius Cjesar	PERSON	'' under the ban because scenes of violence and murder are in general prohibited .

		We are inclined to think that the lines are drawn somewhat too closely by our committees in charge of this inspection ; in their desire to `` play safe , '' they catch not only the vicious and vulgar in their net but also the merely tragic which , distressing as it may be to view , remains an essential part of life , and must not be left out of the scheme if we are to pre - tend to picture either the history of civilization or the conceptions of the great creative writers .

		Is it not legitimate to throw upon the screen any - thing which may be described in a printed book that is published without legal interference ?

		POETIC EXPRESSION .

		There have recently been published in
England	LOCATION	two single-volume studies of the work of
Algernon Charles Swinburne	PERSON	.

		They are by friendly critics , but both of these realize that
Swinburne	PERSON	is on his defence .

		They make the most of their poet 's un - rivaled legerdemain of syllables and sounds .

		They point out , quite justly , his truth of keeping , by which each poem is , as it were , contained within its own frame .

		This gift would be more valuable if there were not such an unutterable monotony in his pages , if the parts of his poems were not mutually inter - changeable .

		They also claim for him insight into human nature , and creative power .

		To us it seems that his figures , classic or romantic , are mainly affairs of masks and megaphones .

		But when it comes to what for a poet is really the crux of the matter , the business of poetic expression , they both practically throw up the case .

		We do not apologize for quoting somewhat largely what they say so well .

		First let us hear Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	: '' But
Swinburne	PERSON	has almost no magic felicity of words .

		He can astonish and melt , but seldom thrill , and when he does it is not by any felicity , as it were , of God-given words .

		He has to depend on sound and an atmosphere of words which is now and then concentrated and crystallized into an intensity of effect which is almost magical , perhaps never quite magical ... Perhaps the greatest of his triumphs is in keeping up a solemn play of words , not unrelated to the subject suggested by the title and commencement , but more closely related to rhyme , and yet giving in the end a com - pact and powerful expression ... Hardly one verse means anything in particular , hardly one line means anything at all , but nothing is done inconsistent with the opening , noth - ing which the rashest critic would venture to call unavailing in the complete effect . ''

		Mr.
John Drinkwater	PERSON	's judgment is remarkably similar .

		He says of Swinburne : '' His control of language was , indeed , not distinguished by the magic that , although it was within the compass of his peers , was so only at the rarest intervals .

		This wizardry that visited every great poet from say Chaucer down to him of yesterday , was known to each but a few times in his life .

		Those lines of almost inconceivable beauty , lines commoner in
Coleridge	LOCATION	and
Keats	PERSON	than in poets whose collective achieve - ment is greater than theirs , is , when all is said , but an ex - quisite fragment of our poetry .

		They amount to a hundred , a thousand perhaps ; a mere handful in any case .

		It has been the privilege of every great poet to shape a few : Swin - burne made scarcely one , and he loses one of the poet 's rarest if not most commanding distinctions in consequence ... The rarest graces are beyond his reach ; but to the high expression which is poetry , he attains with superb ease . ''

		We have only to question one point in this last criticism , the statement as to the rarity of magical phrase in English poetry .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	in his story entitled '' Wireless '' reduces the really inspired pas - sages of this kind to just two , one by
Coleridge	PERSON	and one by
Keats	PERSON	.

		It would be interesting to know what those poets , who intoxicated themselves with the fine phrases of their predecessors , would have thought of such a judgment .

		Hazlitt declared that
Wordsworth	PERSON	's lines , '' Elysian beauty , melancholy grace , Brought from a pensive though a happy place , '' were the most perfect in the language ; and the same '' Lady of the Lake , Sole sitting by the shores of old Romance , '' was probably the parent stock on which
Keats	PERSON	grafted his double rose of beauty which Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	ad - mires so much .

		The fact is that these flowers or jewels of poetic speech are scattered thickly over all English verse of the better kind .

		They glitter on
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's robe until it seems drenched with dew .

		They gleam from the folds of half of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's dreamy stanzas .

		Allowing for the drama 's necessary recurrence to the conversational tone ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is all compact of them .

		Milton and the lyric poets contain sumless treasures of them .

		If
Swinburne	PERSON	failed to add any - thing of the sort to our literature it will go hard with his pretensions , notwithstanding his noble literary enthusiasm and his undoubted mastery of metre .

		To use words as if they had never been used before , to impart to them a fresh fragrance , an inex - 132 -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	plicable charm , a profundity which makes whole his - tories or extended phenomena implicit in a phrase , that is what is meant by verbal magic .

		It does not need that it should deal only with sensuous things , though doubtless on that side the most miracles of language are wrought .

		The Elizabethan dramatists have the gift , though their sphere is that of action .


Dryden	PERSON	, Pope , and
Goldsmith	PERSON	have it , though their matter lies mainly in the regions of moral abstrac - tions .

		The Cavalier lyrists and
Burns	PERSON	have it , though they deal with the emotions .

		It is hardly worth while to give examples .

		Everyone knows what the best is ; but everyone is always forgetting the face of the true Una of poetry and taking up with some false Duessa .

		So we shall quote a few lines , not from English writers , but from that American poetry of which
Swinburne	PERSON	hardly disguised his contempt .

		Emerson , almost incapable of a complete poem , could write by fits and starts like a divinity .

		Take '' O tenderly the haughty day Fills his blue urn with fire '' ; Or , '' Thou canst not wave thy staff in air , Or dip thy paddle in the lake , But it carves the bow of beauty there And ripples in rhyme the oar forsake . ''

		Poe is all for total effect , yet his words have an almost impossible finish .

		For example , '' Banners yellow , glorious , golden , O'er its roof did float and flow -LRB- This all this was in the olden
Time	ORGANIZATION	long ago -RRB- . ''

		Or this : '' No more no more no more Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree , Or the stricken eagle soar . ''

		Or this , '' In what ethereal dances , By what eternal streams . ''

		Bryant usually gives the weight rather than the lustre of words ; but take this : '' A friendless warfare !

		lingering long Through weary day and weary year ; A wild and many-weaponed throng Hang on thy front , and flank , and rear . ''

		FitzGreene
Halleck	PERSON	's writing at its best is with the best .

		Witness , '' Green be the turf above thee , Friend of my better days !

		None knew thee but to love thee , None named thee but to praise . ''

		Or this , '' Wild roses by the Abbey towers Are gay in their young bud and bloom ; They were born of a race of funeral-flowers That garlanded , in long-gone hours , A templar 's knightly tomb . ''

		Simple words these and simple metres , but they have the indubitable magic that
Swinburne	PERSON	's two critics deny him .

		Yet in the greatest poets this enchanted apparition of words is only the warp of their work ; rhetoric , language raised more or less above the ordinary , is the woof .

		With most verse writers this last is all in all .

		And it can be very good .

		In fact , compared with the other it is what light is to light - ning , or perhaps what daylight is to moonlight .

		Moonlight is more suggestive , lightning more revela - tional than daylight , but we could not stand either of them all the time .

		The trouble is that rhetoric is within the reach of almost anyone who can write at all ; and if the person using it possesses also the gift of musical speech , the ordered movement of verse , he can easily set up for a great poet .

		Swin - burne is the perfect type of the rhetorical poet who lashes commonplace into extravagance and sets it to a music which has something of the obviousness and overwhelming blare of a brass band .

		A tour de force is always impressive , and no one who knows the difficulties overcome will cease to wonder at
Swinburne	LOCATION	's management of metre .

		But the true lovers of poetry will prefer those metrists whose sounds steal upon the ear and win their way to the heart .

		And this rich and lovely music , like that of some velvet-voiced vocalist , some virtuoso on the violin , '' the horns of elf-land faintly blowing , '' is almost always associated with magic of phrase .

		Shelley is perhaps the only great metrist in the language whose high and lovely singing is as a rule not embodied in words equal to its own exquisiteness .

		Milton often crashes out discords ; and
Shakespeare	PERSON	at the height of his expressiveness , in `` Lear '' for example , disdains music and pictured phrase alike , and gives us instant , imminent revelation .

		There is much more to literature , even to poetry , than the extreme wizardry of words , there are the expression of thought , emotion , personality ; the creation of character , the telling of tales , the building-up of artistic wholes .

		All these things can be done with plain business speech or heightened rhetoric .

		And it is often difficult to say where these end and the more mysterious use of language be - gins .

		Most recent critics would decide that
Byron	PERSON	, for example , is solely a rhetorician ; but for our part we think that he , too , is a weaver of spells , though his may be black magic rather than white .

		If verbal magic were only a matter of purple patches , it might be disregarded .

		But purple patches and fine writing belong to rhetoric rather than to verbal magic .

		The supreme mastery over words suffuses a glow over whole works , penetrates character , and influences the presentation of thought .

		It is the thimbleful of coloring matter which makes the blue of the whole sky .

		There is , in truth , an analogy between magical language and the use of color , light , and shade , mere pigment in painting .

		Drawing , form , group - ing , dramatic expression , are the basis , the most necessary things in art ; the glory of color , whereby , as
Hazlitt	PERSON	said of
Velasquez	LOCATION	, things seem to be wished upon the canvas , is comparatively a luxury .

		Sometimes the two powers go together , but less often than the intellectual and sensuous gifts in poetry .

		But in both arts , the force of instant and vivid expression is the rarest and most inspira - tional thing .

		It is the effortless power of divinity , all the rest is mere human labor .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 133 CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE DETECTION OF GENIUS IN EMBRYO has always been admitted to be a difficult thing .

		Our young swans turn out to be geese , and our ugly ducklings prove themselves to have been cygnets in uncouth disguise .

		But perhaps as common a mark of incip - ient genius as any though even here one is liable to deception is an irresistible impulse to do com - mon things in an uncommon way , a deadly hostility to the usual and the conventional .

		Memory recalls the instance of a mathematical genius , a veritable prodigy in the swift solution of rather complicated problems , who , in his boyhood , if asked to cube a number in six figures , would have no recourse to pencil and paper , but after a momentary trance-like stillness would undergo a sort of spasm , and , with certain comical and meaningless movements of head and limbs , would bring to birth the result of his lightning-like calculation , the process of parturition having every appearance of being little short of excruciating .

		Professor
Edmund Kemper Broadus	PERSON	writes with humor and insight on the subject of '' Genius at School '' in the current ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		After acknowledging the disappointing quality of academic success , and the perverse tendency of the self-willed and the lazy to achieve distinction , once in a while , at least , in after life , he goes on to say , among other things : '' And if , in addition to the self-directed spirits who are independent of formal ' schooling , ' and the amiably idle who are indifferent to it , there remains a residuum of the incurably ignorant , not even of these need the seeker despair .

		There is a kind of perfection , an orbicular wholeness about ignorance , sometimes , that is akin to genius itself .

		They are the leaven of the whole lump , in - deed , these indomitable ignoramuses .

		They are the geniuses in the art of getting things wrong .

		The student who said that churches promote the mor - tality of the community , and his fellow who averred that churches are supported by the tribulations of their members , had that vatic quality which savage nations are accustomed to recognize and reverence in the weak-winded . ''

		Nevertheless , neither blunder - ing , however pregnant with unintentional wisdom , nor eccentricity , however astonishing , is a sure sign of genius ; else how easy it were , comparatively speaking , to achieve fame !

		A
BOSTON	LOCATION	PUBLISHER OF HONORED ANTECE - DENTS , reputed for his own just and courteous deal - ings with authors , both American and foreign , and perhaps even more famous as the son of an unusu - ally able and distinguished publisher , died recently in the city of his birth and of his business activity for the greater part of his active life .


Benjamin Holt Ticknor	PERSON	, born
August 3 , 1842	DATE	, was the son of
William Davis Ticknor	PERSON	, who founded the house of
Ticknor & Fields	ORGANIZATION	and was largely instrumental in bringing to public notice and to enduring fame so many of our
New England	LOCATION	authors of the middle of
last century	DATE	.

		In fact , as is maintained by Miss
Caroline Ticknor	PERSON	, daughter of him whose death we here regretfully note , in her late admirable work , ``
Hawthorne	PERSON	and his Publisher , '' the elder
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	acted as publisher to more American and foreign au - thors of celebrity than any one else of his time ; and his honorable and generous dealings with English authors in those piratical days were as unprece - dented as they were appreciated by the beneficiaries .

		Reared in such an atmosphere , and coming , as he must have come , into something like intimate contact with the many noted frequenters of his father 's Old Corner Bookstore , the young Ticknor naturally and properly continued the traditional policy of the house when he rose to prominence in its management , even though the firm name was subject to rather fre - quent and , to an outsider , unaccountable changes .

		From
Ticknor & Fields	ORGANIZATION	it became successively Fields ,
Osgood & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
J. R. Osgood & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Ticknor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and , finally ,
Houghton Mifllin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, but retained the valued services of Mr.
Ticknor	PERSON	until about eight years ago , when he retired on account of ill health .

		The famous authors whom he knew as publisher and friend would make too long a list to enumerate here .

		A PLEA FOR THE QUESTIONNAIRE , that more or less unwelcome inquisitor which is likely to come at any time , and from any quarter , prying into our private or professional or business affairs , is made by `` The Inland Printer '' in its current issue .

		Statistics , repellent though they are in undigested form , may , like the ugly and venomous toad , wear yet a precious jewel in their head .

		Statistics of the book-trade , for instance , or of public libraries , or of newspaper circulation , may serve to indicate a rise in the tide of popular intelligence and general cul - ture , and so rejoice the humanitarian interested in the welfare of the race .

		Straws show the wind 's direction and velocity , and the statisticians of the
Census Bureau	ORGANIZATION	are on the watch for all such aids to a trustworthy determination of the trend of the times .

		But if we shirk the filling-out of the blanks issued by the
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	for the gathering-in of useful information on a multitude of subjects , how can we ever hope to learn with any certainty where we are or in which direction we are moving in the mighty stream of civilization ?

		The Director of the Census has good reason to complain of insufficient zeal on the part of the public in furnishing the information desired by him .

		He says , as quoted by the afore - mentioned monthly : `` One of the principal causes for the delay in the publication of the statistics of manufactures of the
United States	LOCATION	is the difficulty we experience in securing reports from the different establishments .

		At the last census of manufactures , which covered the year
1909	DATE	, all of the establish - ments throughout the country were furnished with blank schedules upon which to make their reports by mail , but there was less than
one per cent	MONEY	of the entire number that made complete reports .

		All of the others were collected by a personal visit of spe - 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	cial agents .

		This field work was not only expensive , but greatly retarded the compilation of the sta - tistics . ''

		A greater readiness of response to the questionnaire would undoubtedly be for the benefit of all concerned .

		t REVIVING A NATIONAL LANGUAGE AND LITERA - TURE that have fallen under the blighting influence of foreign domination can not but be a long and difficult task .

		It is now a century since
Norway	LOCATION	freed herself from
Denmark	LOCATION	and recovered her in - dependence as a separate nation , although dynastic ties held her in political alliance with
Sweden	LOCATION	until
1905	DATE	.

		Four centuries of Danish rule naturally left their mark on the speech of
Norway	LOCATION	, as attested by the present similarity between the spoken and writ - ten language of cultured Norwegians and that of educated
Danes	LOCATION	.

		But the patriotic Norwegian is not inclined to acquiesce in the Danification of his ancient tongue , and in connection with this year 's centennial celebration of the recovery of independ - ence it is proposed to adopt by due process of law a revived Norwegian language as the national and official speech of the kingdom ; and for this purpose the labors of
Ivar Aasen	PERSON	, patriot , philologist , and man of letters , are to be turned to account .

		Sixty years ago
Aasen	PERSON	busied himself with the construc - tion , or reconstruction , of a national language which he called `` Landsmaal , '' going back to the old Norse Sagas for genuine native words , and also having re - course to the dialects of those remoter districts that had successfully resisted the inroads of the Danish tongue .

		According to report , which may be more or less erroneous , the Norwegian speech thus learnedly and painstakingly put together seems , contrary to all precedent , to be meeting with popular favor and to be gaining acceptance , especially in the rural dis - tricts , in songs and sermons , in the mimic life of the stage and in the real life of every day .

		Landsmaal is said to be melodious to the ear , of poetic quality , phonetic in its written form , and not so unlike the printed Danish as to be beyond the comprehension of a scholar familiar with the latter tongue .

		May it not be that
Ireland	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	and
Cornwall	LOCATION	and
Brittany	PERSON	, with who knows how many other dis - languaged regions of the earth , will some day succeed in reviving their obsolete or obsolescent tongues and thus add to the linguistic variety and picturesqueness of the civilized world and the domain of literature ?

		A MAN OF THE PEN AND OF THE SWORD , General
James Grant Wilson	PERSON	, who died on the first of this month , was the son of a poet and publisher ,
William W. Wilson	PERSON	, who brought his family from
Edinburgh	LOCATION	to this country in
1833	DATE	, when
James	PERSON	was one year old , and settled at
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	.

		A partnership in the paternal publishing house failed to satisfy the young man 's ambitions , and he entered journalism , becoming in
1857	DATE	the founder and first editor of the
Chicago	LOCATION	`` Record . ''

		Soon after the outbreak of the Civil War , he was commissioned major of the
Fifteenth Illinois Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	, and ere long became its acting colonel ; served in the
Vicksburg	LOCATION	campaign under Grant , and then , on that general 's advice , accepted the command of the
Fourth U. S. Negro Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	; was for two years aide-de-camp to General Banks ; brevet brigadier-general in
March , 1865	DATE	; resigned from the service
three months later	DATE	, and made his residence in
New York City	LOCATION	, where he occupied himself chiefly in literary work , and in gathering his fine library , until the end of his life .

		Of the score of books written or edited by him , the more important are his biographies of Grant and
Fitz-Greene Halleck	PERSON	, his `` Lives of the Presidents of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' `` Sketches of Illinois Offi - cers , '' `` Thackeray in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' `` Love in Letters , '' `` The World 's Largest Libraries , '' `` Mr. Secretary
Pepys	PERSON	and his Diary , '' ``
Bryant	PERSON	and his Friends , '' `` Sketches of Illustrious Soldiers , '' `` Com - modore
Isaac Hull	PERSON	and the Frigate Constitution , '' `` Appleton 's Cyclopaedia of American Biography , '' the '' Great Commanders '' series ,
Halleck	PERSON	's '' Poems , '' '' Poets and Poetry of
Scotland	LOCATION	, '' '' Memorial History of the City of
New York	LOCATION	, '' and the `` Centennial His - tory of the Diocese of
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Academic honors and society memberships and officerships were con - ferred upon him in abundance .

		He had a wide acquaintance with noted men of letters and other celebrities , and had known with some degree of in - timacy every president from
Lincoln	LOCATION	to the present occupant of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		His books have had a considerable circulation .

		* A MISSIONARY TO THE BOOKLESS in one of the sparsely-settled counties of southeastern
Maryland	LOCATION	is doing a work that merits attention .

		In the current Report of the
Maryland Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	we note , under ''
East Berlin	LOCATION	, '' which is in
Worcester County	LOCATION	: `` Here we have a county library on a small scale , with nine stations throughout the country-side .

		The Friendly Library was established in
October , 1908	DATE	, by Miss
Rozelle P. Handy	PERSON	, who lives about five miles from
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Through the generosity of her friends , she gathered together 500 volumes .

		The library now numbers
1600	DATE	volumes .

		She placed type - written lists at the stores in the neighborhood , with the request that the people make out a list of books wanted .

		The books are kept at Miss Handy 's home in a book - case built in a sheltered corner of the porch .

		Applications for books are made through the stores .

		Miss Handy carries the books to and from the stores , and only in the case of invalids or people too old to go to the store does she deliver the books to the homes .

		There are no fines and fees , and she does not insist that books come back on time -LRB- three weeks being the limit -RRB- , but the books away come in on demand .

		Miss Handy keeps a record , showing just what books each person has read and what persons have read each book .

		As the books are usually read by each member of the family , a book is not sent to a family a second time unless the younger children have grown up and demand it .

		... All her finan - cial help and gifts come from the outside .

		She is
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL fortunate in having many friends interested in the library , and is constantly receiving gifts . ''

		A record for the past year of 2800 circulation -LRB- 400 non-fiction -RRB- among 368 borrowers , is not bad , especially as the total number of readings of all the books sent out far exceeds the circulation figure .

		Here is a chance for those burdened with a superfluity of books or money , or both , to aid in a good work .

		A NEW HONOR FOK PROFESSOR
JOHN BACH McMASTER	PERSON	was conferred in his election , on Feb - ruary 7 , to the presidency of the
Franklin Inn Club	ORGANIZATION	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, in succession to the late Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	.

		Of this club of authors , artists , and publishers , Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	had been president for fourteen years .

		Its membership roll has included such famous Philadelphians as
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, the Shakespearean scholar ; Dr.
Henry Charles Lea	PERSON	, the historian ; Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	, the novelist ; Professor
Schelling	PERSON	, the authority on Elizabethan poetry ; Professor
Cheney	PERSON	, whose his - tory of the Elizabethan period has just been pub - lished ; Professor Lamed , who has elucidated the German influence in
America	LOCATION	; Dr. Keen , the cele - brated surgeon , who as a young man was associated with Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	in the Civil War hospitals of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; Dr.
Gummere	PERSON	, of Haverf ord College ; Ex -
Provost Harrison	PERSON	and
Provost Smith	PERSON	of the Uni - versity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	; Mr.
John Luther Long	PERSON	, the novelist ; Mr.
Francis Rawle	PERSON	, chairman of the committee of the
American Bar Association	ORGANIZATION	; Major - General
James Harrison Wilson	PERSON	, the most distin - guished surviving corps commander of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	armies ; and Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	, artist and writer .

		The
Franklin Inn Club	ORGANIZATION	is to be congratu - lated upon the maintenance of its long-established traditions ensured by Dr.
McMaster	PERSON	's election to the presidency .

		To its quaint
Philadelphia	LOCATION	home , where is preserved an early colonial atmosphere , there are brought almost daily scholars , authors , men of distinction in various fields , from all parts of this country , from
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
South Africa	LOCATION	, the ends of the earth ; and these fortunate guests are likely to find no diminishment in the charm of sur - roundings under the new administration .

		BITS OF BIBLIOTHECAL NEWS , in this preemi - nently bibliothecal age and country , are every day or two claiming our interested attention .

		For example , the
Kansas City Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has re - cently received from an unnamed benefactor the gift of five hundred music-rolls for circulation among card - holders who may wish to borrow them , under the rules governing the lending of books , and to enjoy the tuneful effect of their operation on the mechanical player-piano with which every third or fourth home is now equipped .

		No rag-time pieces are included in these rolls , and none will be ad - mitted to the library or so the librarian is said to have announced .

		In addition to its other activities in educational uplift , who knows but that the library is ere long to become a powerful agency for the elevating and refining of our musical taste ?

		To the already established heads of departments in public libraries shall we not presently see added a custo - dian of music-rolls , equipped with the special knowledge required for the discharge of his impor - tant duties , and energetic in promoting the cause of good music in his community ?

		Another pleas - ing item of news under this general head bring * with it the promise of greatly improved facilities for the circulation of library books among patrons at a distance from the library .

		Congressman
Gillett	PERSON	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	has introduced a bill for the grant - ing of a special mail rate of
one cent	MONEY	a pound on library books to apply to public libraries , school libraries supported by taxation , and , under certain conditions , social , industrial , and trade libraries .

		MRS.
GASKELL	PERSON	'S MANCHESTER HOME , the house at 84
Plymouth Grove	LOCATION	where she did her best literary work and received so many of her literary friends , , including
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and her whose life she was to chronicle in one of the world 's most memorable biographies , has very recently become vacant through the death of Miss
Margaret Gaskell	PERSON	r who with her sister , also deceased , had occupied the house from the time of their mother 's death in
1865	DATE	.

		Naturally enough , the admirers of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	are earnest in advocating the preservation of the house as a
Gaskell Museum	ORGANIZATION	, a repository for such articles of furniture , works of art , books , manuscripts , and other memorials , as are associated with the author of ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' and her friends .

		It has been pro- posed that the city of Manchester buy the property and turn to profitable use a part of the vacant land adjoining the house .

		A shilling admission fee , too , would go far toward making the museum self - supporting .

		But it appears from reports that the city fathers estimate the probable cost of maintenance as prohibitive of the undertaking .

		Surely , now that the
Johnson	PERSON	house in Fleet Street has been rescued and restored by the public spirit and large generosity of one man , Mr.
Cecil B. Harmsworth	PERSON	, the prosper - ous city of Manchester ought not to pull its purse - strings quite so tight when so worthy a cause is in question .

		BAITING THE HOOK TO CATCH THE READER is a. trick that not only publishers and authors and head - line-writers find it necessary to learn , but librarians - also are giving more and more attention to this detail of their profession .

		In a recent issue of `` The Outlook '' Miss
Sarah Comstock	PERSON	writes about `` Byways of Library Work , '' describing some of the devices used to whet the rural appetite for such literary wares as are offered by the county book - wagon and through other agencies of library exten - ion .

		`` I 'm going to the library , '' breathlessly xplained a storm-buffeted lad on his way over the western prairie to the nearest source of supply for iis book - hunger ; `` she -LSB- the librarian -RSB- came an ' tol * me all about '
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	' herself , an ' I 'm going 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	to have it .

		I ai n't froze but one ear yet , an ' I ai n't got but one more to freeze , an ' , anyhow , I 'm goin ' to have that book . ''

		Among other kindred items , the missionary activity of the
Brumback Library of Van Wert County	ORGANIZATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, is described by Miss Comstock with especial reference to the '' traps '' it lays for its readers .

		This notable library and the great work it is doing are soon to be brought to public notice , more fully than heretofore , in a book now in preparation at the hands of the daughter and the son-in-law of the far-sighted and public - spirited founder of the library .

		EIGHT WAYS OF REVIEWING A BOOK , as enumer - ated by Sir
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, are these : first , the ostentatious essay , in which , after two and seven - eighths of the three columns allowed the reviewer have been filled , with more or less irrelevant erudi - tion , he seems suddenly to become aware of the book assigned him for notice , and ends his task with a complimentary sentence in which the convenient phrase `` on the whole '' is pretty certain to occur ; second , the hypercritical review , the review of the expert intent on detecting errors , often of the minutest sort ; third , the man-of-all-work 's review , or the short notice written by the hack of real or supposed encyclopaedic learning who can turn out a presentable article on any book or any subject under the sun ; fourth , the puff , which is familiar to us all ; fifth , the malignant review , which happily is less familiar ; sixth , the honestly enthusiastic review , which is a joy to the publisher and a fountain of life to the author ; seventh , the right kind of review , which is the candid and careful criticism of a com - petent judge ; eighth and last , the personal review , by which is meant `` the review that blends gossip with criticism , '' and that is more likely to please the general reader than any other mode of review yet discovered .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		A DIFFICULTY IN TRANSLATION .

		-LRB- To the - Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		It is interesting to notice instances in which the arly English distinction between the singular and plural forms of the second person pronoun is still observed in modern English .

		Naturally enough , we address God as thou and thee because you would seem familiar and disrespectful .

		The distinction , however , between the formal or respectful you and the affectionate , friendly , superior , or contemptuous thou and thee has been prac - tically done away with in modern English .

		Scholars , of course , are thoroughly acquainted with the frequency and expressiveness of this distinction in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, and even high-school students are able to differentiate clearly the French tu and vous and the German du and Sie .

		But everyone is puzzled when an English equivalent of du or tu is to be given in translation .

		How can one retain the expressiveness of the original if one can translate only by you f How is one to show in English the affectionate familiarity of two friends who , after they have drunk Briiderschaft , address each other as du instead of Sie ?

		Often the use of the familiar thou con - trasted with the formal you is inevitable in translation .

		In Hugo 's `` Laughing Man '' we must translate : `` For Barkilphedro to be ' thee 'd ' and ' thou 'd ' was a suc - cess ; he had aspired to this contemptuous familiarity . ''

		It would be well to show that while Lady Josiana addresses Barkilphedro as thou , he always addresses her , as is due her rank , as you .

		In '' Ninety-Three , '' too ,
Cimourdain	PERSON	discovers that his dearest friend ,
Gawain	PERSON	, has played the traitor . ''

		Accused , '' said he , '' you will stand up . ''

		As Hugo remarks , it is signifi - cant that '' he no longer said ' thee ' and ' thou ' to
Gawain	PERSON	. ''

		Such a distinction in the use of the pronoun , filling as it does a real need , should not be altogether lost : it should at least be preserved in elevated English poetry and prose .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		On page 589 of
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	's '' Every-day Life of Lincoln , '' occurs this statement : `` Scarcely had the horror-stricken audience witnessed the leap and flight of the assassin when a woman 's shriek pierced through the theatre , recalling all eyes to the Presi - dent 's box .

		The scene that ensued is described with singular vividness by the poet
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, who was present . ''

		Now I would ask you to turn to the following state - ment in '' Specimen Days , '' in the collected edition of Whitman 's works published by Putnam -LRB-
1902	DATE	-RRB- under the supervision of the literary executors of the poet , Vol .

		I was home in

		Perhaps some reader of

		I have enjoyed the '' Every-day Life of Lincoln '' so much that I want to have everything veri - fied .

		`` WORTH WHILE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Will you kindly enlighten us of the far West as to the popularity of the phrase '' worth while '' ?

		In the midst of impassioned sermons we learn that life and religion are worth while ; librarians ask patrons to name books that are worth while ; magazines want contrib - utions that are worth while ; professors of literature lec - ture on authors that are worth while .

		Education is worth while ; marriage , feminism , and socialism are worth while .

		So are big business deals , and great engineering projects , and efficiency .

		Truly all these are worthy , good , advantageous , or otherwise ; but why are they all '' worth while '' ?

		NATURAL , HISTORY EAST AND WEST .

		* About thirty-five years ago a collector of plants ascended the
Yangtze River	LOCATION	to the bor - ders of western
China	LOCATION	.

		Finding the natives hostile , he was obliged to return ; but before doing so , he spent a few days examining , as well as he could , the native flora .

		In the course of this work he came across a new and beautiful species of
Primula	LOCATION	, which he knew would be very desirable for cultivation .

		As it was im - possible to get the living plants home , and no ripe seed-capsules were found , he hit upon the expedient of carrying away a sack of earth from the place where the plants were found , hoping that the seeds it probably contained would germinate .

		This plan was perfectly suc - cessful ; and in this manner the Primula obconica , one of our commonest and most ad - mired greenhouse plants of to-day , was secured for horticulture .

		Previous to this time many Chinese plants had been brought to
Europe	LOCATION	for cultivation , some from
China	LOCATION	direct , others from Japanese gardens .

		These , however , were nearly all cul - tivated plants , merely transferred from the gardens of the Orient to those of the Occident .

		It was not known , thirty years ago , that west - ern
China	LOCATION	was full of the most remarkable and beautiful wild trees , shrubs , and herbs , hun - dreds of them well adapted to the gardens of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		During the
last quarter	DATE	of a century these wonders have gradually been revealed by a few indefatigable and phenom - enally successful collectors , among whom , when all the material has been examined ,
E. H. Wilson	PERSON	will probably be found to take the first rank .

		Statistics convey a poor idea of the work done ; but it is worth noting that in the course of nearly eleven years
Wilson	PERSON	collected about 65,000 specimens , representing about 5,000 different species , and sent home seeds of over 1,500 different plants .

		We do not know how many of the species were new to science , but they were exceedingly numerous : thus it is stated that there were forty new species of cherries alone .

		Very many of the plants have proved valuable additions to our gardens in their original form ; others will be used in * A NATURALIST IN

		The results of this work will rap - idly become available all over the country , and eventually nearly everyone will , usually with - out knowing it , be indebted in some way or other to
E. H. Wilson	PERSON	.

		The work of explo - ration and collecting was arduous and time - consuming , but it was thoroughly enjoyed at the time and its results ought to yield as much satisfaction as need fall to the lot of mortal man .

		In his well written and beautifully illustrated book Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	tells the story of his work and gives a general discussion of the people and products of western
China	LOCATION	.

		We are astonished first at the author 's knowledge of the flora ; then at his keen observations on the sociology > politics , agriculture , zoology , and many other matters which came before him .

		The narrative is a perfectly straightforward one , apparently without undue bias of any kind , but written in a sympathetic spirit .

		Those who care for explo - ration and natural history will enjoy it most ; but it is to be recommended also to those who are interested in the character of the Chinese ^ and the future of
China	LOCATION	.

		Many people have visited the fringe of that great country , and freely communicated their impressions to the world ; but here is a man who has gone to and fro in the uttermost parts for many years , with only native companions ; one , also , who is scien - tifically minded , and has no particular reason for distorting the facts .

		On one of his journeys , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	entrusted a box of money to a recently engaged coolie , , who presently complained of feeling sick and was discharged .

		It was discovered next day that the man had decamped with about half the money .

		At about the same time an official , on being asked to furnish the customary escort , sent back a discourteous reply , refusing to - grant the request .

		The reader will think at once : '' Of course , what else is to be expected in
China	LOCATION	? ''

		He will then be astonished to read that both experiences were unique ; that in eleven years no other serious theft of the au - thor 's property occurred , and no other official was anything but polite !

		Could a Chinese r travelling in the
United States	LOCATION	, tell a similar story ?

		On the borders of Thibet there are gangs of robbers , but Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	was not molested by them .

		A friend of the author 's , who has spent many years among the Thibetans , , has contributed a long and very interesting note on polyandry , showing how the custom haa grown out of the mode of life of those people .

		Under the circumstances , it has its advantages , 138 THE DIAL -LSB-

		A few paragraphs from Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's conclud - ing chapter will give some idea of his views : '' A keynote to the Chinese character is pride .

		They are an intensely proud people , and it must be confessed that their pride is justified ... They have also grave national faults , and this pride and its concomitant con - servatism is largely the cause of their present position .

		... I have met in
China	LOCATION	hundreds of students intent on acquiring Western knowledge , but scarcely one who in any sense realized the immensity of the task before him ... For generations
China	LOCATION	went in for competitive examinations to supply all official posts , and had , as a result , a body of truly incapable officials .

		... I do not believe in a ` Yellow Peril ' in the nature of a possible military conquest of the
West	LOCATION	.

		It would be necessary to fundamentally alter the Chinese character in order to make it militantly aggressive .

		But in their virility and industry they are unconquerable people , quite the equals of the West in these qualities .

		If they thoroughly 4 awaken , ' what is to prevent them becoming in com - merce and industry the great competitors of the white race ?

		... My experiences in
China	LOCATION	, though varied , have on the whole been very pleasant .

		To speak as we And and courageously is the only just stand to take .

		With all their peculiarities , conservatism , and faults , the Chinese are a great people .

		Phoenix-like ,
China	LOCATION	has arisen time and again from the ashes of decadent dynas - ties , and there is every reason to believe she will accom - plish this again .

		Her peace-loving , industrious millions can never be utterly smothered or nationally effaced .

		Sooner or later they must come into their own , and side by side with the people of the Occident help forward the destiny of the world . ''

		In
1899	DATE	, wonderfully perfect materials of a gigantic fossil reptile were found in
Wyoming	LOCATION	, and secured for the
Carnegie Museum	ORGANIZATION	at
Pitts	LOCATION	- burgh .

		The mounted skeleton is over eighty-four feet long , with extremely long neck and tail , and a comparatively minute head which must have contained the smallest brain , in compar - ison with the bulk of the animal , of any known vertebrate .

		The species was supposed , perhaps erroneously , to be new , and was accordingly named Diplodocus carnegiei .

		A sketch of it was sent to Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	in
Scotland	LOCATION	, and was by him shown to
King Edward VII.	PERSON	, who at once asked for a specimen to be placed in the British Museum .

		But there are some things that even kings must do without , skeletons of Diplodocus being among them .

		It was , however , possible to make a replica , which was given to the British Museum , and for most purposes serves as well as the original .

		I have seen both the original and the copy , and do not think I could tell them apart without very close examination .

		The great success of this undertaking led to models of Diplodocus being given , at Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's ex - pense , to other European museums .

		When one was set up in
Paris	LOCATION	, one of the papers of that city came out with the `` explanation '' that Americans , having so often purchased fake antiquities in
Europe	LOCATION	, had resolved to get even by one bold stroke !

		Everywhere the
Diplo	PERSON	- docus created a great deal of public interest , and helped to make palaeontology , in spite of its subject-matter , a live science .

		Recently , a Diplodocus replica was given to the Argentine Republic , and Dr.
Holland	PERSON	, the distinguished Director of the
Carnegie Museum	ORGANIZATION	, went to
La Plata	LOCATION	to superintend its erection .

		This journey to
South America	LOCATION	is the basis of the book now before us .

		While Dr.
Holland	PERSON	kept essentially to the beaten path , and has no remarkable adventures or discoveries to record , he has written a thoroughly interesting and entertaining account of what he saw .

		The nar - rative is detailed enough to be vivid , yet not so detailed as to be tiresome ; it is based not only on the actual experiences of the voyage , but also on much reading and thought .

		Thus the author 's `` first impressions '' are not mere naive reactions in the presence of the unfamiliar , but are added to the results of previous close study .

		Dr.
Holland	PERSON	describes his book as `` simply the record of a pleasant journey , '' and does not offer it as an important contribution to knowledge ; but it will open the eyes of many travellers to interesting features of the South American coun - tries , and will especially serve to interest them in numerous scientific problems of which they would otherwise know nothing .

		The book is beautifully illustrated , not only by reproduc - tions from photographs , but also by some very delicate and beautiful colored plates , made from water-color drawings by the author .

H. C. Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	, Litt.D .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 139 erable interest .

		We should burn a fine candle to the Italian gentleman who , we are told , sug - gested that Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	undertake the work .

		The subject is a fascinating one , and it fell into hands which were well fitted to treat it after completing the excellent monograph on Moli ^ re .

		It may be hoped that the author of these two works has definitely forsworn the society novel , and that he will henceforth follow the line of studies in which he has been of late engaged .

		Strange to say , there has been no adequate treatment of
Goldoni	LOCATION	in English : there was a clear field .

		It is regrettable that foreign stu - dents of Italian literature have confined them - selves so straitly to the trecento and the
Renais	PERSON	- sance .

		The eighteenth century in
Italy	LOCATION	was , to be sure , an age of immorality and of low social standards .

		But so it was in the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Yet , whereas English , German , and French writers of that century have been scraped to the bone for a morsel of flesh , the eighteenth century literature of
Italy	LOCATION	and of
Spain	LOCATION	has been scarcely touched .

		Periods of moral laxity and of political corruption are , however , often of great social interest , and of no century is this more true than of the wicked and corrupt but gay and witty century which , despite the utter - ances of philosophers and scientists , fiddled and danced on its way to the French Revolution .

		The adventures of Goldoni -LRB- born 1707 -RRB- before he `` found himself '' and became the purveyor of plays for the two Venetian theatres of Sant ' Angelo and
San Luca	LOCATION	are a perfect reflection of the state of
Italy	LOCATION	during
the first half of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		To match his romantic adventures one must turn to the fictions of
Agustin de Rojas	PERSON	in his Spanish novel of El Viaje entretenido -LRB- 1603 -RRB- , to
Scarron	ORGANIZATION	's French Roman comique -LRB- 1651 -RRB- , or to
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	's better known Capitaine Fracasse -LRB- 1861 -RRB- .

		The source for our knowledge of these '' Wanderjahre '' of the future master of Italian comedy is the Memoires written in French at
Paris	LOCATION	toward the close of his long life .

		Upon these Memoires , covering one of the most checkered dramatic careers of which we have record , Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	has necessarily drawn heavily .

		His excerpts will have the effect of sending many of his readers to make a first-hand acquaintance with the personal recol - lections of the amiable and benevolent `` Papa Goldoni . ''

		We venture to emphasize as most informing the chapters in which the author has set forth the general social and literary conditions in
Venice	LOCATION	, the campaign of Goldoni in favor of the written comedy , the relations of Goldoni with French and English men of letters , the essential inferiority of the Italian to
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, and the
last years of Goldoni	DATE	's long life at
Versailles	LOCATION	and at
Paris	LOCATION	until his death in
1793	DATE	at the age of eighty-six .

		There is perhaps no clearer ex - position of the subject to be found in English than the chapter on '' The Improvised Comedy '' of
Italy	LOCATION	, not even Dr.
Winifred Smith	PERSON	's more detailed
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	thesis on `` The Commedia dell ' arte , '' to which our author acknowledges his indebtedness .

		A mere handful of
Goldoni	ORGANIZATION	's three hundred plays are known to some of our university stu - dents and to a few curious theatre-goers .

		No one who has seen
Signore Novelli	PERSON	in his Italian version of Le Bourru bienfaisant , first played at the
Comedie Fransaise	ORGANIZATION	on
November 4 , 1771	DATE	, will soon forget the comedy or its interpreter .

		But we question whether in a book of this kind , intended for the general reader , it was expedient to analyze so many of
Goldoni	ORGANIZATION	's plays as Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	has done .

		The middle of the volume is a trifle heavy , and one has the unwel - come conviction that each plot is driving its predecessor from the mind , as one comedy of intrigue after another is passed in review .

		The plots of the comedies are abundantly illustrated by the translation of scenes which must have cost the translator no little pains .

		Of these , the poetical renderings are more pleasing than the prose , because it is even less possible in the latter case to reproduce the elusive dialogue of the Italian ; whereas the poetry even in English has a dignity and formality of its own which does not court comparison with the original .

		Goldoni has been so generally referred to as the `` Molie-re of
Italy	LOCATION	'' that Mr.
Chatfield	PERSON	-
Taylor	PERSON	has done well to limit the implied parallel between these two great modern creators of wholesome mirth .

		The Frenchman and the Italian each developed his consummate mastery of character-drawing and of dramatic technique from the improvised comedy of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Each was a bourgeois with an extensive knowledge of the foibles of humanity .

		Each had grown up in the air of the green-room , and each wrote comedies to keep the wolf from the door .

		In outward circumstances the careers of the two men were strangely similar .

		Neither was n otably a religious man ; but
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	was a philosopher .

		There are many serious passages in
Goldoni	LOCATION	's comedies in which he preaches to his generation ; but they hardly hit the eternal truth as does Moliere in his portentous portraits of the hypocrite , the 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	misanthrope , the miser , the rake , and the social climber .

		One might prefer to have the sunny and optimistic Goldoni for a friend with whom to chat and drink coffee in the
Piazza	LOCATION	in
Venice	LOCATION	, while he laughed over his adventures with act - resses , with naughty grand dames and their '' cicisbeos '' ; but one would prefer to read Molire , to study humanity through his observ - ing eyes , and to recognize in this great , sad , lovable man the same jarring note of tragedy and comedy which makes the whole world his kin .

		Goldoni is comparatively shallow , while Molire is incomparably profound ; Goldoni is an Italian , and more specifically a Venetian , of the eighteenth century , while Molidre is universal because he deals with eternal types of human folly .

		The general reader , for whom the body of the book is intended , will be especially inter - ested , moreover , in the literary friendship of Goldoni and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, in the influence of Rich - ardson upon the Italian playwright , and in the experiences of the exiled dramatist as Italian tutor in the family of Louis XV .

		But there are a number of hors d'oeuvres contained in the massive volume : the appetite is whetted by the admirable reproductions of paintings by
Pietro Longhi	PERSON	, illustrative of Italian life in the eighteenth century , which lend precious assist - ance to an understanding of
Goldoni	ORGANIZATION	's comedies ; the author 's footnotes lead the way to French and Italian authorities for the history of the Italian drama ; and , most valuable to the scholar , there are three Appendices and an Index , rep - resenting the painstaking work of Professor
F. C. L. van Steenderen	PERSON	of Lake Forest Col - lege .

		Appendix A , containing a chronological catalogue raisojine of
Goldoui	ORGANIZATION	's works with reference to the source and the first performance of each play or opera , is an invaluable com - pendium of information for the student of com - parative literature .

		A biographical chronology and a bibliography of editions of Goldoni fur - ther enhance the value of the volume , and thus place a mass of scattered details at the conven - ient disposal of the student .

		Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	's style is easy and agreeable to read .

		Like Mme. de Sevigne in one respect , he lets his pen trot '' la bride sur le eou , '' thereby offering a striking contrast to most academic writers who feel that space limi - tations require succinctness of statement .

		There is one sentence , on page 510 , that savors of Gol - doni 's countryman , the cavaliere
Marino	PERSON	.

		As an example of preciosite it jars on the natural style of the book , and may be quoted a titre de curiosite : `` Goldoni , too , is open to the charge of having presented in
The House Party	ORGANIZATION	a triangle of domestic infelicity similar in outline to the conventional framework of the plays of modern
Europe	LOCATION	; yet he has so tem - pered his situations that the apical angle de - scribing his story of marital incompatability , being neither viciously obtuse nor insinuatingly acute , may justly be termed right . ''

		How this curious concetto escaped the pen of an experi - enced writer is cause for wonder .

		The following slight inaccuracies have been noted , and should be corrected in a second edition : on page 474 it is incorrect to include Mme.
Champmesle	PERSON	in the troupe of the
Comedie Francaise	ORGANIZATION	at the time of
Goldoni	ORGANIZATION	's arrival in
Paris	LOCATION	in
1762	DATE	, as she had died in
1698	DATE	; on page 547 -LRB- note -RRB- the Spanish play El Burlador de Sevilla should be assigned to
1630	DATE	, when the first edition was published at
Barcelona	LOCATION	-LRB- cf. Fitz-Maurice
Kelly	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The publishers have cooperated generously in giving this important text a carefully constructed and handsome frame .

		It is cause for gratification that in this case an American has forestalled English scholarship in producing a biography of the foremost Italian comic author which should find a place in every library .

		IDEALISTIC FORCES IN
AMERICAN HISTORY	ORGANIZATION	.

		* '' There is to-day , '' says Professor
Adams	PERSON	, '' a very decided tendency to seek purely material reasons for historical development , and espe - cially so , apparently , in American history . ''

		This tendency is unfortunate , he thinks ; for there are in history '' other influences of an in - tellectual , it may be a spiritual , character . ''

Yale	ORGANIZATION	, on the ''

		The ideals selected for this purpose are indicated by the titles of the lectures ,
Nationality	ORGANIZATION	, Anti-slavery ,
Manifest Destiny	ORGANIZATION	, Religion , Democracy .

		Professor Adams at - tempts '' neither explanation nor analysis of these ideals , but rather ... to show by straight - forward historical review and by familiar quota - * THE POWER OF IDEALS IN AMERICAN HISTORY .

Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 141 tions from leading Americans of the time , the force that was in them . ''

		This , clearly , should prove no hazardous undertaking to maintain that men do not act solely from material motives , to show that an emotion , or a sentiment , or a faith , has often had a powerful influence upon the course of events .

		On first thought , one is disposed to question the necessity of demonstrating so ob - vious a truth .

		We all know , do we not , that our friends are every day acting from other than material motives , from a sense of honor , from friendship , or at the call of duty .

		Certainly we know this .

		And it is a commonplace that men in the mass , even more than individuals , are likely to be moved by passion or sentiment to noble or despicable action .

		If anything is known , it is known that the motives which in - spire human conduct are many , and capable of a great variety of combination , so that the pres - sure of any particular motive , or of any combina - tion of motives , is never quite the same in any two situations .

		Undoubtedly it is this variety in the circum - stance and motive of action that gives the study of history its high value .

		A famous professor of economics , in examining a candidate for the doctor 's degree on one occasion , began with the following question : '' Suppose a man and a dog with two biscuits , cast away at sea in a small boat ; what would the man do ? ''

		I dare say the fascination of a certain kind of Political Economy arises from the fact that you can say straight off precisely what the man would do .

		But if such questions have any meaning , then life has none , and history has none .

		You have to know the man and the dog and the biscuits , the kind of boat , on what sea it was , and the season of the year .

		Put
St. Augustine	LOCATION	in the boat , and I should say that he would give both biscuits to the dog , at least if it were the dog which we know of in the story .

		But if it hap - pened to be
Bill Sykes	PERSON	in the boat , I should say that he would certainly eat both biscuits himself and afterwards , perhaps , the dog also .

		History will readily furnish us both these extremes , and between them a great variety of possible courses .

		But if this variety makes his - tory interesting , it also makes it difficult extremely so ; so difficult that it is impossible to enter into it in any intimate way , much less to describe it , without selecting , out of the countless number of actual situations , certain situations of a special kind , and emphasizing , in order to understand these situations , the pur - poses or motives which seem to be most import - ant .

		This selection and emphasis constitute an interpretation .

		Obviously , in this sense , there are many possible kinds of interpreta - tion .

		Each will be more or less useful accord - ing to the knowledge , the insight , and the sympathy of the mind that makes it ; but none can ever sum up the whole of history , or be the only useful way of regarding it .

		By all means , therefore , let us look at the past from as many angles as possible , each stu - dent regarding that.aspect of it which interests him , and representing it in the best way he can .

		Unfortunately , we are all disposed to exaggerate the importance of what interests us ; and some men are temperamentally unable to rest easy until they have cleaned up the cosmos and stored away everything in the snug compart - ments of some general principle , without any fragments left lying around to stumble over ; hence the neat formula which professes to explain quite simply what seems at first sight so inexplicably complex .

		From the
Ionian Mythographers	ORGANIZATION	to the days of
Taine	PERSON	and Lam - precht , the student of historical literature encounters the debris of such formulae .

		But the attempt to pack the human spirit in some or other odd shaped syllogistic hand-bag never does any harm because it is never successful .

		The bag bursts , or the fashions change , and the human spirit goes on its way , as resilient as ever , whether rejoicing or not .

		Of these recep - tacles , the latest is the well-braced provender - crib known as the `` Economic Interpreta - tion of History . ''

		The latest , do I say ?

		No , not the very latest ; for it is already half passe , of which fact Professor
Adams	PERSON	's book is , in its way , an interesting confirmation .

		Of course any thoroughgoing materialist who knows his business would say that Professor
Adams	PERSON	has gone about to upset a man of straw , very neatly , no doubt .

		Only a most superficial materialist , he would say , ever sup - posed that the immediate springs of conduct are always material interests .

		Emotion , sentiment , ideals , these often move men , sure enough , to irrational action .

		But what makes ideals ?

		Democracy is a force , I admit it ; but how do you explain the existence of the ideal of democ - racy , and why does it prevail one time rather than another ?

		Are ideals ultimate and persist - ent forces , or are they but the natural instincts of the human animal psychologically trans - formed into more subtle instruments to be employed in the service of those instincts ?

		Psychology tells us that emotion is but the in - stinct for action delayed or thwarted .

		Well , 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	the Puritan ideal , for example , was a powerful force , certainly ; but you will find the origin of it in an economic and social organization which for two or three centuries isolated the bourgeois and thwarted his pursuit of wealth and power .

		And what is the idea of democracy but an effective moral and intellectual weapon forged for the use of the average man in his contest for the spoils of the world ?

		Historians , so I suppose our materialist to say , who are satisfied with conscious motive as an explanation of action in history are only one degree less superficial than those who are content to narrate action without explanation .

		We must be more pro- found than that .

		We must refer action to motive , and motive to the elemental and persist - ent forces which give rise to it .

		This is to place the discussion of historical interpretation on another level altogether .

		On this level , the materialist can indeed be encoun - tered with good prospect of victory , but he can not be routed so easily .

		Professor
Adams	PERSON	does not meet him on this level ; nor does he profess to have done so .

		He has made his attack upon the cruder and more superficial forms of materialistic interpretation .

		This was well worth doing , and it has been done effectively .

		An alien and exotic quality in the book renders it peculiarly acceptable to an

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		not only the greatest man whom the Chinese race has produced in modern times , but , in a combination of qualities , the most unique per - sonality of the past century among all the nations of the world . ''

		He was notable as man of letters , soldier , diplomat , and statesman ; and in all these scarcely related fields his greatness was due to a certain brilliance of mind and activity and per - sistence of will .

		His steady rise from his first subordinate position in a district office until as an old man he held the fate of
China	LOCATION	, at several momentous crises , in his hands alone , this uninterrupted career in the achievement of his youthful ambition seems to have been the inev - itable result of abilities rather than the effect of family or monetary influence .

		Moreover , the personality of the great
China	LOCATION	- man is not only impressive , but also attractive and at times fascinating .

		The astonishing shrewdness of the man , a businesslike and yet almost preternatural keenness in estimating men and turning them to his own purposes , this quintessence of worldly wisdom , blended with ready and full appreciation of the abilities and services of other men , and with apparently com - plete loyalty to his country and his rulers , makes him the sort of person to whom men of common abilities attach themselves .

		Suavity , intellectual keenness , power , and loyalty are the marked traits of his character .

		Such one feels
Li Hung Chang	PERSON	to have been in and of himself .

		But a sketch of his person - ality can not end there , for he was something in addition as an Oriental and a Chinaman of the last century .


Gulick	PERSON	has shown convincingly that national traits supposedly ineradicable may be the product of age-long environment , and may be subject , under a changing environment , to alteration or complete effacement .

		As we contemplate the uglier side of the character of Li , we should be the more repelled if we did not bear this truth in mind .

		In him century-long environment had produced a person of cruel nature and low moral consciousness .

		Though seemingly devoted to the welfare of all his coun - trymen , he took pleasure in ordering the head taken from the shoulders of a wretch who at - tempted his life , and years afterwards referred to the incident with a sort of satisfaction .

		The multitudes whom he sent to execution during his long career as a magistrate sat very lightly upon his conscience .

		When he captured
Nanking	LOCATION	from the
Taiping	LOCATION	rebels , he commanded his lieutenant-general to pass through the city and slay all persons who were in any way associated with the use of opium .

		The officer reported that
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 143 he killed twelve hundred users and retailers of the drug .

		Li commented in his diary : `` It is good work , and it further commends Ching in my sight . ''

		When a certain merchant came with a complaint that
Gordon	PERSON	's army had pillaged his property , and begged for protection , Li was about to have the fellow put to death , but altered his mind and sent him back to
Gordon	PERSON	with a request written in English , `` asking the com - mander please to cut the fellow 's head off upon its presentation .

		He went away very gleefully . ''

		When some of the butchers of Chingkiang com - plained that the rebels had used up all meat cattle of the region , and asked whether some of the rebel prisoners might not be killed for food , '' I told them , '' writes Li , '' to see my captain in command over the wretches and tell him it would do no harm to replenish the meat supply of the city . ''

		Yet this cruelty is in strange contrast with the appreciation and sympathy which drew tears from his eyes as he sat by the death-bed of his American lieutenant ,
Ward	LOCATION	.

		He spent the unpaid balance of
Ward	ORGANIZATION	's salary in erecting a shrine to his memory .

		His cruelty to the
Nanking	LOCATION	qpium - smokers was balanced by his sorrow for the curse this drug brought to his race .

		Li 's conception of woman was low and coarse .

		It is without the least sense of shame that he refers to his father 's concubines .

		His own mother was one of these secondary wives .

		Writing as an old man of his changed views in regard to suicide , he ridicules widows who com - mit suicide to show their affection for their husbands , saying their real reason is laziness or the fear that no other man will support them .

		`` In this she does not deceive herself , nor does she fool the many thousands who are glad to come and witness her death .

		Let the widow marry again and rear up more spirits to honor the spirits of those gone before .

		Of course , if she is too lazy to do this , suicide is good enough for her . ''

		He alludes in one pas - sage to a certain secondary wife who had at first been very zealous to please him , but who soon became quarrelsome , and speaks of his dismissing her with a monetary compensation as if it were the discharge of a laborer .

		Yet in strong contrast with this attitude toward women in general is Li 's feeling for his own mother .

		One can not doubt that his devo - tion to her while alive was deep and genuine , and that he remembered her with heartfelt affection and reverence throughout the many years he lived after her .

		While he was travel - ling through
Germany	LOCATION	, the fourteenth anniver - sary of her death occurred , and he secluded himself from all callers and spent the day in thinking of her and renewing his gratitude to her memory .

		Somewhat similar was his loyalty to certain friends , among whom the chief seems to have been
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the tomb of Grant he performed religious rites and offered a prayer to the dead American , and the fervor of his notes in the diary preclude the thought of a mere theatrical display .

		We have commented only upon striking and contrasting elements in
Li Hung Chang	LOCATION	's per - sonality .

		There is much , besides , of interest in these memoirs .

		Li 's style , even in the trans - lation , is never uninteresting , and his humor adds much to the relish of the book .

		He was a great man born in an environment inhospitable to some of the finer fruits of the spirit , yet growing to an old age that commands admira - tion not unmixed with reverence and even affection .

		THE SYMBOLISM OF WORDS .

		* '' There are manifold problems in literature that are insoluble except by the supposition that the mind is at times an instrument played upon by the fingers of an
Unseen Force	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In these words Mr.
Harold Bay	PERSON	ley states in the concluding chapter of his remarkable book the theme that has played all through the two large volumes .

		Another statement of this theme stands at the head of Chapter XV .

		: '' Nothing is clearer than the marvelous persistence of traditional and immemorial modes of thought , even in the face of conquest and subjugation . ''

		There is no pronounced unity either in the individual chapters or in the work as a whole , for in reality the range is encyclopaedic .

		The chapter - titles in the first volume , '' The Parable of the Pilgrim , '' '' The Ways of Ascent , '' `` The Millennium , '' '' The Hosts of the Lord , '' ''
King Solomon	PERSON	, '' '' The Fair Shulamite , '' '' Cinderella , '' '' The Star of the Sea , '' and others , are perhaps as good titles as could be chosen ; yet there are many curious things in each chapter with only a very slight thread of connection , or none at all .

		And from the larger point of view , though there is the unity of a continued gnostic and mediaeval mystic interest , many things intrude as welcome '' brute '' facts , and one will do wisely to use the index as the key to an encyclopaedia .

Virgin Mary	ORGANIZATION	, and the Bride of the
Song of Solomon	ORGANIZATION	and the original Mother or Mere , the Sea .

		There are many hints of the '' heritage of Christianity from Heathendom both
Eastern and Northern	ORGANIZATION	, and many sparkling glances at all ancient universal mythologies .

		Under the caption , '' The White Horse , '' there is a rich mine of animal symbolism .

		In the
Introduction	ORGANIZATION	, after noting a few roots like ffl -LRB- God or Power -RRB- , Ur -LRB- Fire -RRB- ,
Joh	PERSON	, Yah or lah -LRB- the Ever-Existent -RRB- , the author calls attention to a syllable that appears to
spring	DATE	from the original human tongue , ak .


Karnak	LOCATION	,
Menok	LOCATION	,
Anok	PERSON	,
Akbar	LOCATION	,
Balak	LOCATION	,
Hakon	PERSON	,
Anahuac	LOCATION	,
Achilles	LOCATION	,
Heracles	ORGANIZATION	,
Agag	PERSON	, the
Gog	ORGANIZATION	and Magog in the
London Guild Hall	LOCATION	,
Yak	ORGANIZATION	, Oak , to say nothing of the ic 's and o & 's which are equivalent to a & 's since vowels are of such slight conse - quence in etymology , this list could be ex - tended into an impressive one ; all the words , it will be seen , including the common notion of greatness .

		He overlooks
Jacob	PERSON	and climax -LRB- climacks -RRB- and probably many more .

		Meeting this Aryan ak is like shaking hands with the Stone Age Man in the British Museum .

		Again , the connection between Hu the mighty , first of the three chieftains who estab - lished the
Welsh Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and white -LRB- Hu + eet -RRB- , horse -LRB- Ek + Hu = Equus -RRB- , Hog -LRB- Hu + og -RRB- , and Uag -LRB- Hu + ag -RRB- , all indicatig the inntel - lectual principle , will be fascinating if not con - vincing to anyone .

		The syllables Is-se , occurring in
Ulysses	LOCATION	,
Odysseus	ORGANIZATION	,
Jesse	PERSON	,
Eliseus	LOCATION	,
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, as well as in
Elysian	LOCATION	,
Isis	ORGANIZATION	, Dionysos , etc. , will bear witness to a '' burning light '' ; and it is especially curious that Issi ,
Ulysses	PERSON	, and Bissat each achieved fame by burning out the light of a one-eyed monster .

		That Eros should not only have perpetrated in English such a word as erotic , but should also be accredited with rose , pear , caress , and
Jerusalem	LOCATION	-LRB- Eros-el-em -RRB- will make for Christian charity to old heathen gods .

		To find Baba originally meaning `` parent of parents '' recalls
Samuel Butler	PERSON	's famous definition of a hen : `` Merely an egg 's way of producing another egg . ''

		Space is not available for more examples .

		Suffice it to say that of the books recently issued on the poetry and symbolism in words , no other is so charming or on the whole so plausible as this .

		Certainly it must be admitted that Mr.
Bayley	PERSON	's book has the defects of its good quali - ties .

		His theory of unity in language is too simple in its present form , and proves entirely too much .

		For instance , far too many words `` resolve themselves into the mighty ever - existent God . ''

		It would appear that half the vocabulary of the Aryans was composed of combinations of Ag -LRB- Ak -RRB- ,
El	LOCATION	, Om , and
Pa.	LOCATION	.

		Words as dissimilar as goal and dragon are assigned exactly the same meaning ; and , it must be added , that meaning is a highly abstract one which renders its primitive origin extremely doubtful .

		Then , too , the method of comparison is at times desultory and fanciful , depending almost entirely upon phonetic similarities and very little upon historic lines of descent .

		By jug - gling Zend ,
Sanscrit	LOCATION	,
Hindu	LOCATION	, Peruvian , English , French ,
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	, Indian , and Greek , without inquiring whether or how it was possible for Zend to equate with modern English and with no other modern tongues , how or why Aryan should stick to Cornish but to no other lan - guage , one has a very easy task in establishing any special theory .

		To show what is meant : we may admit that the glove was a symbol of cordial friendship , and yet have difficulty in accepting Mr.
Bayley	PERSON	's philological explanation , ag + love or great love .

		He should , for the complete satisfaction of the scholar or even the half-scholar , show how the English luf reached back through the millenniums and confiscated that ancient g. Perhaps it did ; we are inclined to believe so .

		Yet the present work demands too much faith .

		And faith , `` the substance of things hoped for , '' is anathema to the scientist .

		However , the drift of this censure is simply that a mystic is not a scientist .

		Alpha is not
Omega	ORGANIZATION	; that is all .

		Doubtless there are those
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 145 who will say the author might have been more accurate and plodding without impairing the value of such a book .

		But there will be many other readers who would not for a world of dust clip his wings of fancy and suggestion .

		It is the combination of scholar and poet that renders the effect unique .

		When the pains of erudition have failed to track a word to its primal lair , the author does not scruple to use the divining rod ; and the result often passes out of the realm of pedestrian chronicle into the demesne of winged literature .

		THE BIOLOGY OF SEX .

		* The social aspects of sex are just now being exploited to an unprecedented degree .

		Every - where such matters as `` white slavery , '' eugenic control of marriage , and the education of the young in sexual physiology are coming to be the reigning subjects not alone of strenuous debate , but even of polite conversation .

		With all the agencies of social vociferation the pulpit , the stage , the magazines , the daily news - paper , the halls of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, women 's clubs throughout the land , and the schoolroom vigorously , not to say blatantly , discussing these topics , it is certain that unless the rising gen - eration of to-day is a deal more stupid than were previous generations , the young will be more than `` educated '' about these topics .

		They will be vastly entertained .

		By a curious coincidence there has been a notable advance in our knowledge of the bio - logical basis and laws of sex during just the period of the past half-dozen years , in which the wave of popular interest in the discussion of human sex affairs has been gaining force .

		There has been absolutely no connection or relation between these two things .

		Almost , if not quite , without exception , the biologists who have contributed by their investigations to our knowledge of sex have been entirely indifferent to the social or psychological aspects of the matter .

		On the other hand the reformer neither knows nor cares what a sex-chromosome is !

		`` Heredity and Sex '' gives a much-needed summary and critical digest of the recent liter - ature dealing scientifically with the biology of sex .

		The author of the book , Professor
T. H. Morgan	PERSON	, of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, has been very active in investigations within this field .

		* HEREDITY AND SEX .

		By
Thomas Hunt Morgan	PERSON	, Ph.D. .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		In particular he has contributed , perhaps more than anyone else , to the experimental evidence showing how sex is determined .

		His colleague at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
E. B. Wilson	PERSON	, has dealt with the same problem from the standpoint of the structure of the germ cells , with equally notable success .

		Together these two men and their students have made clear , in a remarkable series of papers , the essential features of the mechanism by which it is determined whether a particular individual shall be a male or a female .

		The determination of sex , what a problem !

		Innumerable attempts , from Aristotle on , have been made to solve it .

		Quacks have fattened off its elusiveness , and kings have been extremely vexed -LRB- it is said -RRB- at the most unaccommodating waywardness of the phenomenon .

		Now it ap - pears every day more clear that the determi - nation of sex is a perfectly orderly and lawful thing .

		It is , in fact , a matter of inheritance . ''

		Femaleness '' is inherited , even as are blue eyes , or red hair , or long legs .

		This is a fact which has some important consequences .

		It means , for instance , that the sex of the offspring is not a thing which can be easily controlled or influ - enced by diet on temperature or any other ex - ternal agent .

		Professor
Morgan	PERSON	is , indeed , of opinion that nothing whatever can influence the determination of sex , holding that it is abso - lutely predetermined in the structure of the germ cells .

		It is just possible that time will show that this position is a little too extreme , but for the present it serves excellently to keep the issues sharply clarified .

		What is the evidence that sex is an inherited character ?

		Briefly this evidence is of two sorts , experimental and observational .

		Experi - mentally it has been shown , by cross-breeding or hybridizing various animal forms , ranging all the way from butterflies to chickens , that in many cases an individual is unable to transmit certain of its characters to its offspring of the same sex as itself .

		Thus a
Barred Plymouth Rock	ORGANIZATION	hen appears totally incapable of trans - mitting her barred color pattern to her daugh - ters , though she transmits it to her sons without any difficulty .

		Cases of this sort have been called `` sex-linked '' inheritance .

		They have as yet received no explanation which is so simple and adequate as that which follows the assump - tion that sex itself is an inherited character .

		Professor
Morgan	PERSON	is , as has been said , one of the foremost students of these phenomena , and a considerable portion of the book is devoted to a clear and critical account of the development 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	of our knowledge of sex-linked inheritance .

		The foundation for this discussion is laid in an account of Mendelian principles of inheritance in general .

		The observational evidence that sex is in - herited is found in the cytological studies which have discovered and interpreted the so-called `` sex-chromosome . ''

		Stripped of all technical - ities , the fact here is that , in a very wide range of animals , including man himself , there are certain peculiar bodies , called X-chromosomes or sex-chromosomes .

		These bodies appear to be composed of , or at least to contain , a particular substance , called X-chromatin , which differs qualitatively from other similar substances .

		The chief peculiarity of these bodies is their unequal distribution in the two sexes .

		So far as is now known , females always contain more of this X-chromatin substance than do males .

		These sex-chromosomes provide the necessary mechan - ism for the hereditary transmission of sex , which has been seen in the sex-linkage cases .

		Several chapters are devoted to the discussion of secondary sexual characters , and such related topics as castration , gynandromorphism , her - maphroditism , etc. .

		Darwin 's theory of sexual selection is sharply criticized and finally re - jected entirely .

		The book is abundantly and well illustrated .

		It was written in the first instance as a series of popular lectures -LRB- the Jesup Lectures of
1913	DATE	-RRB- .

		It measurably approaches the standards for the popularization of science set by such men as
Tyndall	LOCATION	,
Clifford	PERSON	, and
Huxley	LOCATION	.

		A higher rec - ommendation of the book to the reader could not be given .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .


Ooldwin Smith	PERSON	For the last dozen v .

		ears of his lif e as reported by the late
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	had the ser - Mt Bosweil .

		v j ces Q a secretar y loyally devoted to him , ardent in admiration of his genius , attentive to his every utterance , and faithful in recording such of his daily conversation as seemed most noteworthy .

		Excellently qualified , therefore , was this alert aman - uensis to prepare such a volume as the recently - issued ''
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	: His Life and Opinions '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- , although it is not strictly a `` life '' of the man , but rather a near view of him in his later years , with abundant examples of his vigorous and pene - trating manner of thought as expressed in friendly chat with his secretary and literary executor , Mr.
Arnold Haultain	PERSON	.

		It is as scholar and thinker and fearlessly independent -LRB- not to say severely caustic -RRB- critic of public men and public affairs that he is made to present himself to the reader .

		One characteristic entry in Mr.
Haultain	PERSON	's diary is thus worded : '' The old Professor was particularly polyantagonistic to - day ; he reviled everything and everybody , and girded at men and things and theories . ''

		More pleas - ing are glimpses of him starting on a journey with a volume of Homer or
Ovid	LOCATION	in his pocket for rail - way reading ; these and other classic authors he read easily and repeatedly , in the original , declaring that he could read Greek and Latin as readily as English , but adding , as a saving clause , '' unless I come to a snag . ''

		His poor opinion of
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's Homeric studies was the judgment of one who knew whereof he spoke . ''

		His Homeric lucubrations , '' he asserted , `` were trash , pure trash .

		No doubt if
Palmerston	LOCATION	had attempted Homeric lucubrations they would have been trash too .

		But the point is that
Palmerston	LOCATION	did n't . ''

		And again , `` girding '' at
Gladstone	LOCATION	, whom nevertheless he admired for his '' powers of acquisi - tion and exposition , '' he says : `` What is there of
Gladstone	PERSON	's that will live ?

		His speeches have no literary merit .

		I can not think of a single sentence of his that will live .

		He was too prolix .

		He had spoilt his style by over-much practice in debating societies .

		The prolixity was not noticeable when you were listening to the man .

		His personality and the unmistakable generosity of his sentiments had a great effect .

		But literary grace they had not . ''

		These conversations , extending from
1898	DATE	to
1910	DATE	, are excellent reading .

		Appended are two-score pages of ''
U. S. Notes	PERSON	, '' brief jottings made by
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	in his first visit to
America	LOCATION	in
1864	DATE	.

		The book , uniform with Mr.
Haultain	PERSON	's collection of ``
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's Correspondence , '' is suitably illus - trated .

		It leaves the impression of an extremely interesting and strongly-marked character , but one in whom a certain harshness of judgment , the fruit , probably , of early disappointment and embitterment , is to be regretted .

		Studies of ^ e late
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	's `` American a diplomatist and English Studies '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- in - and scholar .

		elude some two dozen papers bearing dates from
1872	DATE	to
1912	DATE	.

		The greater number are occasional addresses delivered in
America	LOCATION	and En - gland during the later years of Mr.
Reid	PERSON	's life .

		Those on biographical , literary , and historical sub - jects , such as ``
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, '' `` Byron , '' `` The Rise of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' express the views and impressions of a widely read man of affairs , sup - plemented by facts readily acquired from ordinary books of reference .

		They are thoroughly good of their kind ; but they make no pretence to offering new theories or new discoveries , and they are more valuable to the student of their author than to the student of the man or the movements that they dis - cuss .

		The paper on
Byron	PERSON	, for example , affords a most interesting indication of Mr.
Reid	PERSON	's views re - garding the morality of literature .

		In his studies of modern social tendencies the author speaks with more weight , and such a paper as '' Organization in American Life '' breathes a healthy and conserva - tive optimism .

		In the minds of some Americans the
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 147 admiration aroused by an essay like the one just named will be regretfully modified by the fact that Mr.
Reid	PERSON	expended so much of his best energies in arguing , chiefly from grounds of '' opportunity '' and '' interest , '' for the forcible subjection of the Filipinos , and the retention of the islands as a per - manent colony .

		In many ways the most interesting of the addresses are the four grouped under the heading , '' An Editor 's Reflections . ''

		These remind us , among other things , that while newspapers change rapidly , the requirements for an ideal editor are always the same .

		The address at
the University of the City of New York	ORGANIZATION	in
1872	DATE	might , with very slight changes , be delivered before an incipient school of journalism to-day .

		The predictions made before the
New York Editorial Association	ORGANIZATION	in
1879	DATE	that the great metropolitan journals must reduce the amount of advertising because it was bound to prove unprofitable , that the daily papers would never again be sold as low as
two cents	MONEY	, that pictures must be abandoned now seem ludicrous , as Mr.
Reid	PERSON	himself tacitly admitted in the
Bromley	PERSON	lectures which he delivered at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
1901	DATE	.

		TomMedwin 's As a biographer of Percy Bysshe '' Shelley '' in a
Shelley	LOCATION	,
Thomas Medwin	PERSON	has never new edition .

		been considered quite safe .

		First in the field , with his `` Life of Shelley '' -LRB- 1847 -RRB- , every subsequent biographer has drawn upon his book for material , but each has done so with some sign-post of warning to the reader , such as these : `` Not to be trusted for facts or judgment '' -LRB- Glutton-Brock -RRB- ; '' carelessly written and untrustworthy '' -LRB- Ingpen -RRB- ; `` a bad book full of inaccuracies '' -LRB- Waterlow -RRB- .

		Hard indeed are the names that have been hurled at poor
Medwin	ORGANIZATION	's head , `` perplexing simpleton '' -LRB- Jeaffreson -RRB- ; `` perfect idiot '' -LRB- Captain Hay -RRB- ; `` gay deceiver '' -LRB- Forman -RRB- ; and
Mary Shelley	PERSON	's impatient `` seccatura , '' when by
Shelley	PERSON	's invitation
Medwin	ORGANIZATION	had joined the charmed circle of poets at
Pisa	LOCATION	.

		A book so variously used and abused during sixty-six years would seem scarcely likely to be honored by a new edition .

		But nevertheless a new edition has appeared , with no less distinguished sponsors than Mr.
H. Buxton Forman	PERSON	as editor and the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	as publisher .

		The text embodies the hitherto unpublished emendations , alterations , and extensions made in
Medwin	ORGANIZATION	's own hand on the pages of his personal copy of the original work ; showing that for twenty-two years his zeal and inter - est never flagged , however his memory may have failed .

		No wonder Mr.
Buxton Forman	PERSON	concludes that `` as it last left the author 's octogenarian hands , and with such commentary as its numerous faults and flaws necessitate , it can no more be ignored by serious students than the biographical contributions of
Mary Shelley	PERSON	,
Thomas Jefferson Hogg	PERSON	,
Thomas Love Peacock	PERSON	, and
Edward John Trelawney	PERSON	. ''

		Medwin was
Shelley	PERSON	's cousin , school-fellow , and adoring friend , and possibly the collaborator in some of his earliest works .

		A page of the original text , reproduced in facsimile , shows how Medwin revised , rewrote , and revised yet again , and speaks volumes for his tireless endeavor to do the best that in him lay .

		However , even that best does not make him a satisfactory biographer of Shelley .

		But what we must grant is that he did have extraordinary op - portunities for gathering original material concern - ing both
Shelley	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	; thus providing data for others to scrutinize , sift , and employ to the profit of future students of the two poets .

		`` Somehow , '' confesses Mr.
Buxton Forman	PERSON	, `` I feel impelled to pardon and to take off my hat to
Tom Medwin	LOCATION	in parting . ''

		Students of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	will be especially grateful for the four appendices , which include some of the poet 's early letters , his preface to the first edition of `` Frankenstein , '' and the
Chancery Papers	ORGANIZATION	relating to
Shelley	PERSON	's children , besides an annotated list of
Medwin	ORGANIZATION	's published works .

		A garner
Ifc	ORGANIZATION	is comin g to be more an d more from mediaeval generally realized outside of uni - Merature .

		versity cloisters that
Chaucer	PERSON	was not the only man who wrote anything of modern interest before the year of grace
1400	DATE	.

		The literature of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , especially that of
England	LOCATION	, has indeed an immense intrinsic charm .

		The age which produced
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Lang	PERSON	- land ,
Wyclif	LOCATION	,
Gower	PERSON	,
Minot	LOCATION	,
Huchown	PERSON	of the
Awle Ryale	PERSON	, and the immortal author of `` Pearl '' and `` Gawayne and the
Grene	PERSON	Knight '' is superior in importance to every half-century , except the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan and Victorian eras , since the time of Alfred the Great .

		So any book aiming to interpret this age to the unawakened should be welcome .

		Generally speaking , translations of earlier English into later English for the purpose of catching those who are unwilling to give a little time to the archaic forms , are not very successful .


Dryden	PERSON	's effort to mod - ernize Chaucer to late seventeenth century conven - tions is a case in point .

		Still it is possible to render worthy service of this sort to the lazy ; and , in her volume of `` Legends and Satires from Mediaeval Literature '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , Dr.
Martha Hale Shackford	PERSON	has attained a very fair measure of success .

		Some of the translations are made from the French , and some from the Latin , although the most are from English .

		Since the editor 's purpose was to show types , and also to avoid reproducing the better-known pieces which are available in other popular forms , the selection is somewhat restricted .

		And some of the pieces , such as `` The Amorous Contention of Phillis and Flora , '' will be found deadly dull by those readers aimed at : that is , those who require urging .

		But `` The Purgatory of Saint
Patrick	PERSON	, '' aside from its theological interest , reveals a sociological one ; `` The Life of Saint Margaret '' revives vividly a dead past ; `` The Song of the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` The Complaint of the Husbandmen , '' and `` Sir Penny '' have some pith ; and the lay of '' Sir Orfeo , '' a Middle - English version of the classic story of Or - pheus and
Eurydice	ORGANIZATION	, has much beauty and charm .

		The editor has earned our gratitude by printing the original of the last-named .

		A small compact body 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	One of the makers of
Kansas	LOCATION	.

		of notes concludes the volume .

		The bibliography which accompanies the notes on each piece is an exceedingly valuable and scholarly addition .

		That the original of Senator Rivers in the play made famous by Mr.
William H. Crane	PERSON	's impersonation of that energetic gentleman should be found to be a most interesting and engaging character , as pre - sented in Mr.
William Elsey Connelley	PERSON	's biography of the man , need surprise no one .

		`` The Life of Preston B. Plumb '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is both a romance of Western enterprise and adventure and the faithful record of a long and useful term of service in the upper chamber of our national legis - lature .

		Readers old enough to have any remem - brance of the anti-slavery struggle , or cherishing even the memory of their elders ' reminiscences of that conflict , will take the keenest interest in the story of Plumb 's hastening from his home in
Ohio	LOCATION	to the help of bleeding
Kansas	LOCATION	, the active part he took in the shaping of the new commonwealth as a free state , and his highly creditable record as a soldier in the Civil War .

		A veritable whirlwind of energy he seems to have been , from the time when , as a boy of six , he nearly crippled his sister in his zeal to show her how like a man he could chop wood , to the last political campaign in which he took part with a vigor that hastened his untimely death in
1891	DATE	at the age of fifty - four .

		His assumption of the editorship and co-proprietorship of the
Xenia	LOCATION	'' News '' at sixteen , his espousal of the cause of
Kansas	LOCATION	at nineteen , his study of law at odd times and his admission to the bar in
1861	DATE	, the beginning of his legislative experience the following year , his three years of army life , his election to the speaker - ship of the
Kansas House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	in
1867	DATE	, his fourteen years at
Washington	LOCATION	as a leader in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	all this and much else will be found chronicled in detail and with an evident determi - nation on the historian 's part to neglect no trust - worthy source of information .

		Footnotes abound , and contain a mass of related matter that no reader can afford to miss .

		A portrait of Senator Plumb , three maps , appended matter , and a full index round out the volume .

		It has been said that the life of
Preston B. Plumb	PERSON	is the history of
Kansas	LOCATION	.

		It is decidedly a life worth reading as related by Mr.
Connelley	PERSON	.

		There is certainly no dearth in the Production of books about
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, and , apparently , not much danger of superfluity .

		A new volume in Stevensonian literature , Mr.
Francis Watt	PERSON	's `` R. L. S. '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , will make interesting read - ing for all lovers of the brilliant romancer , especially those whose admiration for his genius has made them serious students of his work .

		That Mr.
Watt	PERSON	is himself a lover and a student of his subject goes without saying ; he has , moreover , an agreeable style , not without native Scots humor , in record and annotation .

		An introductory chapter , ``
R. L. S.	PERSON	and his People , '' gives a breezy and somewhat un - conventional sketch of the novelist 's life , and is followed by others in which we are led pleasantly along the highways and byways over which
Steven	PERSON	- son travelled in his romantic pilgrimage : through Old
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, hill-surrounded , wind-swept and fog-beset , yet '' weather - tight , especially to those ' panged ' with that inner spirituous lining which no citizen of
Old Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	was like to forget , '' with its ancient landmarks , historic , academic and convivial ; over the
Pentlands	LOCATION	; through the High - lands ; always with
R. L. S.	PERSON	at our side , explaining associations and identifying allusions as he goes .

		Then , with our guide , we pass through
London	LOCATION	, the setting hardly to be called the scene for `` Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	, '' `` Markheim , '' and `` The New Arabian Nights . ''


R. L. S.	PERSON	had no intimate knowledge of
London	LOCATION	, by the way ; he never resided there or worked there ; his visits to the capital were flying ones .

		Across the Channel we tarry at Bar - bizon , at
Grez	LOCATION	, where he met the lady who became his wife , traverse the route through the
Cevennes	LOCATION	which he describes in the '' Travels with a Donkey , '' and trace his course in `` An Inland Voyage . ''

		Thence we follow him to
California	LOCATION	, and so to
Samoa	LOCATION	and
Vailima	LOCATION	.

		With the local color and the atmosphere of `` Auld Reekie '' Mr.
Watt	PERSON	is inti - mately familiar ; with the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	and foreign settings he is not so thoroughly at home , but his notes are nevertheless illuminating and useful as commentary on the text .


Stevenson	PERSON	as letter-writer , as playwright , and as rhymer , is also discussed , and the closing chapters expound his religion , his char - acter , and his style .

		Mr.
Christian Tearle	PERSON	's chatty and Literary walks anec -LRB- j o t a l `` Rambles with an Ameri - about

		can won such favor as to encourage him to issue a sequel , `` The Pilgrim from
Chicago	LOCATION	: Being More Rambles with an American '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- , in which we again meet with the observant and loquacious ``
James C. Fairfield	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	,
U. S.	PERSON	A. '' The rambles described chiefly in dialogue form are mostly in and about
London	LOCATION	, and of course give opportunity for endless literary and other anecdote and reminiscence , in which Mr.
Fairfield	PERSON	shows himself far better versed in English literature and history and topography than are most of his travelling fellow-countrymen .

		The
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' has called him `` a surprisingly winning outcome of
Chicago	LOCATION	's ` tons of culture . ' ''

		As a sample of his talk , called forth by a visit to one of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's haunts , here are some of his words of wisdom : '' It 's a thousand pities that Lamb ever left the
India House	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was only fifty , and the work made no call on his brain he had plenty of time for writing and amusing himself .

		And he ought never to have left
London	LOCATION	.

		The record of these last years is painful to me .

		It 's a pity we know so much about them .

		One does n't love him the less , and one does n't exactly wish that he 'd died sooner , but there 's no denying that the end
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 149 comes as a relief . ''

		Yes , with a comfortable income , and with easy office hours , leaving ample time for essay-writing and social intercourse , our beloved Elia seems not to have known when he was well off .

		Mr.
Tearle	PERSON	diversifies his pleasant pages with scraps of quoted verse and longer metrical compo - sitions of his own .

		Pictures , too , are agreeably numerous .

		An uncompromising intellectual pas - s ' on > an aD8or king intention to under - stand , look out from
Vincent Van Gogh	PERSON	's portrait of himself , reproduced as frontis - piece to a slender volume of '' Personal Recollections of
Vincent Van Gogh	PERSON	, '' by
Elizabeth DuQuesne Van Gogh	PERSON	, translated by
Katherine S. Dreier	PERSON	.

		A self-centredness so intense that it devoured the mind it inhabited , and a contemplation of the world so sympathetic that it became at times a madness of pity and despair , these two elements in the man 's nature are written in every line of his prematurely aged young face and in every word of his sister 's brief record .

		Driven from an unsuccessful attempt at commerce to teaching , and again on to preaching by his determination to follow Christ in the allevi - ation of humble misery -LRB-
Dickens	PERSON	had opened his eyes to some of the pains of poverty -RRB- , Van Gogh lived more than half his life in absolute unconscious - ness of the expression his genius was finally to take .

		Only a terrible physical breakdown , the result of too complete self-abnegation in caring for his mining parish during an epidemic of typhoid , only this break and the consequent enforced leisure revealed to him his power of analyzing color , of drawing in color what he saw , and so making his experience comprehensible to his contemporaries .

		But recog - nition of his genius , like all recognition of genius , was slow ; in his case it never became general even in the artists ' world of
Paris	LOCATION	, where he worked hope - fully for some years , until his tragic death called attention to a production so untimely ended . ''

		I try just as bard as certain other painters whom I have loved and honored , '' he wrote four days before he died ; and now ,
twenty years later	DATE	, his devotion has its reward .

		He is one of the three prophets of the Futurists , the group of young enthusiasts who be - lieve that they are finding in balance of color and `` dynamism '' of line a new method for avoiding '' conventional realism '' and expressing inner real - ities of personal vision .

		This book , supplemented by the letters of Van Gogh which have recently been published , will undoubtedly rank as one of the gospels of the modernist 's faith .

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Although she chooses `` Samphire '' ^ the title of her volume of collected essays , or essayettes ,
Lady Sybil Grant	PERSON	is hardly to be thought of as `` one that gathers samphire , dreadful trade ! ''

		With much less risk to life and limb than is braved by the seeker after that suffruticose herb , she finds in the walks of ordinary life the material for her clever little disquisitions , her list of topics embracing such themes as garden - ing , snobbishness , originality , vagueness , personal relations , criticism , authors , concentration , shop-talk , tact , circumstantial evidence , and millionaires in fiction .

		Three little parodies in fiction , of which the first is called `` Matilda of the Cinque Ports , '' will be enjoyed .

		In closing her remarks on origi - nality , the writer says : `` There is only one way in which to attain originality now ; a very laborious and difficult line to take : it is to be perfectly nat - ural . ''

		This discovery deserves to rank with that of him who first found out that the most baffling and mystifying of diplomats is he who speaks the simple truth .

		In style the book is animated and pleasing though one might object to '' awoken '' as a need - lessly far-fetched form of the past participle .

		Lady
Sybil Grant	PERSON	deplores her handicap as the daughter of such clever parents as Lord and
Lady Rosebery	PERSON	, but she makes a good fight against this adversity of her lot .

		-LRB-
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- A pioneer Long and intimately acquainted with mission-worker the late Dr.
James Curtis Hepburn	PERSON	, in the far East .

		an -LRB- j u e -LRB- j W j t i 1 admiration for his noble character and memorable achievements , Dr.
William Elliot Griffis	PERSON	was the one above all others to write the life of the eminent missionary , physician , lexicographer , and scripture-translator .

		`` Hepburn of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Westminster Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a glowing tribute to a man of heroic purpose and notable accomplish - ment , from one whose own years of residence in the distant land which
Hepburn	PERSON	chose as the scene of his labors equip him in a peculiar manner for his task of biographer .

		The dangers and difficulties faced by the mission - worker in
Japan	LOCATION	half a century ago are brought by Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	to the reader 's vivid realization , and his book has something of the `` thrill '' of an entirely different order of literary composition .

		Rich in varied incident , and covering almost a century of time , Dr.
Hepburn	PERSON	's life was well worth recording , and its story is well worth reading .

		A number of chronological inconsistencies , some in quoted passages , others from the author 's own pen , perplex the reader , but need not seriously interfere with his enjoyment of the book .

		Portraits and other illustrations are not lacking , and the nar - rative is commendably free from prolixity , being confined to about two hundred and thirty duodecimo A guide to Professor
Peter Henry Pearson	PERSON	's the study of manual on '' The Study of Litera - uterature .

		ture -LRB- McClurg -RRB- professes to offer assistance to both `` the general reader who wishes a deeper insight into the charm and meaning of English literature , '' and '' the teacher of the subject in school or college . ''

		Probably it will be the latter rather than the former who will hasten to extend a warm welcome to the book , for to the teacher more than to the general reader does its method appeal a method thus , in part , described at the outset : `` The work is concentrated in turn on each of the classics that are on the program for close study .

		The aim is to work through it analytically and 150 THE DIAJL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	minutely , so that the significance of every detail is understood ; to survey it finally as a synthesized whole , aiming at the result that the pupil shall grasp the author 's message in its completeness . ''

		On a later page the appreciation of a literary work is explained as `` a synthetic procedure in which the pupil is led to manipulate the units of a classic in relation to each other and to estimate them as a whole . ''

		Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's eleven chapters deal suc - cessively with early literary studies , interpretation , appreciation , structural elements , literary elements , methods of literary evaluation , the study of prose forms , `` The Deserted Village , '' `` L'Allegro , '' ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' and literature in its reaction on life .

		The book is the work of a close student and a con - scientious teacher .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The interest aroused by the recent publication of ''
Scott	PERSON	's Last Expedition '' makes timely the appearance of a new and cheaper edition of '' The Voyage of the ' Discovery , ' ''
Scott	PERSON	's record of his first Polar voyage .

		The edition is in two handy volumes , with a dozen or more illustrations .

		There should be a wide demand for this engrossing story in so convenient and inexpensive a form .

		Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	publish the work .

		Part II .

		of Mr.
Herbert H. Gowen	PERSON	's `` Outline History of
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Sherman , French & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an excellent handbook of Chinese history from the beginning of the Manchu dynasty ,
1644	DATE	, to the year
1912	DATE	.

		Accessible and trustworthy material for this period of the history is naturally much more abundant , in proportion to extent of time covered , than for the thousands of years treated in the first volume of the work .

		The author would have received more favorable mention had he issued the two parts simultaneously .

		The present volume contains as much information as could be compressed within its 206 pages ; the information is well selected , well arranged and tabulated ; and it is given in a very readable style .

		Forty years of a librarian 's life are reviewed with reference to American library history and happenings , in Mr.
Samuel Swett Green	PERSON	's enjoyable and instructive volume , '' The Public Library Movement in the
United States	LOCATION	, 1853-1893 , '' which is published in a substantial octavo by the
Boston Book Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thirty-eight years of librarianship , at
Worcester	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, preceded by four years ' service on the board of library directors of the same city ; the position of librarian emeritus since
1909	DATE	; original membership in the public library com - mission of his
State	ORGANIZATION	, with nineteen years of service as commissioner ; one term as president of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	, of which he is a charter member and a life fellow , and on the governing board of which he has served almost continuously since
1876	DATE	this , in part , has been Mr.
Green	PERSON	's unconscious preparation for the writing of such a book , largely reminiscent and anecdotal , as the one that now comes from his skilled pen .

		In referring to library legislation in
Illinois	LOCATION	he might well have sup - plemented his mention of Mr.
F. H. Hild	PERSON	's name in that connection by noting the earlier and more important work of another
Illinois	LOCATION	librarian , who drafted the library bill of
1872	DATE	and was instrumental in procuring its passage .

		A good portrait of the author precedes , and a full index follows , the text . ''

		Lost Diaries , '' another of Mr.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	's amusing fabrications , will be issued shortly by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Little Essays in Literature and Life , '' by Professor
Richard Burton	PERSON	, appears among the
March	DATE	announce - ments of the

Arthur Ransome	PERSON	is now at work .

		An important and timely art book is announced in Mr.
Arthur Jerome Eddy	PERSON	's study of '' Cubists and Post - Impressionism . ''

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		In his forthcoming novel , ''
Shea	PERSON	of the Irish Bri - gade , '' Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	has taken for a back - ground the days when the allies were seeking the defeat of Louis XV .

		An important addition to the literature of socialism is announced in Mr.
John Spargo	PERSON	's '' Socialism and Motherhood , '' which Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	will publish during the
Spring	DATE	.

		Two important works which Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	have in press for early issue are Professor
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	's '' The Wonder of Life '' and Professor
H. A. L. Fisher	PERSON	's extended study of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		Two promising books of fiction on Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,

Spring	DATE	list are '' Ariadne of
Allan Water	PERSON	, '' by
Sidney McCall	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
E. F. Fenollosa	PERSON	-RRB- ; and '' Felicidad , '' by Mr.
Rowland Thomas	PERSON	.

		A large volume of uncollected writings by
Bret Harte	PERSON	, consisting of stories , poems , and essays , has been com - piled by Mr.
Charles Meeker Kozlay	PERSON	, and is in
prepa	LOCATION	- ration for
March	DATE	issue by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Arthur Bartlett Maurice	PERSON	's series of articles entitled `` The Literary Baedeker '' which have been appearing in `` The Bookman '' will be published in book form this Spring by Messrs.

Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		After numerous delays , the third and fourth volumes of
Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	's collected dramatic works , in the authorized edition edited by Mr.
Ludwig Lewisohn	PERSON	, are definitely promised for early Spring publication .

		`` Beaumont the Dramatist '' by Professor
Charles Mills Gayley	PERSON	, of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	, will be published this month by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work aims to settle definitely the
Beaumont	LOCATION	-
Fletcher	PERSON	controversy .

		A new volume of essays by ''
Vernon Lee	PERSON	'' is an - nounced by
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its title is '' The Tower of the Mirrors , '' and it will contain thirty five chapters giving the author 's impressions of famous cities and other places which she has visited .

		A notable novel of the
Spring	ORGANIZATION	season will be Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	's `` Chance . ''

		The publishers of this book ,
Messrs. Doubleday	LOCATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will have ready at about the same time a critical and biographical study of
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	, written by Mr.
Richard Curie	PERSON	. ''

		Still Happy Though Married '' is the title of a book by the Rev.
E. J. Hardy	PERSON	, which is in the press .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's book , '' How to be Happy Though Married , '' has had a huge circulation , and the coming volume gives the author 's supplementary reflections on the subject .

		The publication of `` The Print Collector 's Quar - terly '' has been transferred by the
Boston	LOCATION	Museum of Fine Arts to
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who have become the publishing representatives of this institution .

		Mr.
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 151
FitzRoy Carrington	PERSON	, Curator of the
Print Department of the Museum	ORGANIZATION	, and a lecturer upon engravings at

		This house has also in train for immediate issue a new edition , re - vised and reset , of Mr.
Sidney Low	PERSON	's '' The Governance of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Two little volumes by
M. Emile Faguet	PERSON	are to be issued this month in English translations entitled '' Initiation into Literature '' and '' Initiation into Phi - losophy . ''

		They are both books for the beginner in these fields .

		Sir
Howe Gordon	PERSON	,
Bart.	LOCATION	, is the translator in each case .

		Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	has arranged to give a series of lectures at the Sorbonne on '' The Romantic Movement in English Literature in the Beginning of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		When published in book form later , as they will be , these lectures should constitute a useful addition to literary history .

		In addition to Mr.
Worcester	PERSON	's two-volume work on
the Philippines	LOCATION	, we are to have this
Spring	DATE	an even more extensive book on '' The Americans in the
Phil	PERSON	- ippines '' by Mr.
James A. LeRoy	PERSON	, who was secretary of the

America	LOCATION	and the
Philippines	LOCATION	'' by Mr.

		The Candid Review , '' a quarterly devoted to poli - tics , science , literature , and art , is soon to be launched in
London	LOCATION	.

		Its promoter , Mr.
T. Gibson Bowles	PERSON	, assures prospective subscribers that it will be `` dull and honest , '' a decided recommendation in a day of so much clever mendacity in journalism .

		About the same time the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	will begin pub - lication of a quarterly review which will limit itself to articles of a political nature .

		The Quarterly '' Bulletin of Bibliography and Dra - matic Index , '' published by the
Boston Book Company	ORGANIZATION	, begins a new series with its
January	DATE	number , changing the style and color of its cover , adding a department of '' Applied Economy '' -LRB- library economy it proves to be in this instance , dealing with the

		195 `` THE CHARM OF AMERICANS . ''

		The last place in the world in which we would look for a tribute to `` the charm of Americans '' is `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' but such a tribute occurs in a recent issue , bestowed upon us by one of the regular staff contributors , apropos of an American play given in
London	LOCATION	.

		The passage reads as follows : '' The charm of Americans is that they are still able to discover and to enjoy things that were long ago ex - hausted in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Anybody who has heard an Amer - ican quote from
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	will know what I mean .

		The intellectual world is still quite new to them .

		When they succeed in annexing for themselves a new idea or in experiencing a new emotion which we , of course , have long since explored and exhausted we feel the same pleasure in their achievement , the same delight in their power to take it seriously and to enjoy it , as we feel in watching the progress of a healthy baby .

		American sentimentality is incident to American nonage .

		The American man of sentiment is not a gross and emotionally flabby man watering at the eye from habitual quiescence of the inhibitory nerves .

		He is a nice little boy woefully piping at a tale of babes in the wood and how the kind robin redbreasts covered them up with leaves . ''

		Now this is very nice , and we fully appreciate the kindly estimate of our fresh and innocent youthfulness .

		Of course , the writer does not really mean it ; he is simply the victim of a trick that instinct , or habit , or subliminal con - sciousness , or something , plays upon most of the writer folk .

		A man sits down at his desk to compose , say , a leading article .

		He has his theme in mind , and a general notion of the course he wishes his development to take .

		But his opening sentences are somehow given an unintended twist , which commits his thought to an unanticipated sequence of reflection .

		There they stand , in black and white , and they unmis - takably indicate a `` lead '' that was never con - templated , but must obviously be followed , for the sake of logic , to some sort of outcome .

		He wishes he had begun differently , but he can not escape from the snare of his own setting ; he is like
Goethe	PERSON	's Zauberlehrling , who has worked the incantation , and can not remember the word that is potent to dissolve the spell .

		So he watches , with a kind of dismay , the things that the promptings of his tutelary daemon force him to set down , hoping that some lucky inspiration will eventually enable him to muddle through , and get back into the path originally planned .

		After a while , he gets captivated by his own 166 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	cleverness , and the fascination of the ideas he finds himself expressing dulls his sense of re - sponsibility ; he grows reckless , and determines to see the thing through , no matter what the consequences .

		When his disquisition is com - plete , he gasps at the realization of the con - clusions reached by the pen that has run away with him , so different they are from any that he had expected to reach , but he is not left without a thrill of intellectual satisfaction with the fin - ished product , so neatly do its parts fit together , and so plausible seems the whole argument .

		This , we take it , is the explanation of our quoted paragraph .

		The tricksy spirit that twisted the opening sentence , not the writer , is responsible for all that follows .

		Otherwise , the traditional English view of the American as a shrewd and somewhat cynical person , preco - ciously sharp , and rotten before he is ripe , would have emerged from the portraiture .

		The '' healthy baby '' and '' nice little boy '' concep - tion would have had no chance at all had it not been for that fatal opening .

		One of the purest and at the same time most persistent delusions concerning us is that we are a young people , whereas we are in a general sense the heir of all the ages , and in a narrower sense the inheritor of fifteen hundred years of English tradition and development .

		Our children study the his - tory of
England	LOCATION	as if it were the history of a foreign people , although down to the seventeenth century it is as strictly our own history as it is of our kinsmen who have remained in the ancestral home .

		It is true that we are a transplanted stock , and that means a certain temporary re - tardation , but it does not mean a reversion to childhood .

		The transplanted tree does not be - come a seedling by the process ; rather does it strike down its old roots in the new soil for a new phase of vigorous growth .

		So far from acquiring new characteristics from the changed conditions , it tends to perpetuate the old ones beyond their natural term .

		Our seventeenth century American ancestors were belated
Eliza	PERSON	- bethans , and even in the early nineteenth cen - tury we were reproducing phases of life and thought that were characteristic of the
England	LOCATION	of a century before .

		To change the metaphor , we emigrant Englishmen donned a new suit of clothes when we left the mother country , but the youth who does that is by no means restored to the conditions of the cradle .

		His forward growth may be checked , but he does not grow backward .

		Especially in our intellectual outlook , the `` nice little boy '' theory is a delicious absurdity .

		The theology of the
Mathers	PERSON	and the meta - physics of
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	, the most typical of our early intellectual products , were , to say the least , not nursery imaginings .

		Far from being milk for babes , they were , if anything , meat too tough or gristly for the robust diges - tion of full-grown men .

		The people who bought copies of
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	's Commentary , when that work was the last word in literary novelty , in numbers beyond those that found purchasers in the country of its origin , were not in their non - age .

		Neither were the framers of the Consti - tution , the authors of `` The Federalist , '' and the great jurists of our earlier years , children who needed instruction in any political school of the old world .

		No modern country ever saw a group of men of greater intellectual stature than these .

		The notion that the new ideas and the new emotions that Americans have from time to time '' annexed '' to themselves are only those which Englishmen `` have long since ex - plored and exhausted '' is about the most bril - liant example of fatuous insularity that we have ever encountered .

		When our intellectual life came to full blossom fifty or more years ago , one of its most marked traits was its eager receptivity for the new forces that were stirring the waters of the world 's thought .

		The Concord philoso - phers were not toying with the discarded play - things of old-world thinkers ; rather were they the pioneers of an intellectual movement in which
England	LOCATION	lagged far behind .

		In literary criticism throughout most of the nineteenth century ,
America	LOCATION	marched distinctly in the vanguard .

		`` It is probably not rash to say , '' with Dr.
Cairns	PERSON	, '' that the judgment of to-day upon
Byron	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and others was more accurately expressed by the best American criticism than in any reviews of their works that appeared in
Great Britain	LOCATION	during the same time . ''

		And thus it has been ever since .

		What
Poe	PERSON	said in all sincerity about
Tennyson	PERSON	no English - man at that time had dared to say .

		This fact slightly dulls the point of our
Saturday	DATE	Re - viewer 's slur about `` anybody who has heard an American quote from
Tennyson	LOCATION	. ''

		That great poet may be `` exhausted ' in the opinion of super-sophisticated modern Englishmen , but the acceptance of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's verdict does not exactly appeal to the sound critical sense as a mark of juvenile ineptitude .

		There are other examples a-plenty .

		Carlyle first found a serious audience on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	learned from us the true greatness of that spirit .

		The gigantic intellectual synthesis of Herbert
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 167 Spencer might never have been achieved without the support that came to him from this country .


Omar Khayyam	PERSON	was discovered here more com - pletely than in his own country , and
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	used to refer to himself as '' the great American poet . ''

		Americans did rather more than English - men to force the acceptance of Ibsen upon the English-speaking world , and it was from Amer - ica that the philosophy of pragmatism , under the banners of
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	and
James	PERSON	, marched forth upon the invasion of the world of philosophical thought .

		Somewhat to our surprise , we have come out just about where we intended to .

		It all depends upon how one gets started .

		Our starting - point was found in a vehement reaction from the absurdities of our critic .

		But if his starting - point had been different , there would have been no need for all this pother .

		Suppose , for example , that his opening sentence had been thus framed : '' The charm of Americans is that they have an alert mental attitude which enables them to grasp new ideas and recognize new forms of artistic beauty a little in advance of their mere cautious English brethren . ''

		With that preamble , the conclusions we have arrived at would have flowed from the
Saturday	DATE	Re - viewer 's pen as readily and as inevitably as from our own .

		But then , we should have had nothing to write about .

		A GREAT CONTEMPORARY NOVEL .

		The first of the three volumes containing ''
Jean	PERSON	- Christophe '' in its English version appeared during the winter of
1910	DATE	; the last , something less than a year ago .

		If the book bore any relation to the gener - ality of current fiction , some apology for dealing with it so tardily might be in order .

		But when one has to do with a work of genius , apologies may as well be dispensed with .

		Compared with the great mass of current novels , '' Jean-Christophe '' is as an oak - tree rising above a field of
summer	DATE	grass .

		We should like to have been among the earliest to proclaim its qualities ; that privilege having been missed , we can at least avoid a place among the tardiest .

		Notwithstanding its recognition by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	and other high critical authorities as '' the first great novel of the new century , '' the book seems as yet to have found only a small fraction of its destined English audience .

		Critical superlatives are too much soiled by ignoble use to carry much force nowadays ; and as much as ever in the past , genius is still left to make its own way as it can .

		No doubt the unusual bulk of '' Jean-Christophe '' has deterred many pos - sible readers .

		A generation that is accustomed to con - sidering its fiction , like its pills , the better for being readily bolted is not likely to look with favor upon a novel of seventeen hundred rather closely printed pages .

		But for our part , we should be glad if the three volumes had been multiplied into thirty .

		Indeed , the same material , the same wealth of character , the same reservoir of ideas , might well have served a less rigorous artist for thirty novels instead of one .

		Into the making of `` Jean-Christophe '' has gone the greater part of its author 's life .

		The French original , in ten volumes , occupied nearly a decade in the pub - lishing ; and
M. Holland	PERSON	has said that the book was in conception many years before the first page was written , ``
Christophe	PERSON	only set out on his journey when I had been able to see the end of it for him . ''

		`` The writers of to-day , '' says
Christophe	PERSON	to his friend
Olivier	PERSON	, in one of their discussions , '' Waste their energy in describing human rarities , or cases that are common enough in the abnormal groups of men and women living on the fringe of the great society of active , healthy human beings .

		Since they themselves have shut themselves off from life , leave them and go where there are men .

		Show the life of every day to the men and women of every day : that life is deeper and more vast than the sea .

		The smallest among you bears the infinite in his soul .

		The infinite is in every man who is simple enough to be a man , in the lover , in the friend , in the woman who pays with her pangs for the radiant glory of the day of childbirth , in every man and every woman who lives in obscure self-sacrifice which will never be known to another soul : it is the very river of life , flowing from one to another , from one to another , and back again and round ... Write the simple life of one of these simple men , write the peaceful epic of the days and nights following , following one like to another , and yet all different , all sons of the same mother , from the dawning of the first day in the life of the world .

		Write it simply , as simple as its own unfolding .

		Waste no thought upon the word , and the letter , and the subtle vain researches in which the force of the artists of to-day is turned to naught .

		You are addressing all men : use the language of all men .

		There are no words noble or vulgar ; there is no style chaste or impure : there are only words and styles which say or do not say exactly what they have to say .

		Be sound and thorough in all you do : think just what you think , and feel just what you feel .

		Let the rhythm of your heart prevail in your writings !

		The style is the soul . ''

		This is
M. Holland	PERSON	's literary creed , and out of it has come < - Jean-Christophe . ''

		There is nothing of conventional plot in the book .

		Its connecting thread throughout is the history of a human soul , the soul of
Jean-Christophe Kraft	PERSON	, native of
Germany	LOCATION	, the descendant of several generations of musicians and himself destined to be the greatest musician of them all .

		In physique and will he does not belie his surname ; but his is the strength out of which comes sweetness , a strength that carries him unconquered , though not unscathed , through battle with all the forces that can be sent against a man 's spirit , a strength that inspires and invigorates all who come within its influence .

		Concerning the origin of his book ,
M. Holland	PERSON	has written : `` I was stifling ... in a hostile moral atmosphere , I wanted to breathe , I wanted to react against a sickly civ - ilization .

		... I needed a hero of pure eyes and pure heart , with a soul sufficiently unblemished to have the right to speak , and with a voice strong enough to make itself heard . ''

		Such a hero is Jean -
Christophe	PERSON	; but his purity of eye and heart contains no trace of pharisaism .

		He is a creature of stormy 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	impulses and emotions , who stumbles and blunders as frequently as any , yet who never makes terms with the enemy , whether within or without .

		But the book as a whole is far more than a biog - raphy of
Jean-Christophe Kraft	PERSON	.

		It is an analysis , a synthesis , a criticism of present - day life in all of its most significant phases .

		It is an illuminating estimate of European culture , a sane and penetra - tive discussion of social tendencies , an inspiring handbook of ethics , a profound and eloquent treatise on music , and much else besides .

		We doubt if any other writer since
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	has been so success - ful in clarifying the welter of our contemporary civilization , `` beneath the chaos of facts perceiv - ing the little undistinguished gleam which reveals the progress of the history of the human mind . ''

		Weavers , all of us , of the great fabric of humanity , we are taken for a moment from the tiny segment of our individual labor , and the wide tangle of loose ends which shows for us as the collective labor of our generation , and are granted a glimpse of the ordered design that is slowly taking form on the other side of the fabric .

		And this , in our opinion , is the noblest service that literature can perform . ''

		Jean-Christophe '' is thus before all else an inter - pretation of life , a `` novel of ideas '' in the truest sense .

		But for all that , its chief concern is not with the `` intellectuals '' but with commonest and lowliest humanity .

		The kingdom it portrays is in - herited not by the successful and the arrogant the so-called strong men who are held up so generally in life and in literature as patterns of human conduct , but always by the meek and the poor in spirit .

		Nothing in the book is more typical of its author 's spirit than such a passage as this : ''
Christophe	PERSON	felt utterly weary of the fevered , sterile world , the conflict between egoisms and ideas , the little groups of human beings deeming themselves above hu - manity , the ambitious , the thinkers , the artists who think themselves the brain of the world , and are no more than a haunting , evil dream .

		And all his love went out to those thousands of simple souls , of every nation , whose lives burn away in silence , pure flames of kindness , faith , and sacrifice .

		the heart of the world . ''

		It is the ambition of
M. Holland	ORGANIZATION	's art to help the people '' to live , to correct their errors , to conquer their prejudices , and to enlarge from day to day their thoughts and their hearts . ''

		Understanding as clearly as any the futility and danger of many `` popular '' tendencies , he yet never reacts into that attitude of harsh intolerance or brutal indifference so common among the intellectual classes of to-day .

		It is his belief that the individualist who cuts himself off from sympathetic contact with the mass of mankind repudiates thereby the first law of Christianity . ''

		If any man , '' says
M. Holland	PERSON	, `` would see the living God face to face , he must seek him , not in the empty firmament of his own brain , but in the love of men . ''

		As in every great work of art , this pervading quality of humaneness is here secondary only to the quality of absolute sincerity .

		A love of truth as pas - sionate as
Ruskin	PERSON	's , as uncompromising as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's , glows through every page .

		With TeufelsdrOckh ,
Jean-Christophe	PERSON	never fails to cry : ' < Truth !

		though the heavens crush me for following her : no False - hood !

		though a whole celestial Lubberland were the price of Apostasy . ''

		This high sincerity could scarcely fail to be inherent in a book so largely the distillation of spiritual experience , so little the pro- duct of artifice .

		The work was conceived , as we have seen , in a spirit of intense reaction to falsehood and cant .

		Its author is one who has evidently known the acutest mental and physical suffering , but who yet has courage `` to look anguish in the face and venerate it . ''

		In a day when there is so widespread a tendency not only to repudiate the moral value of suffering , but to fasten upon it a definite stigma of shame , such a courage is as rare as it is salutary .

		It should not be inferred that `` Jean-Christophe '' is any the less appealing and readable as a book of fiction because of the higher qualities emphasized in the foregoing , though of course the book could never interest those who are content with the staple product of our fiction factories .

		Even should the cultivated reader wish to skip rather freely , in the residue he will find a wealth of rare treasure .

		We know of few pages in literature more subtly and tenderly sympathetic than the record of
Christophe	PERSON	's early childhood , more deeply stirring than the spir - itual battle depicted in `` The Burning
Bush	PERSON	, '' more poignantly beautiful than the account of
Christophe	ORGANIZATION	's passing in the final chapter .

		And what a wonderful pageant of human character moves through the book , what a gallery of vivid and varied portraiture !

		Who that has come to know them will ever forget
Jean Michel	PERSON	,
Gottfried	PERSON	, old
Schulz	PERSON	,
Olivier	PERSON	,
Chris	PERSON	- tophe himself , among the men ;
Louisa	LOCATION	,
Sabine	LOCATION	,
Antoinette	PERSON	,
Grazia	PERSON	, among the women ?

		In conclusion , we shall venture the statement that with this work
M. Holland	PERSON	takes his place in con - temporary literature as the spiritual and artistic successor of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		He becomes the standard - bearer around whom will rally the idealistic forces of the new century .

		More profoundly than any other yet offered by this century , the gospel he has given us will inspire and direct those who are toiling in the cause of human brotherhood , '' the free spirits of all nations who suffer , fight , and will prevail . ''

		That he assumes no authority , and claims no fol - lowers , only makes his leadership the more secure .

		He would have us understand almost before all else that human progress , like life itself , is not a smooth - flowing development , but a series of metamorphoses or transmutations ; that each generation must wage its own battle for its own truth , and then without bitterness give place to a younger generation which perchance will carry the combat to a far different quarter of the field .

		To fight is the great duty ; to have fought , the only honor .

		The issue is always in the future ; the hope is always with the new gen - eration .

		In no other way can we more fittingly take leave of this noble book than in the words of its author , appended as a preface to the final volume : '' I have written the tragedy of a generation which is nearing its end .

		I have sought to conceal neither its vices
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 169 nor its virtues , its profound sadness , its chaotic pride , its heroic efforts , Sts despondency beneath the overwhelming burden of a super-human task , the burden of the whole world , the reconstruction of the world 's morality , its esthetic principles , its faith , the forging of a new humanity .

		Such we have been . ''

		You young men , you men of to-day , march over us , trample us under your feet , and press onward .

		Be ye greater and happier than we . ''

		For myself , I bid the soul that was mine farewell .

		I cast it from me like an empty shell .

		Life is a succession of deaths and resurrections .

		We must die ,
Christophe	PERSON	, to be born again . ''


W. R. B. CASUAL	PERSON	COMMENT .

		ENCOURAGEMENT TO POTENTIAL POETS and other persons of bright promise , rather than the recognition of completed achievement , is now declared by one of the witnesses of
Alfred Nobel	ORGANIZATION	's will to have been the Swedish philanthropist 's primary object in estab - lishing the series of prizes bearing his name .

		Mr.
Leonard Hwass	PERSON	has contributed to the German newspaper , Die Woche , a noteworthy article , repub - lished in translation by the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post , '' in which he deplores the failure of the ex - ecutors to '' carry out the will and real intent of the great departed . ''

		After coining the term `` social - economist '' as indicative of `` the entire aim and spirit of the man , '' the writer continues : `` He was a quiet , high-minded , Teutonic aristocrat , an individ - ualist of the first water , who never fixed his hopes upon the elevation of the masses , but upon the encouragement of individuals of high social value .

		To them he wished , through his will , to be an endur - ing friend and patron ; because he recognized that they are the real dispensers of blessings and hap - piness to mankind .

		And because he knew from his own bitter struggles how particularly difficult it is for the noble-minded , often so sensitively and deli - cately organized , to make their way , he wished , as he repeatedly emphatically remarked , ` to lighten the life of the dreamers . '

		... By these ` dreamers ' he meant spirits bent upon high ideals , poets , and inventors , who , unpractical and devoid of means , often go to wrack and ruin in the fulness of their mental powers . ''

		Accordingly the Nobel prize , as the writer feels himself justified in asserting , `` should never be bestowed as an honorary prize , but as a promotive prize for the encouragement of new and beneficent work . ''

		And further : `` According to my impressions ,
Nobel	ORGANIZATION	, who himself wrote some beau - tiful poems , unfortunately unknown , in the Swedish and English tongues , meant by the term ` poet ' rather a noble-minded lyric poet , who lifts us to ideal heights , and who rarely possesses much of this world 's goods , than a dramatist or novelist enjoying a large income .

		The deciding factor was , at all events , not to be fame , but a creative spirit evidently striving for lofty ends .

		In any case , world-renowned person - alities , with an assured future , should be excluded . ''

		Especially unwise , he thinks , was the bestowal of the prize upon the aged
Mommsen	PERSON	and the venerable
Carducci	PERSON	, and upon `` the Pole ,
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, who resided in a knightly castle , and upon the Indian patrician ,
Tagore	PERSON	. ''

		But if fame is to be distrusted as an evidence of a man 's desert in the sense in which the prize-bestowers should look for desert , how shall the suitable candidates be brought to the attention of these
Stockholm	LOCATION	gentlemen ?

		In this wise : `` The press of all countries should cooperate here by taking a yearly vote among their circle of readers , to select a forceful , strenuous spirit that is still struggling with fate , and raise him on his coun - try 's shield . ''

		Even so it would be a miracle if modest merit always or often got its desert ; but it is to be hoped that the words of Mr.
Hwass	PERSON	, who professes to have had intimate acquaintance with
Nobel	PERSON	and with his purpose in founding the prizes called by his name , may not fall on deaf ears .

		AN ARTIST IN TYPOGRAPHY , and a man of culture and fine sympathies , was taken from the world of books and publishing in the recent death of Theodore Low De
Vinne	PERSON	, head of the De
Vinne Press	ORGANIZATION	and author of noteworthy books on the history and prac - tice of printing .

		`` Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	was a kind man as well as a great expert , '' says Mr.
S. S. McClure	PERSON	of his one-time employer , in the autobiography now appearing serially ; and `` the De
Vinne Press	PERSON	was one of the best , if not the best , printing houses in the world '' as it still is .

		`` One of the world 's foremost experts , a wide scholar as well as a great printer , '' is the further description of him by the same competent authority .

		Eighty-five years ago last Christmas Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	was born at
Stamford	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		Honorary degrees from
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	attest the acquisition of a good education on his part , however limited his formal schooling .

		He early learned the printer 's craft , and entered the employment of
Francis Hart	PERSON	in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Rising ere long to the position of partner in the business , and , upon
Hart	PERSON	's death , organizing the firm of
Theodore L. De Vinne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, he became a recog - nized leader in the improvement of typography and formed that association with the
Century Company	ORGANIZATION	which appears to have been advantageous to both parties .

		He was an active member of the Typothetae , of the
Aldine Association	ORGANIZATION	, of the
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- at one time its president -RRB- , the Authors ' Club , and the
Century Club	ORGANIZATION	, while various foreign societies were glad to extend to him the honor of membership .

		His first book was a `` Printers ' Price List , ''
1869	DATE	; then followed , at intervals , `` Invention of Printing , '' `` Historic Types , '' ``
Christopher Plantin	PERSON	, '' `` Plain Printing Types , '' `` Correct Composition , '' `` Title Pages . '' ''

		Book Composition , '' and '' Notable Printers of
Italy	LOCATION	during the
Fifteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		His `` Cor - rect Composition '' is an excellent manual for both printers and authors ; it supplied a real need , and will not soon be superseded .

		A good portrait of this scholarly , broad-minded , progressive , and gentle - mannered master of typography may be seen in the 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1 February	DATE	issue of `` McClure 's Magazine , '' in the chapter there printed of Mr.
McClure	PERSON	's autobiog - raphy - ... THE SECRET OF LITERARY STYLE is perhaps much less of a secret than most of us suspect .

		A manner of written expression at once simple and forceful , lucid and picturesque , colored with imagination , spiced with wit , and touched with humor , does not come by accident or heredity or as a gift from the gods ; it is something achieved by diligent effort on the part of one who has first been kindled with enthusiasm for an unattainable ideal of literary art .

		The late
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	was the master of a style so nearly perfect , in its kind , as to render the reader all but unconscious of its presence : the writer 's thought conveyed itself to others almost without their being aware of the medium of conveyance .

		But this apparent ease of utterance was the result of years of painstaking attention to verbal detail .

		His secretary and literary executor , Mr.
Arnold Haul	PERSON	- tain , gives repeated instances , in his Boswellian account of the eminent publicist 's daily life and con - versation , of his scrupulous care in expressing him - self for publication .

		Near the middle of his volume Mr.
Haultain	PERSON	says : `` It is great fun and it is in - structive to watch these little things .

		I wonder if many octogenarian writers take this care in their style .

		The astonishing thing to me is the extraordi - nary simplicity of the product !

		The Chief will think out an article , a little short article , for a news - paper ; will then write it out in his own hand at eight o'clock in the morning ; will dictate it to me at
9:15	TIME	; will carefully , most carefully , go over my MS. , correcting , altering , adding , and excising ; will demand proofs and revises to be sent to him -LRB- by a special messenger often at
ten cents	MONEY	per special messenger -RRB- ; will then go down to the newspaper office and see another revise ; will correct this ; and , if he does not demand yet another revise , it is simply because he relies upon my seeing to it that his ulti - mate revision is faithfully carried out by the printers in the composing room ; and not until I come down - stairs and report that ` everything is all right ' does he slowly rise and totter out of the office .

		This at eighty !

		What would I not give to have seen him at work at thirty ! ''

		Surely , we have here one im - bued with the belief that easy writing is hard reading .

		LATITUDE IN
LATIN	LOCATION	PRONUNCIATION has gone so far , with the Roman , the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	, the English , and sundry other methods putting forth their claims , that no two Latinists , meeting by chance , can now feel any certainty of being understood by each other if the exigencies of the occasion should call for that famous Plutarchian quotation ,
Veni	LOCATION	, vidi , vici , or if one should wish to compliment the other by calling him , justum et tenacem propositi virum , or if either should desire to give expression to the profound truth , qui facit per aliumfacitper se .

		Some of us , in our occasional airing of such Latin as we possess , first rapidly figure out the probable decade or lustrum in which our hearer 's thumbing of
Cae	ORGANIZATION	* ar and
Virgil	PERSON	was cast , and then shape our pronunciation after the old or the new fashion as the case may seem to require .

		In doubtful instances , or before a mixed audience , we sometimes pronounce our Latin first in the style of our grandfathers , especially if any of our grandfathers or their contemporaries are present , and then , turning with an indulgent smile toward our juniors , we render our Ciceronian eloquence in the so-called Roman manner , for their benefit .

		But this system has its obvious disadvantages , besides its waste of time and breath .

		In
England	LOCATION	, the strong - hold of conservatism in Latin pronunciation as in certain other particulars , the battle of the rival schools is still in progress , although on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	the old pronunciation long ago yielded to the new .

		At a recent meeting of the
Classical Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Bedford College	ORGANIZATION	, the president , Sir
Frederic Kenyon	PERSON	, announced that the Roman method was well in the lead .

		But
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	clings stubbornly to the English fashion , as was to have been expected .

		English Latin is , obviously , the furthest remove from Ciceronian in its effect on the ear , though no one really knows how
Cicero	PERSON	pronounced his words .

		Readers of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	will recall that in '' The Fortunes of Nigel '' King James vaunts the indisput - able fact that Scotch Latin could be understood all over
Europe	LOCATION	, but English Latin nowhere outside of
England	LOCATION	.

		A universally intelligible pronunciation is certainly a desideratum .

		THE LATEST FRENCH ACADEMICIAN ,
M. Alfred Capus	PERSON	, is as popular a playwright in his own smiling , gently ironical , always amusing vein , as is
M. Eugene Brieux	PERSON	-LRB- the next preceding writer for the stage elected to membership in the same illustrious com - pany -RRB- in his intensely earnest and morally purposeful dramatic compositions .

		The one writes for those who have seen the world and its follies , and who refuse to take life too seriously ; the other addresses those who have the tremendous seriousness of youth , whatever their age may be , and are bent on reform - ing their fellow-men .

		Of course , since the plays of
M. Capus	PERSON	are written for the sophisticated and that , too , the sophisticated Parisians they contain much that the average Anglo-Saxon theatre-goer rightly regards as in questionable taste and not pro- vocative of wholesome mirth .

		Moreover , their style is so emphatically French , their wit so merged with the medium in which it is expressed , that the peculiar excellence of the original is largely lost in translation .

		Hence the fewness of the attempts thus far made to transplant the products of this clever Frenchman 's genius , and hence , too , the inconsiderable success attending these attempts .

		But it is interesting to note , as an evidence of the rare quality of the pieces that come so plentifully from the pen of
M. Capus	PERSON	, that the exacting
M. Bourget	PERSON	praises him warmly , and even testified to his high opinion of the man by urging his candidacy upon the Academicians . ''

		He thinks in French and he writes in French , * ' declared
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 171 M. Bourget ; and no one will dispute him .

		A few biographical details may be not out of place , in clos - ing .


Vincent Marie Alfred Capus	PERSON	was born
Nov. 25 , 1858	DATE	; was educated at Aix-en -
Provence	LOCATION	, and at the Lyce'e
Condorcet	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	; is an Officer of the
Legion of Honor	ORGANIZATION	, and has published ''
Qui Perd Gagne	PERSON	, '' ``
Monsieur Veut Rire	PERSON	, '' `` Anne'es d'Aventure , '' `` Notre Epoque et le The'atre , '' and many plays .

		THE CABLYLE OF MYTH AND THE CAELYJLE OF REALITY have by this time become inextricably intertwisted , thanks largely to
Froude	PERSON	's juggling with the records , and also to the world 's well-known fondness for discovering or inventing faults and foibles in the great .

		The
Carlyle	PERSON	of unendurable domestic asperities is the real
Carlyle	PERSON	to many , rather than the
Carlyle	PERSON	described by
Emerson	PERSON	as living in a state of beautiful harmony and mutual affection with his brilliant and attractive wife .

		Mr.
J. P. Collins	PERSON	, in a
London	LOCATION	letter to the
Boston	LOCATION	* ' Transcript , '' brings forward the testimony -LRB- new , perhaps , to many readers -RRB- of the maid
Jessie	PERSON	who waited on the
Carlyles	ORGANIZATION	in the last years of their life together . ''

		I could have lived with him all my days , '' she asserted , `` and it always makes me angry when I read , as I sometimes do , that he was * bad-tempered ' and ` gey ill to get on with . '

		He was the very reverse , in my opinion .

		I never would have left him , had I not been going to get married . ''

		Another glimpse of a not unamiable
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	is given us by this same
Jessie	PERSON	-LRB- later , Mrs.
Broadfoot	PERSON	, of
Thornhill	ORGANIZATION	, Dumfriesshire -RRB- .

		An Amer - ican lion-hunter insisted on seeing the great man , and would not be turned away .

		Finally , in des - peration , says the quondam maid-servant , ''
Carlyle	PERSON	told me to send him in , and when he went in
Carlyle	LOCATION	just stood up from his desk in the back dining - room , in his long dressing-gown , and met him with , ` Well , here I am !

		Take a good look at me . '

		The gentleman was very much taken aback ; but he must have pleased
Carlyle	PERSON	, for I remember he stayed and talked quite a long time . ''

		ACCESSIBLE FOREIGN LITERATURE OF OUR TIME accessible in the sense of translated and procur - able from any good bookstore or public library is richer and better worth reading than is suspected by those whose habitual book-diet is the latest American or English novel .

		A pamphlet issued by the
Omaha Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and entitled `` Foreign Literature in Translation , '' by Miss
Zora I. Shields	PERSON	of the English department in the
Omaha High School	ORGANIZATION	, presents an inviting array of modern
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean -LRB- continental -RRB- authors whom the translator 's art has introduced to the English-speaking public .

		Comment and criticism accompany the list of works , these being exclusively novels and dramas , and it is evident that the writer has read and enjoyed the books she invites others to read and enjoy .

		In closing , she urges upon her readers as a duty , `` to stop wasting time and money on our own empty popular novels and magazine stories '' ; she points to the opportunity , so freely offered , `` to read and know books which open up a new heaven '' ; and she hopes for an eventual fusing of '' Norse enthusiasm , German philosophy , French artistry , Russian mys - ticism , and Latin emotion , into a new American race , American literature . ''

		Translators are fallible mortals , and translations often leave much to be desired , but few of us would have any considerable acquaintance with the world 's literature outside our own language if we depended solely on our own knowledge of foreign tongues to help us to that acquaintance .

		UNSANCTIFIED USES OF SACRED LITERATURE are to be regretfully noted in reading the interesting annual report of the librarian of the General Theo - logical Seminary .

		Even a collection of books de - signed primarily to meet the needs of prospective preachers of the gospel is not exempt from losses due to unregistered borrowing a permissible euphem - ism for a shorter and uglier term .

		A rare edition of
St. Augustine	ORGANIZATION	's `` Confessions , '' for instance , would have another beside its literary value that might tempt to its removal from the shelves , for purposes wholly unconnected with those of study .

		But , what - ever the cause , more than one hundred volumes that have disappeared in the last fifteen years from their proper places in the Seminary library are now at last , in despair of their reappearance , definitely stricken from the lists and mourned as irrecoverable .

		`` They have not been removed before now , '' says the libra - rian , `` because it has been hoped that successive in - ventories and the passing of time might reveal them or restore them , as sometimes occurs with missing books .

		This hope has not been justified with the volumes mentioned .

		The loss is very regrettable ; the Librarian , however , has no theory to account for it other than the devious and inexplainable weak - nesses of human nature . ''

		Nevertheless , faith in the honesty of mankind as a whole has not been destroyed , and this library 's praiseworthy system of unrestricted access to the shelves will be continued .

		A MAYOR WITH NO FONDNESS FOR LITERATURE came pretty near balking the efforts of the
Women 's Club	ORGANIZATION	of
Owensboro	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, to secure a public library for their city .

		In the `` Second Biennial Report '' of the
Kentucky Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	is to be found the astonishing story of this mulish muni - cipal officer .

		After the energetic women of
Owens	PERSON	- boro had raised
$ 3,500	MONEY	, bought a lot , secured a
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	building , and were on the point of opening the library to the expectant public , the city council -LRB- at the mayor 's instigation , one suspects -RRB- refused to grant the necessary appropriation for maintenance of the new institution .

		In fact , three successive councils proved obdurate , and when at last a fourth had passed the ordinance '' the mayor refused to sign the warrants and suit was brought and won in the lower court by the Library Trustees to compel him to sign .

		The mayor then took the case to the
Court of Appeals	ORGANIZATION	.

		The trustees won again .

		The warrants 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	were signed in
March , 1913	DATE	.

		In the meanwhile , the
Women 's Club	ORGANIZATION	, growing impatient at the delay , decided to open the library .

		A book reception re - sulted in the gift of about 1,500 volumes ; the women volunteered service and the doors were then opened to the public .

		During the year ending
July 1 , 1913	DATE	, the circulation reached 11,593 . ''

		All honor to the women of
Owensboro	LOCATION	!

		JAPANESE LITERABT LIKINGS tend more and more toward occidental , and especially toward En - glish and American , books .

		English is the foreign tongue most familiar to the people of
Japan	LOCATION	; hence the considerable number of English and American authors read by them and republished in their own country in translation .

		In drama Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's plays seem to be decidedly popular , both for reading and for stage presentation .

		Professor
Eucken	PERSON	and Professor
Bergson	PERSON	are finding favor there as here .

		The useful part of the translator in introducing these and numerous other foreign authors to his fellow-countrymen receives insuffi - cient recognition , fifty yen -LRB- a little less than twenty -
five dollars	MONEY	-RRB- being commonly paid for turning into the vernacular a work of two hundred pages .

		No wonder the critics complain that the rendering is not always quite what it ought to be .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Readers of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	will be pained to hear of the death of Professor
Josiah Renick Smith	PERSON	, a regular con - tributor to its pages since , perhaps , about the year
1895	DATE	.

		As Professor of Greek in the
Ohio State University	ORGANIZATION	, he was the oldest member of the Faculty in continuous service , and always a man of great weight in its councils .

		That a man should be a skilful teacher , well equipped in his special department , is all that most people ask of one who holds such a position , and somewhat more than is often secured ; but it is not all that the
Ohio State University	ORGANIZATION	found in Professor
Smith	PERSON	.

		He was born with a natural affinity for the higher things of life , and his power of appreciation was confined within no narrow limits .

		With unfailing instinct his affections went out to sincere and genuine excellence in literature , music , and art , nor were his acquisitions in these fields treated merely as food for his own pleasure .

		Distilled through bis own mind , seasoned with the spice of his winning personality , and fitly wrought into the web of his teach - ing , he passed them on to generation after generation of his pupils and so into the life of his time .

		But even a great educational institution could not absorb the whole of such a man .

		His taste in music , disseminated through musical organizations , through the local press , and by contact with individuals , has been by no means the least factor in educating
Columbus	LOCATION	to the point where ade - quate support can be safely assumed for a grade of music entirely out of reach of many cities of the same size .

		His talks on various phases of painting and sculp - ture , enriched by personal acquaintance with most of the great collections abroad and at home , were always a delightful stimulus to those who had the privilege of hearing them .

		He was a member of Dr.
Washington Gladden	PERSON	's church , and there as everywhere else a wise counsellor and willing worker .

		But to those who have had the privilege of coming into close contact with him , the charm of his loyal personal friendship will be felt as the greatest loss of all .

		Considering the ease with which the finer and less obviously '' paying '' phases of education may be swamped beneath the more material and '' practical '' in a great state institution , the author - ities of the
Ohio State University	ORGANIZATION	deserve especial credit for maintaining for so many years at the head of one of its departments , and as an active force in its adminis - tration , so distinctive an apostle of '' culture '' in its higher meaning as Professor
Josiah Renick Smith	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	, in his recent severe but scholarly comments in your columns upon Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's second excursion into Shakespearean fields , makes some severe thrusts at this critic 's interpretation of '' Hamlet , '' but fails to mention that Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	is the first who has taken note of the relation of Hamlet 's '' soliloquy '' to one of the '' lawful espials . ''

		Let me quote the passage of Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's to which I refer : '' Hamlet comes in and thinks himself alone ; and talks to himself in that famous soliloquy ' To be , or not to be : that is the question . '

		To listen to it is not to listen to a madman , and the `` King knows this , and is not deceived when Hamlet , detecting that he is spied on , changes his whole manner to
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	, and does play the madman . ''

		-LRB- The italics are mine . -RRB-

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	, in a letter to me , says that the soliloquy is not heard by the espials .

		I claim that this speech was intended by our playwright to be heard by
Claudius	PERSON	even more deliberately than was
Juliet	PERSON	's solil - oquy intended to be overheard by
Romeo	PERSON	-LRB- '' Romeo and Juliet , '' Act II .

		sc .

		; that it is quite as grim in its eaves-dropping humor , distinct as it is in types , as was the effect of the soliloquy of Prince
Hal upon Falstaff	PERSON	, when the latter simulated a dead hero at
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	-LRB- ''
Henry IV.	PERSON	, '' Part I. Act V. sc .

		iv . -RRB-

		; and certainly it is as impressive as an overheard soliloquy as was the effect of the soliloquy of Enobarbus upon the soldiers when the former thought he was alone -LRB- '' Antony and Cleopatra , '' Act IV .

		sc ix . -RRB-

		.

		But did Shakespeare intend Hamlet to believe him - self alone when , as Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	suggests , the soul of Claudius is affected by the soliloquy with doubt and dread ?

		Did not Shakespeare intend to advise his audience that Hamlet knew he was again entering a trap , as Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	fails to suggest , when the line was written : '' For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither '' ?

		What , if any , is the relation between this line and the words in the preceding scene , '' I am most dreadfully attended '' and '' Were you not sent for ? ''

		?

		I should like to see some communications from your readers discussing this point , i. e. , the relation of Hamlet 's soliloquy to
Claudius	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	is the first critic I have read who has taken any notice of Claudius in this matter .

		SYNDICATE SERVICE AND `` TAINTED BOOK REVIEWS . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		On page 97 of your issue of
February 1	DATE	you published a , communication entitled '' Tainted Book Reviews , '' from a correspondent who signs himself '' Book-buyer , '' which contains about as much misinformation as it is possible to get in a half-page .

		The undersigned are responsible for this syndicate book review proposition and are able , therefore , to give you all the facts necessary to an understanding of its workings .

		We maintain an editorial department which reviews current books for a list of newspapers .

		These book reviews are sold to the newspapers as a news feature .

		Our editors are employed by the newspapers exactly as a newspaper employs any writer or reviewer . ''

		The
Jonesville Eagle	LOCATION	, '' for instance , may pay the village school-teacher to review new books , and every
Friday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	the pedagogue makes his way to the news - paper office with his articles .

		That 's exactly what we do , except we are of the opinion that we do it vastly better , for our editorial department costs several hun - dred dollars a week , and we engage such writers as
Arthur Bartlett Maurice	PERSON	, editor of '' The Bookman '' ;
Charles Hanson Towne	PERSON	-LRB- to review verse -RRB- ;
Kendall Banning	PERSON	, of `` System , '' who reviews business books ;
Albert Payson Terhune	PERSON	, of the
New York	LOCATION	'' World '' ;
Sinclair Lewis	PERSON	, formerly associate editor of `` Adven - ture '' -LRB- who writes the leading review each week -RRB- ;
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	-LRB- literary editor of tHe
New York	LOCATION	^ ` Evening Post '' -RRB- ;
Edwin Bjorkman	PERSON	;
William Rose Benet	PERSON	, of `` The Century Magazine '' ;
Berton Braley	PERSON	; and
Major J. E. Hausmann	PERSON	, of the
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	, who reviews books dealing with the
Philippines	LOCATION	and the Orient .

		It is absurd to intimate , as your cor - respondent does , that these men write '' tainted book reviews . ''

		While we do not know , we nevertheless venture to say that this editorial department costs more for upkeep than the literary review department of any daily news - paper in the
United States	LOCATION	, not excepting even the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times , '' or the
Chicago	LOCATION	`` Tribune . ''

		This is made possible as the result of cooperation on the part of seven or eight newspapers .

		Every newspaper on our list maintains a literary editor who edits the syndicate matter sent out by us , and adapts it to the policy and form of the newspaper .

		We solicit book advertising for a list of newspapers , some of which take our syndicate literary review ser - vice .

		Some of our newspapers do not take it , and as far as the advertising is concerned , it makes no differ - ence to us whether they print our reviews or run their own literary page , provided they produce a good book review section .

		Our advertising and editorial depart - ments are as distinct and separate as the editorial and advertising departments of any newspaper or magazine .

		Your correspondent says that our proposition seems to him to be a sinister move .

		We think your corre - spondent does not know what he is talking about .

		With the possible exceptions of three or four of the big dailies that make a specialty of literary news , the book reviewing of the daily press is done by immature reporters , and people out of a job , and narrow-headed school-teachers , or by somebody who does it '' on the side . ''

		There are innumerable instances of absolutely worthless books being called '' the book of the year , '' and so on , by reviewers of this stripe because such literary productions happened to strike the reviewer 's peculiar fancy .

		Then , we know of cases where really great books were ignored or dismissed with a line or two because the local reviewer had no literary stand - ards or guides , and really had no idea of literature .

		Then , there are many cases of the morbidly perverse or immoral in literature being held up as wonderful and epoch-making productions because they happened to be handed out by the local editor to some long-haired extremist .

		Whatever may be the merits or demerits of our syndicate service , we are sure that its productions are characterized by sanity and true literary perspective .

		The entire book publishing world has endorsed this proposition .

		Our supporters and well-wishers include every book concern of importance and standing in the
United States	LOCATION	, without exception .

		Do you think this would be so if we allowed advertising to `` taint our book reviews '' ?

		Your correspondent states that our reviews are writ - ten by a '' hired corps of men in
New York	LOCATION	who are paid practically by the -LSB- book -RSB- publishers . ''

		This state - ment is not true .

		The book publishers do not contribute , directly or indirectly , to the support of our book review service .

		It is supported entirely by the newspapers .

		We do not want to take up any more of your space , else we would occupy ourselves with making a few more corrections , but think we have said enough to give you a clear idea of our proposition .

		174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	IDEALIST IN PRACTICAL , AFFAIRS .

		* With a keen sense both of the little ironies and comicalities of life , and of its deeper tragedy and pathos , Mr.
Brand Whitlock	PERSON	relates the story of his struggles and successes in words that speak compellingly to our common humanity and hold the attention to the end .

		In a style that has much of that ease and effectiveness that come not by chance , but with long and devoted ser - vice to the art of literary expression , he carries his narrative , '' Forty Years of It , '' through nearly four hundred pages and leaves his readers regretful only of its too-early close .

		A politician with an ardent fondness for poetry is not to be found in a long day 's search , nor is a poet with a decided bent for politics very often to be met with ; but in Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	we have primarily the poet , the dreamer , the idealist , and secondarily the practical man who knows how to turn politics to good account in the realization of some of his visions of civic betterment and social welfare .

		Yet in the face of all he has achieved as the head of a city government during four consecutive terms eight years in all , with the apparent certainty of reelection and the prospect of indefinite con - tinuance in office had he consented thus to serve his fellow-citizens longer it is asserted of him by the one who prefaces his book with a few introductory pages that he '' is an artist , a born artist .

		His natural place is in a world unknown and undreamed of by us children of an age com - missioned to carry out the great idea of industrial and political development .

		He belongs by birth - right in the eternal realm of divine impossibili - ties , of sublime and delightful inconsistencies .

		Greatly might he have fulfilled his destiny in music , in poetry , in painting had he been born at one of those periods when spiritual activity was all but universal , when spiritual ideas were popular and dominant , volitantesper or a virum , part of the very air one breathed in the
Greece	LOCATION	of
Pericles	LOCATION	, the
England	LOCATION	of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, or on the Tuscan hills at the time of the Florentine Renaissance !

		But this was not to be . ''

		Thus Mr.
Albert Jay Nock	PERSON	, whose glowing eulogy of the spiritual qualities and the artistic tempera - ment of Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	must not be allowed to veil from us the warm human nature of the man and the admirable catholicity of his sympathies .

		These characteristics will show themselves as we * FORTY YTCARS OF IT .

		pass his life rapidly in review and illustrate some of its phases with passages from his book .

		Born at
Urbana	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
March 4 , 1869	DATE	, the son of
Elias D. Whitlock	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, he was named after his maternal grandfather ,
Joseph Carter Brand	PERSON	, a character rich in entertainment to the reader of his grandson 's description of him .

		Public schools and private instruction provided the boy with such formal book-learning as was to be his portion , and at eighteen he entered upon the work of a newspaper reporter at
Toledo	LOCATION	.

		Three years later he joined the staff of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Herald , '' and after still another three years accepted the position of clerk in the office of the
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	at
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, chiefly , it appears , that he might find time to fit himself for the practice of law .

		His legal studies were pursued under the guidance of Senator
John M. Palmer	PERSON	, and admission to the
Illinois	LOCATION	bar followed in
1894	DATE	, and to the
Ohio	LOCATION	bar in
1897	DATE	, the year of his relinquishing his post at
Springfield	LOCATION	.

		Since then he has been engaged in the practice of his profession at
Toledo	LOCATION	, in the writing of essays , stories , poems , and novels , and , from
1906	DATE	to
1913	DATE	, in dis - charging the duties of mayor of his city , to the evident contentment of a majority of its citizens .

		His writings make a most creditable showing , especially when it is remembered that they were the product of his spare hours , labors of love in the midst of the exacting demands of less con - genial but more surely remunerative occupa - tions .

		The list includes `` The 13th District , '' '' Her Infinite Variety , '' '' The Happy Average , '' `` The Turn of the Balance , '' ``
Abraham Lin	PERSON	- coln '' -LRB- in the series of `` Beacon Biographies '' -RRB- , `` The Gold Brick , '' `` On the Enforcement of Law in Cities , '' and various essays , poems , and short stories contributed to leading magazines .

		Having now too long withheld attention from the book under consideration , let us demonstrate its worth and illustrate the distinctive character of its style and method by some generous cita - tions from its pages .

		Here is a picture of the author 's grandfather ,
Joseph Carter Brand	PERSON	, near the end of a life nobly lived in a spirit of sturdy independence and of steadfast loyalty to truth and justice : '' He was always like that , following the truth as he saw it , wherever it led him .

		But his active days were not many after that ; ere long he was kicked by one of his horses , a vicious animal , half bronco , which he insisted on riding , and he was invalided for the rest of his days .

		He spent them in a wheel-chair , pushed about by a negro boy .

		It was ft cross he bore bravely enough , without complaint , spending his hours in reading of politics , now that he could no longer participate in them , and more and more in reading verse , and even in committing it to
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 175 memory , so that to the surprise of his family he soon replaced the grace he had always said at table with some recited stanza of poetry , and he took to cultivating , or sitting in his chair while there was cultivated , under his direction , a little rose garden .

		He knew all those roses as though they were living persons : when a lady called , if the roses were in bloom , he would say to his colored house-boy : ' Go cut off
Madame Maintenon	PERSON	, and bring her here . ''

		It must have been from this grandfather , born in
Kentucky	LOCATION	of a slave-holding family , but hating slavery so bitterly that he forfeited his patrimony and betook himself into the ad - joining free
State	ORGANIZATION	, that Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	inherited many of his finer qualities .

		Brand , like his grandson after him , achieved civic distinction , or had it thrust upon him , being introduced to the reader as mayor of
Urbana	LOCATION	in the opening pages of the book .

		What is said above about his `` following the truth as he saw it , '' could with equal truth be said of the writer of those words .

		While still in his ` teens he showed a spirit of revolt against the sacred tenets of the protective tariff system , catching this alarming heresy from the congressman of his district ,
Frank Hurd	PERSON	, a man of such brilliant parts that , apparently , his free-trade principles did not do him much injury as a politician even with his high-tariff constituents . ''

		I was by this time a youth of eighteen , and in the
summer	DATE	when he had come home from
Washington	LOCATION	I somehow found courage enough to go to the hotel where he lived , and to inquire for him .

		He was there in the lobby , standing by the cigar-stand , talking to some men , and I hung on the outskirts of the little group until it broke up , and then the fear I had felt vanished when he turned and smiled upon me .

		I told him that I wished to know about Free Trade , and since there was nothing he liked better to talk about , and , too , since there were few who could talk better about any - thing than he could talk about the tariff , we sat in the big leather chairs while he discoursed simply on the subject .

		It was the first of several of these conversa - tions , or lessons , which we had in the big leather chairs in the lobby of the old
Boody House	ORGANIZATION	, and it was not long until I was able , with a solemn pride , to announce at home that I was a Free-Trader and a Democrat .

		It could hardly have been worse had I announced that I had been visiting Ingersoll , and was an atheist .

		Cleve - land was president , and in time he sent his famous tariff-reform message to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and though I could not vote , I was preparing to give him my moral sup - port , to wear his badge , and even , if I could do no more , to refuse to march in the Republican processions with the club of young men and boys organized in our neighborhood . ''

		Passing over a dozen years , we chance upon the following glimpse of the young man in his newly - opened law office in Toledo : '' The little law office had a portrait of
William Dean Howells	PERSON	on its walls , and in time the portraits of other writers , differing from those other law offices which prefer to be adorned with pictures of Chief Justice
Marshall	PERSON	a strong man , of course , who wrote some strong fiction , too , in his day and of
Hamilton	PERSON	and of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, indicating a catholicity or a confusion of prin - ciple on the part of the occupying proprietor , of which usually he is not himself aware .

		^ There were a few law books , too , and on the desk a little digest of the law of evidence as affected by the decisions of the
Ohio	LOCATION	courts .

		I had the noble intention of mastering it , but I did not read in it very much , since for a long while there was no one to pay me for doing so , and I spent most of my hours at my desk over a manuscript of '' The 13th Dis - trict , '' a novel of politics I was then writing , looking up now and then and gazing out of the window at the blank rear walls of certain brick buildings which made a dreary prospect , even if one of them did bear , as I well remem - ber , the bright and reassuring legend , Money to Loan at 6 per cent . ' ''

		Noteworthy are the pen-sketches that the book contains of various more or less celebrated men with whom the writer had been somewhat intimate , or whom he had at least beheld now and then 1 in their less studied attitudes .

		Gov - ernor
Altgeld	LOCATION	, Senator
Palmer	PERSON	,
James G. Blaine	PERSON	, '' Golden Rule '' Jones , Mayor '' Tom ''
Johnson	PERSON	these are some of the interesting characters that Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	helps us to know better than before ; and in sketching them he somehow , one feels , involuntarily but most graphically delin - eates himself .

		Here is an illuminating page from the latter part of the book , where the au - thor is looking back upon the din and turmoil of his political experience : '' I used to be haunted continually by a horrid fear that I should lose the possibility of ever winning the power of utterance , since no such prudence -LSB- as the politician 's -RSB- is at all compatible with the practice of any art .

		For art must , first of all , be utter sincerity , the artist 's business is to think out his thoughts about life to the very end , and to speak them as plainly as the power and the ability to speak them have been given to him ; he must not be afraid to offend ; indeed , if he succeed at all , he must certainly offend in the beginning .

		I am quite aware that I may seem incon - sistent in this notion , since I have intimated my belief that
Jones	PERSON	was an artist ; and so he was , in a way , and , if I do not fly to the refuge of trite sayings and allege him as the exception that proves the rule , I am sure that I may say , and , if I have in the least been able to convey any distinct conception of his personality , the reader will agree with me when I say , that he was sui generis .

		And besides it was not as a politician that he won his success .

		Had he ventured outside the political jurisdiction of his own city the politicians instantly would have torn him asunder because he had not been 1 regular . '

		And that , I find , when I set it down , is pre - cisely what I am trying to say about the artist ; he must not be regular .

		Every great artist in the world has been irregular , as irregular as
Corot	LOCATION	, going forth in the early morning in search of the elusive and ineffable light of dawn as it spread over the earth and stole through the greenwoods at Barbizon , or as Manet , or
Monet	ORGANIZATION	, or any other man who never knew appreciation in his lifetime .

		And
Jones	PERSON	and all like him are brothers of those incom - 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	parable artists ; they are not kin in any way to the world 's politicians . ''

		And so , that he might be more truly and completely an artist , Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	announced his decision not tojbe again a candidate for the mayoralty an announcement received with incredulity by the politicians , because politi - cians so seldom mean what they say in making similar announcements .

		But there was no mental reservation this time , and literature is likely to be the gainer by reason of the sincerity of the declaration .

		Readers of the book here discussed , a book that can not fail to be widely read as a sincere and also a rather extraordi - nary piece of autobiographic writing , will rejoice in the prospect of further productions from the same pen .

		RECORDS OF ANCIENT
GREECE	LOCATION	.

		* To write a single-volume history of
Greece	LOCATION	lays heavy demands on various qualities courage , accurate scholarship , breadth of vision , and a sure sense of perspective .

		To these must be added close adherence to a definite plan .

		It would be too much to say that all these have been fully met by Mr.
Cotterill	PERSON	in his `` Ancient
Greece	LOCATION	. ''

		The range of the field from Aegean times to Alexander the Great , i. e. , from
3000	DATE	B.C. to 330
B.C.	LOCATION	embraces all that is known or inferred or conjectured about Greek civiliza - tion through about twenty-seven centuries ; and to cover this in a book of 500 pages might well give the most intrepid writer pause .

		In his approach to a succes d'estime , however , Mr.
Cotterill	PERSON	has done an interesting and useful work , which represents the results of extensive study and a liberal endowment of the qualities mentioned above .

		In his treatment of the Aegean period he makes full use of the readjustments necessitated by the recent discoveries in
Crete	LOCATION	and other islands and helps us to feel the enchantment of Minoan and Mycenaean art .

		Homer and the Homeric question are lightly touched , Mr.
Cotterill	PERSON	giving his adhesion to the view that both the Iliad and the Odyssey `` owe their main structure and most of their details to one great poet , that the age which he depicted was no mere fiction , and that he lived near enough * ANCIENT GHEECB .

		In the Dark Age ,
1100	DATE	- 776 B. c. , many things were done , but few records were left .

		It was a time of migrations and invasions , whose full significance was re - vealed in later days .

		The Age of Colonization was the magnificent feature of
Greater Greece	LOCATION	.

		As Mr.
Cotterill	PERSON	says : `` Not only , as in the case of our Elizabethan age , did the opening up of new worlds stir the imagination and enlarge the vision of Greek poets and deepen the insight of Greek thinkers , but the existence of
Greater Hellas	ORGANIZATION	had much influence in devel - oping , for good or for evil , the imperial policy of
Athens	LOCATION	in the days of her power , and in determining her fate . ''

		Over the beaten ground of the Age of Peisistratos and the Persian invasions the au - thor advances with alert and assured steps , telling us no new facts , but revealing his own attitudes of mind toward nations and individ - uals .

		It is interesting to see him saying a good word for the Persian character as superior to that of the Greek in some important points .

		Stories are told of the Persian kings ' acts of magnanimity , and of their `` contempt for the huckstering and rhetorical arts of the Greek agora , as well as for the venality and treachery of not only the ordinary Greek but even of Greek leaders . ''

		Father Herodotus is praised and sustained ; Demosthenes treated with scant favor , and
Philip	LOCATION	with reluctant admiration .

		Mr.
Cotterill	PERSON	s paragraphs on the architec - ture of
Greece	LOCATION	are perfunctory and defective .

		He speaks of the mutules of the Doric temple as if they were the guttae ; calls the Poseidon temple at
Paestum	LOCATION	simply ''
Paestum	LOCATION	, '' ignoring the temple of
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	; and retains the tradi - tional view of Corinthian as an independent order from
Ionic	LOCATION	.

		On the other hand , his treatment of sculpture is satisfying and up to date ; and if picked out and published separately would make a good manual of the subject .

		Some slight inaccuracies may be noted .

		Syracuse and
Megara	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 118 -RRB- are certainly not on the `` south-western side '' of
Sicily	LOCATION	; and
Xenophon	PERSON	's birth is now generally accepted as having taken place in 431
B.C.	LOCATION	, not 444 : he calls himself with emphasis a `` young man '' in the
Anabasis	LOCATION	.

		The book is sumptuously illustrated with re - productions of Greek art , the colored vase plates being unusually fine ; and is on the whole a welcome contribution in the field of Kultur - geschichte .

		1914 -RSB- 177 Somewhere about 160 A.D. , old dry-as-dust
Pausanias	PERSON	made that celebrated periegesis or tour through
Greece	LOCATION	, and left his exasperating but indispensable account of it , to be the vade mecum of all classical archaeologists ever since .

		It would hardly be going too far to call Pro- fessor
Weller	PERSON	the modern
Pausanias	PERSON	, so far as
Athens	LOCATION	is concerned .

		His recently published volume may well take the place of the ancient Periegete for those who have not access to
Frazer	PERSON	's monumental six - volume edition .

		Even so , the book is physically too heavy -LRB- it weighs just two pounds fourteen ounces , avoirdupois -RRB- to be carried round like a
Baedeker	LOCATION	.

		Too bad that it could not have been printed on thin opaque paper and reduced to portable size .

		With these objections removed , Professor
Weller	PERSON	's work would be an ideal guide-book to the City of the Violet Crown .

		He follows
Pausanias	PERSON	's route with conscien - tious though not slavish exactness ; beginning at the
Dipylon	LOCATION	gate , working through the Hellenic , Hellenistic , and Roman agoras , the south and south-east quarters , the
Acropolis	LOCATION	,
Puyx	LOCATION	,
Areo	ORGANIZATION	- pagus ,
Cerameicus	PERSON	, and so back to the
Dipylon	LOCATION	.

		There is a supplementary chapter on the Peiraeus and the harbors .

		With scholarly reserve and caution Professor
Weller	PERSON	conducts his readers through the ruins of the ancient city ; presuming on their part a decent acquaintance with the re - sults and conclusions of modern archasologists .

		The descriptions of the
Acropolis	LOCATION	and the older structures which preceded the
Parthenon	LOCATION	and the
Erechtheum	LOCATION	are illuminating ; though as always , the study of the details of the
Erech	LOCATION	- theum ends in a shake of the head .

		Professor
Weller	PERSON	's style , like his plan , follows that of his Greek prototype it is a bit dry .

		He leaves to others , like
Mahaffy	PERSON	,
Barrows	LOCATION	, and Mrs.
Allinson	PERSON	, the raptures so hard to leave out of a book on
Greece	LOCATION	, and attends strictly to his task , which is to prepare a precise and learned topographical guide to the architectural and sculptural remains of ancient
Athens	LOCATION	; and this he has done with complete success .

		The book is profusely illustrated with repro - duced photographs of every important monu - ment and many works of sculpture .

		The plans are most helpful ; the maps a little sketchy .

		In the matter of spelling there is some inconsist - ency : we have '' choragus '' and '' choregus , '' the Calydonian hunt ranges far afield to `` Caledonian '' -LRB- p. 342 -RRB- ; and Latin termina - tions are very generally used , e.g. , '' Dipylum , '' '' propylum , '' '' Heroum , '' etc. .

		SYNGE AND THE IRISH THEATRE .

		* Of the two books before us ,
Lady Gregory	PERSON	's is the romance of the Irish theatre , with
Synge	PERSON	as the most strikingly romantic figure in it ;
M. Bourgeois	PERSON	's is in part the biography of Synge , with a matter-of-fact history of the theatre .

		From the former work one gets an impression of the struggle and strife , and yet withal the abounding joyousness , of those who labored in the cause ; from the latter one comes into close touch with the man
Synge	PERSON	, one realizes his genius , and one comprehends in some meas - ure the effect of his plays upon the Irish dra - matic movement .

		Lady
Gregory	PERSON	also , perhaps unconsciously , shows very plainly of what stuff the workers were made , and why it was that they ultimately attained success .

		No one can read her book without being impressed by her indom - itable courage , her conscientious devotion to what she believed to be just and right , her patience and faith in the face of seemingly insu - perable obstacles .

		What Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	once said in a letter to her was characteristic of them both : '' Any fool can fight a winning battle , but it needs character to fight a losing one , and that should inspire us ; which reminds me that I dreamed the other night that I was being hanged , but was the life and soul of the party .

		Both Lady
Gregory	PERSON	and M. Bourgeois give virtually the same account of the history of the Irish theatre , though , of course , the former is much more personal and intimate .

		There was first the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre , by Messrs.
Yeats	PERSON	,
Martyn	PERSON	, and
Moore	PERSON	and
Lady Gregory	PERSON	, with the purpose of making a national and a literary theatre to offset the unliterary commercialism of the British theatre .

		Only En - glish actors were then available , and after three years the experiment came to an end .

		Then the Fay brothers conceived the idea of having Irish actors for Irish plays ; and the
Irish National Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	, with Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	as the first pres - ident and with headquarters at
Molesworth Hall	PERSON	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, was the result .

		A
week-end	DATE	visit to
London	LOCATION	in
1903	DATE	led to
Miss Horniman	LOCATION	's re - modelling and enlarging the old Mechanics ' Institute in
Abbey Street	ORGANIZATION	, which later became known as the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	.

		178 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	theatre , the five-years ' struggle with the Crown for theatrical independence in
Dublin	LOCATION	was at an end .

		The next kind of difficulty encountered was about the plays that should or should not be presented .

		Already in
1899	DATE	, when Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's ''
Countess Kathleen	PERSON	'' was given a first perform - ance by the Irish Literary Theatre , objections were raised on the ground of the play 's unor - thodox character .

		There was '' booing '' and hooting in the gallery on the part of some who saw in the play an '' insult to their faith . ''

		This opposition did not amount to much ; it was merely a warning of what was to come later .

		The next note came with the production of
Synge	PERSON	's '' Shadow of the Glen '' ; but here again there was comparatively little trouble .

		The real fight came when '' The Playboy of the Western World '' was put on the boards , in
January of 1907	DATE	.

		`` The audience broke up in disorder at the word shift , '' as Lady
Gregory	PERSON	put it in a telegram to Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	at the end of the play .

		The battle continued every night during the week in which the managers had announced that the play would be acted . ''

		It was a definite fight for freedom from mob censorship , '' says Lady
Gregory	PERSON	; and at the end of the week the battle had been won .

		The next fight was over the presentation by the
Abbey Theatre Company	ORGANIZATION	of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's `` The Shewing-up of Blanco Posnet . ''

		It is refreshing to see with what vigor Lady
Gregory	PERSON	fought in the cause she had so sincerely at heart , whether it was with the mob or with the Lord Lieutenant himself .

		In this fight it was
Dublin Castle	ORGANIZATION	, the representative of Majesty , whom she was to oppose ; and again she was victorious .

		She and Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	and , of course , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	refused to accept the
Castle	ORGANIZATION	's opinion that a play should be banned in
Ireland	LOCATION	because it had been banned by the Censor in
England	LOCATION	.

		No Irishman or Irishwoman would stand that .

		As Lady
Gregory	PERSON	said to the permanent official at the
Castle	ORGANIZATION	, '' We did not give in
one quarter	DATE	of an inch to
Nationalist Ireland	LOCATION	at the Playboy , and we certainly can not give in one quarter of an inch to the Castle . ''

		And they did not , even though they risked losing their license and being fined X300 .

		Nothing happened .

		At the end of the first performance there was a tre - mendous burst of cheering , and they knew they had won .

		Though still forbidden in
England	LOCATION	, the play remains on the Abbey Theatre reper - toire , and is always played with success and without let or hindrance .

		The last scene of Lady
Gregory	PERSON	's battlesome adventures is laid in the
United States	LOCATION	, and the bone of contention is again '' The Playboy . ''

		She gives a detailed account of her experiences ; but they are all so recent that it is unnecessary to review them here .

		She exonerates the native American from all blame , and excuses the so - called Irish-American , who , she believes , was acting under instructions from the Irish in
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		She is slightly caustic towards
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , where they had a riot , as in
New York	LOCATION	, and where the whole cast was arrested , as not in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Altogether , the Irish in this country found Lady
Gregory	PERSON	too much for them , and the later performances were as peaceful as those of `` The Old Homestead . ''

		The biographical and historical parts of
M. Bourgeois	ORGANIZATION	's work are very well done .

		We have a plain unvarnished tale of the Irish theatrical and dramatic movement up to and including
Synge	PERSON	's part in it .

		We have , moreover , a very engaging picture of Synge himself , of his unconventional ways , his picturesque profanity , his indifference to dress , and withal his manly and sympathetic soul .

		The volume has no fewer than five portraits of Synge , so that one may judge as to the correctness of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's re - mark that he had a face like a blacking brush .

		The critical part of the book is , however , not so satisfactory .

		The question of the foreign influence in
Synge	LOCATION	's work is played with rather than mastered .

		One is led to believe that there was some foreign influence , but exactly what it was or how it manifested itself we are not spe - cifically told .

		It is unsatisfactory and uncon - vincing to leave the question thus : '' The foreign element was imbibed immediately and mingled with the substance of his inmost temperament ; and in many cases there seemed to exist a sort of pre-established harmony which facilitated the blending and made the two terms practically indistinguishable . ''

		In the criticisms of the several plays , moreover , M. Bourgeois does not show that grasp of his subject which should appear in so pretentious a volume as this .

		Great as is '' Riders to the Sea , '' it seems hyperbolic criticism to call it ''
Synge	PERSON	's absolutely unques - tioned and well-nigh flawless masterpiece , '' `` one of the most remarkable achievements in British play-making , and a dramatic episode of exceptional human interest . ''

		Professor
Wey	PERSON	- gandt has well pointed out that the play is less representative of
Synge	PERSON	than some others , for it is written on one note the note of the dirge , it has no humor , and it is less original , being reminiscent of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 179 and of
Edward Martyn	PERSON	.

		Both `` The Playboy '' and `` Deirdre '' have a vaster sweep .

		It seems also beside the mark to criticize `` The Tinker s Wedding '' unfavorably because of `` its ludi - crous representation of a young tinker woman as an
earnest Catholic	LOCATION	, its malignant portraiture of a covetous priest , the grotesque blasphemy of its language . ''

		Religious hypocrisy is a legitimate subject for satire , and has been from Chaucer down .

		M. Bourgeois ignores the su - perb vitality of the characters , and the '' pathos so poignant of the quick passing of all good things , '' as Professor
Weygandt	PERSON	expresses it .

		The criticism of '' The Playboy '' is also un - satisfactory .

		The suggestion is put forward that this piece is meant by
Synge	PERSON	not only as a humorous and allegorical impersonation of poetic and creative souls in general , but also as an ironical vision of the dramatist 's own personal attitude throughout his `` comedy . ''

		The Play - boy is Synge himself , who mystifies the public as the Playboy did the Mayo countryfolk , so that they '' have not yet been able to decide whether his ' comedy ' is a work of serious portraiture or of fanciful tomfoolery . ''

		An allegorical inter - pretation is as dangerous as it is alluring , and such an interpretation of Synge is fatal .

		Synge was highly impersonal in his plays ; he had no thesis to demonstrate , no point to prove .

		We have the
Playboy	ORGANIZATION	's discovery of himself as `` a likely gaffer in the end of all , '' and that is comedy ; and we have the discovery of herself by
Pegeen Mike	PERSON	in her first disillusionment , and that has in it the elements of tragedy .

		There is much riotous extravagance in the play , but to think of it as mere `` fanciful tomfoolery '' is absurd .

		It is the most original and striking of
Synge	PERSON	's plays ; and the sooner we free our minds of prejudices , national , religious , and moral , the sooner shall we come to a just estimate of its worth .

		`` Deirdre of the Sorrows , '' `` being unfin - ished , '' is given scant treatment by
M. Bour	PERSON	- geois .

		Yet it differs so much from
Synge	PERSON	's other work , while at the same time showing re - markable resemblances , that it deserves greater consideration .

		It comes more from
Synge	PERSON	's own personal emotions than any other play , since while writing it he knew the pain of love in the presence of death .

		It is this fact , as
M. Bourgeois	PERSON	says , `` that gives the play its su - preme beauty . ''

		The appendices contain among other helpful things a very full and valuable bibliography of
Synge	PERSON	's work , and of the critical material relat - ing to it .

		THE CONCLUSION OF Two IMPORTANT AMERICAN HISTORIES .

		* The present generation has witnessed a won - derful change in American historical writing , both in quantity and in character .

		A gener - ation ago the standard histories were those of
Bancroft	LOCATION	and
Hildreth	PERSON	; there were some others of worth , but none as comprehensive or as well known .

		Bancroft 's work ended with the adop - tion of the Constitution ,
Hildreth	PERSON	's with the administration of
John Q. Adams	PERSON	.

		Bancroft saw everything from the point of view of intense patriotism and noble devotion , and in all and over all the directing hand of
Providence	LOCATION	;
Hil	PERSON	- dreth was an intense Federalist , and tended to Constitution-worship .

		These men set the pace , and their successors have followed in their steps , often attempting to follow both leaders .

		For subject-matter these historians have con - fined themselves to details of war and politics .

		Men have fought bravely and died nobly in de - fense of our country and of the cause of freedom .

		Others have come into the limelight of executive power or legislative position , and there , debating over slavery , the tariff , nullification , secession , foreign affairs , etc. , have ground out the raw material of history .

		Few , if any , historians of a generation ago looked very far beneath the surface of things to see if all this fighting and oratory and legislation were really prompted by devotion to native land and the cause of human freedom .

		Indeed , hardly anything other than the glory of war and the pomp of power , in which the well-born had taken a leading part , was considered worthy of notice .

		A generation ago American history was just beginning to secure recognition as providing a good basis for serious study in our scheme of education .

		A few chairs for the teaching of this subject had already been established ; but now they began to multiply , and the holders of these chairs began to study seriously the sources , and to write as well as to teach .

		One of these stu - dents was Professor
John Bach	PERSON	Me Master , the first volume of whose '' History of the People of the
United States	LOCATION	'' appeared thirty years ago .

		Instead of confining himself to the generals and warriors in the foreground , he purposed to bring out the people in the background .

		For sources , instead of confining himself to speeches * A HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES .

Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	and official documents , he depended largely upon the most ephemeral of literature the newspapers .

		The first chapter of his first vol - ume gives us a cross-sectional view , from top to bottom , of the nation at the close of the Revolu - tion .

		It treats of population , the occupations of the people , the kind of houses they lived in , their furniture , the books they read , their edu - cation , their diseases and doctors , their religion , amusements , method of travel , the condition of the laboring classes , including house servants , and of convicts .

		Then follow matters of politics and more of economic and social conditions , sometimes separate , sometimes interwoven .

		This was something new in historical writing .

		Historians of the old school looked at it askance , declared the result bizarre , and pointed to inac - curacies due to the nature of the sources .

		Errors in plenty have been found , but for the most part they are of minor importance and do not seriously affect the value of the work .

		Un - disturbed by such criticism , Professor
McMaster	PERSON	has pursued the even tenor of his way , and now has given us the eighth and concluding volume of his history , covering the period of 1850-1861 .

		All the succeeding volumes since the first have followed the same general plan , and the last volume is no exception , though a relatively greater amount of space is devoted to politics .

		On this theme of politics , it is difficult to see that the author has made any improvement upon what has already been written , especially on the work of Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	.

		The lacter has indeed set a standard that will be difficult to surpass ; yet it has been several years since he covered this period , and a number of important papers have appeared dealing with particular incidents .

		One can not but ask if the last word has been said , for example , on the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise	ORGANIZATION	and on the
Dred Scott Decision	ORGANIZATION	.

		Inevitably Professor
McMaster	PERSON	has had much to say of slavery , both as a social institution and as a political force .

		Among the anti-slavery forces Helper s '' Impending Crisis '' certainly deserves attention ; but one is particu - larly surprised that any man could write a his - tory of this period with no mention of
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	and ''
Uncle Tom	PERSON	's Cabin . ''

		But if slavery was the dominating issue in politics , it was not the only interest of the American people during the period dealt with ; and Professor
McMaster	PERSON	makes this clear in his account of social conditions and economic activ - ities .

		Whether he is writing of the rush to
California	LOCATION	or the Angel Gabriel in
New York	LOCATION	, of the introduction of horse cars in cities or the building of railroads in the west , of `` Nativism '' or '' Bloomerism , '' of labor strikes or the de - mand for women 's rights , it is an interesting tale that he tells .

		One reads with astonishment of the riots which broke out in certain cities when the railroads were trying to come to a common gauge ; to-day we should come nearer a riot if they should attempt to adopt varying standards .

		One of the most noteworthy features of this , and indeed of all the preceding volumes , is the impersonal tone of the text .

		Professor Mc - Master has given us a good deal of economic history , but he can scarcely be called an econ - omic interpreter .

		On the contrary , he is simply a photographer .

		One can not believe that this is due to any limitations ; rather , it is a matter of deliberate choice .

		Sometimes the interpre - tation is clearly evident .

		For example , when the cab-drivers and draymen and keepers of pie-counters in
Erie	LOCATION	were tearing up the rail - road tracks of common gauge , it was because their business was being threatened , just as was the case with
Demetrius	PERSON	and the silversmiths at
Ephesus	LOCATION	.

		But the interpretation is not so obvious in every case .

		The interplay of politics and economics is not always on the surface .

		Professor
McMaster	PERSON	has sought to push the slavery question a little back from the fore - ground , so that it will not obscure the rest of the picture .

		Not everyone will see in slavery simply a dominating phase of the world-old labor problem .

		Other phases of this problem were observable then , and since the abolition of slavery they have come into the foreground of politics .

		Even the term `` slavery '' is now often used in speaking of men , women , and children nominally free ; and legislatures are being called upon to make their freedom real , just as men were then calling for the freedom of the negro .

		In a sense , the condition of the master has improved .

		The slave-owner was sure of his labor supply , but was burdened with the care and support of his laborers ; to-day the master is freed from this latter responsibility , though he is not always absolutely sure of his labor supply .

		On the other hand , the laborer is not sure of food and shelter .

		Another historian who has covered pretty much the same ground as Professor
McMaster	PERSON	is Mr.
James Schouler	PERSON	, whose first volume appeared three years before the first volume of
McMaster	PERSON	, and whose third `` last '' volume has recently come from the press .

		Originally his work closed with the fifth volume , which dealt
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 181 with the period immediately preceding the Civil War .

		Then a sixth was added to cover that great struggle ; and now , after a lapse of four - teen years , the seventh and very last is added to cover the Reconstruction period .

		Above and beyond u good general health , abundant leisure , an active mind , and confirmed habits of indus - try '' impelling to labor , the chief reason for this breaking silence , Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	tells us , was a desire to vindicate the much misunderstood and much maligned
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	.

		The material for this vindication he has found in the recently-published
Johnson	PERSON	papers and the '' Diary of
Gideon Welles	PERSON	. ''

		The specific task which the author set for himself has been well performed .

		It was not difficult .

		Scarcely any first-rate historian would now be so hardy as to hold a brief for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	during this period .

		Its folly and ignominy are well established .

		The legal-minded Professor
Burgess	PERSON	accepts its theory , but utterly con - demns its acts ; the legal views of
Johnson	PERSON	-LRB- or of Seward ? -RRB-

		he praises , but condemns his theories and mixes ridicule with praise in speaking of his character .

		Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	and Professor
Dunning	PERSON	are considered by Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	as somewhat fairer than some other historians , but he does not believe that they give the President his due .

		Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	, in common with Professor
Burgess	PERSON	, makes much of
Johnson	PERSON	's lowly birth and breed - ing as unfitting him for high station , and Pro- fessor
Dunning	PERSON	's discovery that his first message was largely the work of
George Bancroft	PERSON	has been used to represent the President as too ignorant to perform the duties of his office .

		That
Johnson	PERSON	was born in humble station and had few advantages in early life , Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	finds undeniable , but adds that he had what is far better than the association of `` gentlemen born , '' and that was '' an angel of a wife . ''

		His steady rise in a society somewhat aristocratic is all the more to his credit , and could have been based on nothing else than innate ability .

		His lapse from sobriety on the occasion of being inducted into office the author is sure was the last , and his proof of this is as convincing as that of the President 's detractors .

		That he was undignified on occasion is true ; but in that supreme hour of trial , the impeachment , his bearing certainly was superior to that of his enemies , `` gentlemen born '' though some of them claimed to be .

		In an age of nascent cor - ruption , he was so absolutely above reproach that not even a most suspicious
Congress	ORGANIZATION	could find the least stain of this sort upon his char - acter .

		Even a draft contributed by an admirer for his defense was not used .

		Not only that , but he was above nepotism , which ran riot under his successor ; nor did he make any undue use of patronage .

		The `` vindication '' part of his work , Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	has performed well , for he has had the good sense not to try to paint his hero as per - fect .

		But as a history of the Reconstruction period his book contains little that is new or an improvement over previous efforts .

		Indeed , it is hardly a history of some parts of the period , the statement of facts having been replaced by controversial matter .

		Though
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is thor - oughly condemned , the work for which it is condemned is none too well described .

		The writer has attempted to deviate slightly from the well-worn ruts of political and constitutional history , dodging back and forth between the national capital and the
Southern States	LOCATION	; but he has not gone very deeply into other currents which have become the main currents of to-day .

		In most cases his judgment on the topics treated appears sound ; but it is difficult to see how
Garfield	PERSON	was `` vindicated '' of his connection with the Credit Mobilier by his subsequent election to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and later to the Presidency .

		Would any impartial person say that Governor
Sulzer	ORGANIZATION	was vindicated by his recent election to the legislature of
New York	LOCATION	?

		Taken as a whole , however , this volume is a fitting close to a work which has already found a permanent place in American historical lit - erature .

		182 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	exhibits a lightness of touch , combined with sureness , which renders it entertaining as well as trustworthy reading .

		The book is not proclaimed as one having a mission .

		Perhaps for that very reason it may wield more influence upon the public mind than have other writings of its kind which have been more obtrusively educational .

		It is the belief of the author , none the less , that the tension which exists between his country and
Germany	LOCATION	arises from misconceptions which prevail upon both sides , and that if the character and policy of the Emperor were but better known to Englishmen there `` would be no estrangement between the two countries , but , much more probably , mutual respect and mutual good - will '' ; and it may be assumed that Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	has hoped that his book will contribute to the early realization of this improved order of things .

		That the highest national interests of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	are fundamentally irreconcilable , and that the policies of their governments are fundamentally opposed , are pronounced sheer delusions .

		Even the building of the powerful German fleet con - stitutes , in the opinion of the author , no just ground for British criticism or apprehension .

		The fleet may be , as Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	has pronounced it recently , a luxury .

		.

		But , says Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	, if the German Empire deems the main - tenance of such a fleet advisable , and is willing to `` spend money on it , why should she not supply herself with an arm of defense in proportion to her size , her prosperity , and her desert ?

		Unless , and until , it is made clearer than it is to-day that the German navy is intended for aggres - sion , its growth may be viewed by the rest of the world with equanimity , and by the Englishman , as a connoisseur in such matters , with admira - tion as well . ''

		The truth is that if our ordinary Englishman and German were to sit down together , and with the help of books , maps , and newspapers , carefully and without prejudice , consider the annals of their respective coun - tries for the last sixteen years with a view to establish - ing the causes of their delusion , they could hardly fail to confess that it was due to neither believing a word the other said ; to each crediting the other with motives which , as individuals and men of honesty and integrity in the private relations of life , each would indignantly repudiate ; to each assuming the other to be in the con - dition of barbarism mankind began to emerge from nineteen hundred years ago ; ... to both supposing that nations learn nothing from experience ; and to each supposing that he and his fellow-countrymen alone are the monopolists of wisdom , honor , truth , justice , charity , in short , of all the attributes and blessings of civili - zation .

		Is it not time to discard such errors , or must the nations always suspect each other ? ''

		It must not be inferred that Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	falls into a vapid impartiality between the two coun - tries , or that he seeks to heighten his effects by indulging in indiscriminate glorification of the
Kaiser	PERSON	or of other men and things German .

		He points out the deep-seated differences between English and German government , and in a briefer manner between English and German culture , and he makes it plain that his own preferences are in large part for the forms and usages that are English .

		But he pleads that Englishmen shall recognize that what the Ger - man has may be best for the German , and that , above all , the German has quite as clear a right to his ideas , his methods , and his policies as has anybody else .

		The plea is not made in so many words .

		Rather , it comes as a matter of general impression gained from a reading of the entire book .

		But it is none the less incisive and stimulating .

		Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	's characterization of the Emperor as he is to-day exhibits a full appreciation of the many-sidedness of the sovereign 's activities and interests .

		It is peculiarly striking , he says , that a man so many-sided , so impulsive , so progres - sive , so modern '' one might almost say so American '' should have changed so slightly either in character or in policy during a quarter of a century . ''

		He is to-day the same Hohenzollern he was the day he mounted the throne , observing exactly the same atti - tude toward the world abroad and toward his folk at home , tenacious of exactly the same principles , enunci - ating exactly the same views in politics , religion , morals , and art in everything which concerns the foundations of social life .

		He still believes himself , as his speeches and conduct show , the selected instrument of Heaven , and acts toward his people and addresses them accord - ingly .

		He still opposes all efforts at political change , as witness his attitude towards electoral reform , towards the Germanization of Prussian
Poland	LOCATION	, towards the Socialists , towards Liberalism in all its manifestations .

		He is still , as he was at the outset of his reign , the patron of classical art , classical drama , and classical music .

		He is still the war lord with the spirit of a bishop and a bishop with the spirit of the war lord .

		He is still the model husband and father he has always been . ''

		By general agreement , the rivalry of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	is the preponderating fact in the international situation of to-day , and it need hardly be added that the principal factor in this rivalry is the development of naval arma - ments .

		There is , accordingly , good reason to welcome the comprehensive treatise by Messrs.
Hurd	PERSON	and Castle on the rise , growth , and eco - nomic basis of German sea power .

		In this book , as in Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	's , motives of a political nature are disclaimed ; but the altogether reasonable hope is expressed tha , t the work may aid in dis -
1914	DATE	-RSB- 183 pelling some of the ruinous misconceptions which are current on the two sides of the
North Sea	LOCATION	.

		It is maintained , as it is by Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	, that the British and the Germans are separated by no in - herent antipathy , and it is pointed out that the relations of the two peoples have become strained only within the past fifteen years , in other words , only since , under the great
Navy	ORGANIZATION	Act of
1900	DATE	,
Germany	LOCATION	entered systematically upon her present course of naval aggrandizement .

		The growth of German sea power , it is as - serted , is not to be explained by sheer lust of domination .

		It is the fruit of no exotic policy .

		On the contrary , there lies behind it substantial economic justification , mainly the necessity of the defense of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's ramifying maritime , colonial , and commercial interests .

		If battle - ship building has been carried considerably fur - ther than the defensive needs of the Empire require , the fault is to be laid at the door of the somewhat over-zealous
Navy League	ORGANIZATION	and of the Anglophobe press rather than at that of the government .

		The final and most aggressive ex - pression of German policy , embodied in the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	Act of
1912	DATE	, is pronounced unjustifiable ; but responsibility for it is placed chiefly upon the man who , more largely than even the Emperor himself , is the creator of the German fleet ,
Grand	LOCATION	- Admiral von
Tirpitz	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a recent con - versation with a correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Chronicle , '' Admiral von Tirpitz pro- fessed to be '' lost in wonder '' at the German navy being regarded as a danger or a menace .

		It has , he declared , '' a purely defensive function and no aggressive purpose . ''

		The feeling of the average Englishman , however , is that German explanations of German naval policy are differ - ently phrased according as they are intended for German or for English consumption .

		And very likely it will require something more than the assurances contained in such books as those under review to overcome that feeling .

		Three chapters of the volume by Messrs.
Hurd	PERSON	and Castle are devoted to a history of German sea-power to the accession of the pres - ent Emperor , one covering the rise and decline of the
Hanseatic League	ORGANIZATION	, another the develop - ment of the Hohenzollern fleet , and a third the growth of maritime interests during the nine - teenth century .

		There is a suggestive chapter on the influence exerted by
Great Britain	LOCATION	upon German naval policy , and an excellent analyti - cal discussion of the great navy acts of
1898	DATE	,
1900	DATE	, and
1912	DATE	.

		The rise to preponderating power of Admiral von Tirpitz a man who fifteen years ago was almost as unknown to Germans as to outside peoples is described at length .

		And there is a careful examination of the economic basis of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's present naval policy , leading to the interesting conclusion that , if present economic tendencies continue unchecked , the Empire will , '' before long , be in a position to build and arm warships with almost as great facility as the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, and to pay for them and man them with even greater ease than this country . ''

		Not the least valuable portion of the volume is an appendix containing digests of naval legislation , besides numerous summaries and tables and two care - fully prepared maps .

		A volume constructed upon a plan which , although simple and attractive , has not been followed by any earlier writer on modern Ger - many is Mr.
Wile	PERSON	's `` Men around the Kaiser . ''

		Mr.
Wile	PERSON	rightly says that the world at large , fascinated by the
Kaiser	PERSON	's kaleidoscopic and picturesque personality , is prone to accord him almost exclusive credit for the
Fatherland	ORGANIZATION	's `` magic leap into Weltmacht '' and that , while there have been many makers of the
Germany	LOCATION	of to-day , their identities and personalities , with rare exceptions , are unknown to peoples beyond the German borders .

		In the volume in hand there are sketched the careers and char - acters of thirty-one men of eminence and lead - ership in the
Germany	LOCATION	of the past decade , many of them men who to-day are associated intimately with the
Kaiser	PERSON	in the direction of the Empire 's political , military , naval , and cultural affairs .

		Statesmen are represented principally by Chan - cellor von
Bethmann	PERSON	-
Hollweg	PERSON	,
Prince von Buelow	PERSON	,
Herr Bernhard Dernburg	PERSON	, and the Foreign Secretary ,
Herr Gottlieb	PERSON	von Jagow ; military and naval leaders by Field -

		184 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	During the past seven years Mr.
Wile	PERSON	has served as the
Berlin	LOCATION	representative of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times '' and other newspapers , and it would appear that he has made excellent use of his opportunity to acquire first-hand knowledge of the personal -LRB- often undoubtedly the most influential -RRB- factors in the current achievements of one of the most interesting of nations .

		His sketches are of necessity brief , but they contain an amazing amount of information , and his facts and comments are presented in a manner uniformly attractive .

		Each sketch is accompan - ied by a good portrait of its subject .

		Americans who endeavor to follow the course of foreign affairs would be grateful for volumes of the same scope and quality dealing with the lead - ing men of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Eussia	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and even some of the minor countries .

		THE VARIORUM '' CYMBELJNE . ''

		* The reviewing of a posthumous volume is always a delicate task for the conscientious reviewer .

		The natural impulse to speak well of the dead is trans - ferred to his works , and the critic finds himself in - volved in a conflict between this impulse and his duty , a duty to the deceased as well as to the living , and not infrequently he ends by being silent .

		The temptation to yield to this easy escape from a dilemma is increased manifold when the writer of the posthumous volume is a man so generally beloved and so highly esteemed as was the late
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	.

		Alas , neither our praise nor our censure can touch him further !

		But his book re - mains , and , considering its importance and its place in the domain of letters , calls for a careful critical estimate .

		That part of the cultured public which is devoted to the study of the best in imaginative liter - ature is entitled to a candid and impartial estimate of such a volume as the one before us .

		Were Dr.
Furness	PERSON	with us , he would ask for no more and insist on nothing less .

		It is too late a day now to dwell on those features of '' the Furness Variorum '' that have established for this edition of Shakespeare a position from which it can never be dislodged , and that have placed the modest , scholarly , genial , and painstaking
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	in the forefront of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's editors and commentators .

		In this new volume , as in those that have preceded it , we find a familiarity with the text , and the mass of native and foreign commentary that has grown up around it , that is simply amazing ; a cautious weighing of the value of each word of the poem , and of the numerous and varied and often contradictory interpretations of the * THE TRAGEDIE OF CYMBELINE .

		By
William Shake	PERSON	- speare ; edited by
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	. ''

		The Variorum Shakespeare . ''


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		many commentators during the past two hundred years ; an almost microscopically accurate reproduc - tion of all the peculiarities of the original text ; a truly remarkable and almost awe-inspiring compilation of the readings , guesses , conjectures , and misprints of every previous editor of any importance ; carefully selected abstracts from the comments of the best of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's critics ; an exhaustive study of the questions of the date of composition and of the '' sources '' of the plots and incidents , etc. .

		But more important and of greater value than all these are the editor 's introduction and his contributions to the elucidation of many hitherto obscure passages .

		Shakespeare students will be very grateful to Dr.
Furness	PERSON	for his discovery -LRB- pp. 226-227 -RRB- , through Father Clifford of
New Jersey	LOCATION	, that when Shake - speare , in this play as in '' Hamlet , '' referred to a canon against self-slaughter he referred to an actual canon , and not , as has been generally assumed , to a law of natural religion .

		Other interesting and orig - inal contributions to the understanding of this very difficult play are too numerous for detailed mention ; but the chief of them may here be referred to .

		The note on
Imogen	PERSON	's deathlike pallor -LRB- I. 7 , 15 -RRB- when
Pisanio	PERSON	announces the arrival of news from
Posthu	LOCATION	- mus is good not only in itself but as a specimen of the editor 's ability to illustrate the poet 's meaning from other plays , and of his gentle , but none the less biting , sarcasm .

		To Ingleby 's suggestion that lachimo should have greeted
Imogen	PERSON	with a low rev - erence , saying , `` Save you , madam , ''
Furness	PERSON	adds : '' of course , he should have brought his heels together with a click . ''

		Such flashes of wit and humor abound throughout the volume , and serve to relieve the monotony of wading through seas of stale , flat , and unprofitable notes .

		More than once do we strongly suspect that many of these barren notes were lugged in only because they gave the editor the opportunity to exhibit his humor and unchristianly to expose his victims -LRB-
Vaughan	ORGANIZATION	, Ingleby ,
Walker	PERSON	, etc. -RRB- to ridicule .

		Through their occasional absurdities his sound com - mon sense , his shrewdness , his good taste , his genuine appreciation of the dramatic situations , and his keen insight into human nature stick fiery off indeed .

		He uses them as the stalking horse for his wit and wisdom .

		There is no good reason otherwise why interpretations that had been withdrawn or comments that in no way add to our understanding or appre - ciation of this or any other play should be perpet - uated in this edition or be permitted to distract our attention .

		Exquisite flashes of humor are to be found scattered throughout the volume : as when the editor says that anyone who could meddle with the scansion of a certain line '' would have held the pail while
Malone	PERSON	whitewashed Shakespeare 's bust '' ; or when
Vaughan	PERSON	's suggestion that how , show , now , etc. , should be pronounced dissyllabically '' thus , nowu , howu , shown , '' elicits from him this delicious com - ment : `` I prefer the Yankee haow , naow , myself with a sharp nasal twang . ''

		But unfortunately his pleasantries have not always this charm and affa - bility ; sometimes they are quite puerile , and even
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 185 of a nature to cause pain to his victims if the latter were alive .

		Walker 's statement that occasionally words like blowing are to be pronounced as mono - syllables calls forth this burlesquing comment : '' Ha ` ng laid down this jew ' l of a rule he is able to regard some po ` ms written by po ` ts as undy ` ng po ` try . ''

		Richard Grant White 's '' washerwoman '' is resurrected twice quite unnecessarily for our merriment .

		To
Walker	PERSON	's suggestion that a certain verse requires either to be pronounced e ` r , he says : '' If either is to be thus pronounced , why not , in modern editions , give the reader warning and so print it ?

		And if it is to be printed e ` r , why not save ink and type and print it simply r ? ''

		To be sure , this is humor of a certain sort ; but is it literary criticism ?

		But let us return to the enumeration of the more important of Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's original interpretations .

		He is at his best and how delightful is his best !

		in his comments on the singing of the crickets while lachimo is under the spell of the sleeping
Imogen	PERSON	's beauty -LRB- p. 114 -RRB- , on lachimo 's removal of the slippery bracelet -LRB- p. 119 -RRB- , on the snatches in Cloten 's voice -LRB- p. 143 -RRB- , on the location and time-analysis of Act 2 , Scene 4 -LRB- p. 147 -RRB- , on the symbolism of the hymeneal torches which supported the Cupids of the andirons -LRB- p. 157 -RRB- , on
Pisanio	ORGANIZATION	's phrase about `` waking '' his eye-balls -LRB- p. 231 -RRB- , on
Imogen	PERSON	's interrogation '' ` Mongst Friends ? ''

		-LRB- p. 272 -RRB- , on the phrase `` the way which they stopped eagles '' -LRB- p. 363 -RRB- , on horse - racing in
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's reign -LRB- p. 192 -RRB- , on the use of the words `` good '' and `` bad '' in Shakespeare -LRB- p. 136 -RRB- , on the stuttering of German Hotspurs -LRB- p. 189 -RRB- , and on spiders in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays -LRB- p. 296 -RRB- .

		He is less happy in the supposition that when lachimo says `` hell is here '' he strikes his breast and thus indicates to us his remorse and preparation for his final repentance ; lachimo meant no more than the torture of confinement in the trunk and fear of dis - covery .

		Imogen 's words about `` being so verbal '' refer to herself , and may be paraphrased '' being so brutally frank . ''

		The idea -LRB- p. 152 -RRB- that Shake - speare puts a brutal speech into
Posthumus	PERSON	's mouth with the object of creating in us `` an aversion to
Posthumus	PERSON	, so that at the close of this scene our hearts will be duly hardened to endure the sight of his misery , '' is , to say the least , far-fetched .

		The note -LRB- p. 159 -RRB- on the letter that lachimo delivered to
Posthumus	PERSON	is very bad .

		When lachimo says , `` She writes so to you ? ''

		he is not alarmed ; he is mocking his victim : he knows that
Imogen	PERSON	had for - given him and trusted him and that she would not mention his insults to her .

		If he had had any doubts on that score he would have read that letter .

		Nor is it probable , as suggested by Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	intended the frantic
Posthumus	PERSON	to rush back into the room he had just left to deliver his very dramatic and poignant soliloquy ; it would have created a laugh in the theatre to see Philario and lachimo go off to find
Posthumus	PERSON	to prevent him doing himself bodily injury while he comes rushing into the room by another door .

		In discussing the versification of the line , '' With that harsh , noble , simple , nothing , '' the Misses
Porter	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	re - mark that the time of the missing foot is supplied by
Imogen	PERSON	's '' exasperated pause '' ; and Dr.
Furness	PERSON	of course accepts this defence of the Folio text , without noting that the verse is not a foot short and that there is no place within the verse for the missing syllable .

		Moreover , the principle so often invoked by Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, that deep emotion will account for many lacunae in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's verse , is open to grave objections : it can be carried to ridiculous excess ; it would mean chaos in versification ; gaps occur in verses where excessive emotion will not serve as an explanation ; and the supposition is further negatived by the fact that almost all of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's most impassioned speeches are faultlessly constructed .

		Shakespeare would not eke out his verses with pauses like a nervous speaker his sentences with hems and haws .

		To what extent Dr.
Furness	PERSON	will go in this regard is apparent in his suggestion that `` a very timid pause '' after the third foot would take the place of a foot and convert an imperfect verse -LRB- III .

		7 , 30 -RRB- into a perfect one .

		If dramatic poetry were written on this principle , dramatists would have to provide gaps in their verses for the actors ' inspirations and expirations as well as for every gesture ; or should they breathe only at the end of each verse ?

		That Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's ear is a very untrustworthy guide to the music of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's verse is perfectly evident , so it seems to me , from his suggestion that III .

		4 , 155 should read : `` Hath
Britain	LOCATION	all the sun that shines ?

		Prythee think . ''

		And he makes matters worse in defending this read - ing by referring to the extra syllable in the word `` volume '' in the following line .

		But it must be admitted that many of his strictures against much meddlesome tampering with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's verse is quite justified by the antics of some of the com - mentators .

		The fatal Cleopatra to Dr.
Furness	PERSON	is the Folio text .

		He expends his best ingenuity and all his subtlety to read sense and rhythm into anything in the Folio .

		The principle that the harder reading should prevail leads him into all kinds of far-fetched explanations .

		Anyone who has a word to say in the defence of a Folio reading finds a champion in him .

		The best illustration of this is to be found in his interpretation of
Imogen	PERSON	's words , `` Think that you are upon a rock , '' as meaning that her unshaken devotion is a sort of granitic foundation for the wavering
Posthumus	PERSON	.

		And in this interpretation he finds `` a heightened poetic charm '' !

		Another in - stance is the desperate attempt to read a meaning into the words , `` Your pleasure was my neere offence , '' -LRB- V. 5 , 400 -RRB- when it is almost certain that `` neere '' is a misprint for `` mere '' -LRB- only -RRB- .

		So too his defence of `` defended God , '' a misprint for '' descended God , '' etc. .

		In a surprisingly large number of passages , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	seems to have missed the poet 's meaning .

		He tells us that in the sentence , `` The toil o ' th ' war only seems to seek out danger I ' th ' name of 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	fame , '' only qualifies to seek , otherwise he can not `` comprehend the passage . ''

		But it seems obvious that only relates to `` I ' th ' name of fame '' -LRB- III .

		3 , 56 -RRB- .

		Posthumus 's words , '' Is ' t enough I am sorry ? ''

		he interprets `` Can it be that I am sorry enough ? ''

		when the plain meaning is , '' Will it satisfy the good Gods to know and to be told that I am sorry ? ''

		Where is Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's sense of humor when he reads sense into Cloten 's nonsensical remark about cutting
Posthumus	PERSON	's garments to pieces before his decapitated face ?

		He very strangely objects to the soliloquy spoken by
Posthumus	PERSON	after he is convinced of
Imogen	PERSON	's infidelity as being undramatic and as hav - ing been intended only for the study , and that it is inappropriate even there .

		To me it appears exceed - ingly well motived , and as a psychological master - piece with which only Hamlet 's soliloquy , `` What a rogue and peasant slave am I ! ''

		can compare .

		The gaoler 's words , `` Your death has eyes in 's head , then , '' mean `` Death , as you picture him , is provided with eyes , '' not -LRB- as Dr.
Furness	PERSON	para - phrases them -RRB- '' Your death has eyes in its head , '' your being emphatic .

		In the sentence , `` Her women with wet cheeks were present when she finished '' -LRB- i. e. , died -RRB- , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	defines finished as finished her confession because `` it is hardly likely that her women would wet their cheeks for her death . ''

		But the poet meant us to understand that the wicked Queen died immediately after her confession ; her women were moved to pitying tears at the sight of the madly dying woman suffering agonies of remorse while confessing her villainies .

		For numerous very good reasons Dr.
Furness	PERSON	has set himself the almost impossible task of repro - ducing the Folio text with almost microscopic exact - ness .

		How well he has succeeded in this purpose in other volumes I do not know , but in `` Cymbeline '' he has signally failed .

		'T is true 't is pity , and pity 't is 't is true .

		The following is a list of the more important textual errors that I have noted : thousand -LRB- for thousands , p. 58 , 1 .

Philharmonus	PERSON	-LRB- Philarmonus 434 : 516 -RRB- , day -LRB- day , 181 : 87 -RRB- .

		It will be noticed that more than a third of these are errors and misprints that do not occur in the Folio .

		This volume also fails to reproduce numerous `` spaces , '' letter misplacements , and type peculiari - ties that occur in the original , besides introducing numerous letter displacements , etc. , of its own .

		The paging of the original is not reproduced or men - tioned , although two pages in the Folio are incor - rectly numbered -LRB- p. 379 is numbered 389 , and 399 is 993 -RRB- and recent Baconians have turned this to account .

		The textual notes are extremely untrustworthy .

		They fail to point out certain errors in the text -LRB- e.g. ,
Mergan	LOCATION	, arbiterment ,
Mistirs	LOCATION	, rhat , ere for e'er , etc. -RRB- , are marred by misprints -LRB- e.g. , you for yon , IV .

		2 , 416 ; thee for the , I. 1 , 66 ; vnsledg 'd for vnfledg d , III .

		3 , 31 , etc. -RRB- , and fail to record read - ings peculiar to certain editors .

		Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	's edition contains five unique readings -LRB- you for your , I. 4 , 155 ; who for that , III .

		3 , 25 ; That for This , IV .

		4 , 14 ; he for we , V. 5 , 173 ; and at I. 3 , 40 the name Pisanio is omitted -RRB- which are not noted in the
New Variorum	LOCATION	.

		The commentaries throughout the volume are marred by numerous errors in quotations from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, even from this play , and from other writers , as well as by numerous misprints .

		A few of these are : wroth -LRB- worth , 29 -RRB- , one -LRB- me , 108 -RRB- , passagem -LRB- 123 -RRB- , requisite -LRB- requite 129 -RRB- , lock -LRB- look 149 -RRB- ,

		Dr.
Furness	PERSON	nowhere alludes to the almost cer - tain fact that this play was set up from the poet 's manuscript .

		The evidence for this is threefold : the textual errors are such as a compositor will make when he is setting up type from a not easily decipher - able manuscript -LRB- e.g. , Babe for Bribe , Honor for Humor , lowd of for lowdest , easilest for easieest , Sleep for Stoop , etc. -RRB- ; the indication of elisions and contractions where they are required by the versifi - cation , something that an early seventeenth cen - tury compositor could not have done of his own accord -LRB- e.g. , ofs , o'th ' , in 's , th ` more , ith \ thourt , y' are , o n't , Whe n't , T'encounter , pray ` rs , do ` t , lingering ,
Tenioy	LOCATION	, eld ` st , etc. , etc. -RRB- ; and the com -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 187 paratively rare occasions on which the verses are incorrectly divided .

		The matter is of importance as showing how punctilious
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was in the pre - paration of his MS. , as throwing light on Elizabethan habits of enunciation , and as aiding us in guessing at
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's meaning in obscure passages .

		This brings me to a subject of which Dr.
Furness	PERSON	always speaks very feelingly ,
viz.	LOCATION	, the elision of letters to meet the requirements of an ideal verse structure .

		Where the Folio does not indicate an elision he resents any suggestion to shorten a word , and uses all his eloquence and sarcasm in the defence of the extra syllable , as in his comment on
Vaughan	PERSON	's suggestion to substitute vi ` nds for a word in V. 3 , 80 , and on
Walker	PERSON	's ha ` ng for having .

		To
Walker	PERSON	's proposal that in I. 6 , 13 , we read lang ` shing he says : '' Can any lover of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's musical language hear this without ang ` sh ? ''

		He continually pleads for distinct enunciation , and forgets that our ideals in this regard are very different from the Elizabethan ideal .

		Dr.
Furness	PERSON	knew no one better that for the sake of their verse Elizabethan poets would do almost anything with their words ; they would decap - itate them -LRB- ` stroy , ` bove , ` lack , ` count , long , '' complice , etc. -RRB- , add prefixes to them -LRB- e.g. , apaid , -RRB- lop off the tail -LRB- e.g. , refts ' , gi ' , ha ' , marriage '' , syllab , etc. -RRB- , dis - embowel them -LRB- e.g. , o'er , ta'en .

		whe'er , de'il , or for other , since for sithence , canstick for candlestick , marie for marvel , ling ' ring , etc. -RRB- , elongate them -LRB- capitain , ocean , rememberance , etc. -RRB- , compress two words into one -LRB- h ` has , ` tother , hat , but ` t , This 's , i ` th \ unt ` her , etc. -RRB- , change the vowel -LRB- e.g. , hild for held to rhyme with killed , than for then to rhyme with began , sawn f or sown , parl for peril , oerstrawd foro'erstrew 'd to rhyme with fraud , etc. -RRB- , and in other ways distort words -LRB- e.g. , thou ` se , bankrout , etc. -RRB- .

		There was almost no limit to what might not be done for the sake of scansion or rhyme .

		There are in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	twenty-nine verses in which the scan - sion requires the word ignorant -LRB- or ignorance -RRB- to be pronounced as a dissyllable .

		Not one of Shake - speare 's editors has ever noticed it .

		In his magni - ficent edition of '' Macbeth , ''
Liddell	PERSON	suggested that in I. 1 , 58 we read `` this ign ` rant present , '' an impossible combination of sounds .

		In '' Cymbeline '' this word occurs twice as a dissyllable -LRB- '' Poor ignor - ant baubles !

		on our terrible seas '' and u Dost seem so ignorant , we 'll enforce it from thee '' -RRB- ; but one will seek for light from the editors in vain .

		A reference to the
New English Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	makes all plain , for we find there that in the Jacobean period the word was also pronounced ing ` rant .

		In another passage in this play the word exquisite has dissyllabic value , and again the
New English Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	tells us that the word was at times pronounced and written exquised .

		Shakespeare did not scruple to contract have it to hcCt -LRB- spelled hate in a Hamlet Quarto -RRB- and rime it with

		Such sarcastic comments , therefore , as those on languishing -LRB- especially if we consider that gu was then often sounded as in our guess , languor , tongue , etc. -RRB- and having are as un - scholarly as they are unnecessary .

		There is indis - putable evidence that Elizabethan poets intended these elisions , metatheses , apocopes , aphereses , apheses , syncopes , etc. , even when they were not indicated in print .

		The New English Dictionary is very frequently and very wisely referred to by Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, and in several instances he points out errors and omissions in those noble volumes .

		Students can not be too much impressed with the fact that Elizabethan English is very different from modern English , and that to guess at
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's meaning is not the way to read him .

		Dr.
Furness	PERSON	has defined many words that another editor might consider unnecessary , e.g. , who -LRB- whom ! -RRB-

		, / or -LRB- because -RRB- , as -LRB- as it -RRB- , prefer -LRB- recom - mend -RRB- , conduct -LRB- escort -RRB- , tent -LRB- probe -RRB- , weeds -LRB- clothes -RRB- , deem -LRB- judge -RRB- , close -LRB- secret -RRB- , etc. , and has left many really difficult words undefined .

		In some instances the definitions do not seem to be the best that might have been chosen .

		Why we are treated to the etymology of andiron , primrose , and bastard I can not guess .

		There is one passage in which reference to the
New English Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	would have cleared up a hitherto unsolved enigma .

		Many critics have declared
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	guilty of bathos in
Imogen	LOCATION	's words , `` I would have broke mine eye-strings , Crack 'd them but to look upon him . ''

		Staunton proposed to transpose the words broke and crack 'd ; but this is unnecessary if we know that in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's day broke meant , among other things , cracked , exhausted , cracked without complete separation ; and crack 'd meant snapped , split asunder .

		Priscian does not escape unscratched in this vol - ume .

		The following sentences could very easily have been improved upon : `` Abbott would have us pronounce this word ... into a monosyllable '' -LRB- p. 240 -RRB- ; `` It was by the snatches in his voice ... that made Belarius absolutely certain of his identity '' -LRB- p. 255 -RRB- ; `` you may save yourself from this death by only making a stand '' -LRB- p. 362 -RRB- ; `` there was never but one
Phoenix	LOCATION	at a time '' -LRB- p. 77 -RRB- .

		As we know from extant records , the Shake - speare coat-of-arms played an important part in the poet 's life , and if it is to be reproduced at all it ought to be depicted correctly .

		When in
1908	DATE	I called Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's attention to the very inaccurate repro - duction on the covers of his
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, pointing out its errors , he wrote me the following interesting reply : '' You have said the last word on the subject , , and though you may say it is a trifling matter , it has been well said that ' perfection is no trifling matter . '

		As for my own delinquencies , let me plead that when , nigh forty years ago , I adopted on the covers of the
New Variorum	LOCATION	the coat-of-arms that has ever since remained there , every particular of Shakespeare 's life had not received that microscopic investigation to which it is now subjected .

		Suppos - ing that Knight was trustworthy , I accepted Shake - speare 's coat-of-arms as given in his ' Biography / with the improvement of giving the sable bend in true heraldic style , instead of the plain black band which Knight gives . ''

		188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Faint praise for
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nietzsche has never had a less chari - table critic than Dr.
Paul Car	PERSON	us in his `` Nietzsche and Other Exponents of Individualism '' -LRB-
Open Court Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		To para - phrase a certain French critic on
Max Stirner	PERSON	's chef-d'oeuvre , this is un livre qu'on quitte anti-
Nietzschlen	LOCATION	; and the uncompromisingly conserva - tive will welcome it .

		Originality is interesting , they will say ; and to be suggestive is to be helpful , provided the suggestions can be carried out to the ultimate good of the less gifted .

		But when the suggestions are either unfeasible or dangerous , they should be checkmated , especially if they are clothed in the happy phrase that so easily deceives .

		Dr.
Carus	PERSON	looks upon the whole Nietzsche question as one to be refuted : the man belies his work , and his work is to be condemned as erratic .

		Concerning the former , he uses such terms as `` sissy , '' `` goody - goody , '' `` bulldozer , '' `` no philosopher , '' `` not even a thinker '' ; concerning the latter , he says that '' we can not help condemning his philosophy as unsound in its basis , the errors being the result of an imma - turity of comprehension . ''

		But if all this be true , why write still another book on such a theme ?

		Dr.
Carus	PERSON	's study has two justifications : the strength of its ref utal is original , and some of its facts are new .

		Other critics have refuted
Nietzsche	PERSON	, but they have not shown so clearly how , in his self-assertive spirit , he was too proud to recognize the duty of inquiry , so that he adopted some exceedingly erro - neous beliefs ; how , by reason of his nominalistic tendencies , he expressed these beliefs again and again until we weary of them ; how he preached objectivity when he was the most subjective of men ; how the principles of his overman would plunge even a powerful usurper into abysmal ruin ; how all his standards of valuation were subjectively acquired , and , since they have not been objectively justified , were absurd ; how his ethics , if accepted , would only increase jealousy and robbery and mur - der ; how , in short , his philosophy will not work , despite the fact that it makes interesting reading , especially for malcontents , who like invective on general principle .

		All of these things have been said before ; but Dr.
Carus	PERSON	argues , if he does not prove , the correctness of his views by some hitherto unused illustrations .

		The book throws new light on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's indebtedness to
Max Stirner	PERSON	and his inspiration to Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	.

		It also points out his influence on the `` nihilists of
Russia	LOCATION	, the socialists and anarchists of all civilized countries , '' and gives a list of American , English , and German periodicals that owe their origin and subsequent behavior to
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's teachings .

		Besides some miscellaneous illustrations , there are reproductions of the familiar portraits and busts of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		Bat there is one illustration that is not familiar , one that betrays the spirit of the writer : the `` latest portrait '' after an oil painting by
C. Stoeving	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is awful to look at !

		It should be included only in a work that plainly sets out to denounce its title-hero .

		Dr.
Carus	PERSON	's book shows the impossibility of escape from subjectivism : the noble statue of
Friedrich Nietzsche	PERSON	by
Klein	PERSON	reveals one man 's point of view ; the gruesome oil painting by Stoeving another .

		Dr.
Carus	PERSON	's presentation more nearly resembles the latter .

		Typographically , the book shows only one conspicuous error : on page 14 , Professor Deussen is made to visit
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	in
1907	DATE	; the latter died in
1900	DATE	.

		Whether the book is erroneous in other particulars is a different question .

		This much is certain : it resembles in no way those Rettungen that
Lessing	PERSON	used to write on famous men who , as he thought , had been unjustly maligned .

		Public opinion Curing the past year the output of and popular literature dealing with popular gov - government .

		ernment , its character and limita - tions , has been unusually large .

		One of the most notable treatises of this kind is President
Lowell	PERSON	's `` Public Opinion and Popular Government '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- .

		The book is divided into three distinct parts -LRB- grouped into four parts in the book itself -RRB- .

		The author first analyzes in an acute manner the nature of public opinion and the function of political parties in its expression .

		In the second part , he deals with methods of expressing public opinion , discussing somewhat briefly representative action through legislatures and direct popular action through the initiative and referendum .

		To this part of the author 's discussion also belong two valuable appen - dices -LRB- of more than ninety pages -RRB- which give a complete record of initiative and referendum meas - ures in
Switzerland	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The third part of the book is devoted to '' the regulation of matters to which public opinion can not directly apply , '' and discusses in the main the position of experts in popular government .

		In his treatment of public opinion and the methods devised for its expression , President
Lowell	PERSON	confines himself to a broad general survey , paying little attention to detailed plans or to remedies for the difficulties indicated .

		His discussion of the limits of public opinion and of party action is one of the most acute pieces of political writing yet done in this country , and should be read by everyone interested in popu - lar government .

		When the author comes to a close study of the initiative and referendum he is not so successful ; although here , also , he keeps an even balance , and declines to condemn institutions because they may show grave defects .

		However , he perhaps fails to realize fully that one can not measure the success or failure of an institution by the number or even by the character of measures adopted or rejected , but must know somewhat in detail what its effect has been as a working instrument .

		So far as this discussion is concerned , President
Lowell	PERSON	also apparently overlooks the fact that the constitu - tional referendum is still the most used , and that the statutory referendum can not be studied sepa - rately , especially when at the same election questions of similar type are being submitted to the people
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 189 of a
State	ORGANIZATION	, the one as a constitutional amendment , and the other as a statutory referendum .

		The influ - ence of ballot forms upon popular voting is not considered by the author , although its importance for his discussion is very great .

		In spite of these minor defects , the book is a distinct addition to the literature dealing with popular government , in some respects , indeed , the most valuable that has been made by an American author .

		A history of Noting the lack of `` a popularly the followers written , well illustrated , condensed of
George Fox	ORGANIZATION	.

		history of Quakerism as a whole , from the birth of
George Fox	ORGANIZATION	to approximately
1913	DATE	, in one volume , '' Dr.
Charles Frederick Holder	PERSON	, himself of noted
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	ancestry , has essayed the task of supplying the need in his stout octavo , `` The Quakers in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , wherein are set forth in attractive style the heroism , the sufferings , the spiritual triumphs , and the more material successes , of the indomitably persistent disciples of him of whom
Penn	LOCATION	declared , `` In all things he acquitted himself like a man , yea , a strong man , a new and heavenly-minded man . ''

		The first half of the book has to do with the Quakers in the land of their origin , the latter traces their fortunes in the new country to which persecution at home and other motives early drove a large number of them .

		Extending to nearly seven hundred pages , the volume has space for much detail of historic and especially biographical interest , representative Friends like
John Bright	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	and
Whittier	LOCATION	in this country figuring rather prominently both in the text and among the portraits with which the book is generously embellished .

		Written evidently with a rapid pen as it must have been , in view of its author 's fruitful labors in a variety of other literary fields the work suffers somewhat from a lack of well considered system in its arrangement and from insufficient attention to accuracy of detail .

		For instance , the significant facts in the lives of such prominent early Quakers as
Fox	ORGANIZATION	and
Penn	LOCATION	and
Christopher Holder	PERSON	seem to be unduly scattered in their presentation ; and the founding of the first society of Friends in
America	LOCATION	that at Sandwich under Holder 's and
Copeland	ORGANIZATION	's leadership is in one place made to occur in 1656-7 , and on a later page in the month of
August , 1656	DATE	.

		A more nearly complete index , too , would have been a help to read - ers .

		But there is so much that is excellent and at the '' same time eminently readable in the volume , that fault-finding seems ungracious and ungrateful .

		In richness and variety of matter , comprehensiveness of scope , wealth of illustration , and attractiveness of style , the book leaves little to be desired .

		In the footsteps More and m re g enerall y as time of Pompilia and goes on , is endorsed the view of an CaponsaccM .

		ear jy cr iti c that
Browning	PERSON	's `` The Ring and the Book '' is `` the most precious and pro- found spiritual treasure that
England	LOCATION	has produced since the days of Shakespeare . ''

		The object of Sir
Frederick Treves	PERSON	,
Bart.	LOCATION	, in his volume entitled `` The Country of ` The Ring and the Book ' '' -LRB-
Funk & Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is to bring the incidents of the poem into immediate association with the places of their happening .

		Considered thus , in the light of a variorum appendix to a masterpiece , its three hun - dred pages of text and its one hundred illustrations , plans , and maps seem not excessive .

		When
Brown	PERSON	- ing , as he has told us , '' fused his live soul and that inert stuff '' which he found in the square old yellow book , he was less concerned with the tragedy as
Rome	LOCATION	witnessed it than with the way he would present it to the greater world of art , sentiment , and morality .

		He has made
Pompilia	LOCATION	as real to us as
Juliet	PERSON	, and
Caponsacchi	PERSON	as actual as Othello .

		Sir
Frederick Treves	PERSON	takes the same `` inert stuff , '' and one more contemporary account which
Browning	PERSON	never saw -LRB- found in
Rome	LOCATION	and published in English in
1900	DATE	by Mr.
W. Hall Griffin	PERSON	-RRB- , and makes the '' old woe step on the stage again '' by leading us through the lands where the events actually took place .

		The topography of the gruesome tale is given in vivid detail , and with great charm of description .

		The Roman part may be visited by the tourist within a few steps of his favorite haunts , the Corso and the
Piazza di Spagna	LOCATION	;
Arezzo	LOCATION	is still much the same town as when the
Franceschini	PERSON	lived there ; and to follow the unfortunate lady and her soldier-saint in their flight through the stretch of hill and valley that lies between
Florence	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	is to add a new charm to that lovely region .

		When
Browning	PERSON	first found what he called his `` murder story , '' he offered it to two friends in succession as material for literary use .

		Only when both offers had been declined did it capture
Browning	PERSON	's own imagination so completely that he expended four years upon its development into a masterpiece unique of its type in English literature .

		Sir
Frederick Treves	PERSON	now writes the chronicle of the facts , reconstructing and visualizing its scenes as they appeared to its participants .

		One tempting opportunity in connection with the poem still remains .

		As a tragedy in which four persons suffer a violent death , one vanishes into unknown lands , and one ends his days in loneliness and sor - row , it offers splendid material for the theatre of the future .

		But its successful adaptation for the stage would require a dramatist of real courage as well as of great genius .

		An Oxford ant hlgi e8 * Canadian poetry anthology of as have appeared heretofore have Canadian verse .

		been t ne WO rk of compilers who were critics rather than poets .

		The new `` Oxford Book of Canadian Verse , '' however , is edited by one of the principal Canadian poets , Dr.
Wilfred Campbell	PERSON	.

		It professes to cover the field of Canadian verse from the earliest colonial days down to the present time .

		It would be idle to criticise the selection made from the work of individual poets , as probably no two persons would agree upon a dozen short poems that most satisfactorily represented the character and quality of the verse of , say , Archibald Lamp - 190 THE DIAL -LSB- Mareh 1 man , Mr.
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	, Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	, or the editor himself .

		One is , however , a little troubled to reconcile Dr.
Campbell	PERSON	's views -LRB- as set forth in his preface -RRB- of what should and what should not be regarded as Canadian poetry , with the selec - tions included in his anthology .

		He severely con - demns previous editors , who , he says , have included in their anthologies not only the work of writers born in
Canada	LOCATION	and writing on Canadian subjects , but also those who born in
Canada	LOCATION	have lived and done the bulk of their work in other countries , those who though not born in
Canada	LOCATION	have come to that country and written about it , and those who coming to
Canada	LOCATION	in maturity have written verse which has no relationship to the life of the country .

		Yet on turning to the anthology we find Dr. Camp - bell giving examples of the second class in
Roberts	LOCATION	,
Carman	PERSON	, and
Cameron	PERSON	; of the third in
McGee	LOCATION	,
Moodie	PERSON	, and several others ; and of the fourth in Heavy sege -LRB- despite the definite statement in the preface that '' the mere merit of
Heavysege	ORGANIZATION	's work does not warrant us in considering him a Canadian writer '' -RRB- .

		`` Curioser and curioser , '' as
Alice	PERSON	would say , the editor includes verses by the Duke of
Argyll	ORGANIZATION	, whose only connection with
Canada	LOCATION	is the fact that he spent five years there as Governor - General .

		To paraphrase the preface , would it not be consistent to include also
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and
Moore	PERSON	, who also wrote poems very distinctly relating to the life or history of
Canada	LOCATION	?

		While unquestionably no Canadian anthology would be complete without some of Dr.
Campbell	PERSON	's own work , it does seem a little doubtful in taste for the editor to give the largest space in the collection to his own verse .

		Old-time With all the evils that militarism is methods of still inflicting upon a long-suffering recruiting .

		WO rld , there is at least one of its old-time iniquitous practices that has fallen into desuetude ; and that is the violent and wholesale impressment of men into the naval service .

		The history of this method of recruiting , so far as
Great Britain	LOCATION	is concerned , forms the subject of Mr.
J. R. Hutchinson	PERSON	's happily-conceived and engagingly - written book , `` The Press Gang Afloat and Ashore '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Its beginnings lost in the mists of the past , this system of maintaining the fighting force of the British navy continued into the
fourth decade of the nineteenth century	DATE	, when the protests of an outraged public brought it to a close .

		Mr.
Hutch	PERSON	- inson , not content with the customary derivation of `` press '' in this special meaning , explains its origin thus : `` Originally the man who was required for the king 's service at sea , like his twin brother the soldier , was not ` pressed ' in the sense in which we now use the term .

		He was merely subjected to a process called ` presting . '

		To ` prest ' a man meant to enlist him by means of what was techni - cally known as ` prest ' money ` prest ' being the English equivalent of the obsolete French prest , now pret , meaning ready .

		In the recruiter 's vocabu - lary , therefore , ' prest ' money stood for what is - nowadays , in both services , commonly termed the ` king 's shilling , ' and the man who , either voluntarily or under duress , accepted or received that shilling at the recruiter 's hands , was said to be ` prested ' or ` pressed . '

		In other words , having taken the king 's ready money , he was thenceforth , during the king 's pleasure , ' ready ' for the king 's service . ''

		An ingen - ious piece of etymology , certainly .

		In closing , the author warns the present-day advocates of a return to conscription that `` a people who for a hundred years patiently endured conscription in its most cruel form will never again suffer it to be lightly inflicted upon them . ''

		The book is suitably illus - trated , chiefly from old prints and from paintings .

		More gropings Dr.
James H. Hyslop	PERSON	's name is in the fog of , j i i i _ psychical known to many readers largely by research .

		reason of the assiduity of the daily press .

		Following its nose for news , it relieves the tedium of dull days by announcements of his investi - gations upon supernormal individuals of questionable integrity , proving once again the fact of communi - cation with the spirits of the departed .

		The vol - ume which he has lately added to the array of his contributions , '' Psychical Research and Survival '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a summary of his views , a mix - ture of unconvincing philosophy and unphilosophical conviction .

		Much of it is either an insincere quibble or a genuine muddle .

		The assumptions of tolerance as a substitute for clarity of thought , and of intricacy of relations for avoidance of elementary distinctions , are an annoyance to the discerning and a snare to the readily deluded .

		With or without permission , opinions will be formed concerning Psychical Re - search and concerning the possible survival of per - sonality ; and with or without warrant , books will be written on these themes .

		Opinions and books that are plainly extravagant reveal their propagandist motives and are rarely seductive .

		Those like Dr.
Hyslop	PERSON	's , that misrepresent scientific interests and philosophical aims , have a fog-like efficiency in obscuring the plainest truths and the most familiar landmarks of the mind .

		Fortunately , the recognition is becoming common that the vapors thus diffused are not the sign of inspiration , but of intoxication ; and that the interest in the revelations which they induce is swinging back after a long aberration to the normal equilibrium characteristic of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	sturdiness of mind .

		A compelling T the V ^ 6nd f * '' unusuallv lon g plea for life , the late
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	social justice .

		continued to manifest a zealous in - terest in social and economic problems .

		In fact , his approach to the great all-receiving inn seemed to quicken his heartfelt solicitude for the wayfarers he was leaving behind ; and it is most fitting that his last book , written after he had passed his ninetieth milestone , should be a zealous appeal for the poor and unfortunate .

		In `` The Revolt of Democracy '' -LRB-
Funk & Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the distinguished scientist
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 191 voices a sweeping demand that the workers of
England	LOCATION	shall have a fair share of the wealth they produce ; and that no hapless being , however help - lessly incompetent , shall be allowed to suffer the ex - treme penalty of poverty , in the form of starvation .

		Naturally it is not easy to urge anything new in the way of general arguments on these vital questions ; but the author 's opinions do carry the prestige of a great name , and he does offer some detailed sugges - tions of compelling interest .

		For example , he pro- poses that the British government should raise the wages of its huge army of civil servants , to encourage , or perhaps ensure , an improved wage scale for em - ployees in general ; that an increasing tax on great fortunes should be collected partly in land , thus mak - ing provision for those workers who can be induced to return to the soil ; and that young men should be taught something about farming or gardening , in ad - dition to two of the pursuits commonly called trades .

		Or again , he renews an earlier recommendation that free bread be supplied to all who want it , `` not as charity , not as poor relief , but as a rightful claim upon society for its neglect to organize itself so that all , without exception , who have worked , and are willing to work , or are unable to work , may at the very least have food to support life . ''

		Even from these few sentences it will be seen that the volume is as radical as the title would indicate , and each reader will have his opinion about the feasibility and desirability of the remedies suggested .

		As to the need for reform in the general direction urged by the author , there can of course be no question .

		The text proper is preceded by a fairly full and convenient sketch of
Wallace	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		i nc i u ding the sub - title , of a useful and readable little manual by Dr.
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	, who describes his work as `` an attempt to gather and group together many things that are discussed more thoroughly and at greater length in other places , but nowhere , the writer believes , all in one place , or in a style that will commend them to the general reader . ''

		Pri - marily the chapters were designed for pupils in library economy , being `` based on a series of lectures given first to the training class of the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, afterward to that of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and finally to that of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' of which the author is now libra - rian .

		The book treats of such topics as the follow - ing : the nature of literature , style , special literary forms , the reading of poetry aloud , our two lan - guages -LRB- spoken and written -RRB- , the structure of liter - ature , literature as a form of art , its appreciation and preservation , its makers , some formalities of written speech , the context in literature , the samp - ling of literature , and the sum of the matter .

		A timely word is uttered on so-called spelling-reform .

		* ' Reform is , or should be , the restoration of some good thing that has been changed or lost .

		In this instance the thing that has changed is the sound of the word the pronunciation .

		If there is to be reform , then , we should go back to the old sound not make a further change by altering the spell - ing . ''

		Hardly in the same wisely conservative spirit does the author express himself on the subject of capitalization .

		`` We are dropping useless punctua - tion and we have already dropped much capitali - zation .

		Probably the rest could be spared also . ''

		Admirable are the simplicity and directness , the clear - ness and conciseness , with which Dr.

		fo e structure of human society and its present evolution , is the contention of Mr.
Walter Heape	PERSON	in his book entitled '' Sex Antagonism '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		As his title hints , the author views with alarm the disruption of the established equilibrium , especially since in his opinion the disturbance is wrought by the militant spinsters , whose aims and social needs are quite distinct from those of the larger and less aggressive maternal element of society .

		The intra-class warfare thus initiated is , in the author 's view , likely to escape observation by the complacent and non-combatant male , but is nevertheless fraught with ill for his normal place in society .

		The author bases his opinions on the data of anthropology , and upon his study of reproductive processes in their rela - tion to health and disease .

		Primitive savage society evolved two antagonistic tendencies : exogamy , driv - ing the roving male afar for his mate , and totemism , 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	restricting and limiting inter-marriage in the inter - ests of mother and child .

		These two antagonistic tendences our author regards as basic still in the sex relations of modern life , and the feminist move - ment tends to augment the antagonism .

		He takes issue with Dr.
Fraser	PERSON	's idea that totemism had its origin in the ignorance of savage peoples concerning human paternity , and seeks rather to link it to primitive ideas of spirit conception and its more modern homologue the idea of maternal impres - sions .

		The fact that the author considers the theory of maternal or primitive impressions worthy of serious discussion will raise skepticism regarding the entire argument in the minds of most scientific critics , for this idea has long since been relegated to the limbo of superstitions by the advances of modern biology .

		The casual reader will find much in this book to stimulate his thinking in rather unusual direc - tions ; but he will finish it with the feeling that the author is strangely remote in his argument from the world of customs , ideas , and ideals of to-day , which are perhaps quite as potent in shaping human evolution now as were brutish instincts or savage superstitions in the past .

		The popularity of Lord
Avebury	PERSON	's '' Prehistoric Times - -LRB- Holt -RRB- is well attested by the fact that a seventh edition has now been issued of this comprehensive and succinct account of the ancient remains of pre - historic man in all lands and of the manners and customs of contemporary savage peoples .

		This last edition is the result of a complete revision made just prior to the death of the author , involving the resetting of the entire work and the inclusion of new material especially the remarkable records of prehistoric man and quaternary mammals in the interesting cave paintings recently brought to light in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Several colored plates repro - duce these unique and spirited portraits of these mammals now long since extinct , The author 's utilization of American sources is , perhaps natu - rally , somewhat limited .

		He has , for example , failed to avail himself of the later and more critical evidence regarding the authenticity of the Calaveras skull reputed to occur in auriferous gravels of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia .

		Many new illustrations are added or replace older ones , and the work is considerably extended over earlier editions by the new material added .

		Its wide scope , its lucid discussions of controversial matters and of interesting points raised by the fragmentary evidence of primitive man , and its abundant and well chosen data and illustrations , make it a mine of anthropological information .

John Cotton Dana	PERSON	's `` Modern Library Economy '' -LRB- Elm Tree Press -RRB- has advanced to the consideration of '' The High School Branch of the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which Miss
Elizabeth B. McKnight	PERSON	cooperates with the author-in-chief .

		In thirty-nine pages and under forty - seven section-headings , with the usual illustrative equipment , the subject is treated in the thorough man - ner characteristic of the work as a whole .

		This instal - ment constitutes Section 2 of Part VII .

		The general literature of bookplates is apparently sufficient to meet the demands of collectors , and now the tendency seems to be towards monographs dealing with special classes of ex libris .

		Of this character is Mr.
A. Winthrop Pope	PERSON	's handsomely-printed brochure on `` Theatrical Bookplates , '' which contains ten fac - similes of bookplates related to the dramatic profession , a brief essay on the delights of collecting bookplates , and a check list of theatrical bookplates in the author 's own collection , numbering about 125 .

		The work is issued in an edition limited to 150 copies by Mr.
H. Alfred Fowler	PERSON	, of
Kansas City	LOCATION	.

		The dull facts of poverty and struggle become lumin - ous at the touch of one who , like Dr.
Graham Taylor	PERSON	, the author of `` Religion in Social Action '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , writes out of his own experience .

		There are writers who con - descend to visit the districts of trouble to exploit them for literary purposes , and we feel that the result is superficial and hollow .

		Here is a work written by a man who has brought the facts of his faith to bear at all points on the facts of life ; he takes us into a real world .

		The biographical introduction by Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	interprets and authenticates the message .

		The churches are rapidly growing in appreciation of their new tasks , and this volume will help them to see and to act .

		The ideal of social science is to discover from obser - vation the significant facts of human association , the causes revealed by a series of facts , the desirable or un - desirable tendencies , and the wisdom of associated efforts as judged by accepted standards .

		Professor
J. R. Commons	PERSON	, the author of '' Labor and Administration '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has kept in close touch with the conditions which he describes and interprets , and he has held steadily to bis purpose to be fair to contending parties .

		The chapter on '' Standardizing the Home '' offers an ingenious and fruitful method of social observation in relation to domestic life .

		The book deals chiefly with the policies of trade unions .

		Especially valuable is the discussion of
the Industrial Commission of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and the function of investigation in administration .

		That the public library in
England	LOCATION	lags a little behind the public library in
America	LOCATION	, in scope and efficiency , we feel ourselves justified in maintaining .

		For instance , the information desk or bureau is still unknown to the English library system , and the cumbersome `` indicator ''
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 193 is even to this day a part of the equipment of some En - glish public libraries .

		Mr.
Walter C. Rae	PERSON	's little book on `` Public Library Administration '' -LRB- Button -RRB- is espe - cially interesting to American readers as incidentally illustrating some of the differences here hinted at .

		Mr.
Rae	PERSON	is Chief Librarian of the
Fulham Libraries	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and an experienced lecturer and teacher in his depart - ment of learning .

		He speaks with authority and deserves a respectful hearing .

		Bound in limp leather , and well printed and illustrated , the book is a little treasure of its sort .

		A convenient reissue of
Lionel de Fonseka	ORGANIZATION	's suggestive little '' Dialogue between an Oriental and an
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	on the Truth of Decorative Art '' is published by Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	.

		The author , himself a native of
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	, is nearer than he would admit to the creed of the Post-Impres - sionists in his disdain for the actualities of representa - tion which pass for art in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In a style that savors of Oscar Wilde , he inveighs against
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's dictum of `` Art for Art 's Sake , ' and insists on `` Art for Life 's Sake , '' on art as the adornment of life , `` the vindica - tion of the ways of man to man . ''

		How the vindication is to be accomplished by the merely conventional and universally understood symbolism which the Oriental uses in his art forms is not made entirely clear ; though there is plenty of material provided for a much longer debate on the subject than the author reports for us .

		Research and diligence and a good deal of labor in copying have gone into the handsome volume entitled '' Dedications : An Anthology of the Forms Used from the Earliest Days of Book-Making to the Present Time '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Miss
Mary Elizabeth Brown	PERSON	is the compiler , and a pathetic interest attaches to her work from the fact , as appears in her preface , that she has been for two years so nearly blind as to be forced to depend on the good offices of others in the clerical labors of her undertaking .

		From the dedicatory prologue to the '' Ludus Saccorum '' of Cessolis , translated into French by
Jean de Vigny	PERSON	,
1360	DATE	, to the much shorter and less formal dedications of the present time , the selected specimens illustrate the approved modes of inditing one 's book to the
Deity	LOCATION	, to the
Virgin Mary	ORGANIZATION	, to kings and princes and nobles , to prelates and statesmen , to friends and relatives , and even to oneself , and to many others either individually or collectively .

		Three facsimiles add interest to this rather unusual volume , which is also equipped with a bibliography and an author index .

		The
Bibliophile Society	ORGANIZATION	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, issues '' The Early Life of
John Howard Payne	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Willis T. Hanson	PERSON	, Jr. , in '' a limited number of copies ... printed privately for the Editor , for complimentary distribution . ''

		The value of the work lies in its reproduction of letters , or parts of letters , written by
Payne	PERSON	in his boyhood and youth , and never before made public .

		A fortunate chance placed these letters , as copied in a letter-book by their writer , in Mr.
Hanson	PERSON	's possession , and from them he gleans many new items of interest concerning the rather stormy early life of the gifted actor , playwright , and poet .

		But though he strives to dispossess his readers of the notion that
Payne	PERSON	's life was , on the whole , a failure , the impression left by the book itself is that of unusual powers misdirected and frittered away , more through the unwisdom of his elders , at the outset , than by his own fault .

		Nevertheless , or therefore , the youthful
Payne	PERSON	is a fascinating subject for biographical research , and Mr.
Hanson	PERSON	's book would easily find favor with a wider circle of readers than it is likely to reach in its present restricted edition .

		NOTES .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	is to write a volume on
Swinburne	PERSON	for the '' English Men of Letters , '' a task for which few living writers are better qualified .


George Brandes	PERSON	's study of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is to be issued in an English translation this
Spring	DATE	, according to an announcement of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A uniform collected edition , in five volumes , of Mr.

		Figures Famed in Fiction , '' a collection of studies of fourteen heroes or heroines of the world 's greatest novels , is announced for

Edward	PERSON	-LRB- '' Omar '' -RRB-
FitzGerald	PERSON	, has been edited for the press by
May Eleanor FitzGerald Kerrick	ORGANIZATION	, a great - niece of '' old Fitz , '' and will comprise two volumes in Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	's '' Eversley Series . ''

		The success of Hon.
James Bryce	PERSON	's fine study of
South America	LOCATION	has led to the preparation of a new and revised edition of the work , and also of a translation into Spanish made by
Guillermo Rivera	PERSON	.

		Both volumes are to appear very shortly , with the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	imprint .

		Dr.
Morton Prince	PERSON	's '' The Unconscious : The Funda - mentals of Human Personality , '' being an introduction to the study of abnormal psychology , will be ready within a few weeks .

		While based on sound research and experiment , the work is said to have a decided popular interest .

		It is pleasant news that Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	is continu - ing his autobiography so delightfully launched in the vol - ume of a year or two ago entitled '' A Small Boy and Others . ''

		A second instalment , '' Notes of a Son and Brother , '' is promised for
Spring	DATE	issue by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		Mrs.

		Three Great Russian Novelists '' is the title of Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	's study of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	, and
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	, to be published shortly .

		Mrs.
Garnett	PERSON	's translations of these three novelists are familiar to all English readers of Russian fiction , and it will be remem - bered that her versions of Turgenev were produced under her husband 's editorial supervision .

		A discussion of the problem of intemperance from a somewhat new standpoint is promised in Dr.
Joseph Henry Crocker	PERSON	's '' Shall I Drink ? ''

		which the
Pilgrim Press of Boston	ORGANIZATION	will publish this
Spring	DATE	.

		The work embodies a wide survey of facts from scientific labora - tories , insurance observations , medical records , and industrial experiences , and will contain about a score of instructive charts and diagrams .

		Mr.

		This will be the third in the series of books published for the
Bureau of Social Hygiene	ORGANIZATION	by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Readers of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's '' Partial Portraits , '' '' French Poets and Novelists , '' and '' Essays in

		Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	has rendered a fine translation which is scholarly , musical and poetic .

		It is not alone these qualities which commend the book to an appreciative reader , it is rather the strong pulse of truth made clear in every thought of the old Mediterranean Greek who lived a contemporary of the great Athenians about Pericles .

		He was not only a statesman and philosopher , but a poet , a wonderful personality , an egotistic , melancholy , elo - quent soul .

		A conscientious attempt on the part of a lover of literature and philosophy to present the frag - ments of Empedocles in English blank verse that shall bring out their poetry no less than their meaning ; accom - panied by the Greek text of Diels , notes interpreting the ideas of each fragment , and an essay on the author as man , philosopher and poet .

		Hereafter our Retail business will be concentrated in the Putnam Building , Forty - fifth Street , just west of Fifth Avenue , where our Publishing offices are established , and where for three years we have operated the new Retail store .

		We can not transfer the stock from Twenty-third Street , as the new store is already full and complete .

		We are therefore offering the entire huge stock to the public at such startling and drastic prices as will doubtless insure its sale within a few weeks .

		No attempt is made to catalogue them , as the stock changes greatly from day to day .

		A personal visit of inspection will pay .

		But we will answer any specific inquiries from those who can not call .

		We note herewith just a few items of which we offer varying quantities .

		Some of these books are quite new , others are slightly shelf-worn or rubbed .

NEW YORK	LOCATION	220 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	Announcements of The Open Court Publishing Company THE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY in the Light of the Philosophy of Science By
PAUL CARUS	PERSON	Cloth .


$ 1	MONEY	.

		OO The author recognizes the correctness of the Principle of Relativity , but criticises the exaggerated statements which have done much to confuse students , and to mystify the reading public .

		The
Boston Transcript	ORGANIZATION	correctly summarizes his position as follows : `` Absolute existence , in fact everything absolute , is impossible .

		Reality is not immovable and unchangeable absoluteness but the effectiveness of things in their relation .

		All things are in a flux , and we ourselves are constantly changing .

		The only way to make knowledge possible is to ignore complications and to consider a thing as fixed .

		This is a fiction similar to that in calculus where a curve is thought of as made up of a succession of straight lines infinitesimal in length . ''

		The philosophy of science is the philosophy .

		If the philosophy of science had been better known , the principle of relativity would have at once been rightly understood and the vagaries of many mystifying contentions would have been avoided . ''

		After presenting the problem and referring it to the domain of a priori reasoning rather than to that of experiment the author quotes and discusses Prof. D ,
F. Comstock	PERSON	's characterization of relativity , Prof.
Emil Cohn	PERSON	's account of the Pizeau experiment .

		Dr.
Philip Frank	PERSON	's discussion of absolute motion and absolute space in which the contrasted views of Professors
Ernst Mach	ORGANIZATION	and
Alois Hofler	PERSON	are presented .

		Mr.
Norman Campbell	PERSON	and Prof.
William Francis Magie	PERSON	are quoted and the merits of the Michelson-Morley experiment is discussed .

		THE MECHANISTIC PRINCIPLE AND THE NON-MECHANICAL By
PAUL CARUS	PERSON	Cloth .


$ 1	MONEY	.

		OO The truth of the mechanistic principle is here unreservedly acknowledged in this little book , without any equivocation or limitation , and it is pointed out that the laws of mechanics apply without exception to all motions ; but they do not apply to things that are not motions .

		Ideas and sentiments as such are not motions .

		The physiological functions of thinking , willing , and feeling present uninterrupted channels of cerebral motions .

		Thus , while thinking is unquestionably a mechanical process , there is an element in our life that is not mechanical and in this domain there would be no sense in expecting a mechanical explanation .

		How , for instance , can the meaning of a word , of thoughts or symbols of logical syllogisms be mechanically explained ?

		The essential feature of all higher organic life is the appearance of purpose , and the task which the author sets himself is a careful investigation of the problem how purpose is possible in a mechanically regulated world .

		A considerable portion is devoted to the mechanistic views of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	and La Mettrie .

		The philosophy of the former , here presented in copious extracts , is otherwise quite inaccessible to the reading public ; and La Mettrie , the pioneer of this theory , appears rather onesided in ignoring the factor of the non-mechanical .

		Yet these non-mechanical elements play an important part in the mechanism of the brain .

		Among the opponents of the mechanistic theory , the views of Dr.
William Benjamin Smith	PERSON	and of Dr.
James Thompson Bixby	PERSON	are discussed in detail .

		A story of adventure and mystery , but entirely unlike anything this famous author of mystery stories , and creator of '' She '' and ''
Allan Quatermain	PERSON	, '' has previously done .

		It relates the adventurous history of
Olaf the Northman	PERSON	, who lived in the ninth century , as revealed by psychic power to a modern reincarnation of the old Berserker .

		The story opens at
Aar	ORGANIZATION	in the far north , and the life of the wild
Northmen	ORGANIZATION	is vividly portrayed in a series of '' scenes '' culminating in the discovery of the '' Wanderer 's Necklace , '' the source of
Olaf	PERSON	's subsequent troubles and triumphs . ''

		There is plenty of incident of the most stirring sort ... It is a fascinating tale of adventure , and in its telling lacks nothing of that persuasive charm of which Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	has so many times shown himself a master .

		The action begins in the
Northland	LOCATION	at a period far back in the Dark Ages .

		The author soon warms into that rapid swinging stride with which his tales usually go , and thereafter momentous events and stirring scenes and hours of suspense come in swift succession . ''

		Frey tag 's vigorous sketch of Luther as he stands , like Thor of old , enveloped in murky clouds while the light - ning flashes and the thunder-hammer booms , serves well to illustrate the climax of that great struggle which forms the innermost kernel of mediaeval history the struggle between the iron-heeled collectivism of the Romans and the fierce individualism of the Germanic races .

		NEW LAMPS FOR OLD . ''

		Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge ; it is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all Science . ''

		The quotation is so hackneyed that we are almost ashamed to recall it to the attention of our readers , who must have known it by heart all their lives , but there are times when the im - pulse to go back to first principles becomes an mperative mandate .

		`` A frequent recurrence to the principles of civil government is absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty . ''

		These noble words of the
Illinois Constitution	ORGANIZATION	remind us of a similar urgency of obligation in other spheres of thought than the political , and wherever the fundamentals are flouted or ig - nored , it behooves those who stand for sanity and the acceptance of the ripe fruits of the world 's experience to rally around the old standards .

		The parlous times in which we live afford occasions innumerable for thus call - ing out the old guard , for it has become the fashion with young people to reject everything that has been tested in the alembic of reflection , and to offer us in its stead all manner of raw and fantastic imaginings .

		Whatever is old must perforce be outworn ; whatever is new must be deserving of serious consideration just because of its novelty , and the more freakish the form of expression , the more assured the triumph .

		What we are about to say is concerned mainly with the art of poetry , which accounts for the Wordsworthian text , and also for the following collocation of words descriptive of
Chicago	LOCATION	: Hog Butcher for the World ,
Tool Maker	ORGANIZATION	, Stacker of Wheat , Player with Railroads and the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	's Freight Handler ; Stormy , husky , brawling , City of the Big Shoulders . ''

		Here a word of explanation is needed .

		The typographical arrangement of this jargon cre - ates a suspicion that it is intended to be taken as some form of poetry , and the suspicion is confirmed by the fact that it stands in the forefront of the latest issue of a futile little periodical described as `` a magazine of verse . ''

		This , then , is what the coterie responsible for 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	the conduct of the magazine take to belong in the category which also includes : '' Yet once more , O ye laurels , and once more Ye myrtles brown , with ivy never sere , I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude ; And , with forced fingers rude , Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year . ''

		And '' The woods decay , the woods decay and
fall	DATE	, The vapours weep their burthen to thje ground , Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath , And after many a
summer	DATE	dies the swan . ''

		Well , there is poetry and poetry , and it is some - times instructive to place the worst in juxtapo - sition with the best for the sake of the contrast , just as Conductor Stock recently sandwiched a composition by
Schoenberg	PERSON	between symphonies by
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	and
Brahms	PERSON	in a concert pro- gramme which he must have planned with a diabolical chuckle .

		One was in doubt , at the end , whether any definition of the category could possibly be framed comprehensive enough to embrace the examples ; and one is equally in doubt whether the broadest definition of poetry could be made to embrace the three specimens of composition cited above , but we have to deal with the simple fact that certain persons obvi - ously and honestly think that the characteriza - tion of
Chicago	LOCATION	blurted out in such ugly fashion may possibly have some relation to the divine art which
Wordsworth	PERSON	defined , and
Milton	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	exemplified .

		For our part , we deny the relation altogether .

		The definition which should allow admission of these chunks of inchoate observation to the sacred precincts of the muse would not be a definition of any form of art at all , for all defi - nitions of art must say or imply that beauty is an essential aim of the worker , and there is no trace of beauty in the ragged lines we have quoted or in the whole piece of which it is the opening .

		It is not even doggerel , for doggerel at least admits the claims of rhythm , and this composition admits no aesthetic claim of any description , and acknowledges subordination to no kind of law .

		We are told that the author '' left school at the age of thirteen , and worked in brickyards , railroads ,
Kansas	LOCATION	wheat fields , etc. , '' which we can well believe .

		That educa - tion might have made him a poet we will concede ; that these unregulated word - eruptions earn for him that title we can nowise allow .

		There are many ways of acquiring an education , no doubt , and the academic path is by no means the only one that leads to culture , but in these `` hog - butcher '' pieces there is no discernible evidence that culture has * been attained .

		At the risk of being set upon the bad eminence of the reviewer who advised
Keats	PERSON	to go back to his pills and ointments , we are inclined to suggest that this author would be more at home in the brickyard than on the slopes of
Parnassus	LOCATION	.

		We have always sympathized with
Ruskin	PERSON	for the splenetic words about
Whistler	LOCATION	that were the occasion of the famous suit for libel , and we think that such an effusion as the one now under consideration is nothing less than an impudent affront to the poetry-loving public .

		If the '' Ahkoond of Swat '' type of verse is to be accepted as a nor - mal form of the lyric , all the old aesthetic canons must go by the board .

		The eternal law of art as of character is Goethe 's '' In der Beschrankung zeigt sich erst der Meister , '' and the aspirant for poetic laurels should be under bonds to accept its salutary tyranny .

		Any other way lies aesthetic anarchy .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	has recently been talking to us about the art of poetry , and his message seems to be that rhet - oric must be eschewed .

		But rhetoric is simply the fine art of expression , nothing more nor less than that .

		There is splendid rhetoric and there is tawdry rhetoric ; there is the rhetoric of ex - alted emotion and the rhetoric of conceit and fancy , but both species pay homage to some guiding principle of expression .

		To condemn all rhetoric off-hand is to condemn nearly all great poetry , to condemn , for example , '' O here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh , '' which is simply rhetoric of the most magnificent sort , for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was the most consummate rhetorician of the modern world .

		The thing to do is , not to deny to rhetoric its valid claims , but to learn to distinguish its nobler from its baser forms .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is quoted as saying , at a recent literary dinner in
London	LOCATION	: `` One may admire
Tennyson	PERSON	, but we can not read him . ''

		This is a most damning confession of limitation .

		We hold Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	to be a very noble poet , but he never , at his highest , achieved a passage that could match the opening verses of '' Tithonus , '' above quoted , and if he '' can not read '' such poetry , it augurs ill for the perma - nency of his fame , and shows his critical judg - ment to be well-nigh worthless .

		Sir
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	, writing the other day in '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' said some very wise things about the present experimental age in poetry , with its craze for novelty , its determi - nation to be original at any cost , its strident
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 233 means of arresting attention , and its contempt for poetic greatness as hitherto understood .

		The passage is lengthy , but it is just what we need for the close of this discussion , and we reproduce it in full : '' The great difficulty that weighs on a poet at the present day is , I believe , his relation to the tradition that lies behind him .

		If he is the possessor of a lucky temperament or great genius he will probably never think about that relation at all .

		He will create what he wants to create ; he will use such traditional ideas and forms as come naturally to him , and will probably love them because he happens to love poetry .

		But the young poet who lacks these exceptional gifts will be troubled by a thousand small devils shouting in his ear .

		When he likes some poem they will say , ' Pooh !

		That went out of fashion in
1908	DATE	. '

		When he feels a large or high emotion they will murmur , For heaven 's sake do n't be Victorian ! '

		When he thinks of a good story they will shiver , ` Ugh !

		Melodrama . '

		When he makes a clear or wise judgment upon life they will shriek in real alarm , ' Puritanism and the end of all things ! '

		If , discouraged , he turns to them for guidance , then heaven help him !

		They will tell him to be at all costs original ; to be unlike everybody else ; to eschew care - fully all the qualities that he finds in the good poets of the past .

		They will say to him privately , ' Do not try to achieve beauty .

		It is hard , and no one knows it when they see it .

		Do not try for wisdom ; people do not like it .

		Achieve something new .

		We can all tell when a thing is new .

		The verses of the good old poets would generally scan , let yours never scan .

		Their stories were moving , let yours be dull .

		Their charac - ters were interesting , let yours be scrupulously the reverse .

		They kept an eye on truth or else on ideal beauty , do you carefully avoid either .

		They loved poetry , do you hate it .

		Then as long as you are new , you will be successful , perhaps for as much as six weeks . ' '

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A GREAT CARTOONIST OF THE VICTORIAN AGE , born only a year later than
Queen Victoria	PERSON	, and knighted by her in
1893	DATE	, died near the end of
last month	DATE	, full of years and of honors .

		Sir
John Ten	PERSON	- niel will long be remembered for the masterly and often shrewdly-prophetic political cartoons which he contributed to `` Punch '' for more than forty years ; but perhaps his best claim to immortality is to be found in his famous illustrations to those joyous juvenile classics , ''
Alice	PERSON	in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' and `` Through the Looking-Glass . ''

		A pathetic in - terest attaches to the story of his life and artist - activities from the fact that he lost the use of one eye in his youth while fencing with his father , and thus was seriously handicapped in his chosen pro- fession ; and his latter years were passed in total blindness . ''

		Do they suppose there is anything funny about me ? ''

		he asked when he was invited to join the staff of `` Punch '' in
1851	DATE	.

		It had been his ambition to become a great painter , not a car - toonist and caricaturist , as proved to be his ultimate destiny .

		His merciless caricatures of our President
Lincoln	PERSON	are still remembered by those whose mem - ories go back to the war between the
States	LOCATION	; but he later acknowledged the error of his ways in respect to that great man , and `` Punch '' itself did the handsome and the befitting thing in both verse and illustration when
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	died .

		Ii is claimed for
Tenniel	PERSON	's sagacity in public affairs that he only once made a mistake in his graphic forecasts of events to come ; and that was when he pictured General
Gordon	PERSON	, at
Khartoum	LOCATION	, clasping the hand of the commander who had hastened to his relief .

		That cartoon , entitled '' At Last ! ''

		was hardly printed when tidings of the sadly different reality of the matter reached
England	LOCATION	.

		Sir
John	PERSON	has been described as a typical gentleman of the old school , , bearing the ills of life with philosophical composure , and endeared to the host of friends who had become attached to him .

		THE WRITINGS OF THE NEW
JOHNS HOPKINS	PERSON	PRESIDENT , Dr.
Frank Johnson Goodnow	PERSON	, show him to be a close student of municipal problems and administrative law ; and the record of his activities proves that he is no mere theorist , no studious recluse , no shirker of difficult duties connected with municipal government and even larger administra - tive affairs .

		He served on the
New York Charter Revision Committee	ORGANIZATION	, on the
Efficiency Commission	ORGANIZATION	appointed by President
Taft	PERSON	, and two years ago rendered important service in investigating the
New York	LOCATION	school system .

		Finally , and most important of all , he has been for nearly a year special adviser on legal and constitutional questions to the President of the new Chinese republic .

		He is the author of `` Comparative Administrative Law , '' `` Municipal Home Rule , '' `` Municipal Problems , '' '' Politics and
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` City Government in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' and `` Principles of Administrative Law in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Also he has edited '' Selected Cases on the Law of Taxation , '' '' Selected Cases on Government and
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` Selected Cases on the Law of Officers , '' and `` Social Reform and the Constitution . ''

		His college education was re - ceived at
Amherst	LOCATION	, whence he was graduated in
1879	DATE	at the age of twenty ; he then studied law at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and afterward continued his studies at the
Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	, and at
the University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1883	DATE	he was appointed instructor at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, where he con - tinued to teach and lecture on administrative law , municipal science , and kindred subjects , until his call to
China	LOCATION	.

		He comes to
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	well equipped to guide the destinies of that great and growing university on the new site which it hopes before long to occupy .

		THE REVIVAL OF A VANISHING ART , one to which literature owes an incalculable debt , was attempted by
William Morris	PERSON	when he made a diligent study of the best examples of calligraphy and illumination that have come down to us on parchment and vel - lum and papyrus , and turned these researches to 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	account in the making of some beautiful printed books and some choice manuscripts .

		More recently another Englishman , Mr.
Edward Johnston	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	, has been doing his part toward restoring this declining art to favor .

		And now , on this side of the ocean , the officials of the
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library or , more particularly , of the
Museum Association	ORGANIZATION	connected with the library and using a part of its building have interested them - selves in this branch of art , and are at present exhibiting some examples of it as executed by the deft hand of Miss
Elizabeth H. Webb	PERSON	.

		In a brief printed announcement of the exhibition , sent out by the
Newark Museum Association	ORGANIZATION	, we read of Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's work in restoring this neglected craft : `` He is teaching it by the direct method instead of by the laborious and indirect method of copying the texts of old
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		His theory is that with the same tool which the old writers used , a quill pen so cut as to gives strokes like those found in old MSS. , and by a careful study of each stroke made in form - ing letters , and by long and patient practice , present - day writing can disclose the same freedom and feeling , can be as sensitive to the writer 's power and mood , and can possess the same beauty , as did the old .

		These results are obviously impossible by the indirect method of blocking out the letters with a pencil and then filling in with ink . ''

		That we are not yet incurably corrupted by the type-writer and the printing press is evidently Miss
Webb	PERSON	's and Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's hope .

		A list of forty-two historic styles of lettering illustrated by
Miss Webb	PERSON	, and of seven `` books written '' by her , follows the intro - ductory matter .

		J AN AUTHOR 'S HELPMATE is seldom more truly helpful to her husband than was Mrs.
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, whose death has recently been reported .

		Mr.
S. S. McClure	PERSON	, who knew the Stevensons well , warmly praises her in the current instalment of his autobiography . ''

		The more I saw of the Stevensons , '' he says , `` the more I became convinced that Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	was the unique woman in the world to be
Stevenson	PERSON	's wife ... When
Stevenson	PERSON	met her , her exotic beauty was at its height , and with this beauty she had a wealth of experience , a reach of imagination , a sense of humor , which he had never found in any other woman .

		Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	had many of the fine qualities that we usually attribute to men rather than women : a fairmindedness , a large judgment , a robust , inconsequential philosophy of life , without which she could not have borne , much less shared with a relish equal to his own , his wander - ing , unsettled life , his vagaries , his gipsy passion for freedom .

		She had a really creative imagination , which she expressed in living .

		She always lived with great intensity , had come more into contact with the real world than
Stevenson	PERSON	had done at the time when they met , had tried more kinds of life , known more kinds of people .

		When he married her , he married a woman rich in knowledge of life and the world .

		Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	's autobiography would be one of the most interesting books in the world .

		... A sick man of letters never married into a family so well fitted to help him make the most of his powers .

		Mrs.
Steven	PERSON	- son and both of her children were gifted ; the whole family could write .

		When
Stevenson	PERSON	was ill , one of them could always lend a hand and help him out ... Whenever he had a new idea for a story , it met , at his own fireside , with the immediate recognition , appreciation , and enthusiasm so necessary to an artist , and which he so seldom finds among his own blood or in his own family . ''

		But how few of Ste - venson 's admiring readers have ever stopped to reckon up their debt of gratitude to this exceptional woman , who for fifteen years held so large a place it his life and work .

		THE COMPARATIVE DELIGHTS OF LITERATURE AND FARMING , of menticulture and agriculture , as one might express it , are presented to view in a graphic table accompanying the current Report of the Registrar of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	an elaborate document , rich in meaning to the discerning eye .

		The table referred to does not confine itself to the two branches of education named above ; it shows the increase or decrease of enrolment by depart - ments , or colleges , during the past two decades , and incidentally illustrates the steady and considerable growth of the college of agriculture and that of lit - erature and arts , as contrasted with the inferior vigor or the more marked fluctuations noticeable in the other schools .

		As might have been predicted in this age of extraordinary advance in the mechanic arts , the department of engineering shows the greatest present strength ; but its growth has been chiefly within the last dozen years , and for some reason a sharp decline took place in the final year of the record .

		The line denoting the ups and downs of the college of literature and arts registers but one year of decline , and that a very slight falling-off , while in general its course is an even ascent , neither excessively steep , nor unduly gentle .

		Next below it , and almost parallel with it , but tending in recent years to approach and perhaps promising ere long to pass it , runs the line of the agricultural school , a climb - ing line without a single downward slope in its twenty years ' course .

		Much else of significance might be pointed out in this rich pamphlet , but for the present it must suffice to call attention to the flourishing condition of literary and agricultural studies at our
State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Surely there is fair promise for the community that devotes itself largely to the tillage of the soil and the highest culture of the intellect .

		THE TRUE CAUSE OF DICKENS 'S DEATH , or at least a contributory factor , has possibly seemed to others beside the present writer to have been a har - rowing perplexity over the `` mystery '' of
Edwin Drood	PERSON	a mystery that the late memorable trial before Mr.
Justice Chesterton	PERSON	has in no wise helped to clear up .

		And now there comes to notice some comments by Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	in his paper , `` The Sphere , '' in which the opinion of Edmund
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 235
Yates	PERSON	on this head is cited .

		Some time in the seven - ties of the nineteenth century
Yates	PERSON	was questioned by Mr.
Charles Noverre	PERSON	as to the solution of `` The Mystery of
Edwin Drood	PERSON	, '' and the questioner has now made public , in a letter to `` The Eastern Daily Press , '' the answer given by
Yates	PERSON	; and this answer re-appears in `` The Sphere . ''

		`` To my surprise , '' writes Mr.
Noverre	PERSON	, `` he replied that even
Dickens	PERSON	did not know , and that he really thought the trouble to find a satisfactory solution hastened his end .

		He informed me that
Dickens	PERSON	never concocted a plot , although he had a pervading motive such as the abuses of the Court of Chancery in '
Bleak House	ORGANIZATION	' when writing his novels , and positively looked for inspiration at the time when the monthly part had to be issued .

		Such a system , or want of sys - tem , was bound to land him in difficulty sooner or later . ''

		Who knows but it may have helped to land him in his grave ?

		It is a significant fact that his death occurred very soon after an urgent call from the printer for the remaining manuscript of the unfinished novel .

		PUBLIC APPRECIATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES is gauged by the statistician in various ways : some - times he compares the population of a town with its library registration , again he quotes the number of volumes circulated in one year for each inhabitant , or he notes the amount of annual appropriation for each inhabitant , or , finally , he may cite the yearly circulation of each volume in the library -LRB- estimated by dividing the total circulation for twelve months by the number of volumes owned -RRB- .

		Noticeable in the current Report of what is virtually the public library of
Baltimore	LOCATION	the
Enoch Pratt Free Library	ORGANIZATION	is the closing page , which is devoted to compar - ative library statistics of thirty-seven of our prin - cipal cities , including
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	's plea for an enlargement of the central building and for increased annual appropriations deserves to be heard and heeded ; and the fact of the rather niggardly treatment which his library receives at the hands of the city fathers may largely account for the poor showing it makes in some respects in the statistical table .

		For instance , its registration appears to be considerably less than one-tenth of its population a low percentage as compared with most of the other cities on the list .

		But registration figures are ad - mittedly open to a false interpretation , active card - holders being not always distinguished from inactive .

		In the circulation column we find a record equival - ent to an annual lending of each volume twice and a small fraction over , whereas
San Francisco	LOCATION	, for example , and
Portland	LOCATION	-LRB-
Oregon	LOCATION	-RRB- lend each volume almost seven times ,
Cleveland	LOCATION	five times and a frac - tion ,
Chicago	LOCATION	nearly six times , and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	nearly five times .


Boston	LOCATION	, with its great library and comparatively small registration , shows a circulation of about one and three-quarters for each volume , and
Providence	LOCATION	a circulation of less than one and one-half .


New York	LOCATION	has a creditable figure almost five .

		So much for statistics .

		GOVERNMENTAL UNFAIRNESS TO PUBLISHERS , and so , indirectly , to the buyers of those publishers ' books , is no new thing .

		A particular instance of stupid and unjust taxation of literature is at present exciting vehement protest from the American Pub - lishers ' Copyright League ; and all fair-minded readers , on having their attention called to the matter , will join in the chorus of remonstrance .

		A recent ruling of the
Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION	affects and , if it remains unreversed , is likely to prohibit the American sale of English publications hitherto imported by publishers on the payment of a duty based on the actual cost to them of the imported edition .

		Now our government , feeling that it is not exacting the utmost penny legally due , issues orders that such books be taxed on the basis of their '' market price in
England	LOCATION	, '' not on that proportion of the cost of production which the American dealer agrees to pay to the English publisher in return for a corresponding proportion of the total issue .

		Is there a determination in high places to reduce this country to a condition of savagery ?

		The penalty imposed on buyers of certain works of art and pro- ducts of the printing press almost inclines one to believe this to be the case .

		Will it avail nothing to point out that the above-mentioned ruling is ut - terly contrary to the spirit and purpose of the late reduction of duties on books as enacted in the
Underwood	LOCATION	tariff bill ?

		Against stupidity the very gods themselves contend in vain as has been re - marked several thousands of times since
Schiller	PERSON	.

		A STRANGE TASTE IN PSEUDONYMS was displayed by the enormously prolific author who wrote more than two hundred novels under the rather common - place name of ''
Bertha M. Clay	PERSON	, '' and who was under contract to continue writing them at the rate of four a year , and also to furnish two short stories each month , for a large publishing house in
London	LOCATION	, when death from overwork -LRB- small wonder ! -RRB-

		stopped his output a few days ago .

		His real name , known probably to not one in a thousand of his readers , was

		THEODORE LOW DE
VINNE	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Of the men who have contributed to the development of the processes of printing during the
last half of the nineteenth century	DATE	none is more worthy of the intelligent appreciation of all the people than
Theodore Low De Vinne	PERSON	, who , in the ripeness of a worthy life , has recently passed away .

		His service to printing covered the entire period of its modern development , from the time of the practical utilization of rotary presses to the introduction and perfection of machines for setting type .

		About the time he entered the printing business , some attempt was being made to apply steam power to the operation of printing presses , and it was his own firm of
Francis Hart & Co.	ORGANIZATION	that first began to print on dry paper .

		Only a few years before he became an apprentice ,
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	used but one rotary press , and drove it by horse power , the horse -LRB- or mule -RRB- being raised by means of a tackle to the upper story where the new and novel press was installed , and let down to terra firma at night in the same manner .

		When Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	started to learn the printing business , type-setting machines were only a dream , there were but very few cylinder presses , nobody thought of trying to print on dry paper , and only a few of the more venturesome dreamed of any - thing but man power .

		In his own shop , that of
Francis Hart & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the first successful attempts were made to use the cylinder press for anything but newspapers , cheap pamphlets , almanacs , etc. .

		Fine printing on cylinder presses was considered impossible until this concern persisted in experiments , and finally discovered how to make a form ready and produce good job work on a cylinder press .

		Thus there is no department of printing , as now practiced , that does not owe something substantial to the persevering industry and insight of Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	, ixcept the machine composition of type .

		That process , though he recognized its inevitability and its utility for ertain work , he always resisted as applied to good book and magazine work ; but he lived to see it su - preme , even in his own shop and for the periodicals he had made models of good typography .

		But he was practically through with his active work before the machines drove the hand work out of the periodical field , and he was not personally obliged to modify his ideals to allow the machines the right of way .

		Up to the time of the adoption of machine work for '' The Century Magazine '' and '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	, '' these periodicals were models of typographical excellence .

		On the `` Century , '' Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	had lavished himself .

		He had years before devised a display type , known then and now as `` De Vinne , '' which began the revolu - tion in display typography that has not yet quite com - pleted its beneficent work .

		He designed a type for the magazine that embodied many of the ideas he had imbibed and evolved from his experience and study .

		It was called '' Century Expanded , '' and for a number of years it was held for the exclusive use of the maga - zine .

		When it was put in use the attempt was made to use the French form of quotation marks with it , and , though these marks are really much more sensible and harmonious than our awkward apostrophes and inverted commas , readers objected to them and they were dis - continued .

		This type was discarded by the magazine some ten or twelve years ago , and was then put on the market by the type founders .

		It was at once taken up by the newspapers for advertising purposes , and has since been one of the more popular and extensively used body types .

		It is perhaps as near an ideal face as it is possible to get , embodying extreme legibility with those qualities of form and tone which have been found more agreeable and easy for the eye .

		Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	's theory of printing would now be re - garded as somewhat too conservative .

		His scheme for type composition was thorough , and his main idea was to produce a readable page .

		He attained this through careful handling of accepted forms , rather than through innovations .

		He led the way in the development of presswork , and from his shop came a large pro- portion of the improvements in method and practice following the general utilization of the cylinder press .

		To a certain point , he refined the processes of type - setting , though as to basic principles he was a conserv - ative .

		Given the fundamentals of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	and the early masters , he secured his distinctive results by means of carefully studied proportions , fitness of paper , excellent presswork , etc. .

		He was ultra in nothing , and was reluctant to assent to the newer ideas evolved from and based upon universal principles of art , so that some of his best pieces of work give one the impression that he was making a great effort to justify , through his careful and skilful employment of the older methods and forms , the work of the old masters , rather than to exemplify and introduce the newer ideas of those stu - dents who based their convictions upon the principles of art and the requirements of the eye .

		He did not sym - pathize with the extreme conservatism of
William Morris	PERSON	, for example , whose ideals all belonged to the eighteenth century ; nor did he accept the extreme for - ward look of such men as Mr.
D. B. Updike	PERSON	and Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	.

		His were the ideals and the methods of the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	, in
England	LOCATION	, which has perpetu -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 237 ated the work of those early printers who were obliged to obtain their results with one series of type , and who had always before their eyes the artistic forms and fundamentals of the manuscript books of the highly developed artistic period before the invention of mov - able types .

		Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	's great merit was that he promoted his good ideas .

		He was not content to be a good printer , but he was always trying in his way to make other printers good printers .

		He was an evangelist in print - ing .

		He had scarcely become settled in his work before he began to publish books about printing , and gradually the list became long and important .

		He was a writer to the last .

		After his retirement from active business he produced several books , notably the series upon '' The Practice of Typography , '' comprising four volumes , '' Plain Printing Types , '' '' Correct Composition , '' '' Title Pages , '' and '' Book Composition . ''

		He published a book on '' The Invention of Printing '' in
1876	DATE	, the year before he acquired the business of
Francis Hart & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		and made it
Theodore L. De Vinne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	; and he has been responsible for many volumes since then , the more notable being , besides the series above mentioned , '' His - toric Types '' and ''
Christopher Plantin	PERSON	. ''

		In
1910	DATE	he issued a work on '' The Notable Printers of
Italy	LOCATION	during the loth Century . ''

		He wrote innumerable articles for magazines and the printing trade papers , and was much in demand as a speaker .

		He gathered a fine library of works relating to printing and allied arts , and he was acquainted with everything that happened anywhere in the world that was of consequence to printing .

		It was his especial delight to show his fine books and historic examples of the printing of the old masters He was very kind to his fellow craftsmen , taking advantage of every opportunity to encourage and assist them .

		He delighted in helping young men and boys who were entering the business , and never wearied in counselling and directing them .

		He was generous to prodigality with his great store of knowledge concerning the history and practice of printing .

		Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	was for many years the most vital force in the printing business in
America	LOCATION	, dragging it out of the slough of imperfect education , bad precedent , and commercial false doctrines .

		In the day of his meridian he was the supreme authority as to correct typographical form and style , and his work was for many years the best extant .

		To-day , even less than a decade since he abandoned active control of his Press , he is a man of the past in the printing world .

		He did his work with remarkable ability and steadfast devo - tion , and he held rigidly to his ideals .

		When the time came that he could not go on with the flood he anchored his craft .

		When he died the other day we all felt keen regret at the loss of the man , while realizing that a great master printer of the near past had finished his career , his work having already been completed .

		Personally , Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	was a very charming man .

		He was full of the milk of human kindness , always seeking opportunity to befriend his fellows .

		He was popular in the craft , and in every contact with others .

		He was a big-brained and big hearted man , and the success he achieved was much more than the success he made of his business he made a success of him - self , and he helped many of his fellowmen to make successes of themselves .

		Nothing much better can be said of anyone , when the time comes that he must lay down the life that has been such an opportunity for him .


New York City	LOCATION	,

		GEORGE FRENCH .

		ANTI-BABEL .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As noted in one of your recent issues , the labor of
Ivar Aasen	PERSON	sixty years ago seems at last likely to result in the adoption by the people of
Norway	LOCATION	of `` Landsmaal , '' which we understand to be a reconstruction of the ancient language of that country .

		The role of prophet is not an attractive one in this age .

		The sophisticated public of to-day has a way of recording prognostications , and pointing the finger of scorn at any pretended soothsayer who guesses wrong ; so that the Ezekiels and
Daniels	PERSON	of our generation incline rather to staking their dollars , which they are likely to lose anyway , than their reputation for sagac - ity , which may be needed for the accumulation of more dollars .

		Therefore I shall not prophesy that the attempt to induce the people of
Norway	LOCATION	to adopt '' Landsmaal '' can not be permanently successful ; but I would like to point out that such ah attempt runs counter to the trend of modern thought and economic energy , which is towards unity , and it is therefore likely to be relegated to the dump-heap of pleasing but futile plans. , We are instructed that
Norway	LOCATION	is a somewhat idyllic little monarchy where an unostentatious king may stray at large without risk of personal violence , where state functions of the first class are conducted without undue pomp and ceremony , where titles of nobility are unknown , and where one may roam from
Christiansand	LOCATION	to Nordkyn without encountering either of those antipodal bugbears of civilization , the millionaire or the pauper .

		From this somewhat cursory view one gains the impression that
Norway	LOCATION	, if not behind the age , is certainly not conspic - uously travelling with it .

		It suggests a quiet eddy , for a time untroubled by the turbulent current of a powerful and persistent stream .

		Viewed in this light ,
Norway	LOCATION	seems to be a likely field for such an experiment as the adoption and use of a unique tongue .

		She is apparently not yet entered for the world 's Marathon .

		While her neighbors and kindred are competing for the prizes in contests that demand not only individual preparation , bat knowledge of the training methods of each competitor ; when men are everywhere else awakening to the fact that progress to-day means correlative effort ,
Norway	LOCATION	may for a time isolate herself by the adoption of a language that does not promise to be merged in a world-language .

		The exigencies of philosophy and science , no less than of trade , are promising to compel the development of a universal speech throughout the world .

		This impulse will not depend upon what philologists and lovers of literature desire or demand : it will be brought about by what the world needs to complete the great enter - prises now begun .

		Already the scientist is impatient because of the delays incident to the necessity for pur - suing his studies in several languages ; the philosopher is impatient at the opportunities for misunderstanding which beset the translator ; the merchant is impatient of delays and losses that are inevitable where business must be done through interpreters .

		This is not in the realm of prophecy .

		The late effort to invent a polyglot world-language , ingenious as it was , was foredoomed to failure .

		`` Pidgin '' has had a wider vogue .

		On the other hand the increasing preva - lence of English and German , particularly the former , during years which some of us can recall , suggests the employment of one or both of these tongues as the basis of a language universal .

		To-day about a third of 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	the earth 's accounted inhabitants live under the gov - ernment of English-speaking nations , and with possibly not more than one exception the other tongues of
Christendom	LOCATION	and
Heathendom	PERSON	are either at a stand - still or are actually losing ground .

		What is most vital in them the English language has been for some time assimilating .

		It seems no more than reasonable to expect that the universal speech of mankind in the future will combine all that is strongest in all the living languages of the present , even as our speech has been reconstructed from the ruined edifices of the past .

		Experience has taught us that language is a vital , voracious , omnivorous organism .

		It feeds in strange pastures , and fattens upon un reckoned food .

		From the Aryan Ur , and Ak , and Om , it is a far cry to the vocabulary of a twentieth century philologist , whose storehouse is filled with the riches of every land and of all the ages .

		Experience should also teach us that the tendency in language , as in government , education , religion , manufactures , and trade , is toward concentration .

		Can we think that this movement of the centuries , away from
Babel	LOCATION	, will be reversed ?

		What then are the indications ?

		If
Norway	LOCATION	attrac - tive , simple , enviable
Norway	LOCATION	adopts a language of her own , a language that the rest of the world is too busy to learn , what position will
Norway	LOCATION	occupy in the general scheme of things when the next half century mark is reached ?

		Will someone who is not afraid to prophesy please answer ?

		A CASE OF WRONGLY-ASCRIBED AUTHORSHIP .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I was surprised on referring recently to Mr.
Reuben Post Halleck	PERSON	's excellent '' History of American Litera - ture '' to find the following stanzas credited to
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	, later Marchioness d'Ossoli , and cited as an ex - pression of one of her transcendental moods : '' Come , let us mount on the wings of the
morning	TIME	, Flying for joy of the flight , Wild with all longing , now soaring , now staying , Mingling like day and dawn , swinging and swaying , Hung like a cloud in the light . ''

		Chance can not touch me !

		Time can not hush me !

		Fear , Hope , Longing , at strife , Sink as I rise on , on , upward forever , Gathering strength , gaining breath , naught can sever Me from the Spirit of Life ! ''

		I was again surprised when , in response to an inquiry , Mr.
Halleck	PERSON	cited as his authority
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	's '' Poets of Transcendentalism , '' a work which , while not very profound in its criticism , I had always sup - posed reliable as to matters of fact and texts .

		Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	not only prints the poem in his selections from
Margaret Fuller d'Ossoli	PERSON	, but refers to it in his comments on that author .

		The stanzas quoted are from the '' Dryad Song '' by Miss
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	of
Norwich	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and date from a time nearly fifty years after the death of the transcendental
Margaret	PERSON	.

		The poem is given with proper credit in
Stedman	PERSON	's '' American Anthology . ''

		Mr.
Halleck	PERSON	will doubtless change the plates of later editions of his book .

		Miss Fuller informs me that
Cooke	PERSON	's error was the subject of some newspaper com - ment , but it seems perhaps worth while to call attention through your columns to the confusion which has arisen .

		Nothing is harder to correct than a false tradition con - cerning the authorship of a brief poem , particularly when this owes its origin to a similarity of names .

		In this case there is especial danger from the fact that the '' Dryad Song '' has a lyrical movement conspicuously wanting in most of the verse of the elder author , and is just the sort of thing that a critic looking for a tak - ing extract would welcome .

		That two critics find in this end-of-the-century poem a notable expression of the transcendentalism of
1840	DATE	is , I suppose , only an - other indication of what an intangible thing that tran - scendentalism really was .

		PRECURSORS OF THE PRESENT-DAY HEROINE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The tendency of women in the modern novel to balk at marriage is interestingly anticipated by two late - Victorian heroines who express themselves in a strik - ingly similar way .

		In
George Meredith	PERSON	's '' The Egoist , '' when De Craye mentions the supposedly-approaching marriage ,
Clara Middleton	PERSON	replies : `` Girls have grown sick of it . ''

		And Sue Bridehead , in Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's '' Jude the Obscure , '' tells Jude : '' Fewer women like marriage than you suppose . ''

		`` I can not conceive a claim on anyone 's life as a claim : or the continuation of an engagement not founded on perfect , ` perfect ' sympathy , '' says
Clara Middleton	PERSON	.

		And to Sir
Willoughby	PERSON	she adds : '' Does not one look like a victim decked for the sacrifice the garlanded heifer you see on Greek vases , in that array of jewelry ? ''

		`` What tortures me , '' says
Sue Bridehead	PERSON	, `` is the dreadful contract to feel in a particular way , in a matter whose essence is its voluntariness . ''

		And in witnessing how '' a new husband and wife came into the open day - light , '' she sighs : `` The flowers in the bride 's hand are sadly like the garland which decked the heifers of sacrifice in old times . ''

		Of course the new way of projecting the characters of a novel as mere stereopticon slides that illustrate the author 's lecture is hardly comparable to the creative genius of Hardy or of Meredith .

		But when one con - siders some of our contemporary novels , it does not seem that Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	lacked foresight when he made Sue say : '' Everybody is getting to feel as we do .

		We are a little beforehand , that 's all . ''

		THE CRUISE OF A PIONEER YACHTSMAN .

		* A most engaging though whimsical and wilful personality is encountered in the leading char - acter of '' The Story of
George Crowninshield	PERSON	's Yacht ,
Cleopatra	ORGANIZATION	's Barge , on a Voyage of Pleas - ure to the Western Islands and the
Mediter	PERSON	- ranean , 1816-1817 , '' which is compiled , from log-book , journals , and letters , by a
Crownin	PERSON	- shield of the present day -LRB- Mr.
Francis B.	PERSON	-RRB- and privately printed in sumptuous form , with inter - esting facsimiles and with illustrations from water-color sketches and other contemporary sources .

		`` Captain
George	PERSON	, '' as we learn to know him in the book , was of an old Salem sea-faring and ship-owning family , the eldest of six brothers , all but one of whom commanded vessels before they were twenty , and at one time all six were on the high seas , five in command of ships in the
East Indies	LOCATION	.

		This practical appli - cation of strenuous studies in boyhood in the science of navigation was intended to lead event - ually to a desk in the family counting-house and a partnership in its extensive importing business .

		But the embargo of
1809	DATE	was a death-blow to the prosperity of the
Crowninshield	PERSON	firm , and the War of
1812	DATE	completed the ruin of Salem 's commerce .

		To these untoward events , however , we are probably indebted for the conception of the splendid yacht that served to amuse her builder 's leisure , and so led , almost a century later , to the preparation of the volume , equally splendid in its way , which celebrates her first and most memorable cruise .

		Who with a particle of romance in him could fail to take kindly to a shipmaster so enamoured of his yet unbuilt craft and her prospective per - formances that he seriously purposed calling her the `` Car of
Concordia	LOCATION	, '' and only reluctantly consented to the adoption of a slightly less fan - tastical name .

		`` Cleopatra 's Barge '' is more than any present-day yachtsman could stomach , but Captain
George	PERSON	delighted in this product of his invention , and also took such pride and pleasure in the vessel herself that he made his home on board he was a care-free bachelor as soon as she had taken on sufficient shape to be habitable .

		child of his teeming brain , the beautiful daughter of his rich fancy .

		Crowds of welcome visitors inspected her splendors in the weeks preceding her maiden voyage , and the stream of sight - seers that flowed through her gangway in foreign ports was a veritable flood .

		She was , in fact , the first American sea-going yacht , probably the first under any flag to breast the broad
Atlantic	LOCATION	; and only the ``
Jefferson	PERSON	, '' a much smaller craft built also by
George Crownin	PERSON	- shield , takes precedence of her in our yachting annals .

		Yet her tonnage was not quite two hundred , her length on the water line but eighty - three feet , her beam a little short of twenty - three feet , and her depth eleven feet five and one-half inches .

		Fifty thousand dollars was her then unprecedented cost , her furnishing and wood-work being of the choicest quality and most artistic design .

		Of the man who caused all this magnificence to come into being we read that he was short in stature , five feet six inches in height , of robust physique , and famed for his courage and boldness .

		His especial pastime was to sail forth after a storm in his yacht , the `` Jefferson , '' `` taking with him extra men and stores with which to render assistance to vessels which might have been disabled .

		Such duty , now done by revenue cutters , was to him an exceeding pleasure . ''

		Strangely enough , with all this hardihood and physical vigor , '' Captain
George	PERSON	was a great swell and dandy .

		His clothes were of the latest cut and the most advanced pattern .

		He dressed in small-clothes and Hessian boots with gold tassels .

		His coat was wonderful in cloth , pattern , trimmings , and buttons , and his waistcoat was a work of art . ''

		He wore a pig - tail and a bell-crowned beaver hat , and his chosen vehicle on land was a curricle , painted yellow , a wonderful equipage , in which he drove about to the admiration of all beholders .

		It is recorded to his credit that he thrice leaped over - board at sea to rescue persons from drowning , and for one of these exploits he received the gold medal of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Humane So - ciety .

		He also was '' a skilful fireman and made several brave rescues from burning dwel - lings . ''

		The sailing of the new yacht , greatly delayed by the unusual rigors of the season , took place
March 30 , 1817	DATE	though the '' story '' of the enterprise , as indicated on the title-page , begins in the preceding
summer	DATE	.

		Twenty persons , all told , were on board , including the owner of the yacht , his cousin

Benjamin	LOCATION	, Jr. , 240 THE DIAL -LSB-

Samuel C. Ward	PERSON	, '' clerk , '' who also , in his master 's name , wrote of much that occurred , being probably the actual scribe throughout most of the yacht 's journal and in most of the letters written in the yacht-owner 's name .

		There were two mates , ten seamen , and four boys .

		Touching at

Civita Vecchia	LOCATION	, and , after a tedious and un - eventful return voyage , cast anchor once more in Salem harbor on the
third of October	DATE	, of the same year .

		The once prevalent suspicion that Captain
George	PERSON	's real object in this saunter over
summer	DATE	seas was to effect the escape of Napoleon from
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	fails of anything like confirmation in the chronicle presented .

		What we do find in the book is a good deal of rather ingenuous and often amusing observation and comment from `` Philosopher
Ben	PERSON	, '' as the ship - master 's son is called , and a sufficient amount of more concise and less entertaining matter from the vessel 's log-book .

		Also letters and editorial intercalations and other miscellaneous items go to round out the history of the great undertaking .

		A chapter is added on the death of the admirable originator of the enterprise , and the book closes with an account of the `` Jefferson '' when she was sailing as a privateer and , despite her insignificance in size , made three gallant captures .

		Asa specimen of the florid style characteristic of '' Philosopher
Ben	PERSON	, '' the following will suffice , written at
Barcelona	LOCATION	: '' Yesterday morning I had congratulated myself on the new regulation that was to give us a respite from the turmoil of company , whose curiosity could not be repressed , and whose imagination had been excited into wonder by the marvellous accounts circulated on shore .

		If a supernatural being had descended from heaven to work miracles ; if an archangel had lighted on this earth ; such things could not have been more wonderful than the arrival of the

		Americans are universally thought to be negroes or ferocious savages .

		Accordingly the crowd asks Was this built in
America	LOCATION	?

		Was the furniture made there ? ''

		The views of various harbors visited are from water-color paintings made by someone , artis - tically inclined , on board ; probably one of the stewards , surmises the editor .

		As works of art they leave much to be desired ; but as illustra - tions to the narrative they are of course quite in place .

		A good index follows the reading matter .

		A concluding word on the untimely death of Captain
George	PERSON	and the ultimate fate of his yacht must be added .

		He died on board the vessel he had long made his home ,

		The superior results which are now being attained by students of the subject are to be attributed to three new and fav - oring conditions .

		In the first place , the lapse of time has made possible the opening of archives which contain indispensable but hitherto inac - accessible diplomatic and other documentary materials .

		In the second place , there has grown up a group of historical investigators , largely but not wholly resident in the Southwestern states , who have taken it for their task to bring to bear upon the history of the Southwest the same critical acumen that other scholars have brought to bear upon the history of New En - gland and that of the

Mexico	LOCATION	to the Close of the War with the
United States	LOCATION	.

George Lockhart Rives	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		With maps .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 241 of
Mason	PERSON	and
Dixon	PERSON	's line the annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	and the Mexican War were of a piece , and both were the products of a Southern con - spiracy whose object was the acquisition of ter - ritory in which the institution of negro slavery might take root and flourish .

		This interpre - tation of events was formulated and given cur - rency by the Free Soil statesmen of the forties and fifties .

		It found eloquent expression in the writings of
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	, and other mid - century anti-slavery men of letters .

		And it was embedded solidly in such contemporary histories as those of
Ripley	LOCATION	,
Livermore	LOCATION	, and
William Jay	PERSON	.

		Historians of a subsequent generation , notably Von Hoist , approaching the subject in a temper which inclined them always to believe the worst of the '' slavocracy , '' took at its face value the word of writers whose last claim for themselves was impartiality ; and the distortion of facts , instead of being corrected , tended rather to be aggravated .

		In the fulness of time there came the critics , who sought evidence , weighed conflicting testi - mony , made due allowance for prejudice , and were at last successful in arriving at the truth of their subject .

		The pioneer among them was the late Professor
Garrison	PERSON	.

		But they have come to be a goodly number , and not the least of them are men whose antecedents and places of residence relieve them from any possible imputation of sectional motive .

		Indeed , the ablest books that have been written to disprove the slavery conspiracy theory are both from the hands of Northern men .

		One is Mr.
Justin H. Smith	PERSON	's '' The Annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	, '' published in
1911	DATE	; the other is Mr.
George L. Rives	PERSON	's `` The
United States	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Rives	PERSON	's book , aggregating more than four - teen hundred pages , is the product of laborious research extending over a large number of years .

		The first impression which it yields is that of a colossal mass of facts ; and although as one gets into it one finds it by no means devoid of the quality of readableness , its final evaluation must be as a minute chronicle of events rather than as a history laying claim to literary distinction .

		Chronologically , the work begins with the nego - tiation of the Spanish treaty of
1819	DATE	; it closes with the ratification of the peace of
Guadalupe Hidalgo	LOCATION	.

		Ten chapters are consumed with general developments from
1819	DATE	to the rise of the Texan insurrection , the most valuable be - ing two in which there are drawn comparisons between the social and economic conditions of
Mexico	LOCATION	and those of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Many of the aspects here brought out are not only illuminating but such as are not likely to sug - gest themselves to the casual student of the sub - ject .

		The history of the Texan question from
Jackson	PERSON	's attempted purchase to the admission of the
Lone Star State	ORGANIZATION	in
1845	DATE	is told in a series of seventeen chapters .

		The political and diplo - matic issues of the period 1845-1846 , relating to
Oregon	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, Mexican vengeance , and slavery extension , are discussed in five chapters .

		And the remainder of the work , nineteen chap - ters , is taken up with the most detailed political and military history of the contest with
Mexico	LOCATION	which has ever been put in print .

		The purpose of the author has been , in his own words , not '' to pass moral judgments upon the conduct of those whose actions have been described , but rather to endeavor to state the relevant facts and allow these to speak for themselves . ''

		This purpose has been adhered to strictly throughout .

		The tone of the book is never argumentative .

		The reader is brought face to face with certain great conclusions , but those conclusions follow naturally from the pro- cession of facts mustered before one 's gaze , not from the effects of overt controversial dexterity .

		The conclusions which stand out most sharply are two .

		The first is that the annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	was not the result of a conspiracy to extend the area of slavery .

		Says Mr.
Rives	PERSON	: '' The evidence is quite clear that the first occupation of
Texas	LOCATION	by settlers from the
United States	LOCATION	was due to circumstances with which the leaders of public opinion in the South had nothing to do , and that prior to the defeat of the Mexican army by the Texans at
San Jacinto	LOCATION	there was no combined or organized movement on the part of any political faction in the
United States	LOCATION	to encourage annexation .

		The movement for annexation , when it began , began in
Texas	LOCATION	itself ; and it was carried through , not by the South , but rather by the people of the whole
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		There was at all times a strong minority in the South , and especially in the
South Atlantic	LOCATION	states , which was opposed to the annex - ation for the very good reason that it was feared the effect of annexation would be to increase the fast-growing Northern sentiment against slavery . ''

		The second important conclusion is that , while the Mexican war may be regarded as , '' in a sense , '' a war for conquest , the territory which was sought was
New Mexico	LOCATION	and
California	LOCATION	territory which , by the free admission of
Cal	LOCATION	- houn and other pro-slave leaders , was entirely unfitted to support the institution of slavery .

		The war was a contest for territory , but not for slave territory .

		Portions of the lands in ques - tion had been sought by
Jackson	PERSON	as president and by
Van Buren	ORGANIZATION	and
Webster	PERSON	as secretaries of state .

		Besides the fact that the practice of 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	civilized nations at the middle of the nineteenth century was not opposed to wars of sheer con - quest , there were the extenuating circumstances -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the owners and inhabitants of Califor - nia and
New Mexico	LOCATION	had failed utterly to develop the natural resources of the country , so that '' every justification which could attend the settlement by European nations of countries inhabited by uncivilized races , or which could be offered to excuse the expansion of the
United States	LOCATION	over Indian territory , would in principle apply to the conquest of
California	LOCATION	by the
United States	LOCATION	, '' and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that for the conduct of the
United States	LOCATION	in this instance there was an exact precedent , i. e. , the acquisition of the Floridas from
Spain	LOCATION	upon the very grounds which here applied indebtedness for outrages committed upon American citizens , inability to give satis - faction in money , the derelict condition of the country sought , and the urgent desire of the
United States	LOCATION	for expansion to a natural frontier .

		The conduct of the
United States	LOCATION	in relation to
Texas	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, and the Mexican dependen - cies may or may not be defensible .

		Mr.
Rives	PERSON	considers that it is defensible .

		But the matter of present moment is that responsibility for that conduct shall be placed , and that the motives controlling it shall be interpreted , in accordance with the preponderance of impartially consid - ered evidence .

		This service Mr.
Rives	PERSON	must be regarded as having rendered .

		The credit is not wholly his ; for other students of the subject have established independently a good many of his points .

		But by no one have the best results of scholarship within the field been amassed so industriously or with equally telling effect .

		The foot-notes abound in references to man - uscript and printed materials in English , French , and Spanish .

		In a bibliography appended to the second volume the books which are cited in the course of the work are listed .

		There is , also , an excellent index .

		Illustrated in color , etc. .

		Phila - delphia :
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Hematite procures for the wearer a favorable hearing of petitions addressed to kings and a fortunate issue of lawsuits and judgments . ''

		Such are a few of the superstitions commented upon in Dr.
George F. Kunz	PERSON	's '' Curious Lore of Precious Stones , '' the most comprehensive , scholarly , and satisfactory discussion ever printed in English on the subject of precious stones and their properties .

		The book is a treasure-house of fascinating material , historical , critical , and anecdotal .

		A widely varied list of topics is treated , including histories of famous gems , accounts of collectors , records of superstitions still alive not only among savage or backward races but among the most civilized peoples .

		We read that Madame M aeter - linck '' wears a diamond suspended on her fore - head because her husband believes that this brings good fortune to the wearer . ''

		The significance of various colors is explained : '' Blue on a man 's dress indicated wisdom and high and magnani - mous thoughts ; on a woman 's dress , jealousy in love , politeness and vigilance .


Friday	DATE	and
Venus	PERSON	were represented by blue , and the celestial-hued sapphire was the stone in which this color appeared in all its beauty . ''

		There is very full treatment of stones in relation to religious observances , and in connection with medicine .

		Those who have an instinctive feeling for the glowing color of precious gems , and those who enjoy whatever is associated with quaint and potent superstitions , will delight in this volume .

		Belief in the occult virtues of precious stones is of great antiquity , and for centuries these beliefs have been handed down , varying in many ways yet preserving their essential outlines .

		Students of folk-lore have ignored this subject , strangely enough ; and so , too , have students of literature .

		In Dr.
Frazer	PERSON	's `` Golden Bough , '' superstitions about stones are dismissed with very slight notice , almost no effort being made to penetrate their significance in human history .

		Critics of mediaeval and of Renaissance literature pass by allusions to precious stones , giving only vague explanations which do not even hint at the far - reaching nature of the allusions .

		Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	, who is a scientist of eminence , a well-known authority on minerals , and the author of various learned articles and treatises , has for twenty-five years been collecting mate - rial in this field ; his pronouncements are there - fore of the greatest value and interest .

		His attitude towards the subject is free from preju - dice .

		He tells us that in his investigations he '' has never found the slightest evidence of any -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 24S thing transcending the acknowledged laws of nature .

		Still , when we consider the marvellous secrets that have been revealed to us by science ... we are tempted to think that there may be something in the old beliefs , some residuum of fact , susceptible indeed of explanation , but very different from what a crass scepticism supposes it to be . ''

		Written from such an open-minded yet scholarly point of view , the book possesses the caution that should belong to scientific writing , together with the charm that surrounds occult matters .

		Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	's '' Inquiry into Vulgar Errours '' is a work to be mentioned in connec - tion with Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	's .

		He of the seventeenth century who in matters of religion agreed with Tertullian that `` Certum est quia impossible est '' was strangely concerned about the credu - lity of his age in the matter of occult powers of herb and stone and beast , and he endeavored to bring his generation out of bondage to supersti - tion .

		Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	, reflecting on the too rigid sanity and rationalism of our day , endeavors to quicken our sense of the mystery and romance in these symbolic stones .

		Here is a paradox after
Browne	PERSON	's own heart !

		The sources of Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	's information are various .

		He has expert knowledge of the stones themselves , and he has a famous collection of treatises on various phases of the subject .

		He has studied the works of the early writers , the pseudo-Aristotle ,
Pliny	LOCATION	, Isidorus of
Seville	LOCATION	,
Albertus Magnus	PERSON	,
Bartbolomseus Anglicus	PERSON	,
Camillo Leonardo	PERSON	,
Thomas Nichols	PERSON	,
Robert Boyle	PERSON	,
C. W. King	PERSON	, and others who have en - deavored to give scientific worth to their discus - sions in this field .

		Another series of compositions , the lapidaries , or stone books , affords material more distinctly uncritical and fanciful .

		The most famous of the lapidaries was that of Mar - bodus , the twelfth century Bishop of
Rennes	LOCATION	, who discoursed in Latin verse on the appearance , properties , and virtues of fifty stones .

		His material was drawn from popular medieval tradition , probably of remote
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	origin ; and so wide was the interest in his subject that many translations were made into Old French , often with additions of Christian symbolism .

		The vogue of the bestiary , of the volucrary , and of the lapidary was widespread in the later Middle Ages , and ecclesiastics were not slow to take advantage of this situation to point out sermons in stones .

		`` The religious symbolism of the diamond was a favorite theme with the thirteenth century ` lapidaria . '

		Just as it could only be discovered by night an old fancy so was the Incarnation a hidden mystery ; it gave forth a great light , just as Jesus illumined the depths of Hades when he descended thither ; it was unconquerably hard , and who can resist the might of God ? '' ''

		The student of literature would be glad if a final chapter in Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	's volume had been devoted to allusions to precious stones in English literature .

		There is much material for such a chapter , and scant justice has been done by previous commentators to passages where Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	could add some interesting notes .

		Much might be said , for instance , about the carbuncle .

		A mediaeval lover , writing a lyric to his lady , compares her to ten different gems , and con - cludes by choosing the carbuncle for his supreme metaphor .

		Allusions to the carbuncle in the `` Romance of the Rose , '' in the metrical ro - mances , and in
Chaucer	LOCATION	's works are to be found .

		Shakespeare , in `` Coriolanus '' -LRB- I. , 4 .

		55 -RRB- , makes one of the characters speak thus of Coriolanus : '' A carbuncle entire , as big as thou art , Were not so rich a jewel . ''

		In `` Antony and Cleopatra '' -LRB- IV. , 8 .

		28 -RRB- we find `` carbuncled like holy Phoebus ' car , '' and in `` Cymbeline '' -LRB- V. , 5 .

		189 -RRB- `` a carbuncle of Phosbus ' wheel . ''

		The ever-luminous and glowing hue of this stone , often identified with the ruby , and its power to give its wearer success in battle and to endow a man `` with lordship and mastery , '' are not pointed out by commentators .

		It is a sign of good omen that the New Variorum edition of `` Cymbeline '' does discuss the ancient lore of the carbuncle ; but the treatment is by no means adequate .

		Haw - thorne 's `` The Great Carbuncle , '' also , should surely be read with some remembrance of these old traditions .

		The Middle English poem , `` The Pearl , '' has aroused discussion in this respect , and by a few scholars the lore of stones has been inquired into rather industriously .

		Much more ought to be done , however , especially in connection with the Renaissance .

		Through the influence of
Italy	LOCATION	and of
Spain	LOCATION	, where special manifestations of interest in stones were evident during the Re - naissance , not only Shakespeare , but
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Lyly	LOCATION	,
Greene	PERSON	, Lodge , and others were touched by the fashion .

		The `` Diana '' of Montemayor gleams with precious stones ; '' Euphues '' con - tains many an allusion , by way of simile or ` metaphor , to the subject ; and an investigation of the period from
1550	DATE	to
1650	DATE	would doubtless 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	reveal some very significant truths regarding this aspect of the New Learning .

		The book is fully illustrated .

		Some of the plates in color are unusually successful , and add very greatly to the value of the treatise .

		There is also an ample index .

		LABOUCHERE OF `` TRUTH . ''

		* In
1880	DATE	there appeared in the English parlia - ment a man whom
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	once char - acterized as `` the most amusing speaker in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This member was
Henry Labouchere	PERSON	, who had been returned from the radical borough of Nottingham .

		There have , no doubt , always been wits at
St. Stephen	LOCATION	's ; but
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's humor had a quality of its own .

		He seemed more like a jester than a wit : he nev ^ er seemed to speak in real earnest ; and yet his hearers soon came to realize that few members were more serious and more persistent in their aims than the terrible radical from Nottingham .

		For twenty-five years the
House	ORGANIZATION	listened to his droll speeches , till he withdrew from parliament in
1905	DATE	.

		He died in
January , 1912	DATE	.

		Mr.
Algar Labouchere Thorold	PERSON	, a nephew of
Henry Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	, has recently published a biography of this unusual man .

		It happens too often that memoirs and biographies written by near kinsmen show less judicious treatment than one should wish to see : praise is often too freely bestowed , and unpleasant facts are overlooked or suppressed .

		Mr.
Thorold	PERSON	's work , however , seems to be entirely free from these common faults ; his narrative appears to be candid , straightforward , and honest .

		Labouchere lived through a great age in English history ; he shared in the discussion and solution of many problems of tremendous importance ; he was one of the most prominent members of the British parliament .

		It is , therefore , his public career that Mr.
Thorold	PERSON	is most interested in , and which he deals with at greatest length .

		His private life , his strange personality , his many eccentrici - ties and peculiarities , are also duly considered ; but the author is not tempted to give them undue importance .

		Labouchere was not a stranger to the
House	ORGANIZATION	when he took his seat in
1880	DATE	; he had served a brief term earlier , but his parliamentary career really begins with the later date .

		Nor was he a * THE LIFE OF HENRY

		stranger to the nation : he was widely known for his connection with various newspaper ventures , the '' Daily News , '' the '' World , '' and '' Truth . ''

		The chapter on
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	as a journalist is contributed by Mr.
R. Bennett	PERSON	, the editor of `` Truth . ''

		In this , and incidentally in other chapters , we are given full information as to the history , aims , and editorial methods of '' Truth , '' which , by the way ,
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	at first intended to call the `` Lyre . ''

		`` Truth '' was the terror of all who tried to humbug the public ; frequently the plain speech of the editor led to suits for libel , and occasionally
Labou	PERSON	- chere had to pay heavily for his amusement ; but as he was very wealthy , he did not mind a loss now and then .

		The author feels called upon to explain why a man of
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's type should desire a seat in parliament . ''

		Curiosity had been his induce - ment in the first place , and secondly , a conviction that the
House	ORGANIZATION	would benefit considerably from contact with so sound a radical as himself . ''

		Curiosity was a very real ingredient in
Labou	LOCATION	- chere 's make-up .

		It had led him into a great variety of fields and had brought him a great many interesting experiences .

		In the words of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, '' When he first took up journalism he was nearly forty , and he had had an unrivalled experience of all phases of life , extending from
Jerusalem	LOCATION	to
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Among other things , he had spent ten years as an attache ' in six or eight different capitals ; he had gambled in nearly every casino in
Europe	LOCATION	; he had travelled with a circus in
America	LOCATION	; he had run a theatre in
London	LOCATION	; he had sat in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	; he had dabbled in finance in the city . ''

		To complete the list , we may add that he had spent several months with the Chippewa Indians somewhere in
Minnesota	LOCATION	; perhaps this , too , counted in the preparation for public life in
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Thorold	PERSON	gives a chapter to the exposition of his uncle 's radical creed , which should be of some interest to American readers , inasmuch as his radicalism had an American origin .

		`` I was caught young and sent to
America	LOCATION	; there I imbibed the political views of the country , so that my Radicalism is not a joke but perfectly earnest .

		My opinion on most of the institutions of this country is that of Americans that they are utterly absurd and ridic - ulous . ''

		Labouchere believed in republicanism , but real - ized that monarchy could be rendered harmless and might serve a useful purpose ; he believed , however , that the institution should be made less expensive , and that the court ceremonial should be simplified .

		He would abolish the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, and preferred a single chamber
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 245 government .

		The duration of parliament , he thought , should be reduced to three years , and the members should be paid .

		The .

		Anglican Church should be disestablished , and its rev - enues used to finance a system of public schools .

		His ideal public school system was that of
Illinois	LOCATION	, the excellences of which he described in `` The Fortnightly Review '' -LRB- 1884 -RRB- .

		On the subject of land reform he also held advanced and decided opinions .

		He was , for a time , almost the only prominent Englishman who favored Home Rule for
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		In a speech delivered in
1885	DATE	he summed up his beliefs in a sentence that was also borrowed from the West : `` Coming to his Radical creed he said that
England	LOCATION	should become a democracy , by which he meant the rule of the people by the people and for the people . ''

		We should expect ideas of this sort among members of
the Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, but coming from an English gentleman of great wealth and social standing they have a strange sound .

		But the author assures us in the preface that La - bouchere was not an Englishman .

		He was of Huguenot ancestry , and French '' he remained to the day of his death , French in his method of formation of opinion , in his outlook on life , in the peculiar quality of his wit . '' ''

		He once observed to me , in his whimsical way , of a colleague , that the mere denial of the existence of God did not entitle a man 's opinion to be taken without scrutiny on matters of greater importance .

		No ' mere ' Englishman could have said that . ''

		Labouchere did not expect to see his radical programme carried out by the
Liberal Party	ORGANIZATION	, which was still dominated by an influential Whig element .

		Nor did he hope much from the great statesman whom he was the first to speak of as '' the Grand Old Man . ''

		His hopes centred about
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	, who would surely , he thought , succeed
Gladstone	PERSON	as prime minister ; and his plan was to organize a radical party which , in alliance with the Irish , would be strong enough to take up the fight with the Lords and the
Established Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		But Cham - berlain proved a great and bitter disappoint - ment , and after the Liberal Unionist secession
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's aggressive spirit left him . ''

		He continued the war with abuse of privilege , ab - surdity consecrated by tradition , and the other heads of the hydra with which his party fought , but the tone of his attacks was not the same as before the Home Rule split . ''

		The chapter on the split in the
Liberal Party	ORGANIZATION	is composed exclusively of letters , most of them from
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's pen , dealing with the nego - tiations that were carried on between parties and factions during the five months before
Gladstone	PERSON	's first Home Rule Bill met its defeat .

		This is one of the most illuminating chapters in the volume .

		It shows
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	in the capacity of '' political broker '' ; for almost every shade of opinion finds expression in these letters .

		With the genial editor of `` Truth '' all could deal , and through him opponents were able to enter into new relations .

		Many of the letters were written to Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	, and the effort seems to be to find some ground on which all the radical factions could stand .

		The letters also throw much light on the genesis of the Bill .

		It can not be said that the correspondence shows Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's part in the Liberal split in the most favorable light : he evidently had given his radical friends some reason to think that a Home Rule Bill which would be satisfactory to himself could be framed ; but later his efforts appear to have been directed toward making such an outcome impossible .

		The letters also show that there was much dissatisfaction among the radicals with
Gladstone	PERSON	's leadership at this critical time .

		The author has given several chapters to
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's connection with Irish affairs , and in these , too , much important documentary ma - terial has been included .

		It is made perfectly clear how the radical leader , who was at one time , if anything , opposed to Home Rule , so soon became such a staunch supporter of the Irish cause : it was the injustice that
Ireland	LOCATION	suffered that drove him into the Nationalist camp .

		A full account is also given of his part in the exposure of the
Piggott	PERSON	forgeries .

		The
Brad	PERSON	- laugh incident is discussed in a separate chapter .

		Mr.
Bradlaugh	PERSON	was
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's colleague and the genial radical was one of his ablest sup - porters .

		The chapter on `` Labouchere and Socialism '' is chiefly a report of a debate at Nottingham between
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	and the So - cialist leader , Mr.
Hyndman	PERSON	.

		The author has also discussed his uncle 's attitude toward
Gladstone	PERSON	's Egyptian policy and the South African war , or Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's war , as he called it .

		Labouchere was never a Jingo .

		He was sympathetic toward the
Mahdi	PERSON	, and had some slight correspondence with the exiled Egyptian leader ,
Arabi Pasha	PERSON	; the letters are included in the narrative .

		In the South African struggle his sympathies were with the
Boers	PERSON	, and he held that the war was immoral as well as expensive .

		He was a member of the select committee that was appointed to investi - gate the circumstances of the
Jameson Raid	PERSON	, and he dissented very strongly from the findings of 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	the majority .

		He had a suspicion that the colo - nial office had guilty knowledge of this raid ; but his efforts to have the investigation turned in this direction were blocked by the committee .

		As
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's parliamentary activities touched nearly all the great problems of his long career , a complete history of his life would have to include a great deal of political history .

		But the biographer has not yielded to the temptation to write at length on
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's '' times . '' ''

		I have endeavored to concentrate my own -LRB- and I hope my readers ' -RRB- attention on
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	himself . ''

		In this he has succeeded ; and yet a slightly fuller statement of the prob - lem and the factors that contributed to its solu - tion would in almost every instance help the general reader to understand more thoroughly the part that his subject took in the discussion .

		In his preface the author has introduced a splendid characterization of
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	, which is a very interesting and valuable part of the work .

		THE IJIFE AND ART OF THE MIDDLE AGES .

		* In the edition of Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	's ''
Mont	PERSON	- Saint-Michel and
Chartres	LOCATION	, '' just issued , a book privately printed ten years ago and modestly esteemed by its author is now given to the public under the distinguished patronage of the
American Institute of Architects	ORGANIZATION	.

		Within the limited circle which has hitherto been privileged to read it , few books have aroused a more in - tense enthusiasm .

		The fascination of the Middle Ages , with their devotion , their ardor , their faith , shining through its pages , has revealed a world not ours .

		In the prefatory note , Mr.
Ralph Adams Cram	PERSON	, to whose energy the present publication is due , has himself reviewed the book to the admiration and the despair of a reviewer : '' To say that the book was a revelation is inadequately to express a fact ; at once all the theology , philosophy , and mysticism , the politics , sociology , and economics , the romance , literature , and art of that greatest epoch of Christian civilization became fused in the alembic of a unique insight and precipitated by the dynamic force of a personal and distinguished style . '' ''

		And it is not a thin simulacrum he raises by some doubtful alchemy ; it is no phantasm of the past that shines dimly before us in these magical pages ; it is the very time itself in which we are merged . ''

		The means by which this result is accom - plished have a trace of whimsicality , correspond - * MONT - SAINT -

		A niece or nieces are imagined , to whom -LRB- though they are soon enough forgotten -RRB- the various aspects of the Middle Ages are supposed to be interpreted .

		Readers are warned that they also must enter into per - sonal relations with the author that for the moment they must become nieces . ''


St. Michiel de la Mer de Peril	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' La Chanson de Roland , '' `` The Court of the Queen of Heaven , '' `` Les Miracles de Notre Dame , '' are the appetizing titles of certain of the chapters set before them .

		Mont - Saint-Michel and
Chartres	LOCATION	are chosen as supreme embodiments of the time in art ; con - sideration of their architecture , their glass , and their carving provides a filament on which are strung , somewhat loosely and arbitrarily , the jewels of mediaeval literature and thought .

		The fundamental unity of the book is not in its method or in its title , but in its real sub - ject the Middle Ages as a whole .

		Its im - plicit idea is that the different manifestations of the Middle Ages , more perhaps than of any other period , are each intelligible only in the light thrown by the others .

		Architecture must be elucidated by poetry and religion , religion by chivalry and art and philosophy .

		If here and there fragments are thrown pell-mell into the crucible , it does not prevent their fusion , and the sympathetic reader will not be disturbed .

		To a certain extent the old chroniclers and the modern writers are left to speak for them - selves , even in their native tongue , with Mr.
Adams	PERSON	to act as interpreter .

		More often they are condensed and paraphrased , with plenteous comment of the author 's own .

		A scholar might prefer his Viollet-le-Duc or
Abbe Bulteau	PERSON	, his
Roland	LOCATION	,
Aucassin	LOCATION	,
Abelard	LOCATION	, or Thomas of Aquino , taken clear ; or in his own mixture compounded with judicious footnotes .

		But the book is not written for scholars , and most read - ers will perhaps welcome a method which intro - duces them to so many interesting worthies they might not otherwise meet , and which places them together at their ease .

		Of architecture Mr.
Adams	PERSON	could not deal as intimately as he does without some technicalities .

		If these confuse , one will be wise to postpone certain parts of the book to be read , as the author intended , on the spot .

		As a picture of Mont - Saint-Michel easier to realize , though more general in its traits , some may enjoy comparing Maupassant 's , which makes not the least delightful part of `` Notre Coeur . ''

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is concerned not so much with de - scription as with vitalization .

		He interprets the
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 247 entire life of the Middle Ages as an assertion , in defiance of evidences of relativity and dissonance , that the world is an obvious and sacred harmony .

		St.
Thomas	PERSON	declared this in theology , as the cathedral builders declared it in art . ''

		Every inch of material , up and down , from crypt to vault , from man to God , from the universe to the atom , had its task , giving support where support was needed , or weight where concentration was felt , but always with the condition of showing conspicuously to the eye the great lines which lead to unity and the curves which con - trolled divergence ; so that from the cross on the fleche and the keystone of the vault , down through the ribbed nervures , the columns , the windows , to the foundation of the flying buttresses far beyond the walls , one idea controlled every line ; and this is true of
St. Thomas	LOCATION	's Church as it is of
Amiens	LOCATION	Cathedral . '' ''

		The trouble was not in the art or the method or the structure , but in the universe itself , which presented different aspects as man moved . ''

		Even this instability , which the builders thought they had conquered , is implicit in their work . ''

		The peril of the heavy tower , of the restless vault , of the vagrant buttress ; the uncertainties of logic , the inequalities of the syllogism , the irregularities of the mental mirror , all these haunting nightmares of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	are expressed as strongly by the Gothic cathe - dral as though it had been the cry of human suffering , and as no emotion had ever been expressed before or is likely to find expression again . '' ''

		Truth indeed , '' says Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, '' may not exist ; science avers it to be only a relation ; but what men took for truth stares one everywhere in the eye and begs for sympathy . ''

		Nowhere is this more true than at Mont-Saint-Michel and at
Chartres	LOCATION	.

		The miraculous vision above the waters is only less moving than the solemn , hushed retreat within the jostling town .

		For - tunate will he be whom the book may lead as a true pilgrim to these shrines .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* Whatever else may be said of Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's new novel , '' When Ghost Meets Ghost , '' it must be admitted to be `` filling . ''

		There are no less than 862 closely-printed pages , running to something approximating half a million words .

		This implies an exaggeration of the sort of genial garrulity with which the author has supplied us from the first , but we can not find it in our heart to blame him for it , the sum total of the effect being as delightful as acquaintance proves it to be .

		Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's later performances have proved sadly disappointing to lovers of ``
Joseph Vance	PERSON	, '' but the new work brings back the old charm , and we revel in its excursions and divagations as belonging to the lei - surely Victorian manner which it restores to our literature of fiction .

		It will not do to skip anything , for the author delights in supplying the clues to his intricate plot in a casual or even furtive way , and the most seemingly insignificant detail may turn out to have been a signpost for our feet as they pur - sue their devious way through the labyrinth of his invention .

		The scene of the story is laid in the fifties of the
last century	DATE	, and its roots strike back into the soil of the century before .

		Twe octogena - rian women , who make their appearance under unrelated sets of circumstances , are soon surmised to be twin sisters , separated early in life , and each persuaded through certain villainous machinations that the other has long since passed away .

		Slowly the narrative works its way toward revelation of the chapter of fateful accidents , toward mutual dis - covery and recognition .

		Thus is the puzzling title justified .

		It requires nearly seven hundred pages to lead to this consummation , and then many pages more to complete the process of enlightenment and adjustment .

		During the process , we make many fresh starts , and accumulate a bewildering collec - tion of loose ends , but finally they are all shown to be in relation , and the pattern becomes complete .

		Humble folk and people of high station alternate in claiming our interest until in the end the interest is seen to be common to both groups .

		The figures drawn from humble life are the most sympathetic * WHEN GHOST MEETS GHOST .

		248 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	and appealing , owing to the Dickens-like quality of the author 's powers of characterization and humor - ous description .

		The flow of quips and conceits is unceasing , and enlivens the narrative at every point .

		No summary of the plot may be attempted in any space at our disposal , and we must be content with the hints above given concerning the ingenuity and lovable human quality of this voluminous work .

		It is worth a whole wilderness of the popular novels of the day .

		`` Round the Corner '' established the position of Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	among the half dozen or so of living English novelists who count the most .

		It is , then , with unusual flutterings of expectation that we turn to his new novel , `` Old Mole , '' further de - scribed as `` The surprising adventures in
England	LOCATION	of
Herbert Jocelyn Beenham	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, sometime sixth-form master at
Thrigsby Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	in the County of Lancaster . ''

		The opening chapters certainly relate a surprising adventure .

		Beenham , after a blameless life of twenty-five years spent in teaching the classics to grubby schoolboys who unan - imously resent this attack upon the citadel of their ignorance , finds himself one day in a railway car - riage , and attempts to console an obviously distressed damsel who is the only other occupant of the com - partment .

		His benevolent intentions are miscon - strued ; she raises a cry which results in delivering Beenham into the hands of the police , and the re - sulting scandal blasts his career as a mentor of youth .

		The prosecution having been dropped ,
Beenham	PERSON	cultivates the acquaintance of the young woman , and she gives herself up to his protecting care .

		She has a mountebank uncle who heads a company of strolling players , and with this company the two join their fortunes , the girl as an amateur recruit , the man as capitalist patron , adviser , and friend in need .

		Beenham undertakes the girl 's neglected education , and soon establishes with her a tenderer relation than that of pedagogue .

		As his wife , she developes dramatic talent , and rises from humble beginnings into stellar prominence , her husband being her faithful attendant and travelling com - panion .

		The rest of the story has to do with the advent of a young man , one of
Beenham	LOCATION	's former students , who falls in love with his wife .

		After a little inward raging , which results in no violent de - monstration ,
Beenham	PERSON	accepts the situation , and lets the pair depart with his blessing .

		The story is a thin one , for this is the whole of it , and the reader must console himself for the lack of moving incident and dramatic action by his enjoyment of the ironical commentary upon life , as reflected in
Beenham	LOCATION	's consciousness .

		This is the real substance of the work , much as it is the substance of the masterpieces of
M. Anatole France	PERSON	, or of the later books of Messrs.
Wells	PERSON	,
Locke	PERSON	, and
Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		All the books of this type , now so prevalent , are snares for the novel-reader , luring him by a dramatic opening into regions of psychological analysis and social philosophy that he would not be likely to explore at all if presented in formal fashion .

		They are novels under false pretenses , but their brilliancy as essay-writing saves them from failure .

		They are primarily vehicles for the expression of ideas a pale reflection of life rather than of life itself .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	shows us that he can do this trick with the best of his fellow-writers , and the result is clearly worth while , but it is not what we expect from such a brilliant opening as that with which he has pro- vided us in the present instance .

		A wide departure from his accustomed style and setting is offered us by Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	in `` The Joy of Youth . ''

		From Dartmoor to
Florence	LOCATION	is a far cry , and the substitution of sophisticated art jargon for peasant dialect further emphasizes the contrast .

		The artist hero casually stumbles against the heroine in the British Museum , and starts a conversation with her . '' '

		I love art , ' she said . '' '

		Do you ?

		I love apricot jam , and a girl , and several other things not art .

		That 's too big a business for love .

		Art 's my life . ' '' '

		Well , you can love your life , ' she said quickly . ''

		` Good ! '

		he answered .

		` You 're right and I 'm wrong .

		You can love art in the same large sense that you can love your life or your religion if you 've got one . ' '' '

		I 'm an artist myself , ' she deliberately declared ; but he regarded her doubtfully . '' '

		You hardly fill the bill too much the very , very latest thing in clothes . ' ''

		The acquaintance thus breezily begun develops into a romance , and eventually into an exchange of pledges , although the girl is betrothed to a country gentleman who is an embodiment of all the phil - istine virtues , which his speech from time to time sets forth in ironical terms of the author 's choosing .

		Her queer acquaintance is frowned upon by her set , and he shocks them by the freedom of his speech .

		But he prevails upon the girl to visit
Florence	LOCATION	, and there he constitutes himself her cicerone and mentor , enlarging her vision considerably , and emancipating her from her conventional ideas .

		She keeps up the pretence of her engagement until its continuance becomes obviously impossible , and finally breaks away from all the old routine of comfortable respect - ability .

		The hero is a very flighty youth , fed up on
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and
Nietzsche	PERSON	and
Bergson	PERSON	, and spouting his ideas with great volubility .

		His talk about art is packed with vital thought , and his gen - uine passion for
Italy	LOCATION	is imparted to the reader as well as to the girl .

		There are some beautiful pages about the city of the Arno , and altogether much succulent rhetoric upon many themes .

		It is not at all the metier of Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	, but we are glad that he has taken it up by way of variety .

		It seems to us that Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	gives us something less than the best of his craftsmanship in `` The Witness for the
Defence	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The story is inter - esting , as a matter of course , and holds us in suspense until the end is neared , but it leaves an after taste that is not quite pleasant .


Stella Ballantyne	PERSON	, the heroine , is married to an Anglo-Indian official of high rank , who is a confirmed drunkard , and who abuses her when in his cups .

		After life has thus been made a hell for her for eight years , she shoots
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 249 him -LRB- presumably in self-defence -RRB- one night when they are in encampment .

		She is brought to
Bombay	LOCATION	for trial , and at the last moment a witness appears who gives evidence that results in her acquittal .

		He is a man who had loved her in her girlhood , and who had visited her at the encampment for an hour just before the commission of the crime .

		His per - jured testimony runs to the effect that
Ballantyne	PERSON	lived in constant terror of assassination at the hands of natives , and that upon the night of the visit in question , both he and his guest had seen a dark hand and arm reaching under the flap of the tent in the effort to seize a despatch-box .

		This was a drunken delusion on
Ballantyne	PERSON	's part , but
Thresk	LOCATION	, the witness , accepts it as something seen by himself .

		The scene then shifts to
England	LOCATION	, where
Stella	PERSON	is once more living in her childhood home , treated more or less as an outcast because of her notoriety , in spite of the fact that she has been legally cleared .

		A youhg army officer makes her acquaintance , champions her cause , and wins her love .

		Family opposition to the match forces him to contract a secret marriage , and just after this , Thresk intervenes , saving her from suspicion by appearing again as a '' witness for the defence , '' this time in the family circle instead of in a court of justice .

		Then , in a private interview , he puts it up to
Stella	PERSON	that she can not marry the officer unless she reveals the whole truth .

		As the marriage has already taken place , this plea does not do very much to clear up the complication , but
Stella	PERSON	makes a clean breast of the affair to her husband , and he decides to accept the situation .

		This conclusion is as tame as it is abrupt , and we think that the novel needs about a hundred more pages before reaching such an adjustment .

		All through there runs as an undercurrent the thought that Thresk is really the one responsible for
Stella	PERSON	's married misery and con - sequent guilt .

		In the opening chapters , he is repre - sented as having won her love , and as having then renounced it at the beck of ambition .

		In becoming her defender in later years , he is doing what he may to atone for the cold-blooded conduct of his early manhood .

		The novel which centres about the career of a worker in the creative arts is usually a very unsatis - factory type of book .

		The struggles of a novelist , a painter , or a musician , to secure recognition for his genius are confined within so narrow a sphere of life that they can not evoke the broad and sym - pathetic interest at which a writer should aim .

		There is necessarily a great deal of `` shop '' about them , and this is not an engaging ingredient of fic - tion .

		Even so accomplished and subtle a writer as Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	has not triumphed over this obstacle in '' The Way of Ambition . ''

		It is musical `` shop '' that here enlists our interest , and there is a great deal too much of it .


Claude Heath	PERSON	is a com - poser of genius -LRB- so we are assured -RRB- who shrinks from publicity .

		Certain designing women wish to exploit him , that they may shine in society with the reflected lustre , and one of them marries him with that intent , although she disguises it under high - flown phrases about helpfulness and devotion and the like .

		Having got him into her clutches , she cajoles him into attempting commercial success with an opera , and the main part of the story is given to the composition of this work , and to the intrigues connected with its production .

		It is taken up by an American impresario , given a presentation in
New York	LOCATION	, and falls flat .

		The moral of the story is that the failure is deserved , because the composer has been persuaded to adopt a vehicle unfitted for his genius .

		The efforts of his ambitious wife are well-meant , but they divert his powers into wrong paths , and make him false to his deepest convic - tions .

		The chastening that results is probably a good discipline for his spirit , but we feel that it might have been spared him without real loss .

		Of course , Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	is a brilliant novelist , and has made much of this thin material , but we miss the creative power displayed in `` The Garden of Allah . ''

		A searching and poignant study of the conflict between the older and the younger generations is given us in `` The Coryston Family , '' by Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		The milieu of the novel is that which the author knows best the English society of government leaders , titled gentry , and aristocratic families .

		It goes without saying that this society is described from accurate observation and with essential truthfulness , and that the technique of the performance is in every respect admirable .

		More - over , Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is a fair-minded writer , and , if her own sympathies incline toward the conservative ideals that make for social stability , she is not inca - pable of doing full justice to the disintegrating ideals which are active in directing the current of English contemporary life .

		Her Lady Coryston typifies the old order .

		She is a tory by tradition and conviction , and holds with grim determination to the ideas upon which she has been nurtured .

		Her life is made a spiritual tragedy by the way - wardness of her children , but she uses her power , while it is still hers , with the severe sense of duty of a Roman matron .

		Her eldest son is a rank socialist , and she disinherits him as a matter of conscience ; she coddles her youngest son into accept - ance of a seat in
Parliament	LOCATION	as a standard bearer of tory principles , writes his speeches for him , and makes him her puppet .

		For her daughter she plans a marriage with a landed proprietor who makes the stiffest ecclesiasticism his rule of conduct , and will not be shaken from the course of duty by any merely human appeal .

		But the old lady 's plans topple over like a house of cards when the favorite son casts aside the political garments with which he has been fitted , and announces his determination to marry the daughter of the radical leader of the government , while at the same time the daughter revolts from what seems to her the inhumanity of her lover , and breaks off the engagement .

		There is no doubt that the strongest characters in the novel are these two the Roman mother and the Anglican zealot ; they at least have convictions , and shrink at no sacrifice in giving them effect .

		We may 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	repudiate the ideas upon which their lives are based , but we can not , unless we are hopeless sentimental - ists , refuse them the tribute of respect and even of admiration .

		The children appeal to us deeply upon the human side , but at the best they are actuated by personal selfish motives , and we doubt if either of them would be capable of sacrificing the objects of their respective desires for the sake of any sort of an abstract principle .

		So the older generation wins a moral triumph , although utterly routed in the battlefield of actual existence .

		The mother dies of a broken heart , and the Anglican lover embraces the cloistered religious life in either case the only possible outcome .

		It is a spiritual tragedy , as we have already said , and each reader must , judge of the right in accordance with the promptings of his own nature .

		In the list of Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	's published volumes , her latest novel , `` The Custom of the Country , '' is the fifteenth , a somewhat impressive fact , serving to remind us how large a place this accomplished artist occupies in our contemporary letters .

		It seems safe to say that no other woman novelist has achieved such distinction in American literature , or won such high praise from those who are competent to judge .

		Large as the amount ` of her work is , none of it has ever been hurried or scamped ; every page of it gives evidence of the artistic conscience , as well as of a high degree of creative power and stylistic perfection .

		We are almost inclined to say that the new novel is the finest of the whole series , so deeply has it impressed us by its felicity of phrasing and by the incisive quality of its characterization .

		Yet it is a novel for the most part about very unpleasant people , for but one of the characters enlists our sympathy , while of the others we can only exclaim in
Matthew Arnold	LOCATION	's phrase : `` What a set !

		What a world ! ''

		And yet the set and the world are fairly typical of one of the most conspicuous phases of our civilization , the phase which is represented by our so-called `` society , '' with its mad pursuit of wealth and sensual pleasure at the cost of every decent instinct and worthy ideal , and with a recklessness which makes the rush of the Gadarene swine seem the only suitable simili - tude .


Undine Spragg	PERSON	may be a little more coarse - grained and repellent than the average young woman who uses her physical charm as the means whereby she seeks to accomplish her miserable ambition , but her case must find many parallels in the circles which fix wealth and social uselessness as their entrance credentials .

		Undine is a climber by instinct , practicing the art , first in
Apex City	LOCATION	, then in
New York	LOCATION	, and then in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The moral of her career -LRB- if it have any moral -RRB- is that the fruit which she grasps turns to dust and ashes in her mouth , and that , when she has acquired one object of her eager and vulgar ambition , she at once discovers another just beyond her immediate reach .

		`` The custom of the country '' which makes possible her series of sordid adventures , is the custom of irresponsible divorce , that cancer of the social tissue whose ravages fill every thoughtful person with alarm .

		In her efforts to `` get on , '' Undine first marries , and then promptly divorces , a flashy youth in
Apex City	LOCATION	.

		Her second marriage is with the scion of an old
New York	LOCATION	family , a man who does not discover her steely and calculating selfishness until too late , an idealist who wears himself out in the effort to satisfy her mean ambitions .

		Freeing herself from this entanglement , she spreads her net to capture a
New York	LOCATION	bounder of the wealthy fast set , whom she permits to lavish his attentions upon her in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Failing at the critical moment to land him , she takes for her third husband a French aristocrat , but soon chafes under the restrictions imposed by the conditions of his caste .

		Released from this bond , she finally takes up again with her first husband , who has become a multi-millionaire in the game of high finance as played in Wall Street , and in his hands we leave her , wallowing in the vulgarity of unbounded wealth .

		The only fly in the ointment is the knowledge that even her husband 's fortune is not large enough to purchase an ambassadorship , because , as he informs her : `` Because you 're di - vorced .

		They wo n't have divorced ambassadresses . ''

		How her life gutters out after that is left to the imagination .

		This story is one of the finest preach - ments we have ever read , although Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	is too consummate an artist to obtrude her moral upon us ; she leaves it entirely implicit , which makes it all the more effective .

		Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	now has three novels to her credit , and '' Van Cleve '' is quite the equal of its two prede - cessors .

		This writer composes slowly and carefully ; she writes of matters with which she is familiar , and comments upon them with a shrewd and profound knowledge of human nature .

		Her scenes and char - acters may be called commonplace , but they give a deep sense of reality ; they present a faithful tran - script of life , viewed through the medium of a sober and penetrative intelligence , and their art is not artifice .

		Ohio is the scene of the new novel , with a diversion of interest to the camps of the Spanish - American war , which statement also serves to desig - nate the period of the action .

		Van
Cleve	PERSON	is not a romantic hero ; he is simply a straightforward and industrious youth , burdened with a collection of shiftless relatives , whose support he takes upon his shoulders , working for them with determination , in - dustry , and efficiency , and finding in this charge his natural function , not to be evaded or made the sub - ject of complaint .

		His character is of the admirable sort which , multiplied by many thousands , is at the basis of our national stability and good sense .

		He is much such a hero as
Freytag	PERSON	conceived in his im - mortal '' Soil und Haben , '' and will be found wholly sympathetic by all readers who are not swayed by sentimentalism , or blinded by the romantic glamor of passion or adventure .

		His excursion into the field of war is not made for the purpose of waving the flag or winning glory upon the battlefield , but for the more prosaic purpose of rescuing a friend who has weakly gone astray and got lost in the scrim -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 251 mage .

		It is plain goodness of heart that supplies the motive , although it may be said incidentally that the wastrel in question is the brother of the girl whom
Van Cleve	ORGANIZATION	has secretly loved for years .

		He wins the reward of her affections in due time , but is in no hurry about it , for he feels that his first duty is to meet the demands that life has made upon him .

		Slowly and surely he makes his way in the world of business , doing his plain duty as he sees it , and win - ning the respect of all his associates .

		One must not think from this account that the story is a dull one , for it is rich in dramatic incident and in scenes that illustrate the clash of character .

		It is the kind of novel that is worth reading all through , and has something for us in every paragraph .

		It makes us feel hopeful for American fiction , which is by no means the feeling aroused by the hectic and intense styles that seem to be most in fashion .

		Certainly , this book and its two predecessors give to Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	a high place among our woman novelists a rank which Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	and Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	are perhaps the only others to occupy .

		Mr.
Henry Kitchell Webster	PERSON	is an adept in the writing of '' mystery '' stories , and he has never done anything at once more captivating and absorbing than `` The Butterfly . ''

		It is absorbing because the key to the complication remains concealed until the reader 's tension has about reached its limit , and it is made captivating by its delightful humor and sprightly allusiveness .

		Nothing could well be more entertaining than the story of the series of catas - trophes that overwhelmed the modest existence of the professor of dramatic literature in the university town of
Monroe	PERSON	after the advent upon the scene of a famous dancer , come to fulfil a professional engage - ment .

		Unwisely seeking to make her acquaintance , with the best mind in the world to act discreetly , indiscretions are forced upon him until he finds himself an object of dark suspicion on the part of his fellow - townsmen and academic associates , and an outcast pursued by the law for supposed complicity in a mysterious murder .

		His escapades with the dancer -LRB- who is really a nice girl -RRB- lead him far from home and get him into a precious mess , but he is shameless enough to enjoy them , and lets dignity and reputation go hang .

		His character is eventually rehabilitated , but it is with a sense of something missing that he resumes his prosaic labors , and a postscript serves the purpose of contriving his emancipation .

		He writes a play in which his fair quondam companion discovers just the vehicle that she needs for her talent ; she promptly accepts it , and annexes the author into the bargain , from which we infer for him a joyous future career as his wife 's husband in her professional peregrinations . ''

		Nobody but an exile will ever read into ' Home ' all that I have tried to put there , '' writes the author of the anonymous serial whose recent publica - tion in '' The Century Magazine '' has attracted wide attention .

		Since most of its readers will be men and women living far from the scenes `` where childhood knew the way , '' the appeal of this beauti - ful story will awaken many responsive echoes .

		Those of us `` exiles '' who have had the experience of visiting , after many years , the place in which our lives were first rooted , know full well the indescrib - able and unanalyzable feelings with which our eyes rest upon the dear familiar objects , the eagerness with which we fill out the details of the blurred mental image which we have brought back with us , the deep instinctive sense that we are again where we really belong , and that all the years we have spent afar have been shadowy in outline and empty of emotional content .

		And when our thoughts re - vert to '' home '' in that childhood sense , there comes a tugging at the heart-strings , and a yearning to behold it once more that demands to be appeased at almost any sacrifice .

		The feelings thus aroused do not necessarily depend upon any contrast be - tween the fever and fret of manhood and the calm happiness of childhood , for the earlier experiences may not have been particularly happy , and the later ones may have been filled with material and spirit - ual contentment .

		Even a stunted and starved child - hood may draw us back to the scenes amid which it was spent , for even in that unhappy case it was a period in which the world was wonderful , and the imagination free to dwell in the realm of boundless possibilities .

		Sentiment may be a dangerous and morally disintegrating influence if permitted to act as the mainspring of conduct , but cherished for its own sweet sake it is one of the precious things of life , and the sentiment attached to the idea of home is a source of pure joy to the reflective mind .

		The work of fiction now under consideration is attuned to this key , but the sentiment never for a moment becomes mawkish or is permitted to lapse into sloppiness .

		An illustrative quotation will serve to make our meaning clear : '' And then the peace of home descended upon him .

		On his scarred spirit he felt the touch of the healing hands of home .

		Its sweetness and its power , its love everlasting de - manding love forever knocked at his waking heart and found the door open .

		Far , far had he wandered in the world of mind and the world of men , but in the end he had come back like a
Wayne	LOCATION	to the eternal mother of the
Waynes	PERSON	.

		Tonight he knew that his drifting soul had dropped anchor at last . ''

		The `` home '' in this case is a
New England	LOCATION	town .

		But many other `` homes '' are suggested in the course of the narrative , and all have the same ap - pealing attraction .

		The American consul stranded in a Spanish - American republic , the escaped bank - defaulter on a Brazilian ranch , the orchid - hunting cowboy of the plains , the Barbadian in his island , and the Russian cosmopolite in
Africa	LOCATION	and elsewhere , all these , as well as the two exiles from the home in
New England	LOCATION	, afford revelations of the same mystic spell .

		But there is much more than senti - ment in the composition of this book .

		There is an extremely vivid and dramatically interesting tale of the human relations of real men and women , as well as much exciting adventure in many parts of the world .

		It is a book peopled with strong individu - alities , with men and women who save their souls after well-nigh losing them , with characters curiously 252 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	compounded of good and evil impulses , as life so often presents them to us .

		It is a human novel , compactly and beautifully put together , and in all the varied phases of its interest entirely free from dulness .

		We predict that the author of such a book will not long be able to hide his head under a bushel .

Germany	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- throws anything but a dim religious light on the old story that Protestants love to tell ; it is therefore just they who should read this book with care , because they can read it with the enduring satisfaction that comes from seeing a familiar figure neither whitewashed nor blackmailed .

		There may be nothing new about the statement that where Wyclif in
England	LOCATION	and Hus in
Bohemia	LOCATION	and Sav - onarola in
Italy	LOCATION	all failed , Luther , inferior to each of them in some important respects , succeeded in
Germany	LOCATION	because he had a larger opportunity ; but there is something decidedly new in Professor
Vedder	PERSON	's most readable explanation of this oppor - tunity , in his economic interpretation of sixteenth century
Germany	LOCATION	, done here for the first time .

		One reads with a flush of elation the story of the
Renais	PERSON	- sance , of Humanism , of the printing-press without which the
Reformation	ORGANIZATION	could hardly have occurred , and of the almost incalculable wealth of the towns in
Saxony	LOCATION	, the state in which , by no mere accident , the
Reformation	ORGANIZATION	started .

		What Luther actually did was to unlock ecclesiastical directorates that controlled the soul and the purse of the average burgher .

		The reader of this book learns that
Luther	PERSON	did not invent German hymnology , that the Church did not dis - courage the art of printing , that Luther must have known there was a Bible before he went to
Erfurt	LOCATION	, and that he did not translate the New Testament into German in about ten weeks -LRB-
January March , 1522	DATE	-RRB- but simply revised an older translation .

		The reader learns , also , numerous facts about Luther 's person - ality , that he was a consistent bigot , that he would tolerate only followers , that he knew more about the devil than he did about God , and that when the one devil of popery went out the seven devils of secta - rianism came in .

		In short , those accustomed to look upon the Reformation in
Germany	LOCATION	as a wholly good movement will find some slightly disagreeable in - struction in this book .

		They may be pleased to see their hero 's `` Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation '' referred to as `` the greatest political pamphlet ever issued . ''

		But they may wince at the thesis that the sole victory of the Reformation lay in a new attitude toward truth : it taught that nothing is to be accepted as truth because it is old ; there is but one authority , that of truth itself .

		Aside from the value of the admirably arranged appendixes , it is a pleasure to commend this volume as an unobtrusive display of originality , insight , and scholarship .

		An approach to Professor
Lane Cooper	PERSON	's amplified Aristotle for English rendering of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's college students .

		p oe tics '' -LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- has a larger edu - cational significance than immediately appears .

		For what is likely to impress one , first of all , is that the work fulfils adequately the modest aim which the editor and translator announces : '' It is designed for certain students of English that I meet with , who are capable of deriving profit from the substance of the treatise , but gain less on a first acquaintance with it in any modern translation than their efforts commonly deserve . ''

		In Butcher 's excellent translation , for instance , the average col - lege student of English would be nonplussed by the sketchy nature of the treatise , as it has come down to us , and by its unfamiliar terminology and allusions ; nor would he be able , or willing , to help himself by continual reference to the translator 's ensuing explanatory essay .

		For this student , Pro- fessor
Cooper	PERSON	's deliberate expansions within the text -LRB- for instance , in the case of the famous defini - tion of tragedy in Chapter 6 -RRB- are not in the least over-done , however likely to shock devoted
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- telians .

		Concise and adequate , also , are the frequent bracketed expositions of difficult points .

		To be sure , a teacher employing the book will need , for most of his students , to make the illustrations from mod - ern literature much more explicit , and to supple - ment them with further examples .

		And the trans - lator 's general introduction to the text carries the virtue of concision too far in three or four passages .

		The unqualified assertion that the drama should be regarded always as a branch of poetry will not contribute to clear-mindedness in the case of stud - ents accustomed to hearing the term `` drama '' applied to the modern prose play ; especially when they find , early in the text , a pertinent and appre - ciative insistence on
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's refusal to attach the term `` poetry '' to non-metrical imaginative litera - ture .

		Nor will the mental darkness of the student of
Browning	PERSON	, who has innocently come to suppose that the dramatic monologue is a distinct and legit - imate type of art , be lightened by what Professor
Cooper	PERSON	says of this poet 's `` hybrid '' methods .

		On the whole , however , this small book provides , for a far wider constituency than the editor cares to claim , so direct and attractive an avenue of approach to Aristotle that one wonders why the way should have remained practically unopened until now .

		Perhaps the work may be regarded as indirectly an outcome of the movement , still weak in this country but obviously .

		When
Henry VIIL	ORGANIZATION	's third wife died > the kin g remained a widower for two whole years .

		This was not out of consideration for the memory of
Jane Sey	PERSON	- mour , however , for we are told that he began to negotiate a fourth marriage the day after
Jane	PERSON	's death .

		Among the princesses who were regarded as eligible was
Christina	PERSON	of
Denmark	LOCATION	, the widowed duchess of
Milan	LOCATION	.

		It was probably this momentary connection of
Duchess Christina	ORGANIZATION	's career with En - glish history that attracted the attention of
Julia Cartwright	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	-RRB- , and led to the writing of her latest biography , `` Christina of
Denmark	LOCATION	, Duchess of
Milan	LOCATION	and Lorraine '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The Duchess was a most attractive woman , and Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	's narrative of her varied experiences makes pleasant reading .

		Her part in history was only a lesser one , however .

		She was the daughter of the erratic Danish king Christian II. , who was deposed by his subjects and kept in close confinement for twenty-seven years ; and a disinherited princess has but small opportunity to play a r6le on the stage of history .

		But she was also a niece of the Emperor
Charles V.	PERSON	, and her uncle found her very useful as a pawn in the game of European diplomacy .

		In the
sixteenth century	DATE	, when the State was still looked upon as the private property of the monarch , matrimonial alliances were very important political events : treaties were often given an added sanction by a marriage between the families of the contract - ing parties .

		Very often negotiations looking toward that end might serve the same purpose , as is shown in the history of
England	LOCATION	during the reign of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, whose search for a husband at times seems almost pathetic .

		When only twelve years old ,
Christina	PERSON	was married to the Duke of
Milan	LOCATION	, who died the following year .

		The youthful widow was again married
five years later	DATE	, this time to the Duke of
Lorraine	LOCATION	; but after four years the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	died , and
Christina	PERSON	was a widow for the second time at the age of twenty-three .

		`` Her beauty was in its prime , her charms attracted lovers of every age and rank ; during the next ten or twelve years she was courted by several of the most illustrious personages and bravest captains of the age . ''

		But she refused to marry a third time .

		More than one-half of Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	's account is devoted chiefly to
Christina	PERSON	's mar - riages and to the negotiations that led up to them ; the remainder deals with her long widowhood of forty-five years , with her many difficulties as regent of
Lorraine	LOCATION	, and with the marriage of her children .

		One phase the author has neglected : as daughters of the deposed Danish king ,
Christina	PERSON	and her sis - ters had `` hereditary rights '' to the crowns of Den - mark and
Norway	LOCATION	, and it was their refusal to renounce these rights that forced the
Danes	LOCATION	to keep their father in such long and severe confinement .

		But the Danish phase of the story is not given the attention that it deserves .

		A number of excellent portraits , including a fine photogravure reproduction of
Holbein	LOCATION	's famous painting , add to the pleasure to be derived from the book .

		Studies of ^ r '
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	's very in - six European teresting volum e entitled `` European dramatists .

		Dramatists '' -LRB-
Stewart & Kidd Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- consists of a collection of essays on
Strindberg	LOCATION	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	,
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, and
Granville Barker	PERSON	.

		The first of these papers appears here for the first time ; the others are largely revis - ions of essays that have been already published .

		The method of treatment is sufficiently autobiographic to make clear the spiritual development of each dramatist 's genius ; and Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	shows much skill in making clear the personality of the man and the individuality of the artist .

		The criticisms of their work are keen and lucid , and have the advan - tage of coming from one who has studied the plays exhaustively and in some cases in their native en - vironment .

		It was Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's privilege to - see '' Pelle'as and Melisande '' acted at
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's - own home , the ancient
Abbey of St. Wandrille	ORGANIZATION	; to witness a performance of `` Ghosts '' at
Christiania	LOCATION	; and to have associated with Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	as his biographer .

		Each dramatist is made to stand out as a dominant personality .


Strindberg	LOCATION	is `` the supreme universalist of our modern era ... in essence an analyst , a research - worker in the domain of the human spirit '' ;
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is the emancipator of human society by means of life-struggles shown in dramas resting `` upon the indestructible foundations of permanent , enduring art '' ;
Maeterlinck	PERSON	is `` essen - tially the celebrant and interpreter of love '' ;
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	is the `` arch enemy of boredom and ennui ... a purveyor of amusement and a killer of time '' ; Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	is `` the most versatile and cosmo - politan genius in the drama of ideas that
Great Britain	LOCATION	has yet produced '' ; and Mr.
Granville Barker	PERSON	is an innovator in the drama and the theatre who dares to `` leave Aristotle out '' and to experiment with any materials he chooses .

		Around such con - ceptions as these Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	builds his excellent criticisms .

Yale Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The general subject of the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	lectures is representative government ; the addresses before the
Bar Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion deal with standards of admission to the bar and the selection and tenure of judges .

		In the main , .

		Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's discussion of representative government is devoted to a criticism of such newer democratic experiments as the initiative , the referendum , the recall , and the direct primary .

		He dwells upon the physical impossibility of pure democracy in a coun - try like this , and points out the defects and obvious - 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	limitations of the initiative and referendum .

		He admits that representative government , like all forms of government , has its defects ; but he denies emphatically that it has proved a failure , as is as - serted by some representatives of the '' new school of philosophy . ''

		From an analysis of the operations of the initiative and referendum in a number of states , he attempts to show that the results have failed to justify these institutions in the extreme form in which they have usually been introduced ; although he ac - knowledges that the referendum when applied under proper restrictions and limitations may subserve a real purpose in our democracy .

		The employment of the recall , especially as a means of removing judges and of over-ruling their decisions , he pronounces a vicious expedient , and one that will result in the de - struction of the independence of the judiciary .

		He predicts that in the end the good sense of the Amer - ican people will assert itself , and all such radical expedients will be abandoned and a return made to the representative institutions under which we have grown and prospered so long .

		Barring a certain evidence of impatience , not to say intolerance , with the views of those who advocate the extreme prin - ciples of the new democracy , Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's treatment of the subject with which he deals should not be with - out value in an age when there is a widespread de - mand for radical changes in our governmental system and the introduction of expedients some of which are of doubtful practicability and utility .

Salzmann	PERSON	's leisurely essays byways of collectively entitled '' Mediaeval By - medicevai life .

		ways -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are concerned chiefly with those mental byways and lanes which lead into quaint regions of mediaeval life .

		The author has jotted down matter which he has gained from researches among documents `` preserved be - tween Chancery Lane and
Fetter Lane	PERSON	, '' and has brought together much interesting material regard - ing the delusions , the misadventures , and the enjoy - ments of our ancestors in the late Middle Ages .

		The subjects treated in these six papers are various , including , as they do , alchemy , astrology , `` nigro - mancy , '' the perils and pleasures of travel , doctors and their repute , coronations , the ill-conduct of bailiffs and other officers who emptied the purses of the poor , and a final chapter concerning the strange imports , the `` ivory , apes , and peacocks , '' dear to that age .

		All of these topics are discussed in a genial and entertaining style .

		Mr.
Salzmann	PERSON	writes without footnotes , yet we feel that behind his smiling interpretation of incidents is ample documentary evidence .

		The tone of the volume is one of bland enjoyment of the human spectacle , and nothing which bears ironic suggestiveness as to the na/ivet & of private or official life is passed by .

		For example , we read : '' It is pleasant to note that in an instance when the body of a man struck by lightning was first found by his wife , the jury ex - pressly exonerated her , saying , ` she is not sus - pected . ' ''

		One should read these essays as casually as the author wrote them , in order to obtain the most complete satisfaction .

		Desultory and miscel - laneous as they are , they yet touch on many im - portant phases of historical and literary interest in the crooked byways of English life .

		The volume is very sympathetically illustrated by Mr.
George E. Kruger	PERSON	.

		Clear Grit , '' the title of the open - ing selection , is also that of the book .

		Only this first lecture has ever before been published ; the others appear now for the first time , though all have been many times delivered orally from plat - form or pulpit .

		The half-dozen poems , however , which close the volume have all , except that on
Lucretia Mott	PERSON	, been printed and reprinted , times without number ; for Dr.
Collyer	PERSON	's poetic gift re - ceived warm recognition , and at least one of his hymns -LRB- `` Unto thy temple , Lord , we come '' -RRB- is by this time a classic in hymnology .

		The prose pieces of the book , instinct with their author 's vigor , directness , native charm , and wealth of illustrative reminiscence and anecdote , treat of great men known by the writer in life or through the medium of literature and tradition , and of famous cathedrals visited by him .

		Charles and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	,
Robert Burns	PERSON	, `` the human
George Washington	PERSON	, '' the poet
Whittier	LOCATION	, the Pilgrim Fathers , and `` some old Uni - tarian worthies , '' are thus dealt with .

		The distinctive character of each district visited is set forth in bits of description and scraps of conversation with the natives , helped out by the trusty camera and the deft drawing '' mere brush notes '' Mr.

		They are reminiscences of travel among favorite haunts of

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Their style and their sub-title show them to be '' memories of literary pilgrimages , '' and they conduct the reader through parts of

		It is the human , definite , personal quality in these `` memories '' of Mr.

		Even on such a forbidding subject as the little railway station known as
Hoosick Junction	ORGANIZATION	, a forlorn enough spot , surely , as we know by personal experience ,
Miss Humphrey	PERSON	, in her large tolerance and charity and with her saving grace of humor , can find something fresh and significant and stimulating to say .

Stewart L. Mims	PERSON	with the text now published at the

		It is the work of
Moreau de Saint-Me	ORGANIZATION	* ry , and is the author 's diary during his sojourn in the new world .

		Certain parts of it have before appeared in print , but the entire work is now published for the first time .


Moreau	PERSON	fled from the wrath of
Robespierre	LOCATION	in
1793	DATE	, and sailed with his family to
America	LOCATION	, landing at
Norfolk	LOCATION	.

		After many wanderings , he settled in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, where for four years he maintained a book shop and printing press .

		He also became an important writer upon geographical subjects .

		Threatened with deporta - tion under the infamous Alien Act of
1798	DATE	, he ended his exile in that year , and returned to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The document is one of great historical and economic value , and con - tains many passages of vivid pictorial quality and lively interest .

		In the twenty-two years that have elapsed since its original publication ,
Thomas Kirkup	PERSON	's '' History of Socialism '' has attained the position of a standard authority in its field , and has at three different times been given a thorough revision by its author .

		A fifth edition , revised and largely rewritten , is now published by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		Kirkup having died in
1912	DATE	, this revision is the work of Mr.
Edward R. Pease	PERSON	, a long-time Fabian and Labourite .

		He has expanded some chapters of the book , rearranged others , and con - tributed several that are almost entirely new .

		The result is a most satisfactory and interesting handbook , embodying not only a history of Socialism but a criti - cism and interpretation of the movement also .

		What will chiefly impress the uninitiated reader of this book is the remarkable evolution of Socialism , during little more than a half-century of time , from the narrow economic dogmas of
Karl Marx	PERSON	to a conception of hu - man relationships against which the most insistent objection to be urged is that it is too idealistic ever to be practicable .

		Union Square The Neale Publishing Company
New York	LOCATION	276 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	The Attack and By First Lieutenant
OLIVER WILLCOX NORTON	PERSON	THIS BOOK is not a history of the Battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, but only of the fighting on and around Little Round Top , which hill is conceded by all
Union	ORGANIZATION	and Confederate authorities to have been the key-point of the battlefield on
July 2 , 1863	DATE	.

		No other book devoted exclusively to this part of the battle has been published .

		THE OBJECT of this account by an eye-witness and participant as a member of
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade , is to correct errors of the leading historians in stating that
General Warren	ORGANIZATION	, seeing the impending attack by the Confederates on Little Round Top and its undefended condition , left his place at the signal station and rode rapidly to
Barnes	PERSON	' division then formed near the wheat - field for a charge in support of De Trobriand , and took the responsibility of detaching
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade and conducting it to Little Round Top .

		It proves conclusively that
Vincent	PERSON	, learning that
Sykes	PERSON	had sent an order to
Barnes	PERSON	to send one of his brigades to Little Round Top and that
Barnes	PERSON	was not then present with his division , took the responsibility upon himself of taking his brigade there without waiting for the staff officer to find
General Barnes	ORGANIZATION	.

		It shows that
Vincent	PERSON	selected his own position on the southern slope of Little Round Top and placed his brigade there without the guidance or assistance of Warren or any staff officer .

		Such writers as
Swinton	LOCATION	,
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Walker	PERSON	, Hunt , De Trobriand ,
Powell	PERSON	, and
Stine	PERSON	have made the statement directly or by implication that
Warren	PERSON	detached
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade and conducted it to Little Round Top .

		These statements deny to Vincent the responsibility which he took upon himself and relegate him to the position of a brigade commander who went where he was ordered to go and stayed where he was placed .

		THE AUTHOR was a private soldier at the time of the battle , mounted and on detached service at the headquarters of
Vincent	PERSON	's Brigade as bugler and bearer of
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade flag .

		This duty required him to accompany the brigade commander wherever he might go on the march and in battle .

		This position gave him a better opportunity to hear orders given and received than even the members of the brigade staff , who were frequently absent at intervals conveying orders .

		Chapter IV contains the author 's account of what he saw and heard .

		THE WARREN LETTERS .

		Chapter VII contains nineteen letters from
General Warren	ORGANIZATION	and one from Lieutenant Roebling , of
Warren	ORGANIZATION	's staff , written to Captain
Porter Farley	PERSON	, who was Adjutant of Colonel
O'Rorke	PERSON	's regiment , the 140th
New York	LOCATION	, at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		With the exception of a part of one letter written in
1872	DATE	, none of them have ever been published .

		The subject of these letters was a discussion of
Farley	ORGANIZATION	's account of the history of his regiment , which appears as `` Farley 's Number Nine '' in the chapter on the Historians .

		In this form it was approved by
Warren	PERSON	and sent to the Comte de
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Warren never claimed that he detached
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade .

		On the contrary , he says in one of these letters , apparently with some sarcasm , '' If I detached
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade , I do n't recollect it . ''

		The letters reveal much of the inner life of General
Warren	PERSON	, his patriotism and fine personal character .

		They are a great contribution to history .

		CHAPTER III contains the OFFICIAL REPORTS of
Sykes	LOCATION	,
Barnes	PERSON	and
Regimental Commanders of the Union	ORGANIZATION	forces engaged at Little Round Top .

		Also the Confederate Regi - mental and Brigade reports of their forces which made the attack .

		These are copied from the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion , published by the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		310 WHEN S WORDS BECOME PLOW - SHARES . ''

		For while the tired waves , vainly breaking , Seem here no painful inch to gain , Far back , through creeks and inlets making , Comes silent , flooding in , the main . ''

		In the long and often hopeless-seeming strug - gle against ignorance and passion and folly , these lines of
Clough	PERSON	have given new courage to many a soldier of the spirit .

		They remind us that no effort for the right is really wasted , and that , however the immediate aim may be missed , moral agencies are set in motion which slowly but surely disintegrate inveterate prej - udices and dispel ancient illusions .

		The im - pulse toward righteousness may for years work silently beneath the surface of things , and be - come translated into effective action only after a long series of disheartening setbacks .

		The path of progress is by no means the straight upward-sloping line that its more noisy advo - cates would have us think , but a spiral in which every inch of height is gained by a circuitous route , which often sags on the way .

		The forces that finally collect and break in some irresistible wave for the betterment of mankind have been slowly gathering from many obscure quarters , and their impact , when once focussed , surprises us by the rush of its overwhelming energy .

		A case in point is afforded by the dark chapter of recent history which records our ill-starred experiment in imperialism .

		During the past fifteen years the wisest of our leaders have ap - pealed , apparently in vain , to the better angels of our nature for a repudiation of this monstrous negation of the most cherished principles of our national life .

		Their voices seemed to be as of those crying in a wilderness of self-seeking politics and smug hypocrisy , and yet they were heard in the secret chambers of many a heart , and wrought so effectively for the restoration of our spiritual health that the revulsion is already at hand , and the day clearly in sight when the patriotic American may again feel that his coun - try has been restored to him .

		There are signs also that the two other wrongs that have more recently made us hide our heads for shame the spoliation of
Colombia	LOCATION	and the violation of our plighted faith with
England	LOCATION	are about to be righted , as far as reparation or reversal can 282 THE D1A1 , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	right them , and that we may soon feel free to look our sister nations in the face . ''


Norman Angell	PERSON	, '' in a recent essay , gives us an illustration of the slow and subtle processes that , in the course of time , operate a radical change of outlook in men 's minds , so that a new view , once rejected , becomes not merely accepted , but taken for granted by that unconscious or instinctive self that is the mainspring of most human action taken in the mass .

		Speaking of the once world-wide prevalence of the belief in witchcraft , he reminds us that no ten-year-old boy of our time `` thinks it likely that an old woman would or could change herself into a cow or a goat . '' ''

		You say it is the instinct of the boy .

		But the instinct of the seventeenth-century boy -LRB- like the learn - ing of the seventeenth-century judge -RRB- taught him the exact reverse .

		Something has happened ; what is it ?

		We know , of course , that it is the unconscious applica - tion on the part of the boy , of the inductive method of reasoning -LRB- of which he has never heard , and could not define -RRB- , and the general attitude of mind towards phenomena which comes of that habit .

		He forms by reasoning correctly -LRB- on the promptings of parents , nurses , and teachers -RRB- about a few simple facts which impress him by their visibility and tangibility a working hypothesis of how things happen in the world , which , while not infallibly applied while , indeed , often landing the boy into mistakes is far more trustworthy as a rule than that formed by the learned judge reason - ing incorrectly from an immense number of facts . ''

		It is just this slowly-moving but in the end irresistible force which works all the great transformations of common opinion , which casts long-accepted views into the rubbish-heap , and makes each new generation wonder how on earth the earlier one could have held to its prejudices and absurdities with a straight face .

		It is the agency before which the walls of feudalism went down , at whose attack the principle of ecclesi - astical authority crumbled , and the spirit of democracy triumphed over the spirit of sub - servience to absolutism .

		``
Norman Angell	PERSON	, '' as is well known , has directed his efforts to an attack upon the falla - cies that have hitherto supported warfare , and particularly the warfare that is waged for con - quest .

		Wars for the enlargement of a nation 's territorial area have long been condemned in the forum of morals ; it is the aim of the author of `` The Great Illusion '' to show that they are also to be condemned in the forum of reason .

		He maintains the thesis that no nation can really profit by even a victorious war upon its neigh - bors , and the cold logic which he brings to the support of this contention is cogent and con - vincing .

		In the long run , what is gained by such a triumph as that of
Japan	LOCATION	over
Russia	LOCATION	, or such victories as
Germany	LOCATION	's spoliation of the Danish and French provinces , or
Russia	LOCATION	's crushing of the liberties of
Finland	LOCATION	, or the atrocity of the partition of
Poland	LOCATION	?

		Such things are not even of immediate material bene - fit , when the balance of profit and loss is fully made up , and they leave running sores in the international body politic , bequeathing to after generations a legacy of wrongs that can be righted only by other wars . ''

		Just as
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	knew that the real justification of his attempt to correct prevailing error was not a trivial point as to the exact place or shape of the planet on which we live , but the right understanding of the physical universe , its laws and nature , so do we know that our case is bound up with the destruction of mis - conceptions which distort and falsify the fundamental principles on which human society is based and inci - dentally render insoluble those problems on behalf of the solution of which force is generally most readily invoked . '' ''

		The power of destruction serves no purpose at all . ''

		This is the gauntlet boldly flung in the faces of the advocates of militarism , and the principle is defended , not by the sentimental plea of which too much is heard in the contro - versy , but by an array of argument from analogy , from actual experience , from basic economic principle , which is well-nigh incontrovertible .

		`` The idea that the struggle between nations is a part of the evolutionary law of man 's advance involves a profound misapplication of the bio - logical analogy .

		The warlike nations do not inherit the earth ; they represent the decaying human element . ''

		And yet the mad rivalry of armaments goes blindly on , plunging the people of the most advanced countries every year into deeper poverty and more appalling social distress , and all because men will not look the question square in the face , and weigh the enormous sacrifice of human welfare thus certainly entailed against whatever probabilities there may be of sacrifice from a condition of unpreparedness from some contingency which has perhaps one chance in ten of actually aris - ing . ''

		When the forts of folly fall , '' and the delusion of militarism is at last cleared away , how the world will wonder that it ever gained such a hold on men 's minds , and that the nations so long submitted to its tyranny .

		Even in our own country , so long happily free from its obsession , it has placed us in its bondage , and exacts increasing tribute every year from our substance .

		The essay which is our present text is an open letter `` to the American student , '' and it is to him , before his mind becomes sealed by prejudice and false pride , that the most effective appeal may be made .

		All our hope
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 283 for the future is in the young people who in our schools and colleges are now trying to puz - zle out the meaning of life , and if we can keep their vision clear , the coming generation may witness the `` main '' flooding in , `` through creeks and inlets making . ''

		There are many indications that the dykes have about reached their breaking-point , indications that increase in number and significance as every year goes by , and , despite the bristling array of weapons now turned against the cause of pacificism , it is making its way with constantly gathering energy .

		The `` yawp '' of the frenzied politician and publicist has lost much of its power to frighten us , and the bogey which it evokes is seen more and more clearly as a mere scare - crow .

		The civilized world is slowly groping its way toward organic unity of purpose ; rivalry is giving way to cooperative action ; and the motives that precipitate nations headlong into conflict are visibly becoming weaker .

		In this connection a word must be said for the
American Association for International Conciliation	ORGANIZATION	whose pamphlet publications -LRB- one of which has supplied the material for our present remarks -RRB- , represent a high order of ability in exposition and argu - ment , and are obtainable without price by all who wish to have a share in the promotion of the victories of peace .

		FREDERIC MISTRAL .

		One of the most important literary movements of the last century was found in the efforts , made in various parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, to revive for literary uses the languages some of them dialects , and others more sharply differentiated from the orthodox forms which survived on the lips of the people , but which were in danger of becoming extinct through lack of preservation in print .

		Instances in point are the Provencal , the Platt-Deutsch , the Norwegian Lands - maal , and the Gaelic .

		The natural history of the mind rightly regards the loss of such forms of speech as a calamity analogous to that of the extinction of the bison , the passenger pigeon , the great auk , or the dodo in the animal kingdom .

		They should be preserved , not to compete with the normal types of language , but to throw light upon them , and to per - petuate beauties that the latter do not exemplify .

		The most remarkable and successful of these efforts is that of the Felibrige , the society organized in the fifties to keep alive the ancient langue d'oc , which once had almost as good a chance of becoming the orthodox literary speech of Frenchmen as the northern form which finally left its rival far behind in the race .

		The central figure in this Provencal revival was that of Fre ` de ` ric
Mistral	PERSON	, whose death at
Marseilles	LOCATION	, on the twenty-fifth of
last month	DATE	, leaves a gap in the literary world that will not easily be filled .

		Mistral lived to his eighty-fourth year , and was one of the last of the great race of nineteenth - century artists for which the twentieth century thus far shows no signs of providing substitutes .

		He was the leading spirit in the Provencal movement , although such men as
Jasmin	PERSON	and
Roumanille	PERSON	must not go unmentioned in this connection , and when the Nobel prize for
1904	DATE	was shared by him with
Echegaray	PERSON	, in accordance with its policy of reward - ing veteran service to letters rather than of encour - aging new promise , it was universally felt that the distinction was deserved .

		Born of peasant stock in
1830	DATE	,
Mistral	PERSON	had the routine school education , fol - lowed by the study of the law .

		An enthusiasm for
Virgil	PERSON	led him to translate one of the eclogues while a boy , and suggested to him the hope of becoming the
Virgil	PERSON	of his own people .

		This hope was realized when , in
1859	DATE	, he published `` Mire'io , '' that marvel - lous rustic epic of Provencal life .

		This was followed by other long poems : '' Calendau '' in
1867	DATE	, '' Nerto '' in
1884	DATE	, and ``
Lou Poemo	PERSON	dou Rouse '' in
1897	DATE	.

		Mistral also wrote ''
Lis Isclo d'or	PERSON	, '' a collection of shorter pieces ; a play , '' La Reino Juno '' ; and ''
Lou Trdsor dou Fdlibrige	PERSON	, '' a collection of proverbs and legends illustrating the speech and folk-lore of the south of
France	LOCATION	.

		The great poem , `` Mire'io , '' is well known to English readers through the beautiful version of
Harriet Waters Preston	PERSON	, who has almost made of it an English classic .

		Music-lovers know the story part of it through
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	's opera `` Mireille . ''

		America has done much to spread Mistral 's fame , notably by the translation just men - tioned , and by the labors of the late
Thomas A. Janvier	PERSON	, who was a devoted Felibre , and wrote much about the activities of the society .

		Nor should we forget to mention
Longfellow	LOCATION	, whose translation of a poem by Jasmin first brought the attention of the American public to the Provencal revival .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		SLIPSHOD ENGLISH is acknowledged to be one of the most considerable by-products , if not indeed one of the main products , of our educational system .

		The faulty writing of college students and college graduates has become a reproach and a taunt unto the teachers of English composition .

		At
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	an expert has for some time been engaged in search - ing for the causes of so much inability to express thought clearly and correctly on paper , and his report is awaited with interest .

		In the
April	DATE	``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' Professor
Canby	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	writes with force and feeling on this sad defect in the culture of so many of those supposed to be liberally edu - cated , as well as in the preparatory equipment of entering college students .

		He well says that `` words indicate the man , '' and that `` the power to write well shows intellect , and measures , if not its pro- fundity , at least the stage of its development . ''

		At 284
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
April 1	DATE	the same time he believes that good literary expres - sion can be taught ; for `` writing , like skating , or sailing a ship , has its especial methods , its especial technique , even as it has its especial medium , words , and the larger unities of expression .

		The laws which govern it are simple .

		They are always in intimate connection with the thought behind , and worthless without it , but they can be taught . ''

		The best methods of this instruction , the times and the sea - sons for it , form the subject of further remarks and suggestions from Professor
Canby	PERSON	.

		It is a refresh - ment to follow his well-considered and scholarly dis - course , so correctly and luminously unfolded ; but more than one reader is likely to receive a perceptible shock when the writer permits himself , not once but twice , to use a certain hardly defensible and surely most uncalled-for colloquialism .

		Let us quote the two instances : `` It would be a comfort to blame it all on the school ; ... '' `` Again , it would be easy to blame much of the slipshod writing of the under - graduate upon the standards set by the grown-ups outside the colleges . ''

		The writer of this present comment well remembers the amusement and the parental reproof evoked , a third of a century ago , by a juvenile indulgence in the unclassical idiom illustrated in the foregoing .

		Why is it not just as easy , as well as less open to censure , to lay the blame for an error on a person as to blame it on him ?

		And finally , but without undue insistence , may it not be as well , in a serious and scholarly essay , to let `` grown-ups '' give place to the less questionable and at the same time shorter and equally expressive `` adults '' ?

		... THE BEGINNINGS OF LIBRARY SCHOOLS are com - monly placed in the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	; but the diligent and scholarly Dr.
Rich	PERSON	- ardson , of the
Princeton University Library	ORGANIZATION	, pushes these beginnings back to a time some five thousand years earlier ; and if instruction in the keeping of tally sticks , for instance , or knotted strings , or scratched bits of stone , is to be considered as teach - ing in library economy , one may consent to go all the way with Dr.
Richardson	PERSON	in his burrowings into the prehistoric past as illustrative of primeval practice in that department of education wherein Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	is generally regarded as the pioneer .

		In his recent book , `` The Beginnings of Libraries , '' the
Princeton	LOCATION	librarian asserts that the germs of the modern library school are to be found `` in the schools of the Scriptoria of the middle ages , where librarians made as well as kept their books , and in the temple schools of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	, where men were trained to all sorts of professions , including the keeping of books .

		Such schools are alleged in
Babylonia	LOCATION	as early as 3200 B. c. , and more primi - tive still must be counted the schools for the training in memorizing of ancient
India	LOCATION	.

		That some analo - gies to this training in the keeping of books existed in the collections of mnemonic books is not merely inferred in general but found in the alleged train - ing of keepers of quipus in the use and publication of these records .

		The same is possibly true in some of the initiation ceremonies of primitive tribes where the young men are presumably taught the use of message sticks , secret languages , and the like .

		It may fairly be said that these are remote in nature as well as in time , and yet they are as truly the predecessors of the library schools of to-day , as these of to-day are of the library schools of to-morrow , which are likely to differ very considerably from those of to-day . ''

		Five or six thousand years hence will some scholar-librarian be searching the records of the past and trying to convince incredulous readers that at
Albany	LOCATION	on the Hudson there existed , as early as the nineteenth century A. D. , an institu - tion that might , without undue violence to language , be called a library school ?

		THE HUMOR OF
HENRY JAMES	PERSON	, SENIOR , gentle and scholarly , cheerful and kindly , is delightfully presented in certain passages of his son and name - sake 's latest book , reviewed on another page .

		In their school days the four James brothers were frequently embarrassed , on being questioned by their playmates as to their father 's occupation , at not being able to say exactly what it was ; and the boy
Henry	PERSON	was on one occasion filled with envy of a comrade who was in a position to make the proud announcement that his father was `` in the business of a stevedore '' fine and mysterious word .

		Some such imposing term must be found for the hitherto so lamentably nondescript occupation of the envious youngster 's father ; but to all appeals that unsatis - factory parent , with great apparent enjoyment of the situation , put off the petitioners with strange and unheard-of attributions that would have made them ridiculous to their school-fellows .

		His `` say I 'm a philosopher , say I 'm a seeker for truth , say I 'm a lover of my kind , say I 'm an author of books if you like ; or , best of all , just say I 'm a student , '' helped his offspring but very little toward a solution of the perplexing problem .

		`` Abject it certainly appeared , '' now writes the author-son , `` to be reduced to the ` student ' plea ; and I must have lacked even the confidence of my brother Bob , who , challenged , in my hearing and the usual way , was ready not only with the fact that our parent ` wrote , ' but with the further fact that he had written Lectures and Miscellanies James '' A letter to a friend , Mrs.
Caroline Tappan	PERSON	, from this lover of his kind and seeker for truth , we find beginning in this fashion , not unsuggestive of a much more famous humorist : `` My dear Carry Are you a carryatid that you consider yourself bound to uphold that
Lenox	LOCATION	edi - fice through the cold winter as well as the hot
summer	DATE	?

		Why do n't you come to town ? ''

		TENDENCIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN CONTEMPO - RARY MEXICAN LITERATURE are well summarized in an article recently contributed to '' La Revista de
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- published at
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- , by
Sefior Alfonso Reyes	PERSON	, son of the late
General Reyes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Unlike laws , arts are not silent amid the clash of arms .

		Wars
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 285 and poems , romances , pictures , and statues are as coincident as sun spots and meteorological phenom - ena .

		The Latin-American Republics , particularly
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Cuba	LOCATION	, have been in a state of political agitation or eruption for years .

		And these national birth-throes seem to have resulted in a great deal of literary expression .

		Poetry seems to predomi - nate in recent Mexican literature , as is natural in a nation struggling under great stress .

		The reign of the novel usually arrives in the piping times of peace .

		Among the poets briefly reviewed by
Sefior Reyes	PERSON	are
Urbina	ORGANIZATION	,
Diaz	PERSON	Mir < 5n ,
Julio Ruclas	PERSON	,
Jesus Valenzuela	PERSON	,
Manuel Jose '' Orthdn	PERSON	,
Rafael	PERSON	L < 5pez ,
Manuel de la Parra	ORGANIZATION	,
Eduardo Colin	PERSON	, and
Roberto Argttelles Bringas	PERSON	.

		Among prose writers and critics ,
Sefior Reyes	PERSON	cites
Pedro Henriquez Urefia	PERSON	, whose influence he declares to have been incalcu - lable , and
Alfonso Craviolo	PERSON	, representative of the true literary feeling in prose .

		In philosophy there are named
Gomez Robelo	PERSON	and
Antonio Caso	PERSON	; and for the novel there is a champion in
Carlos Gonzales Pefia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sefior Reyes claims that Mexican literature has widened its horizon of late years ; that it no longer holds exclusively to French traditions and standards ; that the younger men reflect the influence of some of our
North American writers Poe	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	.

		We own we should like to see more of a blending together of , and mutual admiration between , the Americas in literature ; though of course racial instinct is a stronger power than geographical contiguity .

		Sefior
Arturo de Carricarte	PERSON	, in his literary articles in `` El Figaro '' of
Havana	LOCATION	, seems to be working to effect such an affiliation , though all the while championing the claims of Latin-American authors to place and appreciation .

		HOW TO GET BOOKS TO THE BOOKLESS , who are counted even in this enlightened country by the tens of millions , is the present important problem with those engaged in the publishing and the selling of books .

		The still young but already vigorous Pub - lishers '
Cooperative Bureau	ORGANIZATION	is now investigating existing conditions with a view to the adoption of methods that shall increase the sale of their wares .

		In this broad land of ours only one person in about seven thousand three hundred buys a new book in the course of a year .

		The record in
Great Britain	LOCATION	is reported as approximately one in three thousand eight hundred , the same in
France	LOCATION	, and what seems to be a much better record in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	-LRB- where , however , many pamphlets are classed as books -RRB- , while in
Switzerland	LOCATION	there is the very credit - able showing of one in eight hundred seventy-two .

		Obviously , and as is maintained by the
Cooperative Bureau	ORGANIZATION	's manager , in many parts and over large areas of our country not even the surface of book - selling possibilities has been scratched .

		Some more thorough-going method of book-distribution , as
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	long ago declared , is what the book-trade especially needs .

		It is significant that our book-production fell from 12,470 to 10,903 in the two years following 1 910 , and even last year the figure had not quite risen to that of
1910	DATE	.

		Of course the necessity for judicious advertising is here apparent , and there are a multitude of other details to be considered .

		An early report from the
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, which has been investigating this whole question , is expected .

		Then perhaps we shall know more def - initely why , among a people so rapidly growing in number and so devoted to the cause of education , the sale of books shows no corresponding vigor .

		A READER 'S HINT TO INNKEEPERS who wish to increase the attractiveness of their hostelries , and thereby add to their revenue , is given in the corre - spondence columns of the
London	LOCATION	'' Book Monthly . ''

		The adoption of the suggestion might not contribute to the greater comfort of a Falstaff taking his ease at his inn , but it is conceivable that to a Shenstone it might render still warmer that `` warmest wel - come '' celebrated in the familiar quatrain .

		The words of the correspondent , who signs himself `` A Travelled Reader , '' are in part as follows : '' I am perfectly certain that an hotel would have an added attractiveness for many people if it were known that it contained a decent library , with really readable books instead of hoary old ' yellow-backs ' and still more hoary works on subjects in which nobody is interested whatever .

		I would not compel an hotel manager to read books , but I would point out that it is to his interest to have in the house books which the quiet customer , who is always the best customer , would regard as friends .

		You will say that these ideas , if they are not exactly Utopian , are raw and that is true ; but every idea is a raw idea before somebody has reduced it to a successful state of cooking . ''

		Not so raw , after all , on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's pleased surprise at finding in a certain
Boston	LOCATION	hotel an excellent library with its own printed catalogue found expression in his late book on what he saw and heard in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But it is true enough that this
Boston	LOCATION	inn - keeper 's praiseworthy example has not yet been fol - lowed by many of his fellows even in this land of libraries , while in other countries such an addition to a hotel 's equipment has scarcely been dreamt of .

		THE LUXURY OF RHETORIC is indulged in , more or less , by most of us .

		A good mouth-filling oath is the plain man 's not infrequent testimony to the relief which language will sometimes bring to a state of mental or emotional tension . ''

		Rien ne soulage comme la rhktorique '' declared a French master of the telling phrase ; and a conspicuous ex - ample of the rhetorician addicted to unrestrained indulgence in elaborate and vivid phraseology in our own tongue is , of course , the sage who preached the virtues of silence .

		When he was in the throes of literary composition he grumbled and groaned , orally and in his letters , over the gigantic obstacles to progress that he encountered ; and when he had no book on hand he was in even more wretched plight . ''

		Nevertheless , be complaint far from us , '' 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	he writes in characteristic vein to his brother
Alex	PERSON	- ander .

		`` I am far sadder and gloomier of mind than I used to be ; but ought not to say that I am to be called unhappy , on the contrary rather .

		This wretched blockhead and beggar of a world can now do nothing for me , nothing against me ; ... All is going -LRB- as you too feel -RRB- into unspeakable downbreak ; and must either re-make itself on a truer basis , or die forever : in either case with long misery and agony , sad to contemplate . ''

		To
Augustus Hare	PERSON	he bewailed in splendid rhetoric the hardship of his lot in having to endure the din of the metropolis .

		`` That which the world torments me in most is the awful confusion of noise .

		It is the devil 's own infernal din all the blessed day long , confounding God 's works and his creatures a truly awful hell-like combination , and worst of all is a railway whistle , like the screech of ten thousand cats , and every cat of them all as big as a cathe - dral . ''

		But no compelling force obliged him to live nearly half a century , as he did , in the heart of this uproar .

		What wealth of epithet should we not have had from his lips and pen had he lived to hear the honk of the motor-car , the screech of the electric tram rounding a sharp curve , and all the other ear - splitting inventions in the way of noise that the twentieth century has produced !

		ONE WAY TO PRAISE A POET , a cheap and obvious way , is to belittle his rivals .

		Censure Homer for his occasional nodding , and you thereby enhance the renown of Virgil or imagine you do .

		In the closing years of the last century
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	and those other gifted ones with whom he associated at
Cambridge	LOCATION	decided among themselves that
Tennyson	PERSON	lacked the spirit of true poetry ; and condemnation of a poet of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's fame must carry with it a certain sense , innocent and harmless enough , to be sure , of elation and superiority in the censor .

		At a recent
Chicago	LOCATION	banquet of poets , the guest of honor , Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	, took occasion to pay tribute to a brother poet , Mr.
Nich	PERSON	- olas
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	, in this wise : '' I address Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	because I have read his `
General Booth Enters Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, ' and in it I recognize the work of a brother poet .

		Before there can be great poetry in any country the poets must be humble and sim - ple .

		The reason many of us have revolted against
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	is that he is too ornate .


Paul Verlaine	PERSON	, whom I saw in my youth , told me that he could not translate
Tennyson	PERSON	because he was too ` English ' ; when he should have been bowed down with grief he stopped for reminiscence .

		Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	speaks the simple language of the humble people .

		He is a truth-speaker . ''

		Why make invidious comparisons when it is sufficient to point out differences ?

		There are diversities of poetic gifts , but the same spirit .

		ANTIPODEAN LIBRARY ACTIVITIES acquire for us a certain peculiar interest from their very remote - ness in geographical location .

		In the latest number that has reached us of that enterprising trilingual periodical , `` The Library Miscellany , '' of
Baroda	LOCATION	, we find in the section devoted to
India	LOCATION	-LRB- and printed in English -RRB- the following : `` At the suggestion of Mr.
Govindbhai H. Desai	PERSON	, Subah of
Kadi Division	ORGANIZATION	, the Kadi Agriculturists ' Association have organized a travelling exhibition of agricultural implements .

		The
Library Department	ORGANIZATION	has cooperated by sending an assistant who delivers lectures on library topics and social and moral questions .

		An assistant from the
Visual Instruction Branch	ORGANIZATION	, with a '
Kok	PERSON	' cinema , sets of stereoscopes and stereographs , is also de - puted . ''

		Do we see here the Oriental adoption of an American idea ?

		Another item may for more reasons than one prove interesting .

		`` Mrs.
Billious	PERSON	-LSB- one almost wishes the compositor had inverted the w -RSB- , the widow of Mr.
Billious	PERSON	, a Jew merchant of
Howrah	ORGANIZATION	, has declared her intention of making over to the
Howrah Municipality	ORGANIZATION	her palatial residence with about 150 bighas of beautifully laid out garden situated in the heart of the town , to be utilized as a public library .

		The deed of gift will take effect after her death .

		The property is worth five lakhs of rupees . ''

		And will the institution thus generously provided for be known as the Billious Public Library ?

		THE DEATH OF AN ACCOMPLISHED GREEK SCHOLAR , such as
Rufus B. Richardson	PERSON	showed himself to be , is occasion for peculiar regret in these days of lessening regard for such scholarship .

		Theological studies seem to have claimed his devo - tion in earlier life , his academic course at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	hav - ing been followed by three years at the
Yale Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	and further studies of the same nature at
the University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	.

		But in
1880	DATE	, at the sufficiently mature age of thirty-five , he accepted the chair of Greek at
Indiana University	ORGANIZATION	, whence he was called to a like professorship at
Dartmouth	LOCATION
two years later	DATE	.

		There he remained until
1893	DATE	, when he was appointed Director of the
American School of Classical Studies	ORGANIZATION	at
Athens	LOCATION	, a post that he held for ten years .

		In his later retirement at
Woodstock	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, he occupied himself chiefly with writing and study .

		He was the author of many peri - odical contributions on archaeological and classical subjects , and also of the books , `` Vacation Days in
Greece	LOCATION	, '' ``
Greece	LOCATION	through the Stereoscope , '' and `` History of Greek Sculpture . ''

		^
Eschines	ORGANIZATION	's `` Ora - tion against Ctesiphon '' was edited by him while he was at
Dartmouth	LOCATION	.

		He was born at
Westford	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
April 18 , 1845	DATE	, and died at
Clifton Springs	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	,
March 10	DATE	, of this year .

		LOCAL TALENT IN THE LIBRARY is commonly preferred to imported .

		It is pleasant to deal with an assistant whom one has known for years ; it is sometimes embarrassing to go with one 's questions and complaints to an entire stranger behind the delivery desk or in the reference room .

		Moreover , tax-payers like to see their money circulate among their own people , and not drained off by outsiders .

		Something may be read between the lines , as well as in the lines , of the announcement of the
Cali	LOCATION	-
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 287 fornia
Board of Library Examiners	ORGANIZATION	, printed in the current issue of `` News Notes of

		`` HIGH-BROW . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A young woman was speaking to me the other day of one who held her , as I knew , to be the best and truest of friends , a well-tried and trusted companion .

		And as she talked she exclaimed , laughing the while : '' O , but you know , he 's such a dreadful high-brow ! ''

		I fear no words will suffice for expressing the regret with which these thoughtless words filled me , and yet I can not resist making the attempt .

		For the attitude here suggested how frequently does one meet with it , and how far - reaching is the real and serious havoc which it plays with the best tendencies and aspirations of our life !

		` The reference was to a youth , brought up in an atmosphere of plain thinking and high living , who had yet managed , despite his parents , despite the environ - ment and authorities of his preparatory school and his fashionable college , to maintain an instinctive love of the best that life affords .

		He held , with the good Montaigne , that '' it is not enough to join learning and knowledge to the mind , it should be incorporated into it : it must not be sprinkled , but dyed with it ; and if it .

		change not and better her estate -LRB- which is imperfect -RRB- it were much better to leave it . ''

		And living under the shadow of such wise counsel , he was , though young , already on a fair way to attaining that ripeness of just estimation , that mild sufficiency of mind , which apper - tains only to him who has to good purpose spent his years in loving contemplation of the heights of human effort .

		Withal he was no self-conceited prig , formid - ably strutting his little way about the earth ; but he was of an excellent catholicity of judgment , fulfilled of too much wisdom either wholly to condemn the prejudices and excesses of the vulgar , or to approve the rigors of the puritanical .

		In fine , this youth was learned and yet not a pedant , virtuous and yet tolerant , seriously disposed and yet gifted with a ready sense of humor , and , with whatever failures and baitings by the way , yet in all his actions and in all his thoughts he was '' Fain to know golden things , fain to grow wise ,
Fain	PERSON	to achieve the secret of fair souls . ''

		And of him , as of
Cowley	ORGANIZATION	, it could be said : '' His learn - ing sat exceedingly close and handsomely upon him : it was not embossed on his mind , but enamelled . ''

		This , then , is the type of man of whom it was said , '' O , but you know , he is such a dreadful high - brow ! ''

		If this were a solitary instance it would still be deplor - able , but it is more than that .

		The recollection of everyone will rise up in confirmation of the belief that it is typical , the type and norm of an attitude that pre - vails with the vast majority of Americans .

		These -LRB- and the fact is so well recognized that it passes for common - place and excites no comment -RRB- use constantly our quoted expression to indicate a certain light and nonchalant contempt for all that is best in human endeavor , for all that is worthiest in human thought .

		Lightly and almost without reproof do our friends , and often enough even our relatives , thus betray their feelings as to man 's all too wavering but yet never ending search for rounded perfection .

		Surely we are in no danger of making , as the phrase goes , mountains out of mole-hills in our serious depre - cation of this general attitude .

		For it is more than a betrayal of meanness , meanness of life and ignorance in thought , on the part of the countless many who hold to it ; it is more than a tacit confession of com - placent slothfulness , of self-satisfied frittering away of mind and the moral fibre that makes for character .

		It is in all this a sign of our disbelief in that fundamentally important thing , right reason , as an efficacious guide in the conduct of individual life , and as a preeminent neces - sity for any real greatness of national life .

		But beyond and behind all this it is a subtle indictment , coming out of the mouths of those who are its typical fruit , of our present mode of life .

		`` It 's a free country , '' we hear it said .

		And again , '' There 's no accounting for differ - ence in taste . ''

		Here , perhaps , are the secrets of our national loss of dignity and poise , our pursuit of well , it may not be the worst in literature , but at all events the mediocre , our disbelief in intellect and in the impor - tance of rigorous intellectual discipline .

		For by free - dom we mean freedom to do as we please , forgetting that it means , in a government constituted as ours in , above all things a grave responsibility .

		And therefrom springs our precious maxim regarding taste .

		In this connection we use the word with a very v/ide latitude indeed , applying it to many things which are really not 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	matters of taste at all , but primarily matters for the exercise of sober and measured judgment .

		In other words , we have , in so far as we might -LRB- and we are busy even now attempting to extend the boundaries -RRB- , banished authority from our lives .

		Perhaps the fact is sufficiently known ; it is rather one of the results of this process that we are here con - cerned with .

		Just what the result is , we have been at the pains of seeing ; but perhaps it is not so plain that our light-hearted contempt for intelligence is really a result of our mode of life .

		Freedom , however , as we know , means freedom to do as we please ; and that an instinctive love of the best is not the inheritance of most of us , we know from our national attitude towards right reason .

		Then , too , our mischievous saying about taste , as if there never had been such a thing as an educated taste or a cultivated taste , gives us an added justification for what we already regard as the axiomatic first law of our being the freedom to conduct our lives as superficially or as ignorantly as we choose .

		I , for example , am as '' good '' as anybody else in this broad land , and my opinion is as '' good '' as anybody else 's .

		So there is not and how can there be ?

		any popular or widespread respect for the rigorous pursuit of the best that life affords .

		We have deceived our - selves into believing that in our most ordinary moments , in our instinctive feelings , in our most ignorant phases of thought , we are '' good enough . ''

		And of all this the result is -LRB- certainly it is plainly enough a result by now -RRB- that we as a nation are not merely neglectful of the best in human thought , the highest in human endeavor , but we are complacently contemptuous of those strenuous paths which lead us towards , though never quite to , a rounded perfection of mind and soul .

		Surely , then , it is high time for us to undertake a little inward searching of our hearts : for us to come to some sort of a realization that right reason is of the utmost necessity for controlling any life that is to be truly good , and that there can be no real test of worth save it be centred in authority , the authority of the trained judgment of the wisest and the best .

		MR.
COTTERILL	PERSON	'S `` ANCIENT
GREECE	LOCATION	. ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		While thanking you for the friendly notice of my '' Ancient
Greece	LOCATION	'' that appeared in your issue of
March 1	DATE	, I should be much obliged if you would allow me to answer publicly the allegation of your reviewer that I `` ignore the temple of
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	at
Paestum	LOCATION	'' and '' call the Poseidon temple simply
Paestum	LOCATION	. ''

		If he will look at p. 215 and 216 n. he will see that I speak of `` the great
Paestum	LOCATION	temple , '' by which of course is meant the Poseidon temple ; and on p. 217 he will see that I speak also of the
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	temple and the `` Basilica '' ; and on p. 454 he will find a description of all three
Paestum	LOCATION	temples and the remark that the
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	temple is a '' splendid ruin . ''

		It seems almost as if he had not observed that at the end of my book there is an Appendix that gives an account of all the finest Greek temples .

		It comes rather as a surprise to be told that I am ignorant of , or ignore , the existence of a splendid ruin my acquaintance with which was made some forty-three years ago , at a time when the delights of a visit to
Paestum	LOCATION	were enhanced by the possibility of encounter - ing brigands to judge from the fact that the diligenza had been robbed by these gentry only a few days previously .

		As for mutules and guttae , perhaps I should have been a little more explicit ; but surely it is justifiable to intimate that the band or bracket adorned with globules -LRB- i. e. , the mutulus adorned with guttae -RRB- constitutes a group of ornaments representing raindrops ; and I find a similar expression in
Smith	PERSON	's '' Dictionary of Antiqui - ties , '' viz. , '' sets of drops , called mutules . ''

		In regard to the '' Corinthian order , '' I was aware that some have banished it as a mere variety of the Ionic .

		I knew also that
Ruskin	PERSON	, on the contrary , asserts that there never was , and never '' till dooms-day '' could be , any order except the Doric -LRB- convex capital -RRB- and the Corinthian -LRB- concave -RRB- .

		But I did not think it necessary to enter into polemics on the subject .

		Perhaps , how - ever , I may here add that I regard what some writers call the '' aesthetic appeal '' of the Corinthian order as specifically different from that of the Ionic .

		Lastly ,
Syracuse	ORGANIZATION	and
Hyblaean Megara	LOCATION	are certainly not in the `` southwestern corner '' of
Sicily	LOCATION	; but seeing that a few lines later -LRB- p. 118 -RRB- Seliuus is also put in the
S. W.	PERSON	, and seeing that a map faces the text and puts everything in its proper quarter , perhaps it might have been fairer not to have stigmatized a venial lapsus calami as an '' inaccuracy . '' -RSB-

		PIONEER LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN
ILLINOIS	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A sentence in your '' Briefer Mention '' in the issue of
February 16	DATE	has just come to my notice : '' In referring to library legislation in
Illinois	LOCATION	he -LSB- Mr.
Samuel Swett	PERSON	Green -RSB- might well have supplemented his mention of
F. H. Hild	PERSON	's name in that connection by noting the earlier and more important work of another
Illinois	LOCATION	librarian , who drafted the library bill of
1872	DATE	and was instrumental in procuring its passage . ''

		Why not give the name of this librarian who did this '' earlier and more important work '' ?

		Dr.
Samuel Willard	PERSON	, who died about a year ago at the age of ninety-one , was the founder of free libraries in
Illinois	LOCATION	, drawing up the bill providing for them and arguing for its passage .

		He established the
Public Library of Springfield	ORGANIZATION	at that time , the first library under the new law .

		Dr.
Willard	PERSON	came to
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1870	DATE	to teach history in the one high school in the city of that day , and con - tinued twenty-seven years in the service .

		Few in - structors have done more for

		-LSB- The paternity of the

		Our reference was to Mr.
E. S. Willcox	PERSON	, veteran librarian of the
Peoria Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		His work in connection with the law passed in

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 289 GLIMPSES or A GIFTED FAMILY .

		* Fulfilling the promise of his earlier autobi - ographic volume , '' A Small Boy and Others , '' Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	now gives to his readers , in `` Notes of a Son and Brother , '' those fuller memorials of the late
William James	PERSON	that have been awaited with no little eagerness , and at the same time draws in considerable detail the portrait of his gifted father , with less elaborate delineations of the other members of this ex - tremely interesting family , and passing glimpses of many more or less famous persons outside the domestic circle but of some intimate asso - ciation with the writer or his household .

		The period covered by the narrative is more partic - ularly the decade between
1860	DATE	and
1870	DATE	, with some backward glances at a remoter past , and a few incidental references to later years .

		After an experiment of five years and a half of
Europe	LOCATION	in search of the right environment and atmosphere for his own and his children 's intellectual and spiritual well-being , the elder
Henry James	PERSON	returned with his family to
America	LOCATION	and there continued the endless quest for ideal conditions .


New York	LOCATION	and
Newport	LOCATION	and finally
Cambridge	LOCATION	seem to have found most favor with him , and it is in
Cambridge	LOCATION	that the closing years of the decade referred to see him somewhat contentedly and fixedly set - tled , with his eldest son at last on the way to that choice of a calling in which he was later to distinguish himself , and the next oldest tasting the delights of some little literary success and dreaming of greater achievement to come .

		The immediate and deciding cause of the family 's repatriation seems to have been
William	PERSON	's temporary passion for painting and his father 's decision to place him under the instruction of the prospectively famous artist whom a few bold and vivid strokes thus picture to the mind 's eye in the pages before us : ''
William Hunt	PERSON	, all muscular spareness and brown - ness and absence of waste , all flagrant physiognomy , brave bony arch of handsome nose , upwardness of strong eyebrow and glare , almost , of eyes that both recognised and wondered , strained eyes that played over questions as if they were objects and objects as if they were ques - tions , might have stood , to the life , for
Don Quixote	PERSON	, if we could associate with that hero a far-spreading beard already a little grizzled , a manner and range of gesture and broken form of discourse that was like a restless reference to a palette and that seemed to take for granted , all about , canvases and models and charming , * NOTES OF A SON AND BROTHER .

		amusing things , the tremendously interesting ' in the seen bit or caught moment , and the general unsayability , in comparison , of anything else .

		He never would have perched , it must be added , on Rosinante he was fonder of horses than of the method of Couture , and though with a shade of resemblance , as all simple and imagi - native men have , to the knight of La Mancha , he least suggested that analogy as he passed in a spinning buggy , his beard flying , behind a favorite trotter . ''

		Under Hunt 's tuition , and with
John La Farge	PERSON	as sole fellow-pupil ,
William James	PERSON	for a brief space applied himself with characteristic whole-heartedness to the development of his unmistakable talent for graphic art .

		A pencil portrait of himself , prefixed as frontispiece to the book under review , and other specimens of his facility as draughtsman elsewhere in the volume , notably his pen-and-ink sketches in letters reproduced in facsimile , show a liveli - ness and originality that for the moment almost induce regret at his having so soon forsaken art for other pursuits .

		What his brother , always his admirer and repeatedly representing himself to us as his humble imitator , has to say in this connection is worth quoting : '' He at a given moment , which came quite early , as completely ceased to ply his pencil as he had in his younger time earnestly and curiously exercised it ; and this constitutes exactly the interest of his case .

		No stroke of it that I have recovered but illustrates his aptitude for drawing , his possible real mastery of the art that was yet , in the light of other interests , so utterly to drop from him ; and the example is rare of being so finely capable only to become so indifferent . ''

		Always master of the given situation , as the writer says of him , '' whatever he played with or worked at entered at once into his intelli - gence , his talk , his humour , as with the action of coloring-matter dropped into water or that of the turning-on of a light within a window . ''

		Still again , and with engaging modesty on the younger brother 's part , it is said of William : '' Whatever he might happen to be doing made him so interesting about it , and indeed , with the quickest concomitance , about everything else , that what I probably most did , all the while , was but to pick up , and to the effect not a bit of starving but quite of filling myself , the crumbs of his feast and the echoes of his life . ''

		The indulgent father 's attitude toward such rapid changes of bent as showed themselves in his eldest son is finely described in the book .

		Calmly philosophical , with abundance of toler - ance and an enviable cheerfulness , he evidently believed in allowing his children free scope for the development of such germs of genius , of whatever sort , as might discover themselves .

		Even the following of mistaken promptings 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	he seems to have regarded as educationally beneficial , so that his son says of him : `` I am not sure indeed that the kind of personal history most appealing to my father would not have been some kind that should fairly proceed by mistakes , mistakes more human , more associational , less angular , less hard for others , that is exemplary for them -LRB- since righteousness , as mostly understood , was in our parent 's view , I think , the cruellest thing in the world -RRB- than straight and smug and declared felicities ... He had a manner of his own of appreciating failure , or of not at least piously rejoicing in displayed moral , intellectual , or even material economies , which , had it not been that his humanity , his generosity and , for the most part , his gaiety , were always , at the worst , consistent , might some - times have left us with our small savings , our little ex - hibitions and complacencies , rather on our hands .

		As the case stood I find myself thinking of our life in those years as profiting greatly for animation and curiosity by the interest he shed for us on the whole side of the human scene usually held least interesting the element , the appearance , of waste which plays there such a part and into which he could read under provocation so much character and colour and charm , so many implications of the fine and worthy , that , since the art of missing or of failing , or of otherwise going astray , did after all in his hands escape becoming either a matter of real ex - ample or of absolute precept , enlarged not a little our field and our categories of appreciation and perception . ''

		The father 's favorite adjective when he wished to express disapproval , in his mild fashion , of a restless son 's abandonment of one pursuit for another , was '' narrowing . ''

		Each of the eldest son 's successive shiftings from art to chemistry , then to anatomy and physiology and medicine , later to psychology and philosophy , was held by him to be narrowing ; and , again , when the second son turned to writing , '' it was breathed upon me , '' says the one thus mildly censured , '' with the finest bewildering eloquence , with a power of suggestion in truth which I fairly now count it a gain to have felt play over me , that this too was narrowing . ''

		One queries whether any concentration of energy whatever would have commended itself to this large-minded father as free from narrowness .

		Perhaps it was the fear of narrowing their view and cramping their minds that made the elder
James	PERSON	look with disfavor upon a college education for his sons , his own memories of
Union College	ORGANIZATION	in its beginning years not being of the most roseate hue imaginable .

		At any rate , a picturesquely miscellaneous and decid - edly spasmodic course seems to have been fol - lowed in the studies of the early-expatriated children ; and perhaps such desultoriness and variety and so great freedom of election were best in this instance .

		After the return to
America	LOCATION	,
William	LOCATION	, soon forsaking art for sci - ence , entered the
Lawrence Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	and later the
Harvard Medical School	ORGANIZATION	, while his next younger brother , shaping his course somewhat after the elder 's example , as was his wont , betook himself likewise to
Cambridge	LOCATION	and attended lectures at the
Harvard Law School	ORGANIZATION	, where both he and the reader wonder at behold - ing him going with mechanical regularity to listen to teachings that had not the slightest interest for him .

		But the
Cambridge	LOCATION	life brought him into pleasant and helpful relations with scholars and writers of note , and recollections of these quickening influences furnish much readable matter for his present book .


Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	and the long book-lined library at Shady Hill were not the least of these im - portant factors in the stimulating of his literary genius .

		He speaks with reminiscent rapture of one beautiful morning when he went out to Shady Hill and , `` to the accompaniment of a thrill the most ineffable , an agitation that , as I recapture it , affects me as never exceeded in all my life for fineness , '' drank `` to the lees the offered cup of editorial sweetness none ever again to be more delicately mixed . ''

		The occa - sion of this intoxicating experience is thus described : '' I had addressed in trembling hope my first fond attempt at literary criticism to
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, who had lately , and with the highest , brightest compe - tence , come to the rescue of the
North American Review	ORGANIZATION	, submerged in a stale tradition and gasping for life , and he had not only published it in his very next number the interval for me of breathless brevity but had expressed the liveliest further hospitality , the gage of which was thus at once his welcome to me at home .

		I was to grow fond of regarding as a positive consecration to letters that half-hour in the long library at
Shady Hill	LOCATION	, where the winter sunshine touched serene bookshelves and arrayed pictures , the whole embrowned composition of objects in my view , with I know not what golden light of promise , what assurance of things to come : there was to be nothing exactly like it later on the conditions of perfect Tightness for a certain fresh felicity , certain decisive pressures of the
spring	DATE	, can occur , it would seem , but once . ''

		Of other
Cambridge	LOCATION	celebrities recalled by the author , and of notable persons elsewhere that lend interest and variety to his pages , there is here no room to speak .

		Of his emo - tions at the outbreak of our Civil War , and his longings to be a participant in the conflict in which his two younger brothers acquitted them - selves honorably , but from which physical frailty excluded him , he has considerable to say .

		In short , there is a wealth of matter in the book , presented with all the elaborate artistry dear to Mr.
James	PERSON	's readers , that renders it a remark - able piece of autobiography and one of the most notable works of the season .

		Its style , that of
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 291 the author at his most characteristic some would say , at his best , others , perhaps , at his worst is a wonder and a delight to the reader fond of intricacy , of delicate shadings , of occa - sional tangled involutions .

		The book 's illustrations , from the hand of the versatile
William James	PERSON	, add to its interest .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		LIGHT ON THE CIVIL , WAR .

		* Two years ago at
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	an Amer - ican History Lectureship was established , an outcome of the
Rhodes Scholarship Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		This lectureship , providing for a course of lec - tures each year , was inaugurated in
1912	DATE	by Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	.

		In
1913	DATE	, Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	was invited to give the second series .

		These addresses , delivered in the
Spring term of last year	DATE	, are now issued under the title , '' Trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	Historical Solidarity . ''

		The title does not explain itself , and only illustrates again Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's penchant for the striking enigmatic phrase that piques the curiosity of the reader .

		Previously to leaving for
Europe	LOCATION	, Mr.
Adams	PERSON	discussed the subjects of his forthcoming lectures with his friend Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, explaining that he proposed to present to his Oxford audience cer - tain events and phases of the Civil War , and to examine these from a novel point of view .

		He hoped to present a new picture , and in so doing to justify certain new conclusions .

		To his sur - prise , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	failed to express sympathetic accord with the plan , and in friendly but none the less assured fashion warned the lecturer that the American Civil War was not now vital his - tory at
Oxford	LOCATION	; that it was quite hopeless to expect to revive interest in a subject which had left no imprint upon
England	LOCATION	or the outside world , a subject , in a word , so essentially and narrowly American as was our great conflict of the sixties .

		Conceding the deep and stirring impression the war made upon
England	LOCATION	at the time , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	still maintained that for En - gland to-day the subject is but '' remotely historical / ' The assurance that the present day Oxford student was certain to regard the Civil War as a dead issue , failed to deter Mr.
Adams	PERSON	from undertaking the subject , and led him to defend with greater earnestness his positive contention that the Civil War in
America	LOCATION	, far from being * TRANS-ATLANTIC HISTORICAL SOLIDARITY .

		By
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		a mere domestic contest between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	, was in reality a world-event of moment - ous importance , whose influence and results were felt , and still are felt , in
England	LOCATION	and all
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Hence the title , which affirms so emphatic - ally the permanent and world-wide historical significance of the Civil War .

		The four lectures in the volume are as follows : I. ,
Principia	LOCATION	; II. , The Confederate Cotton Cam - paign ,
Lancashire	LOCATION	, 1861-62 ; III. , Dis
Aliter Visum	PERSON	; IV. , A Great Historical Character and
Vae Victis	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first lecture treats of the grow - ing differences between the two sections of the
United States	LOCATION	, based upon a differing interpreta - tion of the Constitution and differing economic conditions , and analyzes for the British listener the relation between
State and National	ORGANIZATION	sover - eignty .

		For Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's audience , this subject was absolutely vital to a correct understanding of his later lectures .

		The second and third lectures , however , offer matter of the first importance for American as well as British readers , for in them we find valuable material and suggestions now for the first time given to the public .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is the first historian to estimate properly , or to emphasize adequately , the
Lancashire Cotton Famine	ORGANIZATION	in its intimate relation to the English - American diplomacy of the period .

		Again , he is first in an exact analysis of forces for and against the North in
England	LOCATION	; and last , and perhaps most acutely interesting of all his offer - ings , is his microscopic study of the inner work - ings of the British Cabinet , and the accurate balancing of men and measures in their official attitude toward the crisis in
America	LOCATION	.

		If these lectures were notable in no other particular , they would claim a most respectful hearing because of the new light they shed upon these three subjects .

		The Cotton Famine in its bearing upon the war has long been overlooked or underestimated by historians ; sources of British popular opinion upon the Civil War have not been known or investigated ; while materials for an accurate knowledge of the processes of British official action have , until now , not been available .

		As viewed by Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, the real crisis of the Civil War came in
England	LOCATION	, rather than in any military movements or series of events in this country .

		Had official
England	LOCATION	decreed in - tervention , recognized the Confederacy , broken the blockade , and made the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	cause her own , it is certain that history would have been differently written .

		No more serious menace to Northern arms could be conceived than British 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	interference in behalf of the South , and Mr.
Adams	PERSON	clearly shows by how narrow a margin that danger was averted .

		He analyzes the forces effective in English government and policy , and among the English people , as overwhelmingly in favor of the South .

		`` In aid of the defiant , slave-holding Confederacy came , first , the great British and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	commer - cial , financial , and cotton-spinning interests , with their far-reaching political influence ; next , the suffering textile operatives , not only of
Lancashire	LOCATION	but wherever throughout other countries cotton was woven into cloth they numbered millions ; third , the entire governing classes , as they then were , of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, including the great landed interest .

		These last also were voiced , and most persistently as well as powerfully voiced , by the
London	LOCATION	Times , known as ' The Thunderer , ' at the acme of its great and memorable career .

		Finally , the French Emperor , for
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, now at the height of his prestige , for reasons of state to which I shall presently make brief reference , was disposed to put forth on behalf of the Confederacy all the influence he could exert .

		A powerful combination , it was one , in a worldly and political sense , wellnigh irresistible . ''

		Opposed to it was an array so apparently meagre as to be almost pitiable ; and if the alliance of forces I have just described recalled Homer , that set over against it was not less suggestive biblically it was
David	PERSON	again confronting Goliath .

		Strange , wellnigh inconceivable , when now asserted in the full light of the event , that opposing array consisted simply of
John Bright	PERSON	, the
Tribune	ORGANIZATION	in
Great Britain	LOCATION	of Political and Industrial Democracy , and behind him a little bit of a woman , ' as she at that time described herself , just as thin and dry as a pinch of snuff , ' holding in her hand a book ; but the woman was
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, and the book was entitled Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin - or Life Among the Lowly . ''


John Bright	PERSON	, then champion of Democracy and spokesman of the English people , together with
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, typifying the great anti-slavery sentiment of the nation , were the two great vital forces in
England	LOCATION	fighting for the North .

		Official opinion was forming ; the Foreign Secretary had prepared a confidential Cabinet circular asking definite expression upon the American situation .

		The Prime Minister himself was distinctly favorable to intervention ; and a special Cabinet meeting , called for Octo - ber 23 ,
1862	DATE	, was to put the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	finally on record .

		Previous historians have noted , as does Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, that this Cabinet meeting was never held ; and that later , on
November 13	DATE	, when
France	LOCATION	had suggested to
England	LOCATION	joint action looking toward intervention ,
England	LOCATION	declined the offer .

		That on
November 13	DATE	England should decline any participation in an intervention which , beyond a doubt , was practi - cally scheduled but a very few weeks earlier , is surely surprising .

		This unexpected change in British policy has never been satisfactorily ac - counted for .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's explanation furnishes extremely interesting reading .

		Briefly ,
Palmerston	LOCATION	and
Russell	PERSON	had agreed during
September , 1862	DATE	, that the moment for recognition of the South was at hand .

		Glad - stone and other Cabinet members were aware of this opinion ; and
Gladstone	PERSON	, at least , had expressed his emphatic approval of the plan .

		So heartily was he in sympathy with the proposal , and so eager to bring it about , that he committed the now famous blunder of his
Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	speech , and , upon
October 7	DATE	, proclaimed the Cabinet policy of intervention as practically assured .

		The announcement was premature ; and
Palmer	PERSON	- ston , between whom and
Gladstone	PERSON	there was much friction , immediately seized upon his sub - ordinate 's officious announcement as a matter for public denial .

		It was promptly stated with Ministerial authority that
Gladstone	PERSON	was in error .

		Thus , according to Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, the mo - mentous matter of intervention was postponed at the favorable moment .

		The Prime Minister deferred for the time all action looking toward intervention , but did so unquestionably with the expectation that within a '' fortnight or a month '' the subject would again be taken up and carried to its logical conclusion .

		He could not know that the matter , once deferred , was disposed of for all time ; that the opportune moment which was essential to successful intervention had passed and could not be recalled .

		The Premier 's postponement for the fortnight or month proved fatal to any action whatever . ''

		Within that space of time , as events then indicated , he confidently believed some definite military result would be reached in
America	LOCATION	.

		Under the vigorous lead of Lee and '
Stonewall	PERSON	'
Jackson	PERSON	, the Confederate army might not improbably occupy
Washington	LOCATION	.

		And within the period assigned something did happen !

		but not what the British Premier had anticipated .

		At just that critical juncture , and by the merest chance as to time , one of the great events of the nineteenth century took place in
America	LOCATION	.

		On
September 22	DATE	, while the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary were corresponding with a view to the immediate recognition of the slave - holding Confederacy , the
Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	had been made public .

		That African servitude was an issue in the American struggle could no longer be denied ; the attitude of the national administration could not be ignored .

		From that time the success of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause meant the freedom of the slave .

		A conflict of Titans , in the conflict , wholly regardless of the influence it would have on the immedi - ateEuropean situation , the quondam
Illinois	LOCATION	rail-splitter , by force of circumstances , and quite unconsciously to himself , became transfigured into a trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Jove , had launched an unmistakable thunderbolt . ''

		At first , in
Europe	LOCATION	, and more especially in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the proclamation was not taken seriously ; dazed , apparently , men seem in no way to have realized its import .

		On the contrary , it excited scorn and
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 293 derision .

		I have not time here to give sufficing passages from the speeches of British public men and the news - paper editorials of the period ; though they to-day read curiously .

		I must confine myself to a few brief extracts .

		Mr.
Beresford-Hope	PERSON	, for instance , a highly respectable member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, energetically characterized the proclamation as ' This slavish type of weak yet demo - niacal spite , the most unparalleled last card ever played by a reckless gambler . '

		And a Mr.
Peacock	PERSON	, the mem - ber for
North Essex	LOCATION	, at a great Conservative demon - stration at
Colchester	ORGANIZATION	towards the close of
October	DATE	, declared that if the proclamation was ' worth anything more than the paper on which it was inscribed , and if the four millions of blacks were really to be emanci - pated on
January 1st	DATE	-LRB- then two months only distant -RRB- , we should be prepared to witness a carnage so bloody as that even the horrors of the Jacquerie and the mas - sacres of Cawnpore would wax pale in comparison ' and so forth and so on .

		Furthermore , the proclamation , he declared , was ' one of the most devilish acts of fiendish malignity which the wickedness of man could ever have conceived . '

		And the
London	LOCATION	organ of the Confederacy spoke within limits when it declared that while ' every organ of a considerable party pronounced the edict infamous , ' a ' similar opinion of it was enter - tained by every educated and nearly every uneducated Englishman . ' ''

		Viewed in the cool , clear perspective of history and through the half-century vista of subsequent events , there is indeed now something distinctly humorous in the simple and honest , but altogether complete self - deception in which the ' educated ' Englishman then nursed himself .

		What he really objected to , and for the best of reasons from his point of view , was the onward movement towards ' Democracy ' that he felt in the very marrow of his bones . ''

		The favorable chance for intervention rested not so much upon American conditions as upon the attitude of the British public .

		And all the virulent speeches in condemnation of the Eman - cipation Proclamation to the contrary not - withstanding , the British public would never support the Government that should interfere to perpetuate the slave-holding Southern Con - federacy .

		By the end of
1862	DATE	, the democratic instinct of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, inspired by
John Bright	PERSON	's assertion that the North was fighting the cause of Democracy , and thoroughly aroused by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's Proclamation , which also Bright applauded , had created upon the
Government	ORGANIZATION	such pressure that , in spite of its inclination , it dared not consider any step that might bring it into conflict with the North .

		In these two chap - ters Mr.
Adams	PERSON	opens new ground .

		The reader will be convinced that in the story of the Lan - cashire Cotton Campaign there is here sketched , for the first time adequately , the crisis of the Confederacy .

		Upon the fourth lecture , '' A Great Historical Character , '' it is unnecessary to comment .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's presentation of General
Lee	PERSON	, and of the conditions at the close of the war , is broad and sympathetic , and is characterized by the same exhilarating directness and virility that mark the entire volume .

		Since the publication of the present work , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has been extremely fortunate in acquiring additional material bearing upon the English Cabinet at this time .

		Some of this new material is incorporated in an amplification of the
Oxford Lectures	ORGANIZATION	now in course of delivery at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In these lec - tures , which it has been the reviewer 's privilege to hear , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	makes it clear that his later findings materially alter certain conclusions in the present volume .

		Whether this latest gather - ing of new material from
England	LOCATION	is to appear in print as a result of the
Baltimore Lectures	LOCATION	, or whether it is to be reserved for later publi - cation , the lecturer has not stated .

		In any case , historical students will look forward with eager - ness to its appearance in print .

		Here , then , are four wholly delightful lectures upon the Civil War .

		They discuss details of events and intricate steps of diplomatic pro- cedure that might easily make dull or difficult reading , while much space is given to minute and painstaking analysis .

		But the lectures are wholly enlivening and stimulating .

		There is in each chapter a thread of narrative which holds the attention of even the casual reader ; while for the student of the period , the volume is certain to be read with care and genuine satis - faction .

		THE UTERARY ASSOCIATIONS OF
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		* One has only to glance through the two volumes cited below to be deeply impressed with the part which
London	LOCATION	has played in our litera - ture .

		A large number of English authors were born in
London	LOCATION	; many others sooner or later migrated to
London	LOCATION	; and the
London	LOCATION	back - grounds have always been most attractive to literary men .

		The thought of
London	LOCATION	as a microcosm has been familiar to us at least since
Ackermann	PERSON	's time , more than a century ago .

		Here have always congregated those types dear to the heart of the novelist , the playwright , and the satirist Pendennis , and Colonel
Newcome	PERSON	, and
Nigel Oliphant	PERSON	, and
Micawber	PERSON	, and
Sam Weller	PERSON	, and Sir
Harry Wildair	PERSON	.

LONDON	LOCATION	IN ENGLISH LITERATURE .

		By
Percy H. Boynton	PERSON	.


University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		294 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	what surprising , then , that notwithstanding the large number of works on the antiquities of
London	LOCATION	, there should be few or none dealing generally with the literary atmosphere of the great city , or in which a comprehensive attempt is made to set forth the literary use made of the various streets and buildings and localities of what DeQuincey called `` the nation of Lon - don . ''

		The two volumes before us in a way comple - ment each other .

		Beginning with
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's day , Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	gives us a series of ten pic - tures of
London	LOCATION	, based as far as possible on contemporary evidence .

		He shows us the city of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, Dry den , Ad - dison , and
Johnson	PERSON	, thus giving two chapters each to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ; then he writes three chapters on the nineteenth century , and one on the twentieth ; a justifiable proportion .

		Appended is a representative list of about fifty novels , with references to the parts of the city of which the authors treat .

		This list might have been considerably extended , but is good as far as it goes .

		Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	's narrative of the development of the city is well balanced ; and armed with his references , one can go on almost indefinitely reading about the city as it figures in drama and fiction .

		One must add with regret that the volume is disfig - ured by some bad misprints .

		Mr.
Adcock	PERSON	pursues a different plan .

		He is interested not in chronology or in topograph - ical development , but in sentimental journeys to places peopled by the novelists .

		Going up
Cornhill	ORGANIZATION	, for example , he recalls the fact that near by was '' The court in which
Scrooge	ORGANIZATION	, of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's
Christmas Carol	PERSON	, had his home and business premises , and that coming from his bleak tank of an office one cutting , wintry night
Scrooge	ORGANIZATION	's clerk ,
Bob Cratchit	PERSON	, was so carried away by the joyous spirit of the season that he ' went down a slide on
Cornhill	ORGANIZATION	, at the end of a lane of boys , twenty times in honour of its being Christmas Eve ' ; and somehow
Bob Cratchit	PERSON	became as real to me in that moment as were any of the obvious people swarming on the pavement around nie . ''

		He is not therefore concerned so much with where
Shakespeare	PERSON	and Fielding and Gray and
Thackeray	PERSON	lived and what they saw in walking through the streets ; but he is deeply interested in the '' Grecian '' as being connected with Fal - staff and Shallow , and in the '' Bull and Gate '' in
Holborn	LOCATION	, where
Tom Jones	PERSON	put up on his first visit to
London	LOCATION	, and in the Charterhouse as the old school of the Newcomes , father and son , and of
Pendennis	ORGANIZATION	.

		These men are for him the realities of life rather than are the authors of their being .

		And much as we may wish it otherwise , is there not truth in this view ?

		Shakespeare is a shadowy figure at best , so shadowy that certain vandals have sought to deprive him of his fame and give it to
Bacon	LOCATION	or some other impossible person ; but how real is
Falstaff	LOCATION	, and the young
Henry V.	PERSON	, and
Richard III	PERSON	.

		!

		Thackeray , too , and
Dickens	PERSON	will in time become mere names , except to the few who read their biographies ; but
Becky Sharp	PERSON	and
David Copperfield	PERSON	and
Sydney Carton	ORGANIZATION	will live for many generations .

		This , then , is the point of view taken by Mr.
Adcock	PERSON	.

		Acting as a cicerone , he takes us here and there through the city in a succession of walks , pointing out who in fiction have lived in this or that place , and how the scene has changed since their time .

		It is surprising how much he finds in every part of the city .

		Take , for ex - ample ,
South London	LOCATION	.

		Passing down Borough High Street , we come to Lant Street , where
Bob Sawyer	PERSON	, the medical student in '' Pickwick , '' first encountered
Sam Weller	PERSON	.

		Across stood the the
King 's Bench Prison	ORGANIZATION	, to which the officers brought Mr.
Micawber	PERSON	from
Windsor Terrace	LOCATION	; and further down stood the
Marshalsea	PERSON	, full of memories of Little Dorrit and her family .

		Then there is
St. George 's Church	ORGANIZATION	, of which
William Halliday	PERSON	, in '' The Orange Girl , '' was the organ - ist .

		Round the corner of Horsemonger Lane ,
John Chivery	PERSON	, lover of Little Dorrit , had a tobacco business .

		Beyond
Camberwell Green	ORGANIZATION	lived Wemmick and The Aged , in '' Great Expectations . ''

		Mr.
Adcock	PERSON	is not concerned with the fact that
Browning	PERSON	was born in Cam - berwell he might at least have referred to it , but he knows that
Nancy Lord	PERSON	of
Gissing	PERSON	's '' In the Year of Jubilee '' lived in Grove Lane , and that
Samuel Barmby	PERSON	lived in Cold Harbour Lane before he prospered and went to live in Dagmar Street .

		At
Brixton	LOCATION	,
Osmond Waymark	PERSON	in
Gissing	PERSON	's '' The Unclassed '' was a teacher .


Vauxhall Station	ORGANIZATION	and Park recall the fact that
Evelina	PERSON	used to go to the famous gardens , and that
Boz	PERSON	described them .

		Lambeth is full of memories of
Gissing	PERSON	's '' Thyrza '' ; while Lam - beth
Marsh	PERSON	recalls the complaint of Luke in Massinger 's '' The City Madam '' that his gen tie - men apprentices wasted their time in its evil haunts .


Bethlehem Hospital	ORGANIZATION	or Bedlam recalls
Totty Nancarrow	PERSON	, who passed it on her way to
St. George 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hereabouts , too , the Gordon rioters in ''
Barnaby Rudge	PERSON	'' used to gather .

		Finally , the Bankside recalls '' The Bell of St.
Paul	PERSON	's , '' to say nothing of the Elizabethan theatres .

		Mr.
Adcock	PERSON	's book would have been perhaps
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 295 less interesting but certainly more useful if he had omitted some of the long quotations and had included a full topographical index , in addi - tion to the somewhat meagre general index which is provided .

		Turning from these suggestive volumes to the city itself , it may be worth while for us to glance at the successive stages of
London	LOCATION	's growth as related to literature , noting some features on which Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	has dwelt , and calling atten - tion to some others .

		In the walled
London	LOCATION	of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's day , with its forty thousand inhabit - ants , the chief sights were the Bridge and old
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The narrow , irregular streets , full of the smells of garbage and offal , were roughly paved with large stones , and were lined with small wooden houses .

		Morris 's ''
London	LOCATION	small and clean and white '' scarcely existed except in romance .

		The various handicrafts were pretty well segregated .

		The rich preyed on the poor : a good picture of a poor man is seen in ''
London Lyckpeny	LOCATION	'' -LRB- which , by the way , is not by
Lyd	PERSON	- gate : both our authors here follow a tradition no longer accepted among scholars -RRB- .

		The re - ligious life was much in evidence .

		Of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's twenty-nine pilgrims , ten had something to do with the church or the great orders ; and all of them were performing a religious task .

		When
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	went to
London	LOCATION	in
1586	DATE	, the population had increased to about a hundred thousand , and many houses now stood outside the walls .

		The city had become secularized ; the religious orders had disappeared , and men , turning from morbidly anxious attempts to save their souls , had developed a deep interest in the affairs of the present world .

		As Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	points out , this is well illustrated by the growth of the theatres , the performances in which now consumed much of the Londoners ' time .

		Paul 's Walk continued to be a chief rendezvous .

		Cheapside was unchanged .

		The Thames was a noble stream , an important highway for business and pleasure , on which some have estimated that forty thousand persons earned a living .

		There was such extravagance in food and dress that the cost of living must have been relatively very high ; all of which sounds strangely modern .

		The youthful
Milton	PERSON	beheld the growth of Puritan opposition to the stage which resulted in the closing of the theatres for eighteen years .

		When they re-opened , conditions were , as
Pepys	PERSON	remarks , '' a thousand times better and more glorious than ever heretofore . ''

		The Puritan restrictions upon conduct , as is well known , led to the most violent reaction .

		Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	puts it mildly : '' It is not too much to say that , under royal auspices , vice and vicious luxury have seldom flourished more arrogantly than at that time . ''

		The Plague and the Fire changed the map of
London	LOCATION	.

		Although the old street lines were preserved , in four years a new city arose on the ashes of the old a city on the whole far plainer and more severe than the old , relieved only by the noble architecture of
Wren	PERSON	.

		When
Addison	PERSON	settled in
London	LOCATION	, the town had swallowed up forty-seven outlying villages , and had a population of three-fourths of a mil - lion .

		After the reckless profligacy of the Stuart times ,
London	LOCATION	was inclined to sober down and reflect upon its ways , in which '' The Spectator '' helped .

		The great growths of the time were the coffee house , the club , and the periodical press ; Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	perceives also a new atti - tude of respect toward women .

		By
Johnson	PERSON	's time the territory of
Southwark	LOCATION	was almost as large as the City had been in
Chaucer 's day	DATE	.

		`` Between 1750 and
1765	DATE	new houses are said to have gone up at the rate of over a thousand a year . ''

		Yet though
London	LOCATION	was growing rapidly , it lost none of its charm . ''


Johnson	PERSON	explained that it was ' in the multiplicity of human habitations which are crowded together , that the wonderful immensity of
London	LOCATION	consists . '


Boswell	PERSON	endorsed both himself and his subject when he said : 1 The intellectual man is struck with it , as comprehend - ing the whole of human life , in all its variety , the con - templation of which is inexhaustible . '

		To
Burke	PERSON	it was ' an endless addition of littleness to littleness , ' yet ' clean , commodious , neat . '


Gibbon	PERSON	, more candid , wrote : ' Never pretend to allure me by painting in odious colours the dust of
London	LOCATION	.

		I love the dust . '

		The great city was all things to all men , a center of learning , a well-spring of intellectual pleasures , a vast market , an assemblage of taverns , a breeder of strong men , a ' heaven upon earth . '

		Johnson , as usual , gives us the conclusion of the whole matter : ` No , Sir , when a man is tired of
London	LOCATION	, he is tired of life ; for there is in
London	LOCATION	all that life can afford . ' ''

		One of the chief amusements of this very satisfactory city was gambling .

		Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	recalls the fact that the British Museum was begun with a lottery whose sponsors were the Archbishop of
Canterbury	LOCATION	, the Lord
Chancel	PERSON	- lor , and the Speaker of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, and by means of which ,100 , 000 were raised .

		At
Almack	ORGANIZATION	's -LRB- later
Brooks	PERSON	's -RRB- and other similar places play ran high .

		For other diversions one went to
Vauxhall	ORGANIZATION	, reopened in
1732	DATE	after nine - teen years of disuse ; to
Ranelagh	PERSON	, established in
Chelsea	LOCATION	in
1742	DATE	; to
Marylebone Gardens	LOCATION	; or to
Bagnigge Wells	ORGANIZATION	.

		Roystering and mob vio - lence were much in evidence ; the latter culmi - nating , one may say , in the Gordon Riots , so vividly portrayed in ''
Barnaby Rudge	PERSON	. ''

		296
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
April 1	DATE	In Lamb 's time the
City	LOCATION	had become almost depopulated of residents a
London	LOCATION	de-London - ized .

		Lamb himself frequented the district between
Ludgate Circus	ORGANIZATION	and
Charing Cross	ORGANIZATION	; while
Byron	PERSON	, between
1808	DATE	and
1815	DATE	, was to be found between
Trafalgar Square	ORGANIZATION	and
Hyde Park	LOCATION	.

		It is interesting to compare the impres - sions
London	LOCATION	made upon the two .

		For
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, the city was a never-failing source of delight , with its streets , markets , theatres , churches , its lamps , its coaches , its midnight cries of `` Fire ! ''

		and `` Stop thief ! ''

		its
Inns of Court	ORGANIZATION	, its old book-stalls .

		Place by the side of this
Don Juan	PERSON	's first sight of the city : `` A mighty mass of brick , and smoke , and shipping , Dirty and dusky , but as wide as eye Could reach , with here and there a sail just skipping In sight , then lost amidst the forestry Of masts ; a wilderness of steeples peeping On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy ; A huge , dun cupola , like a foolscap crown On a fool 's head and there is
London	LOCATION	Town ! ''

		And this was typical of
Byron	PERSON	's attitude toward
London	LOCATION	in general .

		The
London	LOCATION	we see through
Dickens	PERSON	's eyes was a grim one .

		Of course there were slums before
Dickens	PERSON	's time ; only they did not get into history and literature .

		Thackeray 's Lon - don was naturally different .

		It '' started with social position and used
Bohemia	LOCATION	as a back - ground as naturally as
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's started with poverty and resorted to the West End only by way of contrast . ''

		Yet it was still an old - fashioned city , '' Untouched by the march of comfort .

		There were no telephones , nor telegraphs , nor railways above or below ground .

		There were no electric lights , nor motor busses , nor elevators ; no department stores nor penny post ... Old cities are like old houses .

		You can not introduce all the modern conveniences without changing the looks of things . ''

		In the Victorian era the clubs came into full flower .

		Pall
Mall	ORGANIZATION	is a creation chiefly of the reign of
Victoria	LOCATION	; so are many of the Govern - ment buildings .

		As a literary centre ,
Chelsea	PERSON	now assumes importance , with the
Carlyles	ORGANIZATION	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	, and
Meredith	PERSON	.

		`` There must have been abundant ozone in the
Chelsea	LOCATION	atmosphere . ''

		Yet the whole
London	LOCATION	atmosphere was stimulating .

		`` Seldom has there been deeper breathing , heartier joking , more uproarious laughter , or sterner invective .

		The general discontent that prevailed in Victorian
London	LOCATION	belonged to the spirit of the age , which was an age of transition .

		If the early century was troubled , as it surely was , it was by ' the cheerful trouble of change . '

		And if the adjustments which were incessantly taking place made more for chaos than order , it was because ' the creed of humanity was on its honeymoon . ' ''

		Here let us take leave .

		With the
London	LOCATION	of tubes and motor busses and evening papers and luxurious hotels we will here have nothing to do .

		That belongs to the next century , for which the
London	LOCATION	of to-day will doubtless have the same charm which
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's

		WOMAN AND THE INTELLECTUAL , LIFE .

		* Whether we consider that ability for scien - tific research arose as a by-product of human evolution , or in some other way , it has become an asset of the first importance to our species .

		The history of nations and the experience of individuals alike indicate that prosperity and progress must come through new ways of util - izing inherent abilities , the discovery of self being the first step toward the discovery of the laws and potentialities of nature .

		It is prob - able that the most highly civilized nations of to-day resemble the steam engine in the small proportion of useful work done in comparison with the energy expended ; so that the social problem , like that of the engineer , is one of conservation and utilization , of the avoidance of waste .

		It is , therefore , extremely interesting to inquire whether the commonly received opinion , that women are less competent than men to engage in research , has any foundation in fact .

		The answer , if it can be found , is no longer a matter of mere sentimental interest , but involves the most practical considerations .

		Are we , through the organization of society , and in con - sequence of our customs and prejudices , pre - venting the development of an enormous amount of intellectual ability , which might be of incal - culable value to our species ?

		That this ques - tion is not inherently absurd , is shown by the history of science as cultivated '' by men : the long periods of stagnation and infertility , cer - tainly due to nurture rather than to nature .

		Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	, in a work of over four hundred pages , seeks to show that women not only are able to engage in severe intellectual labor , but that they have done so in very numerous instances in the past , with the most brilliant results .

		He begins with a discussion of woman and education in ancient
Greece	LOCATION	, and after a short chapter on woman 's capacity for scientific pursuits , describes in detail the achievements of women in mathe - * WOMAN IN SCIENCE .

		With an Introductory Chapter on Woman 's
Long Struggle	LOCATION	for Things of the Mind .

		By
H. J. Mozans	PERSON	, Ph.D. .

		With frontispiece .


New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 297 matics , astronomy , physics , chemistry , biology , medicine , archseology , and invention .

		Then follows a chapter on women as iuspirers and collaborators in science , and a final one on the future of women in science , with a summary of the argument .

		There is a good bibliography .

		The author has been indefatigable in search - ing the records of the past , and has assembled a surprising amount of information .

		When , however , the reader has recovered from his first astonishment at the array of illustrious names , he is likely to reflect that after all , when these are spread out over the length of history and the breadth of civilization , they are as rare as comets in the sky .

		He is likely to note that one comparatively small volume is needed to recount the scientific deeds of women , whereas nobody would think of writing such a book on `` Men in Science . ''

		In all probability , he will also remark on the extremely eulogistic phrases used to describe the women whose brief biogra - phies are given , and recall that the usages of society have sanctioned every kind of gross exaggeration and flattery in descriptions of women by men .

		It will occur to him that the author has assiduously and quite uncritically collected all these sayings , with perhaps no better sense of humor than that of an historian who might endeavor to picture the personal appearance of Queen Elizabeth from the letters and addresses delivered to her during her life - time .

		All these reflections are obviously tinctured with ancient prejudice ; we will not say mascu - line prejudice , for women are as likely to feel it as men .

		It does appear , however , that the author 's narrative requires to be taken with a certain amount of salt , and especially to be supplemented by some other considerations .

		The book is rather weak where it might have been strong , in its treatment of the woman of to-day .

		There are two rather distinct questions involved : whether women in general are intel - lectually inferior to men , and whether it is possible for women to exhibit very high mental powers .

		The latter point must certainly be conceded , even if we temper the glowing pages of history , and confine ourselves to the most authentic cases .

		Everything Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	has recorded might be literally true , and yet it might be true that the female sex was appre - ciably inferior to the male in intellectual powers , taken as a whole .

		Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	, in his concluding chapter , suggests that the sexes have substan - tially equal powers , but men , as
Etienne Lamy	PERSON	said , prefer analysis , women synthesis .

		My own judgment , after teaching both men and women for many years , is that not even this difference exists .

		As a matter of fact , when I have men and women undergraduates in the same class , the women always average better , generally considerably better , than the men .

		This no more proves that the female sex is inherently superior , than the reverse is proved by the argu - ments one often hears .

		The reasons for this state of affairs are complicated ; but college women have on the whole fewer outside activities than the men , and are not so likely to be taken up with purely '' prof essional ' ' courses .

		It is also probable , since the women at college are in a minority , that they represent a more selected group .

		John must go to the university , to get ready for law , or medicine , or what not ; but it is not worth while to spend money on Mary unless she is clever .

		In some cases , I believe that women gain an advantage from the way they approach intellectual subjects .

		The boy , mixing with other boys , has acquired certain active prejudices ; the girl , coming into contact with a new world of thought , naively appreciates things more nearly according to their real merits .

		Some people call this `` feminine intuition '' ; but is it not rather lack of social inhibition ?

		Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	remarks on the multitudes of unmarried women , necessary multitudes , be - cause of the numerical excess of their sex in civilized countries .

		Why should not they be contributing to the advancement of knowledge ?

		It is , however , extremely undesirable to hinder the ablest women from getting married , and equally undesirable to leave scientific research in the hands of any but the able .


Madame Curie	PERSON	is said to be an expert on babies as well as on radium ; and when we have discarded some hoary notions , and have found really edu - cated husbands for our brilliant women , it will probably not appear that marriage is a fatal obstacle to scientific activity .

		Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	does not so consider it , of course ; but we protest against the idea of presenting to a young woman the alternatives of science or marriage , as may easily be done with the best intentions .

		It is not long ago since university fellows were re - quired to remain celibate ; and very good argu - ments can be adduced in favor of this rule , until we begin to look at things in a larger way .

		Among men and women , there will arise a certain number of individuals endowed with such remarkable powers that they become ex - ceptions to ordinary rules , and require special environments .

		If a teacher finds one such during a lifetime , he is fortunate , and it is his duty to 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	do everything in his power to bring about the fruition of so rare a plant , throwing all consid - erations of time and academic technicalities to the winds .

		He is , however , mainly and essen - tially concerned with the normal person of good ability , who should lead a normal life , and con - tribute his share to the progress of the world .

		I believe it is perfectly practicable for the majority of such people , let us say a fourth or a sixth of the adult population , to serve at least as privates in the intellectual army , and in the course of a lifetime to make positive contribu - tions to human thought or knowledge .

		It is doubtless possible for a very much larger num - ber to have intellectual interests of some kind , though not actually engaged in consecutive work .

		This means a great extension of `` amateur '' activities , and a great increase in general cul - ture ; not only fruitful in itself , but furnishing a public well able to appreciate and utilize the greater labors of the genius .

		So far as history and experience show , there is absolutely no rea - son why women should not share equally with men the glories of such a renaissance .

		EVOLUTION OF HOUSEHOLD DECORATION .

		* Thirty years ago when
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	came to
America	LOCATION	, he hastened to tell us what he thought of our houses .

		Most of them , he said , were `` illy designed , decorated shabbily and in bad taste , filled with furniture that was not honestly made and was out of character . ''

		At first we were indignant ; when we had calmed down a bit and looked about us , we found the charges to be true ; then we said to each other , '' What can we do about it ? ''

		Soon came individual efforts at reform , and later , magazine articles and books pointing out the ways we should go .

		Now we have arrived at a stage where pub - lishers ' lists show a somewhat appalling array of books on household decoration .

		These books are of wide appeal , since there are few persons who do not at some time in their lives plan to build or to furnish a home .

		During the reign of the ugly , now commonly known as the mid - Victorian period , the whole business of house decoration was turned over to the professional decorator ; the theory being that , given money * HOME FURNISHING .

		enough , he could and would evolve beauty .

		For people without money the case was hopeless , and beauty in the home out of the question .

		But we have now renounced that belief ; though we accept hints from the professionals , we have discovered that no home is really beautiful unless it expresses , to some extent at least , the individ - uality of the family that occupies it .

		We know better than anyone else our own desires , our own limitations , and what minor things we are willing to sacrifice in order to secure our chief wants .

		Fortunately , the money side of the question has faded into comparative insignifi - cance .

		So many beautiful patterns and colors are now offered in inexpensive fabrics , so many charming designs in simple but graceful and honest furniture , that even the household of limited purse need not despair .

		In what we refrain from buying , quite as much as in what we buy , do we proclaim the quality of our taste .

		This means that household decoration , like all art , requires education in its fundamental principles .

		While good taste comes more natu - rally to some persons than to others , there are few who do not need a certain amount of train - ing , at least enough to save them from the dictum of the decorator or the follies of the faddist .

		A right and necessary use of books on the subject is apparent here .

		If we want an eighteenth century house -LRB- and it happens that there is a growing revival of fondness for eigh - teenth century work -RRB- let us by all means consult the English books devoted to this period .

		But the number of people who build their own houses is very small compared with those who live in houses or apartments built for them by others ; to adapt and furnish to their own taste these ready-made habitations is the main con - cern of the large majority .

		While the character of the house must of course dominate the situation in considerable part , it can not be allowed to do so entirely .

		All the conditions of modern life have changed so completely in the
last two decades	DATE	, that a house older than that presents a very stubborn face .

		Suites of gilded and high-ceiled rooms in which the more formal etiquette of an earlier day delighted are quite out of key with the mood of the `` tired business man '' in his American home or apartment .

		What he and his family want is something as far removed as possible from artificiality and affectation ; to banish the old traditions and to create the proper atmos - phere in the modern home are the chief aims in our new art of house decoration .

		Accordingly , it is not surprising to find in the three recently -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL published books on the subject , with which we have here to deal , an emphatic refusal to remain imitative and an earnest effort to become crea - tive .

		Moreover , many new appliances of science call for a new art in their use .

		Electricity has come to supplant the candles , lamps , and gas of the earlier times ; hence arise entirely new problems in residence illumination .

		Compara - tively little attention has been given to this problem by illuminating engineers , their efforts having been concentrated on the larger and more lucrative contracts for commercial and public buildings .

		Our new books wisely devote considerable space to the subject of lighting fixtures .

		In Mr.
Hunter	PERSON	's volume occurs this instructive passage : '' Light is the most beautiful thing in the world .

		It is not only beautiful in itself , but upon it depends the beauty of all beautiful objects .

		Without light they might as well be nonexistent .

		Carefully to conceal light sources is deliberately to abandon the greatest decorative possi - bilities .

		The work of the illuminating artist is to place and so shade the lights correctly that they glow with gentle , grateful radiance .

		... I can not sufficiently emphasize the difference that exists between the simple rooms in light colors and the elaborate rooms in dark colors .

		The latter take from two to five times as much light without being satisfactorily illuminated ... Frosted bulbs are one of the most blessed inventions of the age .

		They absorb 10 or
15 per cent	MONEY	of the light , but increase the amount of effective illumination .

		With 85 per cent of the light , the eye can see better than it could with 100 per cent .

		For the burning of the eye by the filament closes the pupil and makes it inefficient .

		Frosting also tones the light slightly toward the cream . ''

		In Mr.
Hunter	PERSON	's comments on the subject of rugs , tapestries , draperies , etc. , we find much valuable counsel .

		Best of all is a chapter of good sense on a subject so long treated with open abuse or silent contempt by writers on interior decoration , the subject of carpets covering the whole floor . ''

		Many persons undoubtedly use rugs where carpet - ing would be much more attractive decoratively as well as much more comfortable ... The more I think about carpets and carpeting , the less defense they seem to need .

		The vacuum cleaner removed any objection that could be made against them as dust collectors .

		And the fact that they do collect and hold the dust instead of leaving it to float loose in the air every time a door or a window is opened , is a strong argument in their favor as well as in favor of textiles generally ... Certainly , in halls and on stairways and especially in dining-rooms they are not only more comfortable but they are often more decorative .

		Rugs break up a room and make it look smaller , carpets pull it together and give the maximum appearance of size .

		A long , narrow hall looks much better proportioned with a full carpeting than with a runner . ''

		Had Mr.
Hunter	PERSON	been a housekeeper he might well have added that nothing has done so much to bring about the unhappy state which now obtains in domestic service as the supplanting of carpets by rugs and hardwood floors .

		The daily care of these doubles the work even in a small house .

		Of the other books before us , it may be said that their essential difference is well indicated in their respective titles , `` The
House	ORGANIZATION	as Home '' and `` The
House	ORGANIZATION	in Good Taste . ''

		The first - named is by an Englishwoman , Mrs.
Arthur Stallard	PERSON	, whose qualifications are suggested by her certificates and diplomas from schools of art and of cookery .

		Her book goes into much detail concerning such subjects as kitchens , basements , stores , cookery , children , servants , etc. .

		It is illustrated by twenty-four plates from photo - graphs by the author , mainly views in her own home ; but these are so commonplace as to detract from the book rather than add to it .

		The text is more convincing than the pictures .

		Miss
Elsie de Wolfe	ORGANIZATION	's volume wil be likely to attract considerable attention , not only be - cause the writer is well known as a professional decorator , but because her publishers have made such a beautiful book of it .

		Moreover ,
Miss de Wolfe	ORGANIZATION	writes in an easy and intimate way , telling of what she has herself done in recon - structing three old houses for her own use , two in
New York City	LOCATION	and one in
Versailles	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	.

		All of these houses she adapted for exclusively feminine occupancy , though the writer need hardly have mentioned that fact , for in all three cases the details show most of the features that the average man most detests .

		Miss de
Wolfe	PERSON	remarks in her opening pages : `` Men are for - ever guests in our homes , no matter how much happiness they may find there ... Man con - ceived the great house with its parade rooms , its grands appartements , but woman found eternal parade tiresome , and planned for herself little retreats , rooms small enough for comfort and intimacy . ''

		Granting these premises -LRB- which the present reviewer by no means can do -RRB- , the book contains many feasible and artistic sug - gestions .

		One of the best chapters is that on `` The Effective Use of Color . ''

		Has not the time come when we are ready to hear a strong plea for more color in our houses ?

		Are we not all a little tired of neutral backgrounds , patternless wall-papers , grey paint , etc. ?

		Futur - ism , Cubism , Synchronism , clamoring to be recognized as art , have many sins to answer for ; but they serve one good purpose , at least , in calling anew our attention to the glory that lies in color .

		The fact that strong tints are now so generally demanded in pictures , wall papers 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	and costumes , seems to indicate that we are at the beginning of an age of color .

		The boast of the nineteenth century home was that it made prompt use of the latest discoveries and inventions of science ; perhaps we of the twentieth century may yet boast that we are making good use of art , especially in the place where it has been neglected longest the decor - ation of the home .

		in a lump ; no regard for personality existed ; the faith in court justice and the love for the common weal were blown away to be replaced by the pocket revolver .

		It was the portent of that anarchy of thought which was to burst forth later on , it was the balance sheet of the old view of the world , the beginning of the demolition . ''

		This passage from
August Strindberg	LOCATION	's autobi - ography is significant and to American readers in - teresting .

		It shows one of the sources from which grew the spirit of `` The Red Room . ''

		The founda - tion was laid long before : when the boy found that he could not win his mother 's love ; when he was punished for a theft of which he was not guilty , while his aunt , who was the real culprit , calmly sat by .

		Another stone was laid when he walked the streets of
Upsala	LOCATION	with a backgammon box under his arm , trying to find a friend who would help him to kill the time which he , without books and without money , could not spend in study ; and again , in
Stockholm	LOCATION	, when he did not know where he should get food for the next day ; finally , when the master - piece of his youth , '' Master Olof , '' was refused by the Royal Dramatic Theatre .

		Hence the motto which he placed on the title-page of `` The Red Room '' : `` Rien n'est si de ` sagre'able que d'etre pendu obscure ` ment , '' which motto the translator of the English edition , probably not understanding its sig - nificance , has omitted . ''

		When I get to be thirty I will write a novel , '' he used to say in his younger days .

		When his friends asked what the book would be about , he answered : '' We '11 see when the time comes . ''

		When the time came he wrote `` The Red Room . ''

		It is a large social canvas in which the author shows society in cross sections , its tendencies , its main figurants .

		He had discovered
Dickens	PERSON	, and here he had found his form .

		But when the book appeared everybody cried '' Zola ! '' ''

		L'assom - moir '' had just appeared in a Swedish translation ; and though there is nothing in
Strindberg	LOCATION	's book that could be traced to the French author , the spirit of revolt was evident in both works , and was recog - nized by the champions of the existing order .

		Strind - berg had as yet read nothing by Zola .

		But now he began to read the Frenchman 's works , and found that he was superseded ; the other had already said all that he wanted to say .

		Strindberg then returned to his `` learned idiocies , '' and began to delve in the archives and libraries .

		The result was an historical work , `` The Swedish People , '' heterodox as every - thing he wrote ; heterodox then , but now the others have caught up with him !

		In
1884	DATE	appeared the book which should make
August Strindberg	ORGANIZATION	's name known far and wide : ` Giftas , '' i. e. , `` To Marry , '' not `` Married , '' as all the stories are not of married life , but all deal with the problem of marriage .

		* Of this book the author himself says : '' He went to work with his book on marriage with much sympathy and much old - fashioned reverence for the mother , and he had his ears full of talk about the subjugation of woman ; *
Strindberg	LOCATION	had actually considered the title , '' Married Folks , '' but instead selected `` To Marry , '' for the above - mentioned reason .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAJL 301 himself one of the subjugated , he wished to think out and experiment with means to save her and all others that were oppressed . ''

		After he had written some of the stories he stopped to look over what he had written .

		The result was not what he had expected .

		He lived at this time with his family in a , pension in
Switzer	PERSON	- land , a house full of women whom he met `` at every meal , between meals and everywhere , idle , preten - tious , pleasure-seeking . ''

		Then he wonders where the husband might be , and '' discovers the supporter of the family . ''

		In the preface to the first collection , the sociological viewpoint which ruled
Strindberg	LOCATION	is very clearly brought out .

		Here he criticises
Ibsen	PERSON	, who in '' A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	'' has '' described an excep - tional case and made it stand for a universal idea . ''

		And he shows how the ideal of womanhood has changed with the generations .

		The ideal of the eighteenth century is not the same as that of the middle of the nineteenth . ''

		To remove the woman question now , under present conditions , from its connection with other problems is impos - sible , to attempt it dangerous .

		Woman 's desire for libera - tion is the same as man 's unruly strife for freedom .

		Let us therefore emancipate the men from their prejudices and the women will also be liberated .

		But towards this goal we must work together , as friends , not as enemies . ''

		.

		, ' To quote from
Strindberg	LOCATION	's programme for the liberation of woman which follows this passage would be interesting and instructive , but space for - bids .

		It should be read in its totality .

		This whole preface has , however , been suppressed by the trans - lator .

		Nor will the reader of the English version realize that the volume consists of two collections of stories , written at different times , and the second in a quite different spirit from the first .

		This is emphasized in the original by the preface to the second collection , which the translator has also sup - pressed .

		Without these prefaces , and with no dis - tinction between the two original collections , and further with some of the more significant stories omitted , the present volume presents a distortion of the original that should not have been allowed to be printed * ; the more so as the translation itself is on the whole unsatisfactory .

		However , the `` prize '' is taken by the translation of `` Tjanstekvinnans Son , '' `` The Son of a Servant , '' as the English version has it , or `` The Servantgirl 's Son , '' as a more faithful translation would read .

		That the translator has only a limited knowledge of Swedish is very clear , or he would not have translated `` ga i vagen '' as `` go in the street '' instead of `` get in the way '' ; he would not have translated '' kryddkramaren '' as `` shipping agent '' instead of `` grocer '' ; he would not have made the man servant of the
General	ORGANIZATION	walk about in `` skull-cap and large hedge-scissors '' instead of helmet and saber !

		All this may be found on the first page .

		In addition to making a miserable translation , Mr.
Claud Field	PERSON	has taken the liberty * That the translator has added one more to the transla - tions already existing of `` Creditors '' and tacked it on to this volume of stories gives the whole a rather commercial aspect .

		of omitting the first three paragraphs , which give the historical and social setting to the book .

		One may hope that this translator will refrain from attempting the remaining three parts of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's great autobiography ; it is quite enough that he has spoiled the first part , which , with its most interest - ing story of the life of a boy and youth of unusual sensitiveness , will always command a high place in the autobiographical literature of the nineteenth century , and which should have been given to the English-speaking public in something like a faithful and spirited rendering .

		We may be permitted here to correct a statement in Mr.
Edwin BjOrkman	PERSON	's `` Voices of Tomorrow , '' where he says that
Strindberg	LOCATION	's mother was `` a barmaid who had brought three children into the world before her relations to their father was legiti - mized by marriage . ''


Strindberg	LOCATION	's mother was never a bar-maid ; she was waitress in a restaurant , and later his father 's housekeeper and what we would call his common-law wife .

		The union was legiti - mized a few months before
August Strindberg	DATE	's birth .

		He was not a welcome child , and was always conscious of this fact .

		Still , he always felt tied to the mother with the strongest of ties .

		Before he was ten years old he and his older brother were sent to the country to a sort of
summer	DATE	boarding school .

		The steamer has left
Stockholm	LOCATION	and is far out on the Baltic .

		He can not return home ; and in loneliness he thinks of his mother .

		`` He sees her picture before him , serious , mild , smiling .

		He hears her last words : ' Be obedient and polite to every - body ; be careful about your clothes , and do not forget to say your prayers . '

		He thinks of how disobedient he has been toward her , and wonders whether she is ill .

		Her picture appears purified , transfigured , and draws him on with longing 's never-breaking ties .

		This longing and lone - liness after the mother followed him through life .

		Had he come too early to this world ?

		Was he an abortive ?

		What held him so tied to the mother trunk ? '

		In `` The Confession of a Fool , ''
Strindberg	LOCATION	gives his own version of his first marriage .

		How much of this version is true , how much based on a dis - eased imagination , it is difficult to say .

		That there was a substantial basis for his accusation against his first wife is probably true ; but it is no less true that he imagined much that had no foundation in fact .

		But whether true or not , he believed it to be true , and suffered from his imaginings as much as from the actual reality .

		The book was written in French , but a German translation appeared in
1893	DATE	, a year before the French original was printed .

		No authorized Swedish edition has ever been pub - lished , though a spurious one from the German appeared serially in a
Stockholm	LOCATION	weekly in spite of the author 's protest .

		The book will , however , be included in
Strindberg	LOCATION	's collected works now in course of publication .

		But no matter how revolting some parts of the story are , the book can not fail to make a deep impression as explaining much that would otherwise seem puzzling in the author 's writings , and it must awaken a deep sympathy for him .

		To a man who has suffered as
Strindberg	LOCATION	302 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	suffered during the last years of his first marriage , much may be forgiven .

		Besides , the book is written with a force which carries the reader away as does , perhaps , no other work by this author .

		During his sojourn in
Switzerland	LOCATION	in the middle of the eighties ,
Strindberg	LOCATION	had been imbued with socialistic ideas , which found in his mind a fertile soil .

		He never lost his sympathy for the down - trodden or his interest in socialism ; but there came at one time a reaction from the enthusiasm with which he had embraced the socialistic tenets .

		One outcome of this individualistic swing of the pendu - lum was the novel `` I havsbandet , '' of which two translations have appeared : `` By the Open Sea '' and '' On the Seaboard , '' the former , like the other translations under consideration , by an English translator , the latter by an American .

		There is more than a touch of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	in the delineation of the chief character ,
Axel Borg	PERSON	, the Inspector of Fisheries , neither `` Fish Commissioner '' as the American translator has it , nor '' Superintendent of Fisheries , '' according to the English .


Strindberg	LOCATION	had been in correspondence with
Nietzsche	PERSON	for a short time in the later eighties , not long before
Nietzsche	PERSON	's final collapse ; and the correspondence has recently been printed in a German literary journal .

		It is as a conversation between Die Jung - frau and Finsteraarhorn !


Axel Borg	PERSON	is the super - man who is above the rest of humanity , a sort of scientific
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	.

		He finally succumbs because the delicate machinery of his brain and nerves is unable to withstand the double pressure of sexual excitement and intellectual loneliness .

		After the dissolution of his first marriage ,
Strind	LOCATION	- berg lived for some years in high tension , during which he produced a number of short dramas , essays , and sketches , the former of a rather misogynic character , the latter gradually culminating in a sort of scientific mysticism .

		In the meanwhile , he mar - ried for the second time , and after a couple of years this marriage also was dissolved .

		About this time ,
Strindberg	LOCATION	went through the experience which he has so faithfully described in '' The Inferno . ''

		Dur - ing this period , most of which he spent in
Paris	LOCATION	, he was as near to real insanity as is possible without actually overstepping the bounds of reason ; that he did not overstep these bounds , but still held his mind under control , is shown by his narration of what he went through , probably on the basis of minute diaries .

		During this period
Strindberg	LOCATION	experienced one of his many religious crises , the last one , and he came out of it not only a theist , but a believer in every word in the Bible , though not as an orthodox in the usually accepted meaning of the word .

		He said later that , in order to be able to hold himself upright , he found that he must have an infallible authority , outside of himself to lean upon , and he took the Bible , which he chose to accept as true in its smallest details .

		The three stout volumes published in
1907	DATE	and
1908	DATE	under the title , `` En
Bla Bok	PERSON	, '' are a curious manifestation of this spiritual development .

		Portions of the first two volumes are now translated under the title , '' Zones of the Spirit , '' and make very curious reading .

		They form a col - lection of jottings , notes , studies in little , reflections on science , denunciations of modern science and philology .

		Most of them have a distinct interest as human documents , but others have not even that much interest .

		The volume of collected tales published in En - glish under the title of the one placed first , `` In Midsummer Days '' -LRB- in Swedish called simply `` Sagor '' -RRB- , is , like too much of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's later production , uneven .

		Some of the stories are quite commonplace ; others , for instance , `` Half a Sheet of Foolscap , '' * and `` The Story of
St. Gotthard	LOCATION	, '' are among the finest he has written .

		All of these books , with the exception of `` Zones of the Spirit '' and some of the tales , belong in their original form to the most forceful productions of modern workmanship in the Swedish language .

		But the translations !

		There are parts of `` The Confession of a Fool '' and of `` The Inferno '' where one is reminded of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's language ; but in general the renderings are flat , when they are not worse .

		This is hardly to be wondered at .


Strindberg	LOCATION	is one of the most individual and there - fore one of the most trying authors for the trans - lator .

		It is probably not yet time for a uniform edition of a selection of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's work in En - glish .

		When the time comes , it would be well to take the existing translations and place them in the hands of an editorial board of persons who know both languages and represent both literary skill and philological learning .

		With such a board , but scarcely in any other way , will it be possible to get an adequate rendering of
August Strindberg	LOCATION	's writings in English .

		The question will of course arise ,
Cui	PERSON	bono ?

		Is it all worth while ?

		If it were only for the enrich - ment of the language by characteristic and neces - sarily unconventional phrases , the rendering of the spoken language in printed form , the gain would be great .

		But also as a contribution to literature , the literature of power , it would be more than worth while .

		Because a study of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's writings and the remarkable thread of self-revelation that runs through all he has written will help men better to understand themselves and the hidden motives that guide their thoughts and actions .

		As no mod - ern literature now is complete without a rendering of Ibsen and
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	, so will the time surely come when a knowledge of
Strindberg	LOCATION	will be regarded as necessary by anyone who lays claim to a many - sided intellectual equipment .

		Miss Lind-af-Hageby 's excellent and interesting study should contribute to a deeper understanding of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's life and writings , in his case the two are interwoven as with few writers .


Strindberg	LOCATION	wrote , if anyone did , with his heart 's blood .

		There * Why '' foolscap '' ?

		The original title is '' Half a Sheet of Paper . ''

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 303 is little in his writings that was not experienced by him , and there is nothing that has not been felt by him just as deeply as if it had been part of his own life .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Oland	PERSON	have added a third volume to their series of translations of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's dramatic writings , containing three plays from his later years , all three touched by his peculiar mysticism : `` Advent , '' with the dark mysticism of the Inferno - year ; `` Swan-white , '' in a lighter vein , like the fairy play it is ; `` The Storm , '' with the spirit of old age hovering over the scene .

		These translators , the one a Swede , the other an American , have succeeded better than others in giving not only a faithful , but a spirited , rendering of
Strindberg	LOCATION	in something like his own language .


AKSEL G. S. JOSEPHSON	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Literature and Persons who open Mr.
Holbrook	PERSON	art in the late
Jackson	PERSON	's new book of essays , '' The wth century .

		Eighteen Nineties '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- , anticipating merely a lively account of `` purple patches , '' too-amorous minor poetry , Jin de siecle epigrams , and decadent `` yellowness '' in art and letters , readers cherishing such anticipations are doomed to disappointment .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	is too serious a critic to devote himself to fripperies .

		He is attracted to the
last decade of the nineteenth century	DATE	because , like the ends of many centuries , it was a big , vital , dramatic epoch .

		To be sure , its bigness often bedizened itself in bizarre and tawdry trappings .

		Its splendid vitality was sometimes splendidly misdirected .

		Its dramatic fervor , its zest for novelty , its eagerness to taste life , led to inevitable indiscretions , indigestion and remorse , due to its having tasted more life than was good for it .

		But one should not , on this account , Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	thinks , over-emphasize fin de siecle decadence , or set up
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	as the type of the period .

		Beardsley 's strange exotic genius was but one expression of the questing spirit of the time .

		He challenged the world for individual freedom .

		Oscar Wilde , writing `` The Soul of Man under Socialism , '' showed himself awake to the equally novel and equally insistent demand for social freedom : a crusade that engaged the art of
William Morris	PERSON	.

		Meanwhile Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	was preaching a noble imperialism ; Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	was insisting that facing the facts of life is the only road to salvation ;
Francis Thompson	PERSON	turned to mysticism ;
John Davidson	PERSON	analyzed the difficult present and hailed the dawn of a splendid future ; while an impressive array of lesser geniuses wrote and painted , dreamed and discussed , gaily defying old customs and solemnly inaugurating a new , and on the whole a better , order of things .

		To those who , like the present reviewer , grew up in the nineties and were absorbed in one or another of its many trends , the complexity of Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's analysis will prove astonishing ; and to any reader it will be somewhat overpower - ing , with the recurring long lists of names and the conscientious attempt to be complete at all costs .

		We miss the sympathetic spontaneity of Mr.
Jack	PERSON	- son 's earlier and more casual studies of men and books .

		Nevertheless , `` The Eighteen Nineties '' is good work , worthy of the fine setting and copious and interesting illustration that the publishers have provided .

		Sympathetic studies of the arresting phases of the `` yellow nineties '' are common enough ; Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	has found his opportunity in showing how regenerate forces mingled there with degenerate , and in calling attention to the date of much fine work Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's plays , for example , that was the true fruit of the nineties , though it waited until the twentieth century for popular understanding and acclaim .

		If the Quakers thus magnified their P urest ?

		P irits >
John Woolman	PERSON	would be a saint .

		But the
Quakers	ORGANIZATION	have a way , unfortunately , of keeping many of their best things to themselves ; and had it not been for the recognition accorded by
Charles Lamb	PERSON	and Presi - dent Eliot and other men of the `` world , '' Wool - man 's name would hardly be known outside of the
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	.

		As it is , many well-read people know
John Woolman	PERSON	's meagre Journal to be the record of one of the most remarkably consistent lives ever lived on the pattern of
Christ 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		As liter - ature , it is one of the precious documents of the American colonial period .

		To rehearse
Woolman	PERSON	's life with the help of his Journal , fortified by con - temporary testimony , was well enough .

		But the world to-day wants to know whether this Christ-life led under the sole dictates of the
Voice	ORGANIZATION	within is , practicable .

		Is it possible for a man to be in the world and yet not of it , as was
Woolman	PERSON	?

		A tailor of
Burlington	LOCATION	, New Jersej 7 , he supported a family , paid his bills , directed by spoken and written word the trend of contemporary Quakerism , travelled re - peatedly on horseback from
New England	LOCATION	to
Virginia	LOCATION	, visited
England	LOCATION	in the love of the gospel , and died of small-pox at
York	LOCATION	in
1772	DATE	in the fifty-third year of his age .

		So much Mr.
W. Teignmouth Shore	PERSON	relates well enough , in his volume entitled `` John Wool - man : His Life and Our Times '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; but he misses the chance to present
Woolman	PERSON	effectively as a prophet of our times .

		See what this
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	stood for in the middle of the eighteenth century : anti-slavery in the Colonies , a just treatment of the Indians and a lively solicitude for their moral wel - fare , temperance in the use of liquors , peace among the nations , improvement in the condition of certain oppressed laboring classes , simplicity of life and modesty in expenditure , sharing the lot of the unfor - tunate , the responsibility of wealth .

		This sounds modern enough to arouse the curiosity of our gen - eration to know more of such a life .

		Speaking only at the irresistible dictates of his Master , letting his example speak louder than words , by the modesty and gentleness of his love for all sorts and condi - 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	tions of humanity he drew all men unto him .

		The idiosyncrasies into which he was led by the logical expression of his ideals seem not to have interfered a whit with the great influence that was diffused by his personality .

		There is a place for a book which shall study this life from the standpoint of present - day society ; but in the meantime we do well to ponder the secret of
Woolman	PERSON	's power .

		His Journal can not be lightly read by any serious man .

		It contains the most vital message that Quakerism has brought to the modern world .

		Mr.
Francis Bond	PERSON	's imposing book on '' En g li8h Chu .

		rch Architecture '' -LRB-
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is popular in intent ; whereas his earlier work , `` Gothic Architecture in
England	LOCATION	, '' was confessedly technical .

		It is ques - tionable , however , whether the intention is well kept .

		In mere point of size , with their thousand pages and their fourteen hundred illustrations , the new volumes are somewhat discouraging .

		Mr.
Bond	PERSON	calls attention , for instance , to the individual analy - ses of fifty-seven vaults which he expects will refresh the jaded reader who has just finished a systematic discussion of vaulting .

		Perhaps Englishmen with a hobby for ecclesiastical architecture can enjoy this ; but most other people would prefer some selection .

		When it is understood that the author has avoided duplicating illustrations which were included in the earlier book , itself containing over twelve hundred of the most significant examples , it may be doubted whether the volumes are supremely adapted for popular reading .

		The student , of course , will wel - come the rich publication of new photographic material and comment , which must really have fur - nished the chief motive for issuing the work .

		In his general and special publications , Mr.
Bond	PERSON	is in effect gradually supplying a corpus of English church architecture , not in the best organized form , perhaps , but rendered accessible by the very excel - lent indexes .

		In the new book the text is admittedly subsidiary to the illustrations , yet it contains matter of very great value .

		Its principal service is in bringing church architecture into close relation to ecclesiology , which has been much neglected in architectural books .

		The relation of the plan of the churches to the varied ritual under monastic , can - onical , and parochial use , is set forth in the most illuminating fashion , and goes far to explain many differences which have seemed arbitrary .

		The vexed questions of the origins of ribbed vaulting , of the apsidal aisle , and of French flamboyant tracery are treated with refreshing common sense and freedom from national bias .

		The student , for whose benefit such questions are really discussed , may be amused by the popular analogies drawn from millinery and gastronomy , and possibly a bit irritated by didactic reiteration , but will welcome the book as a useful addition to his resources .

		In - deed , were it not for the uncertainty of aim which has been noted , one might recommend the work without qualification .

		A lawyer 's anecdotal If all extant stories of the bench and bar were gathered into one volume , retrospections .

		jj OW elephantine would be its pro- portions !

		The professional memories of even a single lawyer or judge are frequently packed with enough choice anecdotes to fill a book of good size .

		Rich in entertaining matter of this sort is the reminiscent volume , `` Landmarks of a Lawyer 's Lifetime '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , from the pen of Mr.
Theron G. Strong	PERSON	, of the
New York	LOCATION	bar .

		With modest self - effacement he touches but lightly and incidentally on the facts of his own history , but discourses at length and with generous tribute of praise concern - ing the leaders of his profession whom he has known in the course of more than forty years ' practice in the courts of
New York	LOCATION	.

		A justifiable pride is manifested by him , at the opening of his book , in his descent from the
Connecticut Strongs	LOCATION	, among whom have been many distinguished lawyers and judges .

		He does not , however , weary his readers by tracing that descent , as he probably could have done , from the
John Strong	ORGANIZATION	who came to this coun - try in
1630	DATE	and , if genealogists are to be trusted , was the progenitor of the
Connecticut Strongs	LOCATION	with whom this bearer of the name claims kinship .

		In fact ,
John	PERSON	is not mentioned at all ; but the names of
Judge Martin Strong	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Justice William Strong	PERSON	, Judge
Theron R. Strong	PERSON	-LRB- the author 's father -RRB- , and others , suffice to attest the more than common ability of this branch of the Strong family .

		Among the famous jurists whose achievements and peculiarities are made to lend interest to the writer 's pages are
William M. Evarts	PERSON	,
Justice Field	ORGANIZATION	,
Charles O'Conor	PERSON	,
George F. Comstock	PERSON	,
John K. Porter	PERSON	, Mr.
Joseph H. Choate	PERSON	, and many others .

		Illustrations of
Evarts	ORGANIZATION	's ready wit are given in abundance , and among them this brief message accompanying a present to Ban - croft : `` I am sending you the usual half-barrel of pig-pork and my eulogy on Chief Justice Chase , both the products of my pen '' In a book so large as Mr.
Strong	PERSON	's , and presumably written rapidly in scant moments of leisure , errors of inadvertence are all but inevitable .

		Upon careful revision he would doubtless correct such slips as '' laid awake , '' and he would alter the wording of the clause in which he says of
Justice Clifford	ORGANIZATION	, of the
United States Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, that he `` rarely began a sentence with the definite articles ' a ' ' an ' or ' the , ' or with a personal pronoun . ''

		Dr.
Richard C. Cabot	PERSON	's happily - conceived and happily-named vol - ume , `` What Men Live By '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , belongs to a type of book periodically launched by the moralist , and usually varying from the dismal and feeble to the mediocre relieved by streaks of insight .

		The prejudice against books of this type is for the most part justified ; but we should be sorry if it lost Dr.
Cabot	PERSON	a single reader .

		So much depends upon how a task is conceived , and how it is met .

		To begin with , Dr.
Cabot	PERSON	speaks with a fulness of many-sided knowledge and a geniality
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 305 of outlook that may well claim kinship with the spirit of the two great medical men of letters of our land : the Autocrat still speaking to twentieth - century breakfast tables , and
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, whose loss carries the sorrow of a recent memory .

		The four arms of the cross that support the burden of life are Work , Play , Love , and Worship .

		Very old themes , but set in a modern key ; readily bandied as words , repeated as cant , circulated by the solemn with a self-righteous complacency , and by the frivo - lous in a Pickwickian sense : it is no slight under - taking to put new wine in old bottles and risk the odium of abused labels .

		The legacy of Puritanism , despite the sturdy virtues that give it an enduring place in American loyalty , has rested heavily on the land .

		It is redeemed , in what measure it needed redemption , by the ability with which its distin - guished descendants have met the new obligations with the new insight .

		It is as a contribution to the values of life that this readable volume , aptly phrased and well sustained , deserves a popular career .

		It is sound doctrine for the body , good wholesome sense for the mind , a balanced and not a specious optimism for the soul .

		Here and there the critical reader will find things that he would have said dif - ferently , and some that he would not have said at all .

		There is no preaching by intent , but only by implication .

		If anyone wants good advice or good stimulus to fair thinking on vital subjects , he will find it here .

		If there could be disseminated a knowl - edge of how to work and how to play , how to get the blessing of personal giving and receiving , how to be staunch and yet gentle , responsive to the big things as well as to the little things , life would be more worth living , and the limitations of our influential neighbors less distressing .

		It is a fine thing to have this demonstration that a man may be as discriminating as the best of us and yet retain an enthusiasm of interest and a sane perspective of values .

		Those who have avoided books of this genus because they did not care to expose themselves to the insult of a complacent optimism that made all things good because it saw all things with a com - prehensive immunity to their real significance , may take up Dr.
Cabot	PERSON	's volume without apprehension .

		They may not like all of it ; but they will like much of it .

		Everyone knows many people who should read this book .

		Anintervr etation Among the many publications of the of Chinese past few years dealing with various Buddhism .

		phases of Chinese civilization , it is a rare pleasure to find a book at once so scholarly and so sympathetic as is Mr.
Reginald Fleming Johnston	PERSON	's `` Buddhist
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The early chapters discuss the origin and development of char - acteristic features of that form of Buddhism known as the
Mahayana	LOCATION	, especially in its Chinese type .

		The later chapters deal with religious pilgrimages in
China	LOCATION	, and treat with especial fulness two of the four sacred mountains of Chinese Buddhists .

		A sojourner for fifteen years among the Chinese , Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	has shown his `` grateful appreciation of the unvarying courtesy and hospitality extended to him by the abbots and monks in whose romantic mountain-homes he has spent the happiest days of his fifteen years '' by not only studying with pains - taking interest the religion embodied in these placid mountain temple retreats , but also by imbibing that spirit and transferring it to the pages of this book in which he sets forth Chinese Buddhism to
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	readers .

		His study is a very pleasing example of that sort of scholarly work which , instead of destroy - ing the object of its analysis , really succeeds in con - veying that object in essence to the reader .

		Free of all conscious struggle to express the romantic and poetic , the deep and the childlike , spirit of Chinese Buddhism , Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's interpretation , neverthe - less , does express just these well-nigh inexpressible essences that float about the precincts of a Buddhist monastery in the mountains of
China	LOCATION	.

		He has evi - dently '' fallen under the potent witchery of Chinese landscape painting , '' and has '' found his way into the treasure house of Chinese poetry . ''

		If the statement of
Fenollosa	LOCATION	, quoted in the preface of this study , that '' a very large part of the finest thought and standards of living that have gone into Chinese life and the finest part of what has issued therefrom in litera - ture and art , have been strongly tinged with Bud - dhism , '' if this is true , then so competent and so sympathetic a treatment of Chinese Buddhism as the one before us ought to do much to introduce to
Europe	LOCATION	the spirit of Chinese art .

		To one who knows something of that art it appears likely to be a mere matter of a quarter-century before Chinese art will be as popular among persons of taste in
America	LOCATION	as is Japanese art to-day ; and its influence will be equally wholesome and refining .

		Such books as Mr.
Johns	PERSON	- ton 's `` Buddhist
China	LOCATION	'' will hasten that day .

		The most elaborate , and in many A bible of .

		- .

		Li - -1 humanistic ways the most interesting , compila - religion .

		^ j on fa ^ jj as come to our notice for a long time past is Dr.
Stanton Coit	PERSON	's '' Social Wor - ship '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , published on behalf of the
West London Ethical Society	ORGANIZATION	as a memorial of its twenty - first anniversary .

		In fixing upon this publication as the most appropriate and useful form which their memorial could assume , the members of the Society -LRB- as we are told in the Introduction -RRB- '' felt that the
Religion of Science	ORGANIZATION	, Democracy , and Personal Re - sponsibility in the Service of Humanity must become , like Buddhism , Christianity , and
Mohammedanism	PERSON	, a religion of a book ... Our ambition has been , to do so far as could be feasible , after only twenty - one short years of organized effort for the enthu - siasms , visions , and .

		motives which have drawn us into religious fellowship , what the writers and compilers of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	did for their own religious experiences and those of their immediate predecessors , in collecting the sayings and traditions current among them ; or what the editors of the Old Testament did for the moral idealism of their race . ''

		The result of this ambitious purpose , embodied in 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	upwards of 650 doable-column quarto pages , is a gleaning from the entire field of world literature , be - ginning in point of time with the
Eastern Scriptures	ORGANIZATION	and coming down to President
Wilson	PERSON	's Inaugural Speech , with a range of sources as various as these two instances suggest .

		In the selection of matter for inclusion , as well as in all other details of editor - ship , the religious motive has been predominant ; spirit and substance , rather than form , are counted the essential thing .

		So far , indeed , are literary con - siderations subordinated to the compiler 's purpose , that in not a few cases famous originals have been adapted and even largely rewritten to bring them into harmony with the ethical concept .

		The aim through - out has been to produce , not a literary anthology , subjectively chosen and arranged , but rather a litur - gical manual for social worship , whether in the family , the school , or the church .

		Such a work has long been needed , and it is certain to fill a large place and to exercise a very great influence in an age when religious creeds of every sort are shaping themselves more and more to the insistent human demand for social brotherhood and righteousness .

		We predict , too , that a wide circle of individual readers will be grateful for such a splendid body of inspirational , humanistic literature , presented in so beautiful a typographical setting .

		A supplementary volume , under the editorship of Mr.
Charles Kennedy Scott	PERSON	, is devoted to music , canticles , hymns , re - sponses , and anthems , all especially arranged for this publication .

		Not many students are qualified to treat the psychology of aesthetics for the lay reader ; and the editors of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	manuals were fortunate in securing `` Vernon Lee '' -LRB- Miss Violet Paget -RRB- to write their volume on `` The Beautiful . ''

		The plan of the little book is delightfully simple . ''

		It takes Beauty as already existing and enjoyed , and seeks to account for
Beauty	ORGANIZATION	's existence and enjoyment . ''

		In pursuit of this aim , the author leads us through chapters of varying difficulty on '' Elements of Shape , '' `` Empathy , '' `` The Aims of Art , '' `` Co-operation of Things and Shapes , '' '' ^ Esthetic Irradiation and Purification , '' and kindred topics .

		The subject is bound to be thorny , if it is approached conscien - tiously .

		The physiological basis of aesthetic prefer - ence is no simple problem , nor is anything to be gained by complacently disregarding its funda - mental complexity and inevitable difficulty .

		More thorough and patient investigation of details by the psychologists will help toward clarity ; but in the meantime we may be sagaciously suspicious of any general treatment that presents the appearance of smoothness and finality .

		In this respect
Miss Paget	LOCATION	's volume is admirable ; for it does not blink the hard points , while the presentation is as clear and as free from technicalities as the nature and status of the subject will allow .

		All in all , one is glad to predict that the readers ot this tiny book will be well repaid .

		After this commendation we ' may be allowed to voice our belief that the final chapter might have given us a little more help in answering the important question , How has sensi - tiveness to Beauty contributed to the survival of mankind ?

		It is true that '' aesthetic preference must remain only one degree less mysterious than the genesis and evolutional reason of its psychological components '' ; but even so there are a few established features that might have been adduced .

		As a matter of sociological interest we quote the author 's state - ment that `` aesthetic contemplation , instead of mak - ing an exception , a kind of bank holiday , to daily life , is in reality half of daily life 's natural and healthy rhythm . ''

		It may be true of the readers kept in mind by our enviable connoisseur of the fine arts ; but what about the millions in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	for whom life is almost wholly squalid grief and sordid toil ?

		In fulfilment of our duty as a conscientious reviewer , we must protest against '' these kind of cases '' -LRB- p. 140 -RRB- , and one or two minor slips of presentation .

Europe	LOCATION	commonly held to have been scoured clean of all mystery and romance by the friction of assiduous tourists .

		Mr.
Shackleton	PERSON	, a traveller of experience and not lacking initiative and originality , has sought and found the unfamiliar and the piquantly attractive in the

Dolomites	LOCATION	in the same bracing season , the real
Naples	LOCATION	of the Neapolitans , and along the river

		The author has a keenly observant eye and an aptly descriptive pen .

		In the little - visited Grand-Duchy of
Luxembourg	LOCATION	he is agreeably surprised to find , but slightly removed from the beaten tracks of travel , `` isolated villages , of houses gleaming white against the glaring green of hill - sides , where the landlord of the little inn will evince a desire to shake your hand on arriving , but to use an expressive Americanism for which there is really no capable substitute not to pull your leg on leaving . ''

		At Sedan , he tells us , '' I noticed that not a man , woman , or child dogged my steps to sell mementoes of that bitter battlefield , and that if I spoke in German to one of the townsfolk who was not in a business demanding the pleasing of strang - ers , I was told , with dry disrelish , that German was not understood .

Richardson	PERSON	, in his book on `` The Beginnings of Libraries '' -LRB-
Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has not pushed his researches sufficiently far back into the prehistoric past .

		The Vedas say that book-collections existed even before the Creator created himself , writes Dr.
Richardson	PERSON	, and the Koran maintains that such a collection coexisted from eternity with the uncreated God .

		He decides that it is idle to try to discover earlier traces of libraries .

		On another page he writes , quite seriously : `` If it is true that the animals do make conscious marks to guide them back to hidden objects , or even that they do have memory for facts , which is true memory , then possibly the beginnings at least of memory libraries and perhaps of external records must in the future be sought in the animal world . ''

		Even the possibility of plant libraries is hinted at .

		Under primitive libraries in the world of man are considered collections of message sticks , fetishes , personal ornaments , skin calendars , totems , votive objects , etc. .

		In fact , what most of us would regard as an anthropological museum , the writer chooses to consider a library ; and therefore he illustrates his book with wampum belts , Peruvian quipus , message sticks , leopard 's teeth , tattoo marks , and picture writ - ing .

		Fanciful and strained must seem to the general reader , if he should read the book , some of the ideas it contains .

		But its nucleus was an address before library school pupils , and to library workers chiefly its present elaborated form is likely to appeal .

		It shows scholarship and curious research , and is a fitting addition to the author 's earlier studies on `` Antediluvian Libraries , '' `` Mediaeval Libraries , '' '' Some Old Egyptian Libraries , '' etc. .

		The autobio - graphical note is interestingly emphasized .

		When
Hauptmann	PERSON	placed the early drama , `` Lonely Lives , '' in the hands of `` those who have lived it , '' he saw no other way for the hero to end the conflict in his soul than to seek peace in death .

		`` Man must justify his vision of life and make , not accept , des - tiny , '' this expresses the individualism of

		`` Readings in American History '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Professor
James Alton James	PERSON	, is a companion volume to the historical text-book of Messrs.
James	PERSON	and Saiid - ford .

		There can be no doubt , as the editor urges , that such a selection of source-material `` adds life and real - ity to historical study '' in the secondary schools , and we trust that the day is not far distant when every stu - dent shall be required to obtain a book of this type for use in connection with his narrative text .

		The selec - tions are of widely varied interest , and seem to us excep - tionally well chosen .

		As a companion volume to similar works covering
Europe	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, the projectors of '' Every - man 's Library '' -LRB- Dent-Dutton -RRB- now give us '' A Lit - erary and Historical Atlas of
Africa	LOCATION	and
Australia	LOCATION	, '' edited by Dr.
J. G. Bartholomew	PERSON	.

		With upwards of one hundred pages of maps and plans -LRB- for the most part in colors -RRB- , besides a gazetteer , index , and other text material , the book is a marvel of value for the price .

		The four volumes , as a set , present a graphic survey of the world 's historical and cultural development , from earliest times to the present .

Diaz	PERSON	in
1876	DATE	to the present adminis - tration of Huerta , together with an account of existing conditions based on the author 's recent visit to the republic .

		In its new form , this work embodies as entertaining and instructive an account of
Mexico	LOCATION	as the general reader is likely to want .

		There are numerous illustrations from photographs , excellently reproduced .

		Woman 's achievements in literature , art , science , finance , philanthropy , music , and education as exem - plified in the persons of seventeen eminent women of the present day form the subject of
Miss Lois Oldham Henrici	ORGANIZATION	's well-conceived and handsomely-made book , '' Representative Women , '' which bears the imprint of '' The Grafters , '' of
Kansas City	LOCATION	.

		From
Madame Curie	PERSON	, at the head of the list , to Miss
Ellen Key	PERSON	, at the foot , the names are those of women in whom we are all interested ; and the short biographical sketches , with accompanying portraits , help to a clear conception of their several kinds and degrees of genius or talent .

		A six-page alphabetical list of other notable women is ap - pended , and an Introduction by
Miss Ada M. Kassimer	PERSON	is prefixed .

		To the numerous series of handbooks dealing with serious topics on a scale somewhat between the average encyclopaedia article and the exhaustive special mono - graph is now added '' The National Social Science Series '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , issued under the general editorship 308 THE DIAL -LSB-

Frank L. McVey	PERSON	of

		A promising beginning has been made with three volumes , '' Money '' by Professor
William A. Scott	PERSON	, `` Taxation '' by Mr.
C. B. Fillebrown	PERSON	, and `` The Family and Society '' by Professor
John M. Gillette	PERSON	.

		The treatment in each case seems to be thorough and authoritative without sacrifice of popular appeal .

		In view of the marked present interest in social and eco - nomic affairs throughout
America	LOCATION	, we can imagine a very wide field of usefulness for this enterprise .

		Mr.
G. W. Hinckley	PERSON	has a pitying scorn for the weaklings who indulge in a
summer	DATE	outing in a so-called '' camp '' of comfortable and even luxurious appoint - ments , including porcelain bath-tubs and electric lights , and call it `` camping out . ''

		His conception of the real thing in this branch of healthful recreation is presented in the various chapters of his book , '' Roughing it with Boys '' -LRB-
Association Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which it is made plain that he is a camper-out of the good old-fashioned sort , and also a pedestrian of excellent staying powers .

		Fur - thermore , he evidently knows boys and how to handle them .

		On his title-page he describes himself as '' General Supervisor ,
Good Will Association	ORGANIZATION	,
Hinckley	PERSON	,
Maine	LOCATION	. ''

		This is plainly the book , or one of the books , for boys to read in preparation for their
summer	DATE	's camping .

		It is well illustrated in half-tone .

		For well over half a century ,
Roget	ORGANIZATION	's '' Thesaurus '' has been to countless literary workers a very present help , second only in usefulness to the dictionary itself .

1852	DATE	the latest is a `` large type edition '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , revised and brought down to date by Mr.
C. O. S. Mawson	PERSON	.

		The large type is an actuality , and the revision is of a very substantial sort consisting in the judicious addition of numerous slang and cant expres - sions , Americanisms , and various new phrases and quo - tations .

		The use of thin paper reduces the 650 pages of the book to a thickness of less than an inch .

		Alto - gether , this seems to us the very best edition of the '' Thesaurus '' now available .

		An interesting minor feature is the frontispiece portrait of
Roget	ORGANIZATION	, which shows us a countenance as modest and as winning as
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's .

		FIFTH AVENUE ,
NEW YORK	LOCATION	322 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 16	DATE	The Attack and By First Lieutenant
OLIVER WILLCOX NORTON	PERSON	THIS BOOK is not a history of the Battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, but only of the fighting on and around Little Round Top , which hill is conceded by all
Union	ORGANIZATION	and Confederate authorities to have been the key - point of the battlefield on
July 2 , 1863	DATE	.

		No other book devoted exclusively to this part of the battle has been published .

		THE OBJECT of this account by an eye-witness and participant as a member of
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade , is to correct errors of the leading historians in stating that
General Warren	ORGANIZATION	, seeing the impending attack by the Confederates on Little Round Top and its undefended condition , left his place at the signal station and rode rapidly to
Barnes	PERSON	' division then formed near the wheat - field for a charge in support of De Trobriand , and took the responsibility of detaching
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade and conducting it to Little Round Top .

		It proves conclusively that
Vincent	PERSON	, learning that
Sykes	PERSON	had sent an order to
Barnes	PERSON	to send one of his brigades to Little Round Top and that
Barnes	PERSON	was not then present with his division , took the responsibility upon himself of taking his brigade there without waiting for the staff officer to find
General Barnes	ORGANIZATION	.

		It shows that
Vincent	PERSON	selected his own position on the southern slope of Little Round Top and placed his brigade there without the guidance or assistance of Warren or any staff officer .

		Such writers as
Swinton	LOCATION	,
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Walker	PERSON	, Hunt , De Trobriand ,
Powell	PERSON	, and
Stine	PERSON	have made the statement directly or by implication that
Warren	PERSON	detached
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade and conducted it to Little Round Top .

		These statements deny to Vincent the responsibility which he took upon himself and relegate him to the position of a brigade ^ commander who went where he was ordered to go and stayed where he was placed .

		THE AUTHOR was a private soldier at the time of the battle , mounted and on detached service at the headquarters of
Vincent	PERSON	's Brigade as bugler and bearer of
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade flag .

		This duty required him to accompany the brigade commander wherever he might go on the march and in battle .

		This position gave him a better opportunity to hear orders given and received than even the members of the brigade staff , who were frequently absent at intervals conveying orders .

		Chapter IV contains the author 's account of what he saw and heard .

		THE WARREN LETTERS .

		Chapter VII contains nineteen letters from
General Warren	ORGANIZATION	and one from Lieutenant Roebling , of
Warren	ORGANIZATION	's staff , written to Captain
Porter Farley	PERSON	, who was Adjutant of Colonel
O'Rorke	PERSON	's regiment , the 140th
New York	LOCATION	, at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		With the exception of a part of one letter written in
1872	DATE	, none of them have ever been published .

		The subject of these letters was a discussion of
Farley	ORGANIZATION	's account of the history of his regiment , which appears as `` Farley 's Number Nine '' in the chapter on the Historians .

		In this form it was approved by
Warren	PERSON	and sent to the Comte de
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Warren never claimed that he detached
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade .

		On the contrary , he says in one of these letters , apparently with some sarcasm , '' If I detached
Vincent	PERSON	's brigade , I do n't recollect it . ''

		The letters reveal much of the inner life of General
Warren	PERSON	, his patriotism and fine personal character .

		They are a great contribution to history .

		CHAPTER III contains the OFFICIAL REPORTS of
Sykes	LOCATION	,
Barnes	PERSON	and
Regimental Commanders of the Union	ORGANIZATION	forces engaged at Little Round Top .

		Also the Confederate Regi - mental and Brigade reports of their forces which made the attack .

		These are copied from the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion , published by the

		361 BEASTS OF BURDEN . ''

		A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast . ''

		The wisdom of this proverb finds uni - versal assent , but to admit it in theory and dis - regard it in practice are courses that often go hand in hand . ''

		The last straw that broke the camel 's back '' is too often exemplified in the industrial , the political , and the educational fields of activity .

		The consequent collapse might easily have been foreseen and avoided , and yet when it comes , the theorists who have prepared the way for it are eloquent in expressing their pained surprise at the catastrophe .

		Allowing the theme to be metaphorically extended , there is no end to the illustrations of it that present themselves for our prayerful consideration , and all these cases of malpractice shelter themselves behind the blessed shibboleth of '' efficiency . ''

		Efficiency applied to industrialism can easily make a showing of physical gains , but the '' speeding-up '' of the work involves mental and nervous strains that are lost sight of because they are not susceptible of mathematical com - putation .

		Political efficiency is often attained through the disregard of principles that are more fundamental than any matters of technical pro- cedure , and educational efficiency is fondly thought to be promoted when it really means the sacrifice of hygienic and social principles more important than any questions of adminis - tration or curriculum .

		In the political sphere , nothing is more desir - able in the larger interests of society than the preservation of the principle of representative government , probably the most important of all political inventions , the invention which it took civilization some thousands of years to make , for lack of which the society of the ancient world crumbled away .

		And yet one of the favorite nostrums of our time is a movement to reform that principle altogether , and offer the most complicated problems of government to the direct arbitrament of voters in the mass .

		The refer - endum has worked admirably , no doubt , in the
New England	LOCATION	town-meeting , the Swiss canton , and the Russian mir , because the simple affairs of those communities were easily intelligible to untrained minds , and directly affected the in - terests of every individual who was called to pronounce upon them .

		It seems so reason - 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	able to refer the intricate and technical affairs of the larger community to the same court of appeal , while in reality it is imposing upon the average intelligence a burden too great to be borne .

		Some of the recent fruits of the refer - endum method in legislation must have given pause to the most ardent advocates of that policy .

		What they conceive as a means of get - ting a direct expression of public opinion upon the larger issues of politics becomes in practice a bewildering array of propositions presented to the voter when he spends his legal allotment of five minutes in the polling-booth .

		Shall he vote '' yes '' or '' no '' upon '' An act to amend the act entitled ... concerning the incorporation of cities and villages '' ?

		How many voters will take the pains beforehand to inform themselves as to what the proposition really means , and as to what the dozen or score of other and equally mystifying propositions upon his ballot really mean ?

		When we think how little trouble they will take to vote intelligently when they are asked to do more than make a choice between man and man for a few offices , the notion that they will put themselves to vastly greater pains to become competent legislators as well as electors is seen to be grotesquely inconsistent with what we know of average human nature .

		Elections are perplexing enough as they now are without saddling upon the poor voter a series of propositions of a strictly legislative character .

		If he can not select his representatives with judg - ment , how on earth can he be expected to vote upon the questions that should be decided upon the basis of expert knowledge ?

		The responsi - bility of choosing aldermen and assemblymen and members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is staggering enough without adding to it the responsibility of shap - ing the laws that they are to make .

		After all , we get from our legislators , in the long run , the kind of laws that we really desire , and if we complain about them , we are complaining about our own inefficiency as voters .

		Representative government , conscientiously applied , will be good or bad according to our own pains or slothful - ness .

		If we think the result is farcical , we have the remedy in our own hands , and our first step should be to reduce to a minimum the voting burden we place upon our own shoulders .

		The short ballot offers the solution to more political problems than we imagine , because it means the fixing and concentration of responsibility upon a small number of persons , and the number may readily be made small enough to offer no excuse for careless or unintelligent selection .

		But if we insist upon electing judges and court clerks and educational administrators , we must endure the consequences of our folly .

		And yet , such is the inconsistency of human nature , the advocates of the short ballot are often the very ones who will raise their voices in demanding that special additions be made to the already swollen lists .

		The demand for elective school boards in cities is the supreme instance of this sort of folly .

		A specious plea for such a policy , considered by itself , may easily be made ; but the proposition should not be considered by itself , but only in the light of the whole question of elections , when its ill-advised character becomes at once apparent .

		Perhaps the most long-suffering of our modern beasts of burden are those who , as teachers and students , are engaged in the work of education .

		The constant tendency is to load them with greater and greater weights , in the extension of supervised school activities , and in the increase of work , measured both by quantity and by hours .

		The recent increase of the amount of work in the
Chicago	LOCATION	high schools is a case in point .

		There was no respectable argument in its favor ; in fact , most informed opinion held that the amount was already too great , and that there was a crying need for its reduction , in the interests of the health of all concerned .

		But the increase was made , despite all the counsels of sobriety , and without any attempt to learn the wishes of the children 's parents .

		And so it goes all over the country .

		There is an ominous undercurrent of sentiment among educators , demanding now longer days , now shorter vaca - tions , now fewer holidays , and now increased requirements for diplomas .

		Every now and then this sentiment gets itself translated into specific action , and the cumulative effect of these measures constitutes a veritable menace to child - hood .

		The simple truth that intensive rather than extensive work is to be desired is about the last one that has any chance of prevailing in these days of educational tinkering .

		Miss
Mary Hinsdale	PERSON	, in a paper just published in the Journal of the
Association of College Alumnae	ORGANIZATION	, makes a vigorous protest against thus convert - ing schools into beasts of burden , and utters some very striking and pertinent truths . ''

		The same mother who declares at five o'clock tea that the schools are ' just killing the children ' circulates a petition the next week to have some new subject introduced . ''

		`` The American high school child has mental shortness of breath .

		The contents of his mind are as a badly focussed moving picture show . ''

		`` Everywhere there is a notion that every probable , or even possible ,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 329 activity of life ought to be anticipated at school .

		The simpler aim of putting the child in posses - sion of his powers and leaving their special applications to the great school of the world is suspended for a while . '' ''

		Some aspects of the conversion of the school into a social beast of burden are so contrary to nature that they would grow less if enthusiasts would stop to think . ''

		These random extracts illustrate the general sanity of the paper in which they are included .

		But the voice is of one crying in the wilderness .

		We have practiced our educational experiments now for many years of coddling children and catering to the unscientific demands of the ignorant , until a whole generation now bears witness to the demoralizing results of the pro- cess .

		The volume of our educational chatter has multiplied many fold ; our expenditure on education has grown enormously lavish , and the net result is a flabby mentality and a low - ered efficiency that would have shamed us had it been the outcome of the limited resources and appliances of thirty or forty years ago .

		It is time to call a halt , but the process of getting back to the simpler and saner practices of an earlier generation will be no easy one .

		It must be accomplished , if at all , by a regression as gradual as the rake 's progress of our recent educational years .

		Little by little , painful step by step , lopping oft here one thing and there another , and encountering the stubborn oppo - sition of the interested at every point , the work must be accomplished , until the demands now made upon both teachers and students are again brought within tolerable limits .

		The beast of burden now staggers helplessly along the road ; to lighten his load should be the imperative educational demand of the coming years .

		THE JUPITER OF NOVELISTS .

		Jupiter among the minor planets such surely is Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's place in the world of novelists .

		There are a few works of prose fiction in the whole extent of literature which surpass any single one of his ; but in mass , variety , and power he stands alone .

		The charge of externality and lack of profundity which
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	brought against his greater fellow - countryman falls to the ground with a moment 's examination of the novels .

		No creative artist , ex - cept
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, has given us so many men of the hermit heart , who react against the facts of life , who reenact the Promethean rebellion .

		No one has given us so many sybils , seers , prophets , victims of second sight and superstition .

		Scott 's mind was literally haunted by the supernatural .

		There is an element of this in almost every one of his novels .

		Maclvor ,
Meg Merrilies	PERSON	,
Balfour	LOCATION	,
Norna	PERSON	of the Fitful Head , it is hardly necessary to catalogue the instances of his employment of wonder-working agencies .

		And though sometimes , as in `` Wood - stock , '' he explains away his '' spiritings , '' he is usually far more serious and thrilling and profound than
Burns	PERSON	, for instance , in his playful '' Halloween '' or his half grotesque `` Tarn O'Shanter . ''

		As for meditations on fate and human destiny , whole novels like `` Old Mortality , '' `` Heart of
Midlothian	LOCATION	, '' and `` The Bride of Lammermoor '' are imbued with them .

		It is true that
Scott	PERSON	did not project a Hamlet .

		Nobody else has in modern times .

		`` Faust '' the poem is profound enough , but
Faust	LOCATION	the character is pretty feeble .

		The objection of
Carlyle	LOCATION	that
Scott	PERSON	is not high - soaring or deeply penetrant is negatived by the critics of the modern realistic school , who find that he is too romantic , that his creations are made out of the whole cloth , that he is lacking in observation and truth .

		Now I do not believe that there are two ways of creating .

		The distinctions between romantic and realistic and naturalistic methods are all futile .

		The only real difference is in the creative artists ' intensity of power and the direction in which they exercise it .

		The searchlight of genius may flash on mountain peaks , or wooded hills and glens , or crowded city streets , or quiet little hamlets ; it may reveal the action and agony of battle or a circle gossipping around a tea table ; its X-rays may show minds starred with a universe of thoughts or may glimpse others which stir only with an animal exist - ence .

		But in every case the searchlight brings as much as it finds , it colors and creates .

		Here is a passage from the autobiography of
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	, certainly a typical realist , if there ever was one : '' I never lived in any Cathedral city except
London	LOCATION	, never knew anything of any close , and at that time had enjoyed no particular acquaintance with any clergyman .

		My arch - deacon , who has been called life-like , was I think the simple result of an effort of my moral consciousness .

		It was such as that , in my opinion , an archdeacon should be , or at any rate would be with such advantages as an archdeacon might have ; and lo !

		an archdeacon was produced who has been declared by competent authorities to be an archdeacon down to the very ground .

		And yet , as far as I can remember , I had not then even spoken to an archdeacon . ''

		Scott , the arch romanticist , did not go about his business in this fashion .

		It was late in life that he began novel writing , and his knowledge and experience of life in all its varieties was prodigious .

		Probably no one 's powers of observation ever sur - passed his .

		As far as art can or cares to reproduce truth and reality he went , and humanity recognizes itself in his portraitures .

		Scott shared with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in a certain aris - tocracy of temperament and aim .

		He wanted to be among the privileged of the earth .

		This sets him somewhat apart from the modern current .

		In their different ways
Dickens	PERSON	, Hugo ,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, even Balzac , believed in the divinity of the people .

		They hank - ered after the martyrdom of the multitude , even if they hesitated to share it personally .

		Yet no one has 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	had a keener or more manly sympathy with the poor than
Scott	PERSON	.

		It was not a maudlin pity , the Scotch character forbade anything of the kind . ''

		That for your dommed luxury ! ''

		says the Scotch father in `` Punch 's '' picture , as he kicks from under the head of his son the snow pillow which the latter has rolled up to make more comfortable his bed on the open moor .

		This toughness of fibre is present in all of
Scott	PERSON	's poor people , and it is perhaps a better thing than
Dickens	PERSON	's happy sentimentalism or
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	's frustrate pity .

		It is claimed for the Russian novelists ,
Dostoi	PERSON	- effsky in particular , that out of their overflowing love for disinherited and outcast humanity , they have penetrated into the heart of criminal men and women , have shown the necessity for evil , and the good that is wrapped up with it .

		Of course this is an untenable proposition .

		Every great artist since the beginning of time has recognized that evil is his most powerful ally , that it puts the most vivid colors on his palette , draws the strongest lines on his canvas .

		Indeed , it may be said that a great artist must be in love with evil as far as his work goes .

		Certainly the man who drew
Dirk Hatteraick	PERSON	,
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Nanty Ewart	PERSON	,
Balfour	PERSON	, the
Templar	ORGANIZATION	,
Louis XIII.	PERSON	, and innumerable other black sheep , need not yield to any more recent creator in his knowledge of and sympathy for errant human nature .

		Nor , though he altered and nearly ruined the plot of `` St.
Ronan	PERSON	's Well '' to please the pru - dishness of
Ballantyne	LOCATION	, has he any particular scru - ples about `` the young person 's '' supposed needs .

		Indeed , there is much breadth of theme and racy coarseness in his books , more , I think , than could be gathered out of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Objection has always been taken to the insipidity of
Scott	PERSON	's heroes and heroines .

		The heroes of most novels may be relegated to the limbo of the null and indifferent , and
Scott	PERSON	's are generally no excep - tion to this law .

		But for his heroines a better case may be put up .

		Certainly
Flora Maclvor	PERSON	,
Di Vernon	PERSON	,
Clara Mowbray	PERSON	, and
Rebecca	PERSON	are clearly entitled to a place in the legend of fair women .

		We now come to a great stumbling block to many of the late critics of
Scott	PERSON	, his lack of style .

		It is rather difficult to know exactly what this objection means , but it seems to divide into two parts , want of distinctive and perfected wording in the language , and want of highly-wrought form and tone in the whole compositions .

		As to the first ,
Scott	PERSON	wrote with incredible rapidity , and there are plenty of careless slips and many dull and sprawling pages .

		But when he is interested , which is almost always , he carries the interest of the reader along with unparalleled vivacity .

		And whenever the character or the situation needs it , he rises to the heights of expression .

		If any of the modern stylists have written better things than
Meg Merrilies	PERSON	' farewell to Ellangowan , or
Mucklewrath	ORGANIZATION	's denunciation of Claverhouse , or the latter 's speech to
Morton	LOCATION	, or
Jeanie Deans	PERSON	's appeal to
Queen Caroline	PERSON	, or a hun - dred other passages of the kind , such superior mod - ern efforts are hidden to the world .

		Scott 's English may sometimes be languid or careless , but he hardly ever writes a speech in his own Scottish dialect which is not racy and terse and vivid .

		As to fitting together of parts and creation of atmosphere , we may point to `` The Bride of Lammermoor '' as one of the great tone poems of the language .

		And `` Old Mortality '' and `` Ivanhoe '' are as perfect in their different ways . ''

		Which is the greatest play of Shakespeare ?

		In which aspect do you like the sea best ? ''

		So ex - claims
Keats	PERSON	in one of his letters .

		We may echo the saying in regard to
Scott	LOCATION	.

		There are about a dozen of his novels so even in their diverse excellence that there can be no real precedence given to any one of them , there can only be preference in the individual reader 's mood .

		To '' Waverley '' belongs the right of primogeniture , and it has a certain state - liness and splendor , a richness of material , which support this right .

		It may dispute with ''
Marmion	PERSON	'' the honor of being the Scottish Iliad , or , rather , it has no rival , for the poem is mainly English in its characterizations , as it is in the victory it celebrates .

		To my mind , however , '' Guy Mannering '' is a more important book .


Meg Merrilies	PERSON	is
Scott	PERSON	's greatest creation , a figure so great indeed that it gave a bias to
Scott	PERSON	's mind and compelled him to reproduce it in many subsequent shapes .

		Then the variety of other comic and eccentric characters in the piece are remarkable , as are the variety of scene and incident .

		I should say it has the best opening of any novel I know .

		On the other hand , there is more bad con - struction and more really insipid writing than in any other of the novels of the first rank .

		In mere delight - fulness , `` The Antiquary '' is perhaps supreme .

		But
Edie Ochiltree	PERSON	is a male
Meg Merrilies	PERSON	; Sir
Arthur Wardour	PERSON	is an inferior copy of Sir
Robert Hazlewood	PERSON	.


Jonathan Oldbuck	PERSON	himself and the group of fisher people are the novel elements of the piece . ''

		Old Mortality `` is more closely wrought than `` Waverley , '' with a high excellence of tragic and comic character , yet it seems a trifle more remote from our sympathies a trifle academic .

		Not academic at all is `` The Legend of
Montrose	LOCATION	, '' but overflowing with human interest .

		Dugald Dalgetty may almost dispute with
Meg Merrilies	PERSON	the primacy of
Scott	PERSON	's people .

		Beauty and pathos and tragedy have set their seal on ' - The Heart of
Midlothian	LOCATION	. ''

		But , fine ' as are the delinea - tions of
Jeanie	PERSON	and
Effie Deans	PERSON	, to me those quali - ties seem more perfectly blended in
Madge Wildfire	PERSON	, who is absolutely Shakespearean .

		I should not do battle with anyone who unfurled the banner of either ``
Rob Roy	PERSON	'' or `` Redgauntlet . ''

		For all me , Di
Vernon	PERSON	may ride down to posterity at the head of
Scott	PERSON	's procession , with
Nicol Jarvie	PERSON	on one side and
Andrew Fairservice	PERSON	on the other .

		And ' Red - gauntlet '' is the very pattern and paragon of ro - mantic novels .

		It has hurry , bustle , change , enchant - ment from start to finish .

		Something thrilling is happening every minute , and we have Wandering
Willie	PERSON	's tale thrown in as a makeweight . ''

		The Bride of Lammermoor '' is set apart in
Scott	LOCATION	's work ,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 331 unique in its gloom and tragic singleness . ''

		St.
Ronan	PERSON	's Well '' has been accounted one of his fail - ures , but it seems to me in the first rank .

		He wrote it in good-natured rivalry with
Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		It is certainly not an
Austen	PERSON	novel , but it is perhaps a better thing .

		With all respect for Miss
Austen	PERSON	's inimitable genius , with a full appreciation of her mastery in every stroke , one may still feel a sym - pathy with
FitzGerald	PERSON	when he likened her work to gruel . ''

		St.
Ronan	PERSON	's Well '' is unequally con - trived .

		The villain and his machinations are taken direct from ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	. ''

		Some of the people at the
Spa	ORGANIZATION	are dropped there out of a
Sheri	PERSON	- danic comedy .

		But
Clara Mowbray	PERSON	is so fine and true to nature and the highest art that it does not need to say that she has stepped out of Shakespeare .

		And as
Meg Merrilies	PERSON	is the progenitor of a long line of strange or wandering beings , so
Meg Dods	PERSON	is the culmination and summing up of
Scott	PERSON	's many landladies and '' douce Scotch bodies '' in various walks of life . ''

		Ivanhoe '' and ''
Quentin Durward	PERSON	'' complete the list of
Scott	PERSON	's greatest novels .

		Each is somewhat of a tour de force , and though in each case the effort is successful we feel more than in the Scottish novels that there is an effort .

		Scott 's novels of the second rank , `` The Pirate , '' `` Fortunes of
Nigel	PERSON	, '' '' Kenil worth , '' `` The Talis - man , '' ``
Woodstock	LOCATION	, '' `` The Monastery , '' `` The Ab - bott , '' and `` The Fair Maid of
Perth	LOCATION	, '' are generally so good that ope hardly knows why they should be separated from the first flight .

		There is a differ - ence , yet any one of them may ride forth with their master 's pennon and blazon and do him no discredit .

		Even his failures , '' The Black Dwarf , '' '' Peveril of the Peak , '' `` The Betrothed , '' `` Anne of Geierstein , '' and `` Count Robert of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' have so much of good in them that they would furnish forth a toler - ably first-rate reputation .

		When we take into account the fact that at least three of
Scott	PERSON	's metrical tales hold their own in any assemblage of English narrative poetry , and when we add to this that his profusion of lyrics in their melody , ringing lilt , perfection of wording , and grace or depth of meaning are with the best in the language , we may realize that he was a wholesale dealer in great literature .

		Many writers since have equalled or surpassed him in quantity ; but it seems to me that all his novel-writing successors at least must give place to him for novelty , variety , vitality , and energizing power .

		CAS UA L COMMENT .

		A MINE OF MANUSCRIPTS relating to the early history of
Virginia	LOCATION	,
West Virginia	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and the Old Northwest , has recently been opened and four months spent in exploring its riches by Mr.
Earl G. Swem	PERSON	, assistant librarian of the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	, who now issues a report of his dis - coveries in a bulletin entitled `` A List of Manu - scripts Recently Deposited in the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	by the State Auditor . ''

		Accumulated state and county papers and record books for almost a century and a half had been lying disregarded in the basement of the library until Mr.
Swem	PERSON	's energy and enterprise were brought to bear upon their sift - ing and sorting and the preservation of such con - siderable portion of them as are of value to history students , genealogists , statisticians , and others .

		`` An estimate of the total number of pieces retained and deposited , '' says Mr.
Swem	PERSON	in his prefatory note , `` is between 650,000 and 700,000 , of which 10,000 are records in book form .

		The documents were at once roughly grouped and their titles written in the accession book .

		The list printed in the present Bulletin is based upon this hasty and preliminary classification , and is not presumed to be final .

		It was thought advisable to give to students at once some knowledge of what had been deposited . ''

		Many records examined were returned to the audi - tor 's office , as properly belonging there , but the series designated as `` personal property books '' that is , lists of owners of taxable personal property , with enumeration of such property was deposited in the library , and is believed by Mr.
Swem	PERSON	to con - stitute `` the most authentic and comprehensive source material for the study of the economic and social history of
Virginia	LOCATION	from
1782	DATE	to the close of the War between the States . ''

		Genealogists , too , will find much material of value to them in the col - lection .

		But probably the most generally interesting item in the catalogue is the following : ``
Clark	PERSON	,
George Rogers	PERSON	.

		70 packages of letters , vouchers , accounts , orders , captured papers and miscellaneous documents concerning
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	and the
Illinois	LOCATION	country .

		1778-1783 .

		300 pieces per pack - age . ''

		The magnitude of the task undertaken and carried through by Mr.
Swem	PERSON	, and the inconveni - ences attending it , together with the obvious uncer - tainty whether the work would ever have been entered upon if he had not had the courage for it , all tend to increase respect for his zeal as well as gratitude for his timely service to the cause of his - torical study ... A PASSING GLIMPSE OF EMERSON in an attributed role not the most frequently associated with his name is obtained in turning the pages of the richly en - joyable '' Notes of a Son and Brother , '' Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's current contribution to good literature .

		In a letter of his father 's , written just after the writer had been to
Concord	LOCATION	to '' bury '' two of his children , as he expressed it meaning that he had placed his two youngest sons in Mr.
Frank Sanborn	PERSON	's school he says : '' Then we drove to
Emerson 's	ORGANIZATION	and waded up to our knees through a harvest of apples and pears , which , tired of their mere outward or carnal growth , had descended to the loving bosom of the lawn , there or elsewhere to grow inwardly meet for their heavenly rest in the veins of Ellen the saintly and others ; until at last we found the cordial Pan himself in the midst of his household , breezy with hospitality and blowing exhilarating trumpets of welcome .

		Age has just the least in the world dimmed the lustre 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	we once knew , but an unmistakable breath of the morning still encircles him , and the odour of prim - eval woods .

		Pitchpine is not more pagan than he continues to be , and acorns as little confess the gar - dener 's skill .

		Still I insist that he is a voluntary Pan , that it is a condition of mere wilfulness and insurrection on his part , contingent upon a merci - lessly sound digestion and an uncommon imaginative influx , and I have no doubt that even he , as the years ripen , will at last admit Nature to be tributary and not supreme .

		However this be , we consumed juicy pears to the diligent music of Pan 's pipe , while
Ellen	PERSON	and
Edith	PERSON	softly gathered themselves upon two low stools in the chimney-corner , saying never a word nor looking a look , but apparently hemming their handkerchiefs ; and good Mrs.
Stearns	PERSON	, who sat by the window and seemed to be the village dress-maker , ever and anon glanced at us over her spectacles as if to say that never before had she seen this wondrous Pan so glistening with dewdrops . ''

		After enjoying that flight of playful fancy can one be surprised that two of the writer 's sons attained distinction with the pen ?

		... RECOVERED PORTRAITS OF THE BRONTE SISTERS ,
Charlotte	LOCATION	,
Emily	PERSON	, and
Anne	PERSON	, in a group painted by their brother , together with a profile sketch of Emily from the same amateur hand , have by a fortunate chance been acquired by the
National Portrait Gallery	ORGANIZATION	and will be hung in the so-called Modern Literature Room .

		These pictures , good likenesses , according to Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	, though leaving much to be desired as works of art , had long been given up as lost , and their recent discovery brings joy to the hearts of Bronte enthusiasts .

		The canvases had been taken by
Charlotte	LOCATION	's widowed husband , the Rev.
A. B. Nicholls	PERSON	, to his home in
Ireland	LOCATION	when he left
Haworth	PERSON	, and beyond that nothing was known of them .

		A few weeks ago , however , the surviving second wife of Mr.
Nicholls	PERSON	, still living in the house that was his home at the time of his death , directed a servant to clear out an old cupboard or wardrobe that had remained undisturbed for many years ; and among the objects disinterred were two parcels in brown paper .

		On being unwrapped they proved to be the long-lost portraits , the canvas having the group being folded in four , to its obvious detriment .

		This was the very painting held up by
Charlotte	LOCATION	for her future biographer to admire , as is related in the `` Life '' ; and how
Charlotte	LOCATION	's bereaved husband could have brought himself to treat so barbarously this memorial of her if indeed his was the ruthless hand that did the deed one is at a loss to under - stand .

		But perhaps he took this means to show his little esteem for the vainglorious
Branwell	PERSON	and all his works .

		If so , one can rather easily forgive him .

		THE SOUL OF A LIBRARIAN 'S WIT , like that of wit in general , is not seldom to be found in its brevity .

		The current annual Report of the
Rochester	LOCATION	-LRB-
N.Y.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library resembles the history of that insti - tution : it is very short .

		Three years ago there was no
Rochester Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and its present succinct record of yearly progress is its second .

		But terseness of statement need not indicate paucity of achievement , any more than prolixity should be taken to stand for great things accomplished .

		`` This re - minds us , '' says Mr.
Yust	PERSON	, the librarian -LRB- but he does not say it in his Report -RRB- , '' of a story in the Book of Books .

		In
Matthew 25	DATE	:
14-30	DATE	we are told of three servants who had received talents , five , two and one respectively .

		On the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's return they all rendered account of their stewardship .

		The first two had doubled their capital .

		Each of them said so in fourteen words , and their work was pronounced ` Well done , good and faithful servant . '

		Servant number three had accomplished absolutely nothing , but he made a full report in forty-two words , three times as long as the other reports . ''

		Rochester is building up its library system from the broad base of its numerous and widely-scattered branches and distributing centres four hundred and forty-eight in number - instead of downward from the pinnacle of a main library .

		This main library , still in more or less distant prospect , will , it is hoped , be a fitting consummation to all the effort and accomplishment that have preceded it ; and the trustees are now watchfully waiting for a
million-dollar	MONEY	building fund and a site for the buildisg , we infer .

		Most creditable is the circulation record published by Mr.
Yust	PERSON	, 274,372 , with a total collection of 38,321 volumes , or more than seven lendings of each volume owned .

		... THE FUNCTION OF THE FAIRY TALE in developing the young reader 's imagination is highly esteemed by some educators , and as severely condemned by others ; and the reasons for each of these opposing judgments are obvious .

		Professor
William A. Neilson	PERSON	, of
Harvard	LOCATION	, at a recent meeting of mothers gave his opinion of the
Grimm	PERSON	tales and similar juvenile works .

		`` The stories by the brothers
Grimm	PERSON	, '' he said , `` were written many years ago , and perhaps the most charitable way of dismissing them would be to say that for their time they were all right .

		The fact remains , however , that they are standard and classic , and that there is still a profit - able business in publishing them .

		Sooner or later they fall into the hands of our little folk .

		I believe that these stories should be discarded because their suggestion to the childish mind is that every wrong was avenged .

		Revenge is a bad enough vice to exist in any of us , without being suggested and inlaid in the childish mind by a fairy tale . ''

		True , in part .

		In an ideal world , with an ideal system of education , the child would be taught to turn the other cheek ; but in an ideal world there would be no cheek-smiting to begin with .

		In the actual world the situation is more complex .

		In the actual world , too , it is very improbable that any child not an imbecile ever takes the
Grimm	PERSON	tales literally .

		When
Hansel	ORGANIZATION	and
Grethel	PERSON	shove the wicked witch into the oven , slam the door , and run away to leave her to her merited cremation , the young reader takes a wholesome pleasure in this vivid illustration of poetic justice , without incurring any serious risk
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 333 of imitating
Hansel	ORGANIZATION	's and
Grethel	ORGANIZATION	's example .

		At any rate , if our little folk are to have nothing given them to read more highly-apiced than ``
Sandford	PERSON	and Merton '' and the Rollo books , they will never develop much love for literature .

		A JAPANESE ACROSTIC , the '' I-Ro-Ha '' hymn of
Kwai Han	PERSON	, a famous poet who lived more than a thousand years ago , forms the subject of some inter - esting remarks by Dr.
Clay MacCauley	PERSON	in `` The
Japan	LOCATION	Magazine , '' of
Tokyo	LOCATION	; and the poem itself , consisting of forty-seven verses , each verse beginning with one of the syllables of the Japanese alphabet , in abecedarian fashion , is translated , or paraphrased , by the writer .

		Kwai Han 's self-imposed task was more difficult , or more considerable , one infers , than that of the Hebrew poet who composed the 119th Psalm , the Hebrew alphabet having but twenty-two letters to be worked into the acrostic , while the Japanese has forty-seven characters , or syllables .

		`` The Dominant Note of the Law '' is Dr.
Mac	PERSON	-
Cauley	PERSON	's rendering of the title of the hymn , and of course his translation of the lines retains nothing of their acrostic character , but merely reproduces in substance the poet 's tribute of praise and thanks - giving to
Buddha	LOCATION	.

		Concerning this Japanese alpha - bet , or ``
Hiragana	LOCATION	syllabary , '' as it is called , Dr.
MacCauley	PERSON	has also something to say .

		The Buddhist saint ,
Kukai	LOCATION	, later known as
Kobo Daishi	PERSON	, or `` the great Teacher who spread the law abroad , '' invented the syllabary about twelve hundred years ago , and at the same time devised a metrical arrangement of the syllables in eight lines , '' in which the conviction fundamental in Buddhism is graphically concen - trated . ''

		Like our mnemonic lines , `` Thirty days hath
September	DATE	, '' etc. , these eight verses are readily learned by the child , and they constitute the `` ABC '' of Japanese school-children .

		Here is Dr.
Mac	PERSON	-
Cauley	PERSON	's English paraphrase of them , in the original metre : '' E'en though clothed in colors gay Blossoms fall , alas !

		Who then in this world of ours Will not likewise pass ?

		Crossing now the utmost verge Of a world that seems , My intoxication fails Fade my fleeting dreams . ''

		THE SECRET OF AN AUTHOR 'S STRENGTH prob - ably lies much oftener than is suspected in those seeds of character that were sown in his very earliest years .

		Those who profess to see the man indelibly outlined in the boy of five will not be surprised at Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	's ascription of his success as an author to the unconsciously-acquired nature-lore of his childhood .

		In the autobiographic fragments that give so much of life and charm to Dr.
Clara Barrus	PERSON	's `` Our Friend
John Burroughs	PERSON	'' -LRB- reviewed on another page -RRB- he says : `` When I began , in my twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year , to write about the birds , I found that I had only to unpack the memories of the farm boy within me to get at the main things about the common ones .

		I had uncon - sciously absorbed the knowledge that gave the life and warmth to my page .

		Take that farm boy out of my books , out of all the pages in which he is latent as well as visibly active , and you have robbed them of something vital and fundamental , you have taken from the soil much of its fertility . ''

		On a later page this is significant : '' From the impromptu character of my writings come both their merits and their defects their fresh , unstudied character , and their want of thoroughness and reference-book authority .

		I can not , either in my writing or in my reading , tolerate any delay , any flagging of the interest , any beating about the bush , even if there is a bird in it .

		The thought , the description , must move right along , and I am impatient of all footnotes and quotations and asides . ''

		First and last , it is made very evident that , though other nature-writers may need to lay in a store of material by journeying , gun in hand , to
South Africa	LOCATION	or
South America	LOCATION	, no such premeditated course would ever have furnished the books that now delight the thousands of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's readers .

		A GREAT NEWSPAPER 'S BID FOR POPULARITY has been known to work its own undoing in the long run , or even in the surprisingly short run .

		Fortune loves not to be truckled to , but has a way of bestowing her favors most lavishly on those who scorn them .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' at threepence had so long been a national institution that its change to a lower price could not fail to shock the conservative Englishman and to seem indicative of a lowering of its tone .

		A tuppenny `` Thunderer '' fails to be as impressive as a sixpenny '' Thunderer '' for the journal had been sold at sixpence , fivepence , and fourpence , before it settled upon its long-familiar price of threepence .

		And now we have the spectacle of a `` Times '' sold on the street at the same paltry price at which the hot cross buns of about this season are being cried through the purlieus of
London	LOCATION	.

		Of course the rivalry of competitive journals , notably the '' Morn - ing Post '' and the `` Daily Telegraph , '' is at the bottom of all the plausible professions made by the `` Times '' in justification of its descent to the penny standard or , at least , to the penny price .

		Perhaps the threepenny standard can be maintained even by a penny paper , but the course of journalism in our own country has not been such as to create expecta - tion of highest excellence in cheapest journals .

		It is a significant fact that the three newspapers gen - erally acknowledged to be the best in
America	LOCATION	are sold at three times the price asked for the -LRB- at present -RRB- immensely popular sheets that flaunt their flaming headlines in every street-car and ferry-boat in the land .

		... MATHEMATICAL DETERMINATION OF A LIBRARY 'S USEFULNESS must be appreciably more difficult than , for instance , the determination of the amount of salt in a gallon of sea water ; but the librarian of the
Gary	PERSON	-LRB-
Indiana	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library proposes a system for registering , in terms that he calls `` units , '' the 334 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 16 quantity of service of all sorts , and of each separate sort , rendered by a library in any given time .

		Frankly acknowledging the impossibility of gauging such an institution 's total influence for good through - out its community , he still believes it possible and advisable to ascertain in mathematical terms just how great its activity in each of several directions , and in all these directions , really is .

		Counting as a unit each lending of a book , attendance of a reader in the reading-room , circulation of a picture or of a piece of music , presence of a person at a library lecture or club meeting or entertainment , reference question answered by telephone or mail , and so on , the statistically-inclined librarian should be able at the end of the official year to report , with professional pride and self-congratulation , that his library had rendered public service to the extent of -LRB- let us say -RRB- 343,761 units , with the separate items of this service duly tabulated .

		And when a rival library reports a total greater by fifty or sixty units , what incentive there would be to beat that record next year !

		Ways of more sorts than one by which this might be effected will readily suggest them - selves .

		But is all this counting and classifying and tabulating worth the brain tissue it consumes ?

		Per - haps it is .

		LITERARY CLASSICS ON THE MOVING-PICTURE SCREEN will never , it is to be hoped , cause the same classics to be ignored in book form .

		As an incentive to reading rather than a substitute for reading , these breathless glimpses of a great author 's conceptions might accomplish much good .

		A recent news item under the general heading , `` Music and Drama , '' announces that ``
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	's ` Judith of Bethulia ' and
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's ' Soldiers of Fortune , ' in motion pictures , are filling
Proctor	PERSON	's Fifth Avenue Theatre at every representation . ''

		These are not exactly to be counted among the classics of all time ; but Homer 's `` Odyssey , '' which has been epitomized in moving-picture form , is certainly a classic ; and who knows but we may yet have , for instance ,
Milton	PERSON	's '' Paradise Lost '' offered to an eager public in the same manner ?

		That great epic has obvious possibilities in the way of spectacular scenes and theatrical situations .

		Perhaps , too , the bill-boards will some day announce the presentation of
Bunyan	PERSON	's `` Pilgrim 's Progress , '' of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's `` Faery Queene , '' and even of Chaucer 's `` Canter - bury Tales , '' as the latest attraction to lovers of the '' movies '' ; for even the heedless throng tires in time of the vulgar inanities that are reeled off by the thousand yards at so many show-houses throughout the land .

		INSTANCES OF EDITORIAL FALLIBILITY in the rejection of manuscripts that afterward and else - where demonstrate both their commercial value and their literary excellence are numerous enough in the annals of periodical literature .

		A few nota - ble illustrations , chiefly from his own experience , are given by Mr.
Henry Sydnor Harrison	PERSON	in an article , `` Adventures with Editors , '' in the current `` Atlantic Monthly . ''

		Entering upon `` a regxami - nation of an ancient inquiry : Why are manuscripts rejected ? ''

		the writer offers some good advice to editors who would save themselves from the embar - rassment of discovering , too late , that they have curtly dismissed an embryonic genius such embar - rassment as must have been felt by the unnamed editor mentioned in the following anecdote , quoted by Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	: '' The first real literary success of
Kathleen Norris	PERSON	, author of ` Mother ' and ` The Rich Mrs.
Burgoyne	PERSON	, ' was the acceptance of a story by the
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	.

		` This story , ' she says , ' had been the rounds of the magazines , but when it finally appeared in the
Atlantic	LOCATION	I received four letters from editors , to whom it had previously been submitted , complimenting me upon my work and asking the privilege of considering my next story .

		One of these was Mr. , of 's Magazine .

		I wrote him thanking him for his praise , and told him that the story had been submitted to him on such and such a day , and had been returned with a printed note of thanks a fortnight later . ' ''

		How many a still unrecognized literary genius , with a trunkful of rejected manuscripts , would rejoice to find himself placed in a position similar to that of
Miss Norris	PERSON	, and how few of them , probably , would exercise her forbearance toward the self-stultified editor !

		... THIS YEAR 'S LIBRARY CONFERENCE will be held in
Washington	LOCATION	,
D.C.	LOCATION	,
May 25-30	DATE	, with headquarters at the
New Willard Hotel	ORGANIZATION	, and with accompanying sessions of the various affiliated and subordinate organizations of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Announcement of the order of exercises , the post - conference plans , and other details , is now awaited ; but meanwhile a brief glance at the many attractions
Washington	LOCATION	offers to those engaged in library work must at least induce a strong desire to be present at the coming convention .

		The
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the Library of the
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- recently strengthened and made more widely useful -RRB- , the various department libraries , the
Library of the District of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, the museums and collections of different kinds all these contribute to both the pleasure and the profit of such an occasion as the forthcoming .

		Only once in its history has the
A. L. A.	ORGANIZATION	held its annual convention in this city of libraries , and the home of our chief library ; and that was thirty-three years ago , when seventy , out of a membership of more than four hundred , came together to discuss topics of professional interest .

		Probably one reason for the rather small attendance , the fourth-smallest in the
Association	ORGANIZATION	's history , was the time chosen for the conference early
February	DATE	, when libraries generally are at their busiest and the conditions for travelling least inviting .

		Certainly a much larger attendance is to be expected this year , when it is hoped there will be present a considerable delegation from
Canada	LOCATION	in return for our own hearty response to the invitation to
Ottawa	LOCATION	in
1912	DATE	.

		THE HUMAN NATURE OF A NATURALIST .

		* Many of Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	's readers must have interrupted their reading more than once to ask themselves why it is that everything he writes has so unquestionable a reality , so in - evitable an interest , so inescapable a charm .

		Scrutiny and analysis fail to reveal in his page any rhetorical trick or other device that can be made to explain the secret , nor does the thought which his language clothes attain to such stu - pendous heights or depths as shall account for his unfailing command of our attention .

		Finally , therefore , the conclusion is reached that it is the man 's personality itself that speaks to the reader so compellingly , though so quietly and unassumingly .

		One is made to live the writer 's own life and think his own thoughts with him in his books .

		How then can they fail to be alive with meaning and pregnant with reality ?

		As supplementary to these master - pieces of intimate self-portraiture , such a vol - ume as Dr.
Clara Barrus	PERSON	's '' Our Friend
John Burroughs	PERSON	, '' with its passages of autobiography from the naturalist 's own pen and its scraps of familiar talk from his lips , must be very wel - come to the less fortunate thousands of his ad - mirers who have never enjoyed Miss
Barrus	PERSON	's good fortune in being invited to visit him at Slabsides and
Woodchuck Lodge	ORGANIZATION	, or to travel with him and camp with him in
Colorado	LOCATION	and
California	LOCATION	and the
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	.

		The book 's first chapter , bearing the same title as the book itself , attempts to show why Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	is '' our friend , '' and says , among other things , that '' it is the ' child in the heart , ' and , in a way , the ` child ' in his books , that accounts for his wide appeal .

		He often says he can never think of his books as works , because so much play went into the making of them .

		He has gone out of doors in a holiday spirit , has had a good time , has never lost the boy 's relish for his outings , and has been so blessed with the gift of expression that his own delight is communicated to his reader . ''

		Then follow instances and letters and anecdotes illustrating the large , generous friendliness of the man .

		`` The Retreat of a Poet - Naturalist , '' as the next chapter is called , shows the `` Sage of Slabsides '' under his own rustic roof - tree .

		It * OuB FRIEND
JOHN BURROUGHS	PERSON	.

		By
Clara Barms	PERSON	.

		Including autobiographical sketches by Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	.

		With illustrations from photographs .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		was only after twelve years ' acquaintance with his books that
Miss Barrus	PERSON	yielded to her im - pulse and sent Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	a letter telling him what a joy his writings had been to her .

		Later there came to her a gracious invitation to visit him , and so close a friendship was formed that for the past twelve years she has had the Enviable privilege of helping him with his corre - spondence , which , in respect to letters received , at least , is of no small proportions .

		Following this admirable presentation of the naturalist * in his woodland retreat comes what must be ac - counted the best part of the book , bits of auto - biography sent in the form of letters to Miss
Barrus	PERSON	at her request , and pieced out with fit - ting additions of her own or selections from the autobiographer 's other reminiscent writings .

		In three parts , dealing with his ancestry and family life , his childhood and youth , and an inquiry into the origin and nature of his own distinctive peculiarities , he most frankly and engagingly depicts himself and his environment , exciting admiration for the noble candor to which any concealment or disguise is so utterly foreign .

		Like
Franklin	PERSON	, he unhesitatingly tells the worst that can be told about himself ; but unlike
Franklin	PERSON	he has nothing that is morally repel - lent to reveal .

		Like
Franklin	PERSON	, again , he was one of a large family of brothers and sisters , none of the rest of whom attained to distinction .

		A chapter is next devoted to Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's early writings , with illustrative extracts .

		In the formality and comparative heaviness of those first ventures into print , philosophical or didactic in tone as they mostly were , there showed itself very little of the man as he soon afterward became when he really began to find himself and his true place in the order of things .

		Even in that first `` Atlantic '' essay -LRB- `` Expression '' -RRB- which Lowell so promptly accepted and pub - lished it was in
1860	DATE	, when its writer was twenty-three years old there was , uncon - sciously to the essayist , so much more of
Emerson	LOCATION	than of the future author of `` Wake Robin '' that the piece was generally ascribed to the
Concord	LOCATION	sage .

		Indeecf , it may be found indexed in `` Poole '' as of Emersonian origin , and the earlier editions of Hill 's `` Rhetoric '' have a footnote quoting a line from it and assigning it to
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		It was
Miss Barrus	PERSON	herself , it now appears , who called the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professor 's attention to the error .

		`` A
Winter Day	DATE	at Slabsides '' shows Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	in the youthf ulness and high spirits of seventy-four years , roasting a duck in a pot for his invited guests and giving them such a 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	feast of reason together with the products of his culinary art as may well excite the reader 's envy of those favored banqueters .

		Then comes a view of the naturalist restored to the scenes of his boyhood , in the town of
Roxbury	LOCATION	,
Dela	LOCATION	- ware
County	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, where he has reclaimed an abandoned farmhouse half a mile from the old homestead where he was born , and has christened it '' Woodchuck Lodge . ''

		It is here that he has the `` hay-barn study '' so pleasantly familiar to readers of his later essays , and it is here that he now spends his summers , wonder - ing at the perversity that kept him so long estranged from this beautiful
Catskill	LOCATION	country of his childhood .

		In her penultimate chapter , perhaps her best ,
Miss Barrus	LOCATION	relates what must have been the event of her life , a camping trip -LRB- with one other of her own sex -RRB- with '' the two
Johns	PERSON	, '' ''
John	PERSON	of Birds '' and ''
John of Mountains	LOCATION	. ''

		The latter Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	, of course joined the party in the Petrified For - ests of
Arizona	LOCATION	, showed them the wonders of the
Grand Canon	ORGANIZATION	and the
Mojave Desert	LOCATION	, the beauties of
Southern California	LOCATION	and the sublim - ities of the Yosemite , and only parted with them when they embarked for
Hawaii	LOCATION	.

		The striking contrast between these two nature-lovers and old friends is excellently brought out in the lively chronicle of the memorable excursion , as , for instance , in this passage : '' Mr.
Muir	PERSON	talks because he ca n't help it , and his talk is good literature ; he writes only because he has to , on occasion ; while Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	writes because he ca n't help it , and talks when he ca n't get out of it .

		Mr.
Muir	PERSON	, the Wanderer , needs a continent to roam in ; while Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	, the Saunterer , needs only a neighborhood or a farm .

		The Wanderer is content to scale mountains ; the Saunterer really climbs the moun - tain after he gets home , as he makes it truly his own only by dreaming over it and writing about it .

		The Wanderer finds writing irksome ; the Saunterer is never so well or so happy as when he can write ; his food nourishes him better , the atmosphere is sweeter , the days are brighter .

		The Wanderer has gathered his harvest from wide fields , just for the gathering ; he has not threshed it out and put it into the bread of litera - ture only a few loaves ; the Saunterer has gathered bis harvest from a rather circumscribed field , but has threshed it out to the last sheaf ; has made many loaves ; and it is because he himself so enjoys writing that his readers find such joy and morning freshness in his books , his own joy being communicated to his reader , as Mr.
Muir	PERSON	's own enthusiasm is communicated to his hearer .

		With Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	, if his field of observa - tion is closely gleaned , he turns aside into subjective fields and philosophizes a thing which Mr.
Muir	PERSON	never does . ''

		Miss
Barrus	PERSON	's closing chapter is devoted to an appreciation of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	as a nature - lover and a writer .

		Classing him with
Gilbert White	PERSON	,
Thoreau	PERSON	, and
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, she not unnaturally finds him greatly superior in some respects to the three others .

		For example : '' Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	puts his reader into close and sym - pathetic communion with the open-air world as no other literary naturalist has done .

		Gilbert White reported with painstaking fidelity the natural history of
Selborne	LOCATION	;
Thoreau	PERSON	gave
Thoreau	PERSON	with glimpses of nature thrown in ;
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, in dreamy , introspective descrip - tions of rare beauty and delicacy , portrayed his own mystical impressions of nature ; but Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	takes us with him to the homes and haunts of the wild creatures , sets us down in their midst , and lets us see and hear and feel just what is going on .

		We read his books and echo Whitman 's verdict on them : ` They take me outdoors !

		God bless outdoors ! '

		And since God has blessed outdoors , we say , ' God bless
John Burroughs	PERSON	for taking us out of doors with him ! ' '

		Of Whitman and of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's in - timacy with and admiration for him , the book has considerable to say , as it also has of other men , famous or obscure , whose lives or writings or personalities have been in some way signifi - cant in the naturalist 's life-history and the ma - turing of his powers .

		The purpose and method of the entire book are well conceived , and the author 's success in bringing before us a very real and living and lovable Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	is worthy of warm praise , even though she must share that praise largely with Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	himself , whose own pen has contributed not the least valuable portions of the volume .

		She writes in a style not unworthy of the master whose manner , admirable for its clearness and simplicity , she so justly commends .

		Good por - traits and views show the naturalist in a number of his favorite haunts , and an unusually full and accurate index makes quickly available any part of the riches which it so handily unlocks .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		INTERVIEW WITH THE MUSE OF HISTORY .

		* Mr.
George Macaulay Trevelyan	PERSON	has pre - pared an interesting book by writing the essay which gives the volume its title , and printing with it a number of articles which have already appeared in various periodicals .

		Of the re - printed pieces , the most notable are those on
George Meredith	PERSON	and `` Poetry and Liberty . ''

		Admirers of
Meredith	ORGANIZATION	will wish to read the former ; while the latter is commended to those who do not realize how far
England	LOCATION	was , dur - ing the period from
1796	DATE	to
1820	DATE	, from pos - * CLIO , A MUSE , and Other Essays , Literary and
Pedes	PERSON	- trian .

		By
George Macaulay Trevelyan	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 337 sessing the freedom which tradition is fond of attributing .

		to her .

		It need scarcely be said that all of the essays are charmingly written .

		The style is clear without being unpleasantly crisp and businesslike ; its leisurely urbanity and relaxing humor are most engaging .

		And this is particularly true of the new essay , '' Clio , a Muse , '' which Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	describes as `` a delicate investigation '' into the nature of history .

		Within fifty years , you must know , there have been `` great changes in the management of Clio 's temple .

		Her inspired bards and prophets have passed away and been succeeded by the priests of an established church ; the vulgar have been excluded from the Court of the Gentiles ; doctrine has been defined ; heretics have been excommunicated ; and the tombs of the aforesaid prophets have been duly blackened by the new hierarchy .

		While these changes were in process the statue was seen to wink an eye . ''

		The Muse , it seems , knew all the time that history could never have a direct practical value like the exact sciences , or ever succeed like them in deducing the laws of cause and effect ; she knew that its chief value must always be educational , its chief business to `` educate the minds of men by causing them to reflect on the past . ''

		A great mistake it was , therefore , for the friends of history to `` proclaim it a ' science ' for specialists , not ' literature ' for the common reader of books . ''

		For while we all share in the benefits of chemistry even if we never read chemistry , we can not profit from history unless we have some acquaintance with it .

		It is true there must be critics and spe - cialists for investigation ; but the final aim must be `` not merely the accumulation and interpretation of facts , but the exposition of these facts in their full emotional and intel - .

		lectual value to a wide public by the difficult art of literature . ''

		This is what the
Muse	ORGANIZATION	meant when she winked .

		The Muse was unquestionably right in wink - ing ; the proof of which is that the `` thought and feeling of the rising generation is but little affected by historians . ''

		The responsibility for this situation , Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	lays to historians themselves ; for when they proclaimed history a science for specialists , not literature for the common reader of books , `` the common reader of books accepted his discharge . ''

		.

		There is truth in this , but are we not likely to be a little deceived by this very term , `` the common reader of books '' ?

		The common reader of books is a much larger class than formerly .

		It is said that
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's history was on all the young ladies ' dressing tables .

		Now , I do not suppose it was really on all of them .

		In any case , fewer young ladies had dressing tables in those days , and I have sometimes wondered how effectively the book in question `` entered into the thought and feeling '' of those who had .

		Thousands of young ladies and young men who nowadays read nothing more weighty than the ``
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post '' would not have read anything at all in
the days of Macaulay	DATE	.

		If , therefore , these young people do not read , I will not say the
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	, but even Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	's fascinating Life of
John Bright	PERSON	, historians can not be held wholly responsible .

		If as great a book as
Macauky	ORGANIZATION	's history should appear to-morrow , these young people would not read it .

		Still , it is undoubtedly true that as able and well written a history as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's , if it should appear to-morrow , would not create a tithe of the interest , or exert anything like the influence upon the thought and feeling of the readers of serious books , that
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's work did in his day ; and not
Macaulay	PERSON	's only , but
Ranke	PERSON	's and
Giesebrecht	ORGANIZATION	's and
Thiers	PERSON	's and
Michelet	PERSON	's and a host of others .

		The truth is that in
Macaulay	LOCATION	's day books on history commanded the interest of thinking people in a way which they no longer do , and the difference is not merely a matter of their being well or ill writ - ten .

		In politics and morals the Revolution unsettled all the old foundations , and after the Napoleonic era men turned to the past with immense enthusiasm in order to rediscover there the principles of ordered social life .

		To reconcile authority and liberty was the primary need ; and when both divine and natural right had failed , historic right seemed the only recourse .

		But in our own day , when we are again , some - what as men were in the eighteenth century , seeking a `` new freedom , '' when we are less intent upon stability and more insistent upon `` social justice , '' the past seems unable to fur - nish us what we want .

		The past seems to be on the side of vested interests .

		Behind the mask of historic right , many people think they can discern the old familiar features of divine right .

		And so the authority of tradition grows as burdensome as the authority of kings .

		If serious people read books on history less than formerly , it is due partly no doubt to the fact that not many are well written ; but it is due quite as much to the fact that the orthodox method of interpretation , surviving from an age when men feared revolution more than they do 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	now , no longer ministers to the rising demand for social regeneration .

		The men who fifty years ago read history are no ^ v reading social philosophy and books on religion .

		Mr.
Ber	PERSON	- nard
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is on all the dressing tables .

		Many there are who prefer
Maeterlinck	PERSON	to
Mommsen	PERSON	.

		The most serious minded read
William James or Bergson	PERSON	, or if not the very works of
Bergson	LOCATION	, at least books which endeavor to explain how with logical precision he denies the validity of intellection .

		Nevertheless , it would be well if more historians wrote as well as Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	; for in that case I am sure they would not lack readers .

		TRAGEDY AND TREASON IN EDUCATION .

		* This age has a habit of asking of itself search - ing questions .

		And it is a most hopeful sign that it also strives , almost agonizingly sometimes , to answer these questions fairly and squarely with intellectual honesty .

		The mere fact that the world is so solicitous in regard to its pathological symptoms offers perfect inherent proof that it has some serious mental ailments .

		The growing interest in the problems of edu - cation has been for some years an out-standing phenomenon .

		So far , many students feel , the science of education has usurped the lime-light too exclusively , while the art of education has suffered comparative neglect .

		Now when the accent , either grave or acute , is placed on science the result is dogmatism ; and dogmatism in education is the most complete and wholesale form of race suicide imaginable .

		Unless edu - cation educes the individual , or , as Professor
James	PERSON	put it , '' organizes resources within the human being , '' it is treason .

		And the betrayal of the children of every generation is inexpres - sibly more disastrous than the betrayal of a nation .

		Those who have felt the stunting power of all the educational and social and religious forces around them which make for dogmatism and who has not ?

		will welcome Mr.
Edmond Holmes	PERSON	's new book entitled `` The Tragedy of Education . ''

		It would not be easy to speak with too great enthusiasm concerning this heart - searching little volume .

		The author , unlike the proverbial spinster who knows all about rearing children , and laymen who lay down the law in various fields , has had long official connection with education , having served indeed as Chief * THE TRAGEDY OF EDUCATION .

England	LOCATION	.

		But , fortunately , his practical contact has not spoiled him for philosophical analysis ; rather it has supplied him with the most pertinent ma - terial for criticism . ''

		Tragedy '' is not too heavy a term for the situation as he depicts it : '' For , with the best intentions , the leading actors in it , the parents and teachers of each successive genera - tion , so bear themselves towards their children and pupils as to entail never-ending calamities on the whole human race not the sensational calamities which dra - matists love to depict , but inward calamities which are the deadlier for their very unobtrusiveness ... such as perverted ideals , debased standards , contracted horizons , externalized aims , self-centered activities , weakened will-power , lowered vitality , restricted and distorted growth , and -LRB- crowning and summarizing the rest -RRB- a profound misconception of the meaning and value of life . ''

		The three chapters of the book , entitled re - spectively `` The Poison of Dogmatism , '' `` The Malady , '' and `` The Remedy , '' differ not so much in material as in emphasis .

		The follow - ing will serve as a brief summary : The adult 's assumption that the child wants toys , prizes , distinctions , and the like is fundamentally wrong .

		Before perverted by education the child simply wants to `` energize and grow . ''

		Dogmatism does , or tends to do , three things , devitalize , vulgarize , and demoralize his life -LRB- the last , by `` substituting drill for self-discipline '' -RRB- .

		The teaching profession is no more responsible for the `` follies and failures '' of education than is the army `` for the horrors and miseries of war . ''

		Society and world-tendencies are the villains .

		Man comes under the law of growth ; education should be '' growth-craft . ''

		Western education is based on distrust of the child -LRB- the '' original sin '' notion -RRB- .

		The teacher is expected to obtrude himself as an ideal , '' what I think , you are to learn to think , '' and so on .

		The child 's weakness is postulated at every turn , and his food peptonized .

		The examination sys - tem fosters show against reality .

		Competition is disastrous . ''

		To invite the child to regard his classmates as rivals instead of as comrades is to do him a great and far - reaching wrong .

		It is to dam back the pure current of unselfish sympathy at or near its source .

		It is to unseal the turbid fountain of vanity , of selfishness , of envy , of jealousy , of strife .

		It is to make the child an egoist , without his consent and almost against his will . ''

		Now for the remedy .

		The child must be given the maximum instead of the minimum of freedom .

		`` The child is born good , '' and can best point the way to its fullest development .

		-LRB- Here is the inestimable service of evolution as against the '' special creation '' theory . -RRB- ''

		There is a potential Christ in every new-born babe .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 339 ... Whatever is born carries with it in em - bryo the perfection of its own generic nature . ''

		Pioneers of the right sort are Dr.
Montessori	PERSON	, Mr.
George	PERSON	and Mr.
Lane	PERSON	of the `` Junior Republic . ''

		and the author 's own character , `` Egeria , '' in his `` Utopian '' school .

		And now what is the teacher to do ?

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	must , of course , not be dogmatic .

		This is the teacher 's task : '' To efface himself as much as possible , to realize that not he , but the child , plays the leading part in the drama of school life ... To provide outlets for his healthy activities ... To place at his disposal such materials as will provide him both with mental and spiritual food ... To do nothing for him which he can reasonably be expected to do for himself .

		... To foster his natural sincerity and keep far away from him whatever savours of make-believe , self-deception , and fraud ... To discourage competition ... To foster the child 's communal instinct , his spirit of com - radeship , his latent capacity for sympathy and love . ''

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	realizes that he is setting a stiff pace for the teacher .

		The good will be unat - tainable for generations , but it is a glorious goal .

		And in straining toward it , the spirit of the teacher will bathe in the fountain of per - petual youth . ''

		The bastard self evolves itself in twenty or thirty or forty years , and then grows old and decrepit .

		If the real self is in a sense our unapproachable ideal , it will keep the soul that strives to realize it everlastingly young .

		Education can but help the evolving life to make a happy start ; but a happy start , as
Plato	ORGANIZATION	says , is the most important stage towards ultimate perfection . ''

		While much of this is not new -LRB- it is of course thoroughly in line with the Montessori methods -RRB- , we believe that it is the most fundamental critique from this point of view so far made .

		The position and experience of the author , moreover , give his utterances impressive weight .

		Others have remarked on this same proselytiz - ing tendency in our own and every age . ''

		We are all deaf men with big voices ; but instead of getting ear-trumpets we get megaphones and proclaim our gospel . ''

		The tendency to prose - lytize is without doubt one of the most persistent and malignant temptations mind is heir to .

		In modification , not objection , two things might be said : First , the good - will in teachers will itself make self-effacement difficult .

		Seeing the young about to fall into the same errors -LRB- in their judgment -RRB- that they have fallen foul of , the natural instinct of love will call forth many hortatory pleadings and injunctions , well-advised and ill-advised , necessary and unnecessary .

		Second , the method of this new evangel has been tried out , not very wisely in most instances , in
America	LOCATION	to a much greater extent than in
England	LOCATION	, and so far not with complete success .

		The dogmatic Froebellian kindergarten laxity has achieved doubtful results .

		Teachers have dogmatized in their handling of the novel methods of freedom .

		The reign of love has in some instances run riot and grown gouty .

		The child is too frequently taught that he is merely to follow his inclination in all things .

		Selfish - ness easily follows ; but it is not so easy to develop reverence or a regard for duty under this `` sweet '' system .

		Of course the warning holds only when the '' sweet '' system is in fool - ish and unskilled hands .

		But the attempt to unseat dogmatism can be made and must be made .

		The challenge comes like a trumpet-call to the teachers .

		They will find their work becoming more subtle and exacting ; in compensation more honorific -LRB- they of course will not expect it to become more remunerative -RRB- .

		They can no longer depend upon a `` chief , '' a `` principal , '' or a `` system , '' and content themselves with oiling the machinery from day to day .

		In order to efface themselves and permit the new generations educational freedom , the teachers will need to become much greater and more potent personalities than ever before ; for they will be on tap , to run where they are needed and to sit tight when they are not needed .

		In short , they must add art to their science .

		If such a race of super-teachers can be developed , teachers who can be trusted to permit the stream of life to develop and swell , ebb and flow , flood and enrich , in accord - ance with the laws of life which we have not yet learned , they will be more truly than ever the highest benefactors of the human race .

		They will be the right hand of providence .

		340 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	could exist .

		His stories , though they exhibit ingenuity and power , tend to the ugly , even the hideous .

		As for his essays , even though they contain his most interesting work , one would certainly not care to give them a place in the tradition of the English essay ; but they are interesting , and it seems worth while to say something about them .

		In style , they are obviously of our own day , which is equivalent to saying that they are not free from the taint of journalism .

		They move nimbly , if not gracefully ; they proceed in a straight line , and disdain embellishment , for the epigrams and paradoxes with which they abound are meant to produce an intellectual shock rather than aesthetic surprise and satis - faction ; they are without leisure and poise and dignity , but they are also honest and direct , free of elaborate posing ; they are at the same time smartly irresponsible and terribly in earnest .

		Here is the style at low ebb : '' It is hardly necessary to remind readers that
Carlyle	PERSON	, the Scotchman who wrote a fine romance about the French Revolution but generally preferred to write in broken German , once devoted a book to the considera - tion of Heroes and Hero - Worshippers . ''

		These are fairer illustrations : '' To-day we are so sure of ourselves that we are prepared to classify miracles as they occur . '' ''

		Our poets have always been underfed , and , in con - sequence , they have given us a great account of life , like the hungry boy who flattens his nose on the cook-shop window and thinks nobly of sausages . ''

		For his style at its best , we must go to his essays on childhood , extracts from which are m given below .

		The burden of all the essays , whether they deal with dreams , or politics , or editors , or gambling , or '' The New Sex , '' is one : that all that is lovely and of good report has drooped and faded away , and that in its stead we have evolved a civilization , or a barbarism , which is the reign of the prosy , the humdrum , the un - spiritual , the ugly .

		The dominant mood in the essays is that of disillusionment , with a nostalgia that accompanies it as its shadow .

		Seeking to predict who , of this era , will receive the plaudits of posterity , he can find only five writers , two painters , and no politicians at all ; it may well be that , '' like the majority of our countrymen , the age to come will esteem professional cricket and football above art , and we may not make so bad a showing after all ! '' ''

		The present-day Englishman is afraid of the big thought , the big emotion , the big love . '' ''

		A cold scepticism is burning the hearts of men and women to ashes of that desire that painted the trees green and the lips of women red , and set the stars moving over all . ''

		Common-sense and reason come in for the usual modern indictment , and fancy and the love of beauty are extolled .

		The following sentence states the issue with candor : '' Sometimes , looking at the sky on a fine night , and remembering how
Coleridge	PERSON	was able to see a star within the horns of the moon , a feat no longer possible to well - informed persons , I wonder whether the next intellectual revolution may not be directed against facts . ''

		In an essay on `` Traitors of Art , '' he sets forth his creed : '' We are born to starve and shiver for a while in the gutters of life and presently we die .

		But beauty is eternal , and it is only by means of our appreciation of beauty that we can bear with our clumsy , rotting bodies while our life lasts .

		All other creeds seem to me for - lorn and self - destructive . ''

		The true attitude toward life ,
Middleton	PERSON	sug - gests , is a combination of that of the Bohemian , who sucks joy from the passing moment ; of the rebel , who hates passionately what is not beau - tiful ; and of the pirate , whose enfranchised spirit breathes diviner air than it is the general lot of mankind to enjoy .


Middleton	PERSON	himself had in his veins what he termed '' priceless piratical blood '' transmitted from an ancestor whose dis - tinction it was to be hanged as a pirate by the Spaniards at
Port Eoyal	LOCATION	.

		Because childhood knows not disillusion , be - cause it is nai 've , and because the child is at once Bohemian , rebel , and pirate ,
Middleton	PERSON	yearned , in his weariness of soul , for '' The Day before
Yesterday	DATE	. ''

		The volume of this title is given up entirely to autobiographic essays , and in - cludes what is perhaps
Middleton	PERSON	's best writing .

		Typical chapters are on '' An Enchanted Place , '' `` The Boy in the Garden , '' `` Street Organs , '' '' On Digging Holes . ''

		To illustrate the quality of these chapters , one need but quote a passage or two at random ; where all is good , it is need - less to seek isolated excellent passages .

		In `` An Enchanted Place , '' he tells of an attic `` mouse-cupboard '' which served sometimes as a cave , of tener as a boat : '' The fact that our cabin lacked portholes and was of an unusual shape did not trouble us .

		We could hear the water bubbling against the ship 's side in a neigh - bouring cistern , and often enough the wind moaned and whistled overhead .

		We had our lockers , our sleeping - berths , and our cabin-table , and at one end of the cabin was hung a rusty old cutlass full of notches ; we would have hated any one who had sought to disturb our illu - sion that these notches had been made in battle .

		When we were stowaways even the mice were of service to us , for we gave them a full roving commission as savage rats , and trembled when we heard them scampering among the cargo . ''

		... If any of us had any money we would carouse

		Jam has been eaten without bread on board the
Black Margaret	ORGANIZATION	, and when we fell across a merchantman laden with a valuable consign - ment of dried apple-rings tough fare but interesting and the savoury sugar out of candied peel , there were boisterous times in her dim cabin .

		We would sing what we imagined to be sea chanties in a doleful voice , and prepare our boarding-pikes for the next adventure , though we had no clear idea what they really were . ''

		Or take this , from `` A Railway Journey '' : '' Then something surprising happened .

		I saw the earth leap up and invade the sky and the sky drop down and blot out the earth , and I felt as though my wings were broken .

		Then the sides of the carriage closed in and squeezed out the door like a pip out of an orange , until there was only a three-cornered gap left .

		The air was full of dust , and I sneezed again and again , but could not find my pocket-handkerchief .

		Presently a young man came and lifted me out through the hole , and seemed very surprised that I was not hurt .

		I realized that there had been an accident , for the train was broken into pieces and the permanent way was very untidy .

		Close at hand I saw the little girl sitting on a bank , and a man kneeling at her feet taking her boots off .

		I would have liked to speak to her , but I remembered how she had refused the offer of my magazines , and was afraid she would snub me again .

		The place was very noisy , for people were calling out , and there was a great sound of steam .

		I noticed that everybody 's face was very white , espe - cially the guard 's , which made his beard seem as black as soot .

		The young man took me by the hand and led me along the uneven ground , and there was so much to see that my feet kept stumbling over things , and he had to hold me up .

		On the way we passed the body of a man lying with a rug over his head .

		I knew that he was dead ; but I had seen drunken men in the streets lie like that , and I could not help looking about for a policeman . ''

		FORT
DEARBORN	LOCATION	AND THE OLD NORTHWEST .

		* Dr.
Quaife	PERSON	's large volume on ''
Chicago	LOCATION	and the Old Northwest '' is divided into two distinct parts : -LRB- 1 -RRB- an Introduction of 125 pages giving a description of the
Chicago Portage	LOCATION	and a sketch of the history of the `` old Northwest '' from the time of the earliest French Explora - tions to the end of the eighteenth century ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- a careful history of
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	and the
Chicago	LOCATION	massacre , written from the sources .

		In some respects , the Introduction is the least satisfactory part of the book .

		It covers more than a century and a quarter of time , * CHICAGO AND THE OLD NORTHWEST , 1673-1835 .

		A Study of the Evolution of the
Northwestern Frontier	ORGANIZATION	, together with a History of
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	.

		By

		Illustrated .


University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		too extensive a period to be treated adequately in so small a space , if the chapters dealing with
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	and the massacre are to be ac - cepted as the standard by which the book shall be judged .

		It seems to us that the author might better have followed one of two definite courses : either he should have given a more condensed treatment of those events most closely connected with the early history of
Chicago	LOCATION	, as introductory to the account which follows ; or these chapters should have been expanded into a more intensive study , a separate volume , perhaps , growing out of the same careful investigation which marks the excellent narrative dealing with
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	.

		The question of perspective , how - ever , is always an open one .

		It must also be said that the Introduction , as it stands , shows too little regard for the sources .

		Beyond doubt the narrative is readable ; but an examination of citations to authorities used in the chapter on '' The Fight for the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, '' for instance , reveals a free use of secondary works , a course which the author does not fol - low in discussing that phase of
Chicago	LOCATION	history in which his chief interest lies .

		Furthermore , what is included in the term `` old Northwest '' is not always clear .

		The au - thor speaks of '' the region tributary to
Chicago	LOCATION	, since known as the old Northwest '' -LRB- p. 79 -RRB- and of `` the old
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, to which
Chicago	LOCATION	belonged '' -LRB- p. 81 -RRB- ; so it seems reasonable to assume that his '' old Northwest '' is more limited in extent than that which is generally understood , and comprises what may be termed the frontier of the
Upper Lakes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Where it becomes neces - sary for the author to widen its limits in order that the reader may more fully understand cer - tain events significant in the evolution of this frontier , he very properly allows himself that privilege .

		What slight confusion may arise con - cerning his use of the term `` old Northwest '' is in all probability due to this fact .

		Dr.
Quaife	PERSON	does his best work in the chapters dealing with
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	and the
Chicago	LOCATION	massacre .

		Here he has reconstructed the his - tory of this period , and there is abundant evidence of his diligent search after the sources , his careful and critical appraisement of their value , his practical sense in their use , and his instinct for the essentials of historical investi - gation .

		He has brought to light much material hitherto unknown , or at least unused , and with patient care and unquestioned skill has sifted this material and built up an account unham - pered by tradition .

		It is a difficult , and not always a pleasant , 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	task to turn the light of historical criticism upon popular tradition , and to bring to the view of readers who have accepted that tradition as authentic the knowledge that in many details it lacks the accuracy demanded of true historical writing .

		This is the task which Dr.
Quaife	PERSON	has found it necessary to undertake .

		In doing it he makes no attempt to suppress evidence , but lays it all before his readers , and in addition gives them the benefit of his own sound scholar - ship for the solution of difficult problems .

		When the work is viewed in the broadest light , the author must be commended for his building ; although here and there in the process of sorting out and weighing materials he has used a direct - ness of method and expression which may not meet with the approval of those who support the accepted tradition .

		In the course of his investigations Dr.
Quaife	PERSON	has been compelled to call into question some of the statements made in '' Wau-Bun , '' the work upon which most writers of the early history of
Chicago	LOCATION	have depended for their accounts of the massacre ; and in the light of new sources he has arrived at conclusions which differ materially from those generally accepted .

		In such cases it appears that he has not been intent upon lessening the glory of any of the participants in those stirring events , but that he has been desirous of stating the events in their true proportion and in gaining for all partici - pants their proper share in whatever glory was won .

		Where , in his estimation , new evidence necessitated a re-statement of an incident , or a series of incidents , he makes that re-statement `` without fear or favor from any source . ''

		In this , however , less positiveness of expression might have been desirable , since it would not have weakened the author 's conclusions and would have precluded the possibility of any charge of contentiousness .

		In recounting the story of the massacre , which he does in a direct and impressive way , free from the rhetorical embellishment which so often leads a writer into inaccuracies of state - ment , Dr.
Quaife	PERSON	has made sure that Captain
Nathan Heald	PERSON	shall receive justice from the pens of future historians .

		In defence of
Captain Heald	ORGANIZATION	, upon whose shoulders it has been custom - ary to heap all the responsibility for the evacua - tion of the fort , is quoted
General Hull	ORGANIZATION	's order .

		It states in language not to be misunderstood that the fort is to be evacuated .

		It leaves no choice to the commandant .

		The order was not `` to evacuate the fort , if practicable '' as has been commonly quoted to the detriment of
Captain Heald	ORGANIZATION	's judgment and his reputation as a sol - dier .

		Dr.
Quaife	PERSON	likewise interests himself in the case of
Isaac Van Voorhis	PERSON	, and by a sym - pathetic interpretation of the scanty information at hand does much towards wiping out the stain of cowardice which has been so long attached to
Van Voorhis	ORGANIZATION	's memory .

		The pathetic and tragic story of the hard - ships and horrors of Indian captivity which befell the survivors of the massacre is told in detail , and with a vividness which almost makes one feel that the victims whose bodies lay on the sand dunes of the
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	shore after the bloody work of the day was over were more fortunate than those who were carried away into captivity by the savages .

		The picture of the dreariness and emptiness of garrison life in the frontier posts is of more than passing interest .

		By his practical handling of this sub - ject the author has removed much of the romance which both pleases and misleads the general reader .

		Three chapters round out the narrative to
1835	DATE	: one treats of the Winnebago and Black Hawk Wars as they affected
Chicago	LOCATION	; another discusses the treaties by which the Indian land titles to northern
Illinois	LOCATION	were extinguished ; and the third gives a suggestive account of the fur-trade of the
Chicago	LOCATION	post .

		This field Dr.
Quaife	PERSON	has not worked exhaustively , as he him - self admits ; but the brevity of his discussion is to be regretted rather than criticised .

		In the appendices , nine in all , may be found material of exceptional interest .

		Some of the documents are given here for the first time in print : Captain
Heald	PERSON	's Journal , which in one brief paragraph tells the events of the fateful day when the garrison of
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	inarched to its doom ;
Darius Heald	PERSON	's Narrative as told to
Lyman C. Draper	PERSON	in
1868	DATE	; and the Muster - Roll of
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	.

		Other documents which have appeared before at different times are given again .

		Of the two appendices which are the author 's own contributions , the one entitled '' Sources of Information for the
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	Massacre '' will prove of the greater interest .

		Here we have a critical appraisement of the source material available for the study of this dramatic episode , as well as a searching analysis of previous accounts .

		The study is an illuminating one , and worthy of the highest com - mendation .

		It will , in all probability , provoke discussion of a more or less earnest nature , but it must be admitted that the author speaks '' as one having authority . ''

		The critical bibliography will be of service to students of the period .

		1914J
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, 343 In a study possessing so many excellent features as this one , it may seem almost hyper - critical to call attention to minor errors .

		Yet some of these will not escape the notice of a careful reader .

		The footnotes , for instance , are not always serviceable .

		On page 58 , one finds the following quotation from
Dubuisson	PERSON	's account of the attack on
Detroit	LOCATION	by the
Fox Indians	ORGANIZATION	in
1712	DATE	: `` In this manner came to an end , Sir , these two wicked nations , who so badly afflicted and troubled all the country ... '' No footnote marks the quotation ; and if the reader wishes to locate it in the source , he must grope through two pages of text and notes to find the citation , and when found it is so indefi - nite that seventeen pages of
Dubuisson	PERSON	's report must be searched before the quotation is exactly located .

		One specific footnote would have saved all this search .

		A note -LRB- p. 316 -RRB- which reads ''
Wisconsin Historical Collections	ORGANIZATION	, narrative of
Hezekiah Cunningham	PERSON	, in ` Fergus Historical Series , ' No. 10 , 47 ff . ''

		must confuse any reader .

		Professor
James	PERSON	's article , '' The Significance of the Attack on
St. Louis	LOCATION	, '' is carelessly quoted -LRB- p. 95 -RRB- as published in the `` Turner Essays in American History . ''

		There are frequent varia - tions in capitalization and punctuation in direct quotations , and in some instances the spelling of words varies from that in the originals .

		Words have been substituted in , and phrases omitted from , direct quotations , without indication of such changes to the reader .

		In no instance , however , does it appear that any change has been made with the desire to modify the evidence .

		Most of these defects , as has already been suggested , occur in the introductory chapters .

		This leads one to surmise that the more careful work on
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	was completed first , and that later the author conceived the plan of expanding this into a narrative of more impres - sive proportions , hence the introductory study of the `` old
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Whatever may be the facts regarding this , Dr.
Quaife	PERSON	has given us a book which is of more than ordinary interest throughout , while in his study of
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	and the
Chicago	LOCATION	massacre he has made a sub - stantial and illuminating contribution to the his - tory of the
West	LOCATION	.

		`` THE SCOTTISH REViEW , `` which was founded in
1882	DATE	but suspended publication in
1900	DATE	, has now been revived for the purpose of supplying the Scottish people at home and beyond the seas with a high-class quarterly periodical of really national aim and significance .

		The first issue of the new series makes a very handsome external appearance , and presents an interesting array of contributions .

		THE MEANING OF AKT .

		* One of the many manifestations of the prag - matic and purely experiential tendency of our culture , is the sort of response to art that is content with '' soul - wandering '' among master - pieces .

		In art , as in life , we do not seek a quiet appreciation and understanding of permanent aspects so much as sensation and - novelty .

		We are forgetting amid the restless changes of fashion that the appreciation of art requires intelligence and discrimination , that a relation exists between thoughtfulness and taste .

		Fortunately , as every age has its adventurous seekers after novelty , so it has also many who aspire to the saving remnant .

		And for those who wish to be students of art as well as tasters , Mr.
Edward Howard Griggs	PERSON	has written an introductory volume .

		The book is a summary of much of the recent literature on the principles of the major fine arts , and the method of treat - ment shows the skill derived from long experi - ence on the platform .

		It is comprehensive , as an introductory book should be , covering such matters as art as an expression and interpreta - tion of human life ; the three forces behind art : the artist , the epoch , and the race ; the meaning and function of sculpture , music , and painting ; the relations of poetry to the other arts ; and other similar subjects .

		Being very readable , and presenting a multi - plicity of ideas , such a book can not fail to stimulate thought .

		A timely application of the law of restraint may be quoted : '' When art attempts to do everything for its audi - ence the effect is tawdry .

		That is one trouble with the theatre to-day .

		The effort by skilful scene painting and other sensational effects to accomplish everything for the jaded senses and sluggish imagination of the spectator , tends to make him sit back in a semi-somnolent fashion merely to be played upon from without ; while the challenge to the actor is almost equally wanting .

		The result is that , with no active cooperation between artist and audience , the characters fail to impress themselves . ''

		But the author has not confined himself to making valuable distinctions .

		There is a great deal of '' inspirational '' interpretation , confes - sions of personal responses to certain famous works of art .

April 16	DATE	might better have been omitted .

		These inter - pretations are , as Mr.
Griggs	PERSON	repeatedly admits , purely personal , depending '' upon what of life and knowledge we bring . ''

		The train of thought suggested by a work of art is not part of its significance , is not expressed by it ; and it is confusing to dwell upon that sort of response in a work dealing professedly with principles .

		Here Miss
Eleanor Rowland	PERSON	's new book is an excellent corrective .

		As a '' humble disciple of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's method '' she has been scientific and objective .

		The aim of the volume is '' to limit the provinces of certain arts , the ideas which these arts , better than any other of man 's creation , can express , and the characteristic mental states that are aroused in appreciating them states which , like the pity and fear of tragedy , must be aroused if an object is to fulfill the demands of its own particular art . ''

		This method is applied to sculpture , painting , music , and such '' minor arts '' as wood-carving and terra-cotta , coins and mosaics , glass-work and metal-work .

		Beginning with the material of each art , the author discusses the nature of this material as a means of art , its peculiar fitness for expressing certain states of mind , and the province which in consequence belongs peculiarly to each art .

		Thus sculpture , its material being stone or bronze , impresses one by its weight and solidity .

		The inherent permanence and dignity of the material rules out as inharmonious the expres - sion of violent and uncontrolled passions or actions ; on the other hand , the apparent triv - iality of situation in much of Greek sculpture nevertheless affects us like grandeur . ''

		The lack of occupation in these figures abashes us as no reproof for inaction has ever done , and our separate restless efforts to understand , to in - vestigate , to be well informed all these praise - worthy anxieties lose their customary respectable footing , and take on a reversed color of contempt .

		Our activity becomes shamefaced before an idle boy in stone who plays with an apple ! ''

		As the material of sculpture is heavy , still - life is not available for its purpose , except in reliefs ; for the stone must be made to express life .

		The idea , on the other hand , must not be too animated , but must exhibit `` just enough of liveliness to spiritualize its mass , without quarreling with it . ''

		Sculpture , being more than any other art the expression of restraint , is the most classic of the arts .

		It emphasizes least the individual variation ; it is , in its essence , `` the art expressive of typical values . ''

		Its message is '' the absolute dignity of life as such .

		Man himself is more than anything he does .

		Our separate actions are , after all , two - thirds fussiness ; and the superb dignity of these sculptured maidens who clasp a belt or bind a sandal , the repose of those serene athletes who stand or bend so easily , and who refuse to commit themselves to more , is an eternal proud assertion that life itself , not its pursuits , is the greatest reality . ''

		The same illuminating method is pursued through the chapters on the other arts , until one comes to realize that the `` Aristotelian method '' not only informs us , but performs the high service of disciplining the taste .

		Perhaps the last chapter , on `` Art and Na - ture , '' suggests a limitation of the analytical method .

		This chapter is an attempt to show the naturalness of art .

		`` Art is the great sen - sitive intelligence .

		Science tells us what things were , and what they shall be ; but art tells us what they are . ''

		While this observation may be wholly true , it does not appear central .

		For art is distinguished from nature precisely by its art , which means its consistency and complete - ness .

		Art , amid every disorder and ugliness and incompleteness , is '' the world 's sweet inn from pain and wearisome turmoil , '' where the spirit finds rest and nourishment as well as satisfaction .

		In the strength and poise which art gives , as also nature when appreciated as beautiful , is to be found the essential aesthetic appeal .

		And this vision of beauty is not won by drawing distinctions after the Aristotelian manner , but it belongs to the idealism of the complementary Platonic tradition .

		To preserve intact this sense of beauty is one of the most difficult problems of culture .

		There are those who do not consider beauty sufficient in itself to merit serious attention , and who therefore seek some external purpose by which to justify it , such as its morality or its social efficacy .

		There are others who isolate it from every other department of life , and become aesthetes and decadents .

		M.
Paul Gaultier	PERSON	, whose little book on '' The Meaning of Art '' is now translated for us , has tried to rescue the true art experience from these false or partial modes of comprehending it ; and it is only to echo European praise to say that .

		bis volume is brilliant and significant .

		Dedicated to
M. Berg	PERSON	- son , the book belongs with the anti-intellectualist movement .

		In the appreciation of art the first and last thing is sensibility and sympathy .

		The beautiful , this is his main thesis , is aesthetic emotion and therefore subjective in its origin .

		This emotion is communicated by being object -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 345 ified in the arts , and the sympathetic observer of these again recreates in himself the emotion first experienced by the artist .

		But this is not to say that art is not concerned with intellectual matters .


M. Gaultier	PERSON	discusses sanely and thoroughly the moral and social value of art , admitting its unsocial developments , marking its limitations , asserting the disinter - estedness of art , and yet boldly insisting on its essential harmony with the moral and social life .

		For disinterestedness is essential to art ; and because we are enchanted by art and lifted by it to the plane of disinterestedness , we are lib - erated from selfishness , narrowness , and preju - dice , the great foes of morality .

		Likewise , as it is always sympathetic , art is social and useful to the progress of societies .

		But these moral and social values of art are only incidental .


M. Gaultier	PERSON	nowhere lets the reader doubt that beauty is its all-sufficient and only legitimate aim .

		The role of intellectual analysis is subordinated : '' There is no true art criticism except that which strives to understand , and to make understood and valued , the degree of art or of beauty which aesthetic works possess .

		Furthermore , since beauty is essentially emo - tional , it can be appreciated and judged , as
Kant	PERSON	pointed out in his ' Critique of the Judg - ment , ' only through the aesthetic emotion which it arouses in us .

		The only true criticism of art , then , is felt . ''

		But in the service of this sympathy , to keep it from lapsing into mere impressionism , the intelligence can distinguish beautiful works by the presence or absence of certain exterior masks , such as harmony and unity ; it is even possible to discuss tastes and preferences and to establish a basis of normal sensibility from which to judge them .

		And , of course , '' the ideas , the moral and social tenden - cies , for which art often serves as a vehicle , apart from its own inherent quality , '' are subject to examination by the intelligence .

		Learning and scholarship may thus be informing and illu - minating to the sensibility , they may fortify and justify it .

		But in spite of these resources , art criticism depends at last mainly upon the per - sonality of the critic , upon his sympathy with the beautiful .

		Works of art may reveal their whole power to the simple-minded but sensitive , while their secrets may remain hidden from the learned ; '' because historical knowledge explains the work of art in another way than by itself ; it can not aid us in penetrating to its secret and living soul . ''

		The inconclusiveness of this position is per - haps its great recommendation .

		We can not live by the intelligence alone , nor by the sensibility alone ; we must choose the middle way .

		It is the part of wisdom to understand the role of sensibility and the several roles of the intelli - gence , and permit each to play its part .


M. Gaultier	PERSON	's book presents in an excellent manner their complex interrelations , and by his delicacy , clarity , and sense , is saved from both dogmatism and impressionism .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		An addition Considering the vast amount of to Chaucerian Chaucerian comment and criticism criticism , ; by 8c holars and laymen through five centuries , it would be a notable achievement for anyone to find anything fundamental and new to say about the past .

		Yet Mr.
William George Dodd	PERSON	has recently accomplished something of the sort in his book entitled `` Courtly Love in Chaucer and Gower '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		Though there is nothing sensational or indeed unusual in the style or con - tents of the volume , the conclusion contains some - thing of an iconoclasm .

		If Mr.
Dodd	PERSON	's thesis is true , then
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	is much less humorous than we had supposed .

		Instead of assuming that it is impos - sible to fathom , much less exceed , his gentle irony , we must be on guard lest we read satire into the dullest conventions .

		In Chaucer 's most character - istic poems , such as `` Troilus and Criseyde , '' the `` Parliament of Fowls , '' the `` Legend of Good Women , '' `` The Knight 's Tale '' of
Palamon	LOCATION	and Arcite , even in `` The Nunnes Priests ' Tale '' of Chanticleer and Pertelote , that is , wherever Chaucer touches upon the courtly element in love , we are to believe that he was following in plan the most approved conventions , and that he did not question their validity any more , let us say , than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	questioned the social or political ideas of his time .

		The establishment of this thesis was by no means the author 's main purpose in writing his book ; but nevertheless it is the most interesting thing he has done , or nearly done .

		The first chapter traces the origin of the system of courtly love from the troubadours of the eleventh century , in the south of
France	LOCATION	.

		Two books contain its prin - ciples : the `` Conte de la Charrette '' by
Chretien de Troies	ORGANIZATION	, and `` De Arte Honest Amandi '' by
Andreas Capellanus	PERSON	.

		The remainder of the book takes up in order the `` Romance of the Rose '' and other early French erotic poems ,
Gower	PERSON	's `` Con - fessio Amantis , '' and
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's poems already men - tioned , so far as they treat of courtly love .

		The method followed , pointing out the same conventions in setting and character of lady and lover as each new poem is named , grows very tedious ; but that it bears out well the author 's purpose can hardly be denied .

		The handling of `` Troilus and Criseyde , ''
Chaucer	PERSON	's great dramatic poem , is especially good ; the characterization of Criseyde -LRB- pp. 154-178 -RRB- is 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	in our judgment the most satisfactory that has yet been made of that baffling young woman .

		The comparison of
Boccaccio	PERSON	's `` Teseide , ''
Chaucer	PERSON	's original , with `` The Knight 's Tale , '' is also of value and interest to the student .

		It must be said that the narrow range renders it impossible for this book to create strong certitudes .

		It raises some questions in our minds ; but , strictly speaking , answers none .

		In handling the large inquiry as to whether
Chaucer	PERSON	's treatment of love is conventional or shot with satire , very many sources of evidence which this writer deems out of his sphere must be evoked .

		Among other queries , it would be interesting to seek the bearing of that most curious of all facts in the Chaucer psychology : the recanting of his best books at the conclusion of that work of supererogation ^ `` The
Parson	ORGANIZATION	's Tale . ''

		New textbooks Of making many books on the short for studying story there is just now no end .

		One the short story .

		of the i atest -RRB- T h e Modern Short - Story '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Lucy Lilian Notestein	PERSON	in collaboration with Mr.
Waldo Hilary Dunn	PERSON	, is an attempt to extract what is genuinely valuable from the mass of recent theory and comment , and to present it in a form useful for classes and self - taught students .

		That the work gives generous citations from other authorities is a proof of honesty rather than of any lack of originality .

		The treat - ment shows some of the limitations which are usual in a book that is based on the instructional method of one teacher ; and as a textbook it suffers some - what from slight indistinctness of plan , which is made worse by the habit of printing illustrative extracts in the same type as the text .

		With all its minor defects it is , however , a pleasingly sane and judicious manual , full of sound theory and good illustrative criticism .

		Miss
Margaret Ashmun	PERSON	's `` Modern Short-Stories '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is another of the many collections of short stories , with Intro - duction , Bibliographical and Biographical Notes , and a list of more stories in the Appendix .

		The choice of stories reflects the present interest in
Continental	ORGANIZATION	writers , nine out of twenty-one items being translations .

		At the same time , up-to-date American methods are shown in selections from Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	, Mr.
William Allen White	PERSON	, and others .

		The Introduction contains carefully-wrought brief essays on `` The Technique of the Short-Story '' and `` The Short-Story in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Unfortunately the biographical and bibliographical notes are thrown together in the careless fashion that characterizes so much American editing .

		Ex - amples of easily corrected errors are the wrong date for `` The Scarlet Letter '' -LRB- p. 258 -RRB- , and the strange statement that
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	enlisted as a private in the Civil War -LRB- p. 198 -RRB- .

		Unless
Miss Ashmun	PERSON	has data not known to recent biographers of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, the statements regarding the composition of ``
Berenice	PERSON	, '' and other `` Tales of the Folio Club '' -LRB- pp .

		xxv. , 11 -RRB- are mere conjectures given as facts .

		Repeated assertions regarding
Poe	PERSON	's indebtedness to
Hoffmann	PERSON	are given with no hint that scholars differ regarding the whole question of German influence on
Poe	PERSON	.

		All these are unessential matters , and the book might not suffer much if the bio - graphical sketches were entirely omitted ; but it is time American teachers demanded that textbooks should be edited with reasonable accuracy or not at all .

		Doubters of the actuality of Mr. Two months i 11 i alone with
Joseph Knowles	PERSON	s alleged experiences nature .

		during his two months of solitude in the
Maine	LOCATION	woods , which he entered without clothing or other equipment on the fourth of
last August	DATE	, and whence he emerged in a suit of skins and in hardy physical condition on the fourth of
October	DATE	, should read the convincing narrative of this experi - ment in primitive living `` Alone in the
Wilder	PERSON	- ness '' written subsequently by himself and illus - trated from drawings made by him in the woods with birch bark and charred sticks for his materials , and also from photographs taken before and after the events described .

		Of course his exploit was in the nature of a `` stunt , '' with the betting odds de - cidedly against success in his proposed undertaking .

		But the agencies that were expected to defeat him , cold and hunger and other bodily hardships , proved to be the least of the obstacles encountered .

		It was the want of human intercourse in those sylvan solitudes that came nearest to breaking the back - bone of his resolution .

		How he devised occupation to keep his mind in some sort of tone , and all the wonders of the woodland world that revealed them - selves to him , with much else that is to be read both in and between the lines of his narrative , make a story of rare interest , a
Robinson Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	tale of real life .

		With an excess of modesty he insists that what he did was no more than any man in normal health could have accomplished .

		On the contrary , few men have both Mr.
Knowles	PERSON	's skill in woodcraft and his varied previous experience of roughing it under divers sorts of trying conditions .

		With the enthu - siasm born of his recent success in a hazardous venture , he now plans to establish a colony on a government tract of land , if he can obtain it , to lead a wholesome outdoor life , near to nature 's heart ; and he also proposes , in order to convince the skeptics who at present question the truth of his narrative , to repeat the experiment in the near future , with `` a dozen representative men '' as witnesses .

		Mr.
Knowles	PERSON	, artist , trapper , hermit , naturalist , social reformer , and writer , possesses elements of uncon - scious picturesqueness and simple charm that can not fail to endear him to a wide circle of readers .

		-LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Tr ... Mr.
Clare Jerrold	PERSON	, who last year
Queen Victoria	PERSON	, , rrt \ - at i and the published a volume on `` The Early Prince Consort .

		C our t o f
Queen Victoria	PERSON	, '' has con - tinued his studies of royalty with a book devoted to `` The Married Life of Queen Victoria '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		This new work covers the period from the Queen 's marriage in
1840	DATE	to the death of the Prince Consort
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 347 in
1861	DATE	; it is an intimate account of life at
Windsor	LOCATION	and
Buckingham	LOCATION	, and is chiefly devoted to domestic matters , though several chapters are included which deal particularly with the attitude of the royal couple toward the great international problems of their time .

		The author apparently came to his task with a deep appreciation of the worth and virtues of the monarch whom he calls
Victoria	PERSON	-
Albert	LOCATION	; but this appreciation seems to have declined as the study became more intensive .

		He finds that while Prince
Albert	PERSON	was doubtless a most excellent man in many respects , he was narrow and priggish , and that his unpopularity had a more real basis than his German ancestry .

		He came to
England	LOCATION	to teach the English aristocracy certain lessons in virtuous conduct , and the rather complaisant Englishman resented both the purpose and the methods employed .

		The Queen is viewed in a similar light ; she had her strong points , but was , after all , a rather ordinary woman .

		Her taste in dress was not as highly cultivated as we should expect : on the morning of the Prince 's installation as chancellor of
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, she drove through that city `` wearing a claret-coloured silk gown striped with black , an amber-coloured Indian shawl embroidered with a wreath of flowers , and a bonnet of lilac-coloured silk covered with lace and ornamented with flowers .

		A mixture of colours so bizarre that criticism fails . ''

		The author tells us that he began his study with strongprejudices against Lord
Palmerston	LOCATION	, but soon came to see that he alone of all the English statesmen of the time was equal to the task assigned , that his policies were such as the safety and strength of
Britain	LOCATION	demanded , and that in his conflict with
Victoria	PERSON	-
Albert	PERSON	he was always in the right .

		Like all of Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's writings , the book is gossippy and anecdotal ; but the account is '' interesting throughout , and has its value in that it deals more freely in criticism than has been the custom of earlier writers on the same subject .

		The work contains a number of excellent illustrations , chiefly portraits ; among these the author has included a reproduction of one of the Queen 's own etchings , which , though not great as a work of art , shows that
Victoria	PERSON	was not wholly wanting in artistic ability .

		Memorietof Mr .

		8 - T - * /
O'Connor	PERSON	, whose long a Southern residence in
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	may make others -LRB- but not herself -RRB- forget that she is an American , a Southerner , by birth , revives many of her early memories of the home-land in a book packed with personal anecdote and appropriately entitled , '' My Beloved South '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Not unlike Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	's retro - spective volume of a few years ago -LRB- u Recollections , Grave and Gay '' -RRB- , it presents in most attractive form the chivalry and romance , with a touch also of the pathos , of the Old South so famous in song and story ; and it also deals instructively , here and there , with more recent conditions in that part of our country , as in the chapter entitled `` A Present - Day Plantation , '' a pendant to her earlier sketch of '' An Old-Time Plantation , '' in the same book .

		Other chapters treat lightly and entertainingly of
Charles	PERSON	- ton ,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Savannah	LOCATION	,
New Orleans	LOCATION	, the
Suwanee River	LOCATION	, the mules of
Georgia	LOCATION	, the romance of a Russian Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	-LRB- the scene of which is laid partly in
New Orleans	LOCATION	-RRB- , the '' conquering pioneer , '' the picturesque figure of
Sam Houston	PERSON	, and similar themes .

		The writer ventures the un - qualified assertion that '' the best blood of
America	LOCATION	is in
Texas	LOCATION	, '' which of course is likely to raise the temperature of the blood in every other State .

		She also informs us that , by a wise provision of nature , '' after the Civil War all the babies born in the South were boys .

		It was impossible for mothers who longed for them , to produce girls , ... '' In speak - ing of herself she says : '' The one satisfactory thing in my shorn and unsatisfactory life is that I was born a Southern woman .

		I love the South and everything in it .

		I could be , if I allowed myself , rigid and narrow , but I just open my heart and wo n't be . '' ''

		I have known very charming , agree - able , and generous Yankees , '' she magnanimously acknowledges .

		Sir Thomas In his book > '' The Greatest House More 's house at Chelsey '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , Mr.
Randall	PERSON	at

		Davies deals with a most attractive theme .

		It is to this historic building , now repre - sented by a mere fragment , that
Erasmus	PERSON	refers in - the letter known to many readers : `` More hatb built near
London	LOCATION	upon the Thames side a commo - dious house , neither mean nor subject to envy , yet magnificent enough ; there he converseth with his family , his wife , his son , and daughter-in-law , his three daughters and their husbands , with eleven grandchildren .

		There is not any man so loving to his children as he ; and he loveth his old wife as well as if she were a young maid ; and such is the excellency of his temper that whatsoever happeneth that could not be helped , he loveth it as if nothing could happen more happily .

		... '' One is tempted to quote still more of this vivid description of a lovable man in the bosom of his family , a tempta - tion to which Mr.
Davies	PERSON	wisely yields .

		The famous house , built by More in
1520	DATE	, and enlarged or rebuilt by Sir
Robert Cecil	PERSON	in
1597	DATE	, was successively owned by fourteen men of eminence , beginning with More and ending with Sir
Hans Sloane	PERSON	, and includ - ing , besides
Cecil	PERSON	,
Lord Burghley	PERSON	, the great and the lesser
Dukes of Buckingham	ORGANIZATION	, the Earl of Bris - tol , and the
Duke of Beaufort	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` With such company as this , '' says the author , `` the reader need never fear to be dull ; and lest the author should be , he has preferred wherever possible to let the past speak for itself , and to transcribe freely from the contem - porary writers in each period . ''

		From unpublished letters and other not easily accessible material , Mr.
Davies	PERSON	selects passages bearing upon the characters and the scene of his historical drama , if one may so name it ; and he adds eighteen illustrations , of which the
Holbein	PERSON	portraits are the most noteworthy .

		`` Psychology in Daily Life , '' by Professor
C. E. Seashore	PERSON	of the Uni - versity of
Iowa	LOCATION	, is the first volume in the '' Conduct of Mind Series '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , whose purpose is `` to provide readily intelligible surveys of selected aspects of the study of mind and its applications . ''

		The series , as well as the initial volume , expresses a dominant tendency in current psychology .

		The infant stage of a science is a period of theoretical and experimental orientation ; the adolescent stage is a period of rapidly widening interests and applications to practical affairs ; the adult stage is a period of more or less settled facts and confident progress .

		Psychology has reached the stage in which applications abound , and contacts with other and practical interests are profitable .

		The boundaries of the science have sufficiently expanded to make such advances useful and safe under competent direction .

		There has recently been much writing on applied phases of psychology .

		Some of this literature is genuinely scientific , some is purely or even crudely commonplace , and some is pseudo-scientific .

		`` Psychology in Daily Life '' be - longs to the first class .

		It is popular yet thoroughly authoritative ; it is non-technical yet scientifically conservative .

		It is the mature outgrowth of broad psychological knowledge and keen insight into the varied and subtle ways of human behavior .

		The scope of the book is indicated by the topics treated : Play ,
Serviceable Memory	ORGANIZATION	,
Mental Efficiency	ORGANIZATION	, Men - tal Health , Mental Law , Law in Illusion ,
Mental Measurement	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each chapter is a clear statement of facts and of the practical suggestions which they support .

		Teachers , business men , ministers , pro- fessional men , in fact all intelligent readers , will find the book at once interesting and profitable .

		It will tend to give the reader a more balanced insight into the motives and a more rational control of conduct .

		The volume augurs well for the future of the series , and deserves a wide circle of readers .

		Judicial power Curing the
last five or six years	DATE	there over legislation has been an extensive output of liter - in
America	LOCATION	.

		ature dealing with the American judiciary , books , pamphlets , magazine articles , and addresses before bar associations .

		Much of this liter - ature has been devoted to criticism of the courts , : and especially of their power to declare acts of the legislature unconstitutional .

		American courts have exercised this power since the Revolution , and for the most part their right to do so has gone unques - tioned .

		Recently , however , the freedom with which the power has been exercised in some States , espe - cially to nullify advanced social legislation , has led to a widespread belief that the courts are usurping functions that do not properly belong to them , that they are standing in the way of social progress , and that they are out of touch with modern economic and social conditions .

		Naturally , much of the liter - ature which deals with this question is controversial in character ; but there have been some notable exceptions , the most recent of which is Professor
Charles G. Haines	PERSON	's '' The American Doctrine of Judicial Supremacy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author attempts to review the origin and development of the practice of judicial control over legislation in this country , from colonial times to the present .

		He traces the origin of judicial power over legislation from the ancient and mediaeval law of nature , from
Coke	ORGANIZATION	's theory of the supremacy of the common law courts , and from American colonial precedents , to its emergence in the nineteenth century as a fully recognized principle of our constitutional law .

		He reviews the early opposition which the doctrine en - countered , and the recent outpouring of criticism by socialists , progressives , sociological writers , and even judges themselves .

		It is safe to say that no treatise has yet appeared which deals with the subject in a spirit characterized by so much impartiality , scholarship , and breadth of view .

		English and Dr '
James Douglas	PERSON	, in his study of French colonies ``
New England	LOCATION	and
New France	LOCATION	'' in
America	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Putnam -RRB- , makes an attempt , and on the whole a very satisfactory one , to describe and contrast the spirit of the two colonies in the seven - teenth century .

		In doing so , he depends mainly upon the evidence of contemporary documents , and quotes extensively from such narratives as the Journals of
Bradford	PERSON	and Winthrop for New En - gland and
Champlain	LOCATION	's History and the Jesuit Rela - tions for
New France	LOCATION	.

		He has apparently not made any serious attempt to utilize the stores of unpublished documents in the national and state archives , the libraries of historical societies and other institutions , but has made effective use of those sources available in print .

		This material is familiar to students of the period ; but it has not hitherto been brought together for the purpose of a compre - hensive survey of the rival colonies .

		Dr.
Douglas	PERSON	discusses the colonial administrations of
New France	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	, their jealousies and conflicting interests , the status of women , slavery , education , the French and Puritan missions , superstitions , and other minor topics .

		Two of the earlier chapters are devoted to a useful summary of documentary sources .

		An admirable '' The better the b k ' the brief er the handbook on praise . ''

		These words of an honored Greek Art .

		editorial friend simply insist on being placed at the beginning of this notice of Professor
Percy Gardner	PERSON	's `` Principles of Greek Art '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		Some nine years ago the same pen gave us a modest but welcome volume called `` A Gram - mar of Greek Art , '' which was intended to set forth the leading principles of sculpture , painting , archi - tecture , and so forth , that could be traced in the surviving monuments of ancient Hellas .

		The pres - ent work only claims to be an enlargement of the
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 349 '' Grammar '' ; but the corrections and additions make the revision distinctly more valuable , so that the rather ambitious title is amply justified .

		The treat - ment is sane , scholarly , and enjoyable from begin - ning to end ; and we can recommend the book most cordially .

		With it Professor
Gardner	PERSON	has rendered a substantial service to a cause that is dear to the heart of every man who persists in believing that the legacy of Hellas to the modern world is so sig - nificant and so potentially glorious that life might be made better and brighter by a wider appreciation of an inheritance that we seem prone to underrate and neglect .

		After this general commendation we must content ourselves with saying that the twenty - one chapters include the fundamental topics nat - urally implied by the title of the volume ; that the hundred and twelve illustrations are adequate , and wisely chosen ; and that when one differs from the author it behooves one to be very sure of his ground .

		In a last word , we are glad to note that the typog - raphy is excellent , and that the general effect of the volume is pleasing in its simplicity .

		Those who are curious to know what It name interesting associations may have gathered about their own surnames should consult Professor
Ernest Weekley	PERSON	's curiously erudite volume on `` The Romance of Names '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , a work comparable in importance with
Bardsley	PERSON	's '' Dictionary of English Surnames , '' and probably more nearly free from hazardous etymo - logical conjecture .

		With the
London	LOCATION	Directory as a source from which to draw a supply of English surnames , the author has grouped under twenty - three chapter-headings scholarly discussions of three thousand five hundred or more current names , with an index at the end ; and as most surnames have various forms -LRB- for example , Gardener ,
Gardiner	PERSON	,

Gardenier	PERSON	, etc. -RRB- , the book may be said to deal with twice or thrice the number of names in the index .

		Why the author assigns one chapter to `` occupative names '' and another to `` trades and crafts , '' both treating of names having a similar character , is not clear .

		Chaucer , whose writings date from the period when English surnames began to be hereditary , is aptly quoted , wherever possible , by Professor
Weekley	PERSON	.

		His present work , rich in matter though it is , appears to be but a preliminary study to a far more comprehensive '' Dictionary of English Surnames '' which he has in preparation .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The leading characters in fifteen famous novels are briefly but vividly presented in Dr.
H. G. Pillsbury	PERSON	's '' Figures Famed in Fiction '' -LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Cp	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		, which is designed for those too busy to find time for the complete romances thus , in a sense , epitomized , and also for those who wish to renew , in a few short readings , their acquaintance with these masterpieces .

		Not all the novels selected are of the first rank , natu - rally enough , but all are deservedly popular , and the compiler has shown skill in extracting the best and the most characteristic elements from these various works .

		From
Victor Hugo	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	,
Blackmore	PERSON	and
George Macdonald	PERSON	,
Miss Mulock	LOCATION	and Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, to
John Habberton	PERSON	and
Ada Ellen Bayley	PERSON	, he interprets his chosen authors sympathetically and reproduces as much as possible of their own language .

		The vicissitudes of a travelling showman 's life `` a showman from the day of my birth up to , and including , the present time , '' the author calls himself are briskly and cheerily narrated by Mr.
J. H. Taylor	PERSON	in his book , ``
Joe Taylor	PERSON	, Barnstormer '' -LRB-
Jenkins	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Disclaiming , in the first line of his preface , any literary merit in his chronicle , be ingratiates himself at once with his readers by the frankness and good humor of his autobiographic memories and anecdotes .

		The clever cartoonist known by his signature as '' Ripley '' furnishes some amusing illustrations for the book .

		Two volumes of minor writings by the late
William Graham Sumner	PERSON	of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	have been collected and edited by Professor
A. G. Keller	PERSON	, under the titles of '' War and Other Essays '' and '' Earth Hunger and Other Essays '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Of the papers here brought together , the greater part have been printed elsewhere , either in periodicals or in earlier volumes by
Sumner	ORGANIZATION	.

		They range in length from forty pages to five or six pages each , and the time of their composition extends from
1880	DATE	to
1909	DATE	, the last year of
Sumner	ORGANIZATION	's active writing .

		To the first volume Pro- fessor
Keller	PERSON	contributes an Introduction in the form of a sketch of Sumner , written with the warm glow of an intense personal devotion .

		Much of this material , Professor
Keller	PERSON	tells us , was to have been worked by
Sumner	ORGANIZATION	into a large book on '' The Science of Society , '' which he did not live to finish .

		Like all of Sumner 's writings , these essays , though many are only fragments , reveal the virility of the man , his intellectual honesty , and his fearlessness of expression .

		In '' War and Other Essays '' is included a bibliography of
Sumner	ORGANIZATION	's writ - ings , while in the other volume is reproduced a brief autobiography written by
Sumner	ORGANIZATION	in
1903	DATE	.

		There are frontispiece portraits ; but neither volume is indexed .

		Something over seventeen years ago there appeared in '' The Century Magazine '' a contribution from the pen of
W. J. Stillman	PERSON	entitled ``
Billy	PERSON	and Hans : My Squirrel Friends . ''

		It aroused widespread interest , and was later published in
England	LOCATION	as a booklet , revised and somewhat enlarged .

		Now , at last , it is made avail - able to American readers , in an edition published by Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	.

		We doubt if a more appeal - ing and sympathetic record of animal life has ever been written .

		It is indeed a classic in its kind .

		Similar in subject as in title is Mrs.
Maud Thornhill Porter	PERSON	's `` Billy : The True Story of a Canary Bird , '' which Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	has also just reprinted .

		Though lacking the grace of style and depth of insight shown in Mr.
Still	PERSON	- man 's narrative , this is nevertheless a charming bit of writing , which will be enjoyed by every lover of birds .

		Completing Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's output for this season is '' Books and the Quiet Life , '' a thin volume of selections from
Gissing	PERSON	's '' Private Papers of
Henry Ryecroft	PERSON	. ''

		Literature to
Gissing	PERSON	was an absorbing passion , and in these random thoughts about books and reading he falls little below the charm of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and
Hazlitt	PERSON	and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	in their writings on the same subject .

		As always with Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's books , the external form given these three little volumes is fitting and delightful .

		Each is printed on handmade paper , and bound in decorated board covers .

Ulysses S. Grant	PERSON	will complete the excellent series of '' American Crisis Biographies '' which has been in course of publication for several years past under the capable editorship of Dr.

Edward Payson Morton	PERSON	, whose death occurred in
Chicago	LOCATION	on the 2d of this month , was a scholar of wide interests , and one of the foremost authorities upon the study of English versification .

		For several years past he had been a valued member of THE DIAL 'S reviewing staff .

		He was born in
St. Louis	LOCATION	in
1869	DATE	, was graduated at
Illinois College	ORGANIZATION	in
1890	DATE	, and took the degrees of
A.B.	LOCATION	, nd A.M. at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1892	DATE	and
1893	DATE	, and Ph.D. at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	in
1910	DATE	.

		He was Professor of English at
Blackburn University	ORGANIZATION	, 1894-5 , Instructor and Assistant Professor at
Indiana University	ORGANIZATION	, 1895-1908 , and Professor at
Wake Forest College	ORGANIZATION	, 1910-11 .

		In
1911	DATE	he settled in
Chicago	LOCATION	, devoting himself to miscellaneous writing and editorial work .

		During the laborious life of an English teacher he found time to edit numerous books for students , his latest publications of this kind being a series of little volumes sketching the history , legends , and commercial growth of the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Ainsworth :
Chicago	LOCATION	, 1913-14 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Morton	PERSON	's chief interest , however , lay in the fields of metrics and bibliography .

		On these subjects he was a frequent contributor to philological and other journals .

		His articles on the Sonnet , in the '' Publications of the
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	'' and elsewhere , and on the Spenserian Stanza , in '' Modern Philology , '' and his treatise on '' The Technique of English Non-Dramatic Blank Verse '' -LRB- Donnelley :
Chicago	LOCATION	,
1911	DATE	-RRB- , were distinct contributions to metrical history .

		At the time of his death he had made considerable progress with a much-needed set of
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 351 '' Chronological Outlines of English Literature , '' fuller and more accurate than those now available .

		It is a matter of regret that more of - his time could not have been given to the bibliographical investigation for which he was so markedly qualified .

		The fact is humiliating , that as yet in
America	LOCATION	work of this kind , so funda - mentally important to scholarship , can he done only incidentally , by men who are supporting themselves in other ways .

FRANCIS FISHER BROWNE	PERSON	Compiler of '' Golden Poems , '' `` Bugle Echoes : Poems of the Civil War , '' `` Laurel-Crowned Verse '' etc. .

		^ ir ^ HIS biography of Lincoln brings the man , not the tradition , A very near to us .

		It is Lincoln as his friends and daily associates knew him what he said to them , how he looked and acted while saying it anecdotes and stories by the hundred , all woven into a continuous narrative which holds the reader like a book of fiction .

		`` There need be no hesitation in pronouncing this one of the best biographies in existence . ''

		The Review of Reviews . ''

		It would be hard to name anything in
Lincoln	LOCATION	literature giving in popular form so sound and personal a picture of Lincoln the man . ''

		He then proceeds to show how the energy generated by this falling movement is , in the wise economy of Nature , applied by her in the opera - tion of that wonderful machine , the solar system : how it rotates the sun and planets , orbitally and axially ; how it causes the precession of the equinoxes ; how it affects the position of the solar apex and the apparent movement of stars and star-streams ; how it turns to account the gyro - scopic reaction , from east to west , of our system , whose members all revolve contrawise among themselves ; and , finally , how it produces the secular acceleration of the moon and reconciles that apparent discrepancy with the law of the inverse square .

		In brief , the book presents an altogether new and complete SYSTEM OF COSMOLOGY , based solely upon the dynamical principle of UNIVEKSAL gravitation , in the unrestricted sense .

		NEW BOOKS ... 393 DOGBERRY 'S LATEST .

		We have frequently been impelled to voice our opinion of the tax upon knowledge which , in the form of a duty upon English books , affords a standing indication of our national unwillingness to move into the ranks of the civilized countries .

		The principle involved is one that can not be defended without blushing , and its continued statutory assertion is nothing less than a national disgrace .

		We had hoped that the wicked practice would be altogether abandoned by the administration of President
Wilson	PERSON	, but all that we got was a beggarly ten per cent measure of relief , and the new tariff still sheltered the principle of the old iniquity .

		Our present discussion is , however , not con - cerned with the principle itself , but with certain recent administrative rulings that are utterly repugnant to common sense , and that reveal the figure of Dogberry still firmly in possession of the seat of custom .

		The Dogberry type of officialism can make a mockery of any law , and never has it done so more conspicuously than in the present case of its attitude toward the publisher who arranges for the simultaneous issue of a work in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	upon joint account .

		The class of works involved in this case are of great importance , although the demand for them is so limited as to remove them as far as possible from the class of best sellers .

		They are books that could not possibly bear the cost of duplicate manufacture , and which would have no chance of getting published at all with - out some arrangement whereby the cost of com - position might be shared by the two countries .

		The philosophical writings of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	afford a typical example , for they could hardly have seen the light had they not secured the benefit of a joint arrangement between the En - glish and American publishers .

		A present-day example is the great ``
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature '' an enterprise which was made practicable only by the cooperation of the American house which assumed a share of the initial cost .

		The American publisher , then , agrees to take a thousand sets of such a work , or half the entire edition , as the case may be , and to assume a proportional share of the expenses of production .

		The law says plainly 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	that he shall be penalized to the extent of fifteen per cent ad valorem for performing this public - spirited service for the American people .

		But this is reckoning without
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	in the
Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION	, who `` smells a rat , '' and sniffs suspiciously at the transaction .

		At last , out of his sapient cogitations comes forth the edict that the fifteen per cent shall be reckoned , not upon the invoiced value of the imported American edition , but upon the trade value in the
London	LOCATION	market , as based upon sales of a dozen copies at a time to individual English booksellers .

		In a word , these books shall not be treated as other imported merchandise , but shall be made the subject of an absurd discrimi - nation likely , in effect , to make the American edition impossible , and force the small and scattered company of scholars who must have the work in question to get it at a greatly enhanced price by individual importation , if indeed the work be published at all in the mother country .

		This preposterous ruling , so defiant of all common sense , and so regardless of all humane amenity , has actually been made by the Treas - ury , and is now in force at the custom houses .

		The official pronouncement uses the following language : `` The law requires merchandise to be appraised at the price at which it is freely offered for sale to all purchasers in the usual wholesale quantities .

		If merchandise is sold for export at prices less than it is sold for consump - tion or for use in the country of origin , it is the latter price which fixes the value for dutiable purposes . ''

		The sale , by advance arrangement , of American , Canadian , and Australian editions , at a price determined by sharing the initial cost , which arrangement is , in many cases , the only means of making any publication of the work possible , is thus debarred by this muddle-headed decision .

		The normal fifteen per cent penalty is thus arbitrarily raised to perhaps fifty per cent , which is simply prohibitory in most of the cases which come under the ruling .

		It will be observed that in all this there is no question of the undervaluation with fraudulent intent whereby dealers in many kinds of mer - chandise seek to get the better of the tariff .

		The English publisher doubtless has two rates for the sale of his book one a wholesale rate in dozen lots for the ordinary bookseller ; the other a much lower rate for the foreign publisher who shares the original expense , and is willing to assume the risks and responsibilities that go with the marketing of an entire edition .

		And yet this foreign publisher is to be treated as if he were the beneficiary of a secret rebate , although he does not in any way come into competition with the wholesale purchaser in the home mar - ket .

		He makes a perfectly legitimate transac - tion , on terms which would doubtless be offered to any other purchaser on as large a scale , but the
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	mind can see in the transaction only an example of special privilege , ignoring the patent fact that it enables an important English work to be sold in
America	LOCATION	at a rea - sonable price .

		Import your edition if you will , but you must pay duties upon a fictitious valu - ation , not upon the real value as determined by your contract this is the absurd position of the authorities , which knocks the law itself into a cocked hat .

		Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, who always comes to the front as a valiant champion of decency and fair dealing in matters concern - ing the book business , puts the matter in a nut - shell in his recent letter to President
Wilson	PERSON	: '' The importer of woolen or linen goods is able to base his duty upon the figures of his purchase invoice because , and only because , similar quantities are sold in the market of origin .

		The publishers claim a similar privilege , namely , the right to base the dutiable value upon which duty is paid in like manner upon the amount actually paid by them for the goods .

		I hope very much that it may be practicable for you to have this material so digested that without an undue demand upon your time , the matters at issue can be presented for your attention and for your judgment . ''

		He further says that `` if the policy indicated in this interpretation is to be maintained , the business of importing into this market books in editions will be brought practically to a close . ''

		Another principle involved in this discussion is that of the author 's royalty .

		This is included in whatever price is paid for the American edi - tion and , according to the new ruling , becomes also subject to the increased duty .

		But a de - cision dated as early as
1877	DATE	expressly says that `` the royalty to be paid on the sale of imported books does not constitute a dutiable item , and this royalty is , therefore , not to be included in the appraised value of such books . ''

		This decision , it may be noted , was reaffirmed only three years ago by Secretary
MacVeagh	PERSON	, but now the underling in charge of the matter overrules it by the arbitrary edict that '' when said market value or wholesale price abroad includes the charge for royalty , such charge will be included by this office in the appraised value . ''

		Thus the author , as well as the long - suffering public , is to be mulcted , we suppose in the sacred name of protection .

		It is doubt - less an impudent pretension for an English author to expect a royalty from the sale of his
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 371 book in
America	LOCATION	, and it is well to read him a lesson upon his greediness .

		We are not very hopeful of any good results from Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's appeal to the President .

		Bureaucracy usually gets its own way in such matters , and we can not ignore the fact that the President is responsible for the perpetuation of the fundamental iniquity of the tax upon knowledge , the meanest of all taxes .

		He had but to say a word last year , and the whole dis - grace would have been wiped out .

		The word was left unsaid , and he will now have the excuse that more weighty affairs of state preclude his consideration of so petty a matter .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A FAIRY TALE IN LATIN sounds like a contra - diction in terms , so stately and formal , so severely logical and prosaically unimaginative , does the spirit of the Latin language seem to those who have labored over their
Caesar	PERSON	and
Cicero	PERSON	with grammar and dictionary at school and college .

		Yet some early memories of Phsedrus may linger , to remind one that the Romans could , at a pinch , write some - thing beside commentaries and orations and his - tories and stately epics .

		But even the fables of Phaedrus suffer the restrictions of verse .

		A good story informally told is a thing hardly conceivable in classical Latin literature .

		If the old Romans had left us a few first-rate novels or even a single col - lection of good short stories , how much easier and pleasanter might have been the task of learning their language !

		To supply this lack , in some measure , Dr.
Arcadius Avellanus	PERSON	has long been engaged in putting forth translations and other productions of a readable nature , thus demonstrating that Latin can be learned as French and German are learned , with no preliminary memorizing of the grammar and without too much thumbing of the dictionary .

		`` Robinson Crusoeus '' came from his hand a few years ago , and now we are glad to welcome from the same ready pen
Ruskin	PERSON	's '' King of the Golden River '' in fluent and simple Latin .

		``
Rex Aurei	PERSON	Rivi '' is prefaced in English by Mr.
E. Parmalee Prentice	PERSON	, eloquent advocate of '' the
Amherst	LOCATION	idea '' in liberal education .

		-LRB- See under this head THE DIAL of
June 16 , 1911	DATE	. -RRB-

		In his preface he gives promise of further translations of a similar sort , in such supply as the public demand may seem to justify .

		In the present work it is curious to note the ingenuity with which linguistic difficulties have been met .

		`` Southwest Wind ,
Esquire	ORGANIZATION	, '' is rendered , `` Herus Africus , '' and `` coal-cellar `` becomes '' cellarium lith - anthracinum . ''

		Occasionally , however , the terseness to be expected of the Latin gives place to a rather unnecessary circumlocution , as in the sentence , `` It is a cold day to turn an old man out in , '' which is thus elaborated in translation : `` Tempus nimis algidum uvidumque est , nee senem convenit tarn impropitia tempestate tecto evertere . ''

		Stricter lit - eralness of rendering seems , here and there , both possible and advisable , as in the sentence , `` There are enough of them to keep you warm , '' which ap - pears in Latin thus : `` Ad te operiendum habes eorum satis . ''

		Still it remains none the less true that for learning Latin , or for recovering one 's lost knowledge of that language , a more agreeable method could not easily be devised than that of Dr.
Avellanus	PERSON	, who himself acquired the tongue collo - quially in his childhood .

		This privately printed version of a favorite fairy tale is procurable from Mr.
Prentice	PERSON	at 37 Wall Street ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		A BOOK-LOVING BLACKSMITH furnishes material for an exceptionally interesting article in a recent number of the ''
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin . ''

		The late Judge
Anthony Donovan	PERSON	, of
Madison	LOCATION	, worked at the forge for twenty-two years before he entered the law school of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, at the age of forty .

		His election as municipal judge of Madison occurred when he had practiced law but a year , and he sat on the bench almost as long as he had stood at the anvil .

		A passionate lover of books from his youth , he early accumulated a fund for their purchase by laying aside daily the small amount he would have spent on cigars and beer if he had allowed himself even a moderate indulgence in those superfluities .

		This `` cigar account '' and `` drink account '' provided him in time with a fine library , any occasional extraordinary addition to which he managed to keep within the limit of what it would have cost him to `` go on a spree . ''

		``
Intel	ORGANIZATION	- lectual sprees '' he called these book - buying orgies , and they commonly left him poorer in pocket by fifteen or twenty dollars , but immeasurably richer in mental and spiritual satisfaction .

		In an autobio - graphical confession that reminds one , in substance though not in style , of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, he says : '' Were you ever afflicted with that incurable disease , a mania for books ?

		That disease which sends its victims to the bookstores and has their pockets emptied ?

		Do you know what it is to be drawn to a place where books are for sale with an attraction like that of steel to a magnet ?

		Did you ever stand for hours turning over the pages of some coveted volume and racking your brain for some art by which with your limited funds you could make it your own ?

		Did you ever feel your heart sink within you when , through your want of funds , you saw the volume you had set your heart upon carried away by some one more fortunate than you ?

		If you did , I can sympathize with you , for I have had the same experience . ''

		But
Donovan	PERSON	was not merely a buyer of books ; he read all that be bought and as fast as he bought them ... A SESQUI-CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION of interest to the educational and also to the literary world is planned for
October 1115	DATE	of this year by
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, to commemorate its founding in
1764	DATE	.

		On the programme of exercises , already issued by 372 -LSB-
May 1	DATE	the
Celebration Committee	ORGANIZATION	, we note the revival of the old comedy by
Vanbrugh	PERSON	and
Gibber	PERSON	, '' The Provoked Husband , or a Journey to
London	LOCATION	, '' said to be the first play performed in
New England	LOCATION	, and to have been presented at
Newport	LOCATION	in
1761	DATE	by a company of players from
Virginia	LOCATION	, who also appeared at
Providence	LOCATION	in
1762	DATE	.

		The old theatre , in Meeting Street near Benefit Street , where took place this first dramatic performance witnessed by the good people of
Providence	LOCATION	, will be reproduced , together with some historical incidents connected with the beginnings of drama in the same city .

		Even more popularly appealing is the announcement that `` on one evening there will be an illumination of the campus and a torchlight procession of undergrad - uates and alumni in costume representing with his - torical accuracy various periods in the
University	ORGANIZATION	's history .

		A historical pageant will be given in
Warren	LOCATION	, R. L , the original seat of the
University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Undoubtedly attractive to a large number present will be the diversions of the closing day , when '' there will be special exercises at the athletic field of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, illustrating the development of athletic training from grammar school to college , including folk-dances and pageantry by school children , and a football game between
Brown	PERSON	and another New Eng - land college . ''

		The orator selected for this memorable occasion is the Hon.
Charles Evans Hughes	PERSON	, who will deliver an historical address
Wednesday	DATE
morning	TIME	of celebration week at the
First Baptist Meeting House	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE MOST-USED LIBRARY IN THE WORLD is that which ministers to the needs of the great cosmo - politan public of
New York City	LOCATION	.

		The extent and variety of its activities , as presented to view in the librarian 's annual record , are all but incredible .

		Its book-circulation in all departments last year easily outstripped that of any other library in the land , and in reference work the use of books within the building not even the British Museum or the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	can show an equal activity .

		Furthermore , the use of the main library is so rap - idly increasing that each month now shows a gain of not far from fifty per cent over the correspond - ing month of last year .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's endeavor to make the institution under his superintendence a vast storehouse of universal information , promptly available for all comers , seems to be meeting with success .

		As an illustration of the library 's special usefulness to scholars and writers and publishers , far and near , note should be made of its photo - graphic reproduction of rare works , upon request , at a cost so slight that other libraries in many parts of the country have been glad to obtain in this man - ner facsimiles of missing pages 6r illustrations or other details to make good the defects in their own collections .

		In its work for the blind the library circulated last year more than twenty-three thousand books in raised type .

		That its income is not keep - ing pace with the demands upon it , is of course a foregone conclusion .

		But no city has so many wealthy citizens as
New York	LOCATION	, and not a few of these are philanthropists as well as millionaires ; so that there is hope for an ultimate strengthening of the original Astor-Lenox-Tilden foundation .

		A POET 'S PERSONALITY has for many persons a deeper interest than is felt for his poetry .

		The current `` Yale Review '' has an article on `` The Personality of Tagore , '' by Mr.
Basanta Koomar Roy	PERSON	, a Hindu by birth , and well qualified to present in lifelike portraiture the subject of his sketch .

		Like many another boy destined to become famous , the young Rabindranath cherished a vehement ha - tred of school . ''

		We all expected that '
Rabi	PERSON	' would make his mark in the world , '' sadly remarked the eldest sister after the attempt to educate him had been given up in despair ; '' but our hopes have been nipped in the bud by the waywardness of the boy and now he will be the only unsuccessful man in the family . ''

		The following passage is of curious significance : `` Of all subjects English was of least interest to him .

		His Bengali teacher tried his best to make Tagore feel that the English language was very charming .

		With melodramatic intensity the teacher would recite some of the most sonorous passages from the famous English poets , to make the child feel the beauty of English verse .

		But that excited nothing but the mirth of the boy .

		He would go into hysterics with laughter , and his teacher would blush and give up reciting , and with it all hope of turning his pupil into an English scholar .

		And yet this boy , forty years later , as the author of ` Gitanjali , ' was to give the world a new style in English prose , rich in its singular simplicity , but superb in its rhythmic effect . ''

		Not always , evi - dently , does the familiar Wordsworthian adage hold true .

		... A FRESH IMPETUS TO INTER-LIBRARY LOANS IS one of the results already following upon the recent admission of books , over eight ounces in weight , to parcel-post privileges ; and the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, which holds its annual conference this month at
Washington	LOCATION	, has under consideration plans by which the libraries of the entire country , work - ing together and making the fullest use of the mail service , may greatly enlarge their sphere of useful - ness .

		The
Association	ORGANIZATION	's secretary , Mr.
George B. Utley	PERSON	, is warmly in favor of the proposed scheme .

		Dr.
Bostwick	PERSON	, of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, reports that , having announced his intention to circulate books by mail as soon as the new postal regulation should take effect , he received the first request for a book -LRB- to be thus sent -RRB- on the
morning of the very day	TIME	when the old order had given place to the new .

		Direct sending of books to the library 's patrons , as well as loans effected through other libra - ries , will be greatly facilitated by the cheapened mail service .

		From
Virginia	LOCATION	there comes word from the State Librarian that '' the extension of the parcel-post rates has already had a considerable effect in increasing the use of the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	by the people in the interior of the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The present zone system of graduated rates makes
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 373 rather expensive the sending of books from
Maine	LOCATION	to
California	LOCATION	, or from
Florida	LOCATION	to
Oregon	LOCATION	; but the chief call for the new service will involve much shorter dis - tances , and for the longer ones we now have a lowered express rate .

		On the whole , there seems to be no rea - son why henceforth , within certain limits and under necessary safeguards , all the publicly-owned books in the country should not be available for all the public .

		SPELLING AND SOUND , often at so great a vari - ance in our language as to seem to justify , in some measure , the present movement for spelling-reform , are especially likely to clash in English proper names , both personal and geographical .

		In his ex - cellent book on `` The Romance of Names , '' already noticed more fully by us , Professor
Ernest Weekley	PERSON	devotes a chapter to those patronymics that most conspicuously fail to indicate their pronunciation by their written form .

		Cholmondeley -LRB-
Chumley	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
Marjoribanks	PERSON	-LRB-
Marchbanks	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Mainwaring	PERSON	-LRB- Manner - ing -RRB- ,
Auchinleck	PERSON	-LRB-
Affleck	PERSON	-RRB- , Knollys -LRB-
Knowles	PERSON	-RRB- , and
Sandys	PERSON	-LRB- Sands -RRB- are familiar examples .

		Wemyss and
Colquhoun	PERSON	, which the author fails to mention , are also old offenders , in the eyes of phonetic spellers .

		Sometimes the telescoping of syllables has been effected in the spelling as well as in the pro- nunciation ; for example ,
Milton	PERSON	-LRB- from Middle - ton -RRB- ,
Putnam	PERSON	-LRB- Puttenham -RRB- , Posnett -LRB- Postlethwaite -RRB- ,
Dabney	PERSON	-LRB- d'Aubigny -RRB- , and Tedman -LRB- St.
Edmund	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Two names not unknown in this country , but not mentioned by Professor
Weekley	PERSON	, might appropri - ately have found a place in the chapter referred to ; they are
Taliaferro	PERSON	, commonly pronounced
Tolliver	PERSON	, as indeed it is often spelled , and -LRB- strangest of all , yet an actual surname borne by families in
Virginia	LOCATION	-RRB- Enroughty , pronounced
Darby	PERSON	!

		A LIBRARY SCHOOL 'S QUARTER-CENTURY RECORD is briefly but impressively presented in the current annual Report of the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	.

		To be exact , the record covers twenty-seven years , and it is displayed to the public by Director
Wyer	PERSON	in the hope that it may , for at least a passing moment , arrest the public attention and bring to the indifferent a quickened sense of the good work done by one of the
State	ORGANIZATION	's not least important edu - cational institutions .

		More than two thousand posi - tions have been filled by its students , the present head of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is a graduate , and forty-four other members of that library 's staff received their training at
Albany	LOCATION	, as did the libra - rians of
Rochester	LOCATION	, Troy , and
Utica	LOCATION	.

		The two lead - ing libraries at
Albany	LOCATION	have graduates of the school as their chief administrative officers ; library schools throughout the country have drawn upon the parent institution for superintendents and instructors ; and the number of smaller public libraries where positions are filled by
Albany	LOCATION	graduates is past counting .

		But with all the demand from outside the State for libra - rians trained in the pioneer library school a school that in its first years was , of course , the only source of supply for libraries seeking systematically-trained employees it appears that about
thirty-eight per cent	MONEY	of the places thus filled have been within
New York State	LOCATION	itself .

		Other important aid rendered to the community by this school at
Albany	LOCATION	is to be noted in the recital of its achievements .

		THE AUTHORITY OF THE STANDARD WRITERS 18 cited in support of its typographical vagaries by the current quarterly issue of the ' Simplified Spelling Bulletin . ''

		It asserts that `` the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	has never been able to get ahed of the ritera of standard English literature .

		Whatever recom - mendations the
Board	ORGANIZATION	may make , it is found that the ` standard riters ' hav used them before .

		Of course , as the newspapers frequently intimate , the members of the
Board	ORGANIZATION	and the other advocates of simplified spelling ar totally indifferent to English literature , and hav never red any of the works of the great authors .

		It is therefore all the more gratify - ing to find that whatever the
Board	ORGANIZATION	recommends happens to be supported by the authentic works of the accepted riters of English literature . ''

		Will some simplified speller have the kindness to point out exactly where in these '' standard riters '' are to be found the forms , ar , red -LRB- not the color -RRB- , ahed , riters , and -LRB- from another article in the same issue -RRB- anomalus , tru , taut -LRB- not the adjective -RRB- , scool , and folloed ?

		Perhaps this request is unreasonable , and if it should be found difficult to comply with it the simplified speller may still take comfort in the fact that the
Laramie	LOCATION	'' Boomerang '' has recently adopted a number of the officially approved spellings , and the
Truro	LOCATION	`` Daily News '' still continues to appear with so liberal a sprinkling of these spellings as must make glad hearts at No. 1
Madison Avenue	LOCATION	.

		THE ART OF LEAVING OFF , in writing , in story - telling , in speech-making , in preaching , in calling , and in much else , is an art that many never learn , perhaps chiefly because it is so simple to stop when you get through .

		Scott more than atones for the long - winded preliminaries to his novels by the masterly abruptness with which he closes them .

		A compli - ment worth winning from one 's readers is the in - voluntary exclamation at the end of the book , Is that all !

		Those who have read much aloud will recall many a masterpiece of fiction that has elicited from breathless hearers that unmistakable testimony to the attention-compelling quality of the narrative .

		In her useful treatise on `` The Art of Story-Telling '' -LRB- noticed more formally on another page -RRB- Miss
Julia Darrow Cowles	PERSON	pertinently remarks : `` Story-tellers sometimes remind one of a man holding the handles of an electric battery .

		The current is so strong that he can not let go .

		The story-teller must know when and how to ` let go . '

		Let us suppose that , in telling
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	's story of ` The
Nightin	PERSON	- gale , ' the story-teller after the delightful denoue - ment of the supposedly dead Emperor 's greeting to his attendants , where he ` to their astonishment said `` Good morning ! '' '

		were to add an explana - tion of the effect of the nightingale 's song in restor - ing the Emperor to health !

		It would be like offering 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	a glass of ` plain soda ' from which all the efferves - cence had departed . ''

		TROUBLESOME AUTHOR-NAMES , which , by reason of being compound names , or variously spelled names , or pseudonyms , or , in the case of women , married names not associated with the writers ' earliest and perhaps most famous books , cause con - fusion and several sorts of blunders , are more in number than might be supposed .

		At the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	, as explained in the librarian 's latest Re - port , an '' official name list '' is being compiled , `` definitely recording once for all our decisions as to the forms of authors ' names , the manner of spell - ing them , the data necessary to differentiate two or more bearers of the same name , cross-references from forms not adopted but under which a reader might first look , etc. '' Like library catalogues in gen - eral , this catalogue of names will never be finished , but must receive continual additions .

		At present it contains more than thirty-six thousand `` officially adopted forms of names . ''

		The publication and gen - eral adoption of some such carefully-compiled list would be desirable in the library world , where stand - ardization of working implements is not yet so com - plete as the casual observer might be led to infer .

		COOPER VERSUS SCOTT formed the subject of a recent conversation with Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, re - ported by Mr.
H. I. Brock	PERSON	in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Even - ing Post . ''

		Not everyone will agree with the gifted Pole -LRB- n6 Kortzeniowski , be it remembered -RRB- in pre - ferring the Leatherstocking to the
Waverley	LOCATION	novels .

		It was from the former that his '' first deep draught of English fiction in the original '' was taken , and he is still warm in his praises of the delectable quality of the beverage . ''

		Not only , '' writes his interviewer , `` did he find in Cooper a real genius for description and an art of writing not to be despised , but as an old sailor he discovered in the American 's work an extraordinarily fine and true feeling for the sea .

		Cooper , who had been to sea in his youth as a mid - shipman , confessedly wrote his story ' The Pilot ' to show his contempt for the literary seamanship ex - hibited by Sir
Walter	PERSON	in his story of ` The Pirate . '

		It did not appear , however , that Sir
Walter	PERSON	's mud - dled nautical vocabulary troubled Conrad .

		What was missing for him was just that feeling for the sea which
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	had , and which was part of the fibre of the being of the men who had spent half their lives on the great waters .

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	was a lands - man . ''

		The unfairness of judging the landsman when not in his proper element is , of course , obvious .

		LITERATURE IN
ARKANSAS	LOCATION	has its lovers , though not in such numbers as in
Illinois	LOCATION	and
Indiana	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		One good reason of the disparity is that there are a great many more inhab - itants in each of these latter states than in
Arkansas	LOCATION	.

		From the Fourth Annual Report of the
Little Rock Public Library	ORGANIZATION	we learn that the late Judge
U. M. Rose	PERSON	, who is described as '' a rare student and scholar , '' has left his collection of nearly eight thou - sand volumes to that institution a gift that `` espe - cially strengthens the library in history , travel , gen - eral literature and belles lettres .

		There are between two and three thousand volumes in French , making one of the largest French collections in the South .

		Encyclopedias , dictionaries , a set of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Re - view ,
Niles Register	ORGANIZATION	, and many other works which would be difficult to duplicate , make the library an invaluable source for reference .

		Though the library contains no incunabula , strictly speaking , there is in it a number of early editions which are interesting because little , if at all , duplicated in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There are also specimens of early printing , illustrating and binding . ''

		As the
Little Rock	ORGANIZATION	library had but about nine thousand volumes before receiv - ing this gift , it now finds itself nearly doubled in size .

		No other library in the country , remarks the librarian with satisfaction , has been so favored in the past year with respect to book-gifts .

		THE NOVEL-WRITING HABIT , like other habits , in - creases with indulgence .

		Mr.
William Heinemann	PERSON	, the well-known
London	LOCATION	publisher , has a pertinent word to say on the subject in a conversation reported by the
London	LOCATION	literary correspondent of the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript . ''

		`` I have no desire , '' declares Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	, `` to criticise contemporary fiction ad - versely ; on the contrary , the standard of the best fiction is as high as it ever was .

		What I have in mind is the enormous surplus of rubbish that reaches print .

		You may see this by the extent to which the novel - writing habit has grown of recent years so much so that the possession of a pen and an ink - pot seems quite excuse enough for anyone to turn author . ''

		Upon the enterprising literary agent is laid a large part of the blame for this recent rank luxuriance of growth where already there was no insufficient vitality .

		The agent 's eagerness to swell his commissions by `` tying up authors and publishers for several unread and even unwritten books on the strength of the often imaginary success of a first book , '' is at the bottom of much of the mischief , avers the same competent authority .

		There are reprehensible dealings in '' futures '' in the book market , as on the stock exchange .

		A WORD or CHEER TO HELLENISTS comes from
Hamilton College	ORGANIZATION	, which has recently issued its annual catalogue , wherein one finds indubitable evidence that not everywhere is the study of Greek falling into irretrievable neglect .

		The number of classical students at
Hamilton	LOCATION	increases yearly , and the present freshman class has more members pur - suing Greek than any former class in the history of the college .

		The sophomores come within one of equalling this record , and even in the junior class , where the `` grind '' of the earlier college courses is commonly exchanged , with sighs of relief , for less exacting studies , largely elective , there is displayed a gratifying fondness for Greek literature .

		One can not believe that Greek is made so easy at Ham - ilton as to account for this enviable state of affairs , but rather that it is made so attractive .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 375 COMMUNICATIONS .

		THE OLD AND THE NEW POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I say in your pages a few words about your recent interpretation of that very true and beautiful Wordsworthian text , '' Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge '' -LRB- the italics are mine -RRB- ?

		You very aptly quote a certain fine passage from
Milton	LOCATION	, and a certain fine passage from
Tennyson	LOCATION	, to exemplify this famous definition of poetry .

		But then , if I read you rightly , because a poet of a different day and civilization from either
Milton	PERSON	's or
Tennyson	PERSON	's narrates his impression of life in a metrical manner different from either of theirs , you argue , or seem to argue , that since he has not written in
Milton	LOCATION	's or
Tennyson	PERSON	's way , and with
Milton	PERSON	's or
Tennyson	PERSON	's knowledge , but in his own way and with his own knowl - edge , what he has written can not be poetry .

		You might of course have drawn this inference justly from Words - worth 's definition of the art , if this definition could be understood to mean , '' All poetry is the breath and finer spirit of
Milton	LOCATION	's and of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's knowledge . ''

		But I can not help feeling that a rather more catholic inter - pretation of the Wordsworthian definition might be found to be more correct .

		You mention '' calling out the old guard '' against new expression in poetry .

		You call
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		But will they come ?

		It seems to me that in quoting
Wordsworth	PERSON	's words about '' the breath of all knowledge '' you do not quite induce him to emerge for us from the vasty deep of literary criticism , in the character of a poet in a pet against other poetic truth than his own .

		As for
Milton	PERSON	, you not only advise the writer of poetry unlike
Milton	PERSON	's to stop writing and turn to manual labor , you not only exhort public opinion to rouse itself against the existence of a periodical which will print such poetry , but you seem to imply to the reader that in voicing this advice and exhortation you somehow express
Milton	PERSON	's spirit iu these matters .

		But do you express it ?

		The ordinary , historic impression of
Milton	PERSON	has been that of one rather strikingly elo - quent against the very points of your insistence .

		The ideas and principles of `` The Areopagitica : A Speech of Mr.
John Milton	PERSON	for the
Liberty of Unlicensed Printing	ORGANIZATION	to the Parliament of
England	LOCATION	'' are not very plainly evoked by the vision of a figure opposed to the expression of individual conceptions or to more open opportunities for their publication .

		Are you quite justified in assuming tacitly that the composer of `` The woods decay , the woods decay and
fall	DATE	, '' can be summoned in the guise of one whose life and work have been those of an old guard , ready to bayonet all theories and practices of poetic art other than his own ?

		In both theory and practice , perhaps no poets were ever wider apart than
Tennyson	PERSON	and Whitman .

		Does the following letter , quoted from Mr.
Horace TraubeFs	PERSON	`` With
Walt Whitman	PERSON	in
Camden	LOCATION	, '' evince a determi - nation on
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's part to drive
Whitman	PERSON	and his views of poetry from what you call '' the sacred pre - cincts of the muse '' ? ''

''

		Yours Always ''
Tennyson	PERSON	. ''

		As you admire
Tennyson	PERSON	's conception of poetry , I know you will listen for a moment to the voice of the singer he held in such honor and entreats so gently ; and I am sure you will be generous enough to let me place beside this passage from
Whitman	LOCATION	's song about the soul facing death two other brief expressions on the same theme by writers of very different manner but who use somewhat the same metrical method : '' Facing west , from
California	LOCATION	's shores , Inquiring , tireless , seeking what is yet unfound , I , a child , very old , over waves , towards the house of maternity , the land of migrations , look afar , Look off the shores of my Western Sea the circle almost circled . ''

		This is by
W. E. Henley	PERSON	: '' The smoke ascends In a rosy-and-golden haze .

		The spires Shine and are changed .

		In the valley Shadows rise .

		The lark sings on .

		The sun , Closing his benediction , Sinks , and the darkening air Thrills with a sense of the triumphing night Night with her train of stars And her great gift of sleep . ''

		So be my passing !

		My task accomplished and the long day done , My wages taken , and in my heart Some late lark singing , Let me be gathered to the quiet West , The sundown splendid and serene , Death ! ''

		My third quotation is one of the collection of verses by Mr.
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	recently published in '' Poetry '' : '' 1 shall foot it Down the roadway in the dusk Where shapes of hunger wander And the fugitives of pain go by .

		`` I shall foot it In the silence of the
morning	TIME	, See the night slur into dawn , Hear the slow great winds arise Where tall trees flank the way And shoulder towards the sky . ''

		The broken boulders by the road Shall not commemorate my ruin .

		Regret shall be the gravel under foot .

		I shall watch for Slim birds swift of wing That go where wind and ranks of thunder Drive the wild processionals of rain . ''

		The dust of the travelled road Shall touch my hands and face . ''

		In my own view these songs may all be fittingly in - cluded in one category , and may all suitably be called poetry .

		Whether or not any or all of these expressions are poetry for you , I think it would have been fairer to compare Mr.
Sandburg	PERSON	's work with that of other singers of somewhat the same method than with the verse of singers of an entirely different musical tradition .

		For you surely must admit the existence of a great body of metrical text and metrical translation , not composed according to classic conceptions of prosody , nor with the foot or line measure of the Greeks or the Latins , nor by English rhyme schemes , and yet holding a place among the most enriching and distinguished possessions of the 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	world of letters , and regarded by thousands of people in modern , media 1 val , and ancient life , as poetry , the verse of
Langland	LOCATION	, of the Hymns of the
Zend Avesta	PERSON	, of Whitman ,
George Meredith	PERSON	,
Ossian	PERSON	,
Rabindra Nath Tagore	PERSON	, the Psalms , and Lamentations , to mention some random instances .

		`` So for one the wet sail arching through the rainbow ` round the bow , And for one the creak of snow-shoes on the crust . ''

		The call of poetry for the feet of the young men will always , to my own belief , cry along very differing trails .

		Least of all would I wish to appear to do anything so pretentious as to deny to THE DIAL 'S own course the wisdom of '' unto each his voice and vision ; unto each his spoor and sign . ''

		I would only remind you a little of this wisdom ; and that it seems to be true that `` poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge . ''

		MR.
YEATS	PERSON	ON POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I was interested in your very sane comment on the speech of Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	at the recent dinner given him by those associated with the magazine called '' Poetry . ''

		This gallant little periodical has done good service in publishing original poetry , some of which is of real distinction .

		I particularly liked the
April	DATE	number .

		And Mr
Yeats	PERSON	has done work of real merit , both as an author and as a friend of authors .

		Nevertheless his precepts are rather to be regarded as belonging to a school , than as of universal validity .

		He insists upon the necessity of simplicity , regardless of the fact that a great deal of very noble poetry has been complex , involved , and allusive ; and that in the effort to be simple a host of verse-writers , including some men of exalted genius , have succeeded only in being vacuous .

		He urges the poet to confine himself to the expression of instinct , although surely instinct is always most interesting , and not infrequently most poetic , when associated with action or with ideas .

		He urges the poet to avoid the attempt to instruct , although history clearly proves that even didactic verse may be great poetry , as was especially the case with the `` De Rerum Natura '' of Lucretius .

		And lie strangely enjoins the practise of humility , between which and poetry there is absolutely no connection .

		It is good manners not to brag ; and it is certainly true wisdom not to let our thoughts run monotonously on any merits that we may believe ourselves to possess .

		But such counsel is of personal and social import , and has nothing to do with poetry , a point which Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, speaking after a good dinner , has seemed totally to miss .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's remarks are of interest as a confession of his own aims and aspirations .

		One may easily be a true poet and practise all that Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	enjoins .

		One may easily be a true poet and practise none of it .

		The important thing is to be a true poet .

		Where there is a real poetic gift , it is extremely difficult to lay down rules as to its methods of procedure .

		A RARE ASSOCIATION VOLUME .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The bibliophile is likely to possess all the garrulity usually ascribed to old age before he has passed or even reached the meridian .

		He delights in talk about his treasures and particularly his `` finds '' -LRB- little things of a bookish nature interest him -RRB- , and it is not always what Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	called '' good talk . ''

		Nevertheless , the tribe smitten with the blight of bibliomania is numerous enough to make even a trivial story worth the telling .

		The '' find '' I am about to describe would not , I am well aware , be considered a notable one in these degen - erate days of long purses .

		But it is at least as curious and interesting as many experiences I have heard related with much gusto , and listened to , it must be con - fessed , with a tinge of envy .

		Some years ago in
1903	DATE	to be exact I read with profit Mr.
John Bach McMaster	PERSON	's book on
Daniel Webster	PERSON	-LRB-
New York	LOCATION	,
1902	DATE	-RRB- , and was impressed by a reference -LRB- page 81 -RRB- to the opinion of Chief Justice
John Marshall	PERSON	respecting the maiden speech of
Webster	PERSON	in the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	says : '' But a better testimonial as to the effect of that maiden speech is furnished by
Chief Justice Marshall	ORGANIZATION	.


Nearly twenty years later	DATE	, when the name of
Webster	PERSON	was known over all the land , a copy of his ' Speeches and Forensic Arguments ' was sent to the great judge , who went straightway to
Justice Story	ORGANIZATION	, and expressed his regret that two were not in the col - lection that on the resolutions calling for proof of the repeal of the French decrees , and another on the previous question . '

		I read these speeches , ' said
Marshall	PERSON	, ' with very great pleasure and satisfaction at the time .

		When the first was delivered I did not know Mr.
Webster	PERSON	; but I was so much struck with it that I did not hesitate then to state that Mr.
Webster	PERSON	was a very able man , and would become one of the very first statesmen in
America	LOCATION	, and perhaps the very first . ' ''

		A few months afterwards , while the reference was still fresh in my mind , I was , one rainy afternoon -LRB- of course , such things always happen on rainy afternoons -RRB- , browsing among some neglected books in the attic of my wife 's old
Minnesota	LOCATION	home .

		My search , if such it could be called , had been fruitless .

		The books were quite without value to me , and I had given up hope of finding a single '' nugget , '' to use a favorite term of the late
Henry Stevens	PERSON	of
Vermont	LOCATION	, when lo , I picked up a stained and battered octavo , whose title-label was indecipherable .

		Almost mechanically I opened the book to learn its title , and encountered on the fly-leaf this inscription : '' Mr.
Webster	PERSON	begs
Chief Justice Marshall	ORGANIZATION	's acceptance of this vol .


Washington	LOCATION	Jany 22ud
1831	DATE	. ''

		The title-page read : Speeches and | Forensic Arguments .

Gray & Bowen	ORGANIZATION	.

		|
New York	LOCATION	:
Jonathan Leavitt	PERSON	.

		| M
DCCC	ORGANIZATION	XXX .

		It soon dawned upon me that I had in my hand the identical volume mentioned by Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	in the foregoing quotation .

		How then did the book , once a part of the library of the great jurist , find its way into that
Minnesota	LOCATION	attic ?

		Inquiry soon pieced out the book 's story .

		The volume had been given by the
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	himself to my wife 's grandfather ,
Ezra Abbott	PERSON	, who for some years was a resident of
Fauquier County	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	was a native of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, and after his graduation from
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	, in
1830	DATE	, he removed to
Virginia	LOCATION	to open a private school , in the conduct of which he was very successful .

		In this ca - pacity , several of the grandchildren of
John Marshall	PERSON	were entrusted to his care ; and naturally enough he became acquainted with the
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	, then an old man , when the latter paid his annual visit to the '' Oak Hill '' estate , and now and then was privileged to talk with him .

		Knowing that his young friend greatly admired
Webster	PERSON	,
Marshall	PERSON	generously gave him the
1914	DATE	-RSB- 377 collection of speeches .

		Later , Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	became one of the pioneers of
Minnesota	LOCATION	, where he died in
1876	DATE	, a useful and much-loved citizen .

		This copy of
Webster	PERSON	's '' Speeches and Forensic Arguments , '' a rare association volume in more than a single sense , now has a place of honor on my shelves .

		INCREASING THE SALES OF BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your '' Casual Comment '' paragraph on '' How to get books to the bookless , '' in THE DIAL of
April 1	DATE	, suggests that the publishers must originate other and new methods to accomplish that result , and also raises the question as to whether it is worth while to do so .

		Why , we may well ask , should anyone worry about getting books to the bookless who evidently do not wish to become book owners ?

		There are abundant facilities for getting books to those who wish for them .

		But if books must be forced upon the bookless it is evident that the publishers must adopt other methods of selling than merely to announce their wares and wait for the demand to make best sellers .

		And that is just what they must do .

		I believe the bookless may be reduced to a figure comparable to
England	LOCATION	's record , or even less , but not in consequence of present sales methods .

		There is no other commodity which is allowed merely to answer the original or normal demand .

		There are many commodities that are now staples , and that sell enormously , which were unknown and unwanted until the enterprising vendors created the demand .

		The publishers must create a new and increased demand for books .

		It can be done , but not through studying con - ditions among book buyers .

		Buyers can be created .

		Books can be sold to people who are not readers and will not become readers .

		The matter of books as house - hold decorations has never been properly exploited ; and it has great possibilities .

		A fair-sized household library is a cheap decoration , even when a good sum is paid for the bookcases .

		Then the idea of a small library for each home can be promoted .

		There are many families that would buy some books , if the proposition were to be put concretely to them not to buy books , but to buy these books that are arranged , selected , priced , and described , and that will be delivered with a suitable case upon terms easy to meet .

		A great many sets of books are annually sold in this manner , by concerns organized to sell books rather than to publish them .

		Some of these sets are good , and some are not .

		Most of them are sold to people who have no idea of reading them .

		They buy them because the party of the other part wished to sell them .

		Why do not the `` regular '' publishers learn selling wisdom of these concerns , who sell millions of books of mediocre value and doubtful interest ?

		There are many ways to sell books other than to people who wish the books to read .

		Not one person in a hundred who buys books buys them all to read , or expects to read all they buy .

		Pub - lishers may regard their books as merchandise , rather than strictly as literature , and promote their sale as other merchandise is sold .

		There is , it seems to me , a great field for book selling that has not been exploited , and many methods that have not been adequately tested .

		There is more than one person in seven thousand who will buy books if books are properly offered to them .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The communication of R. S. printed under the head - ing , `` High-Brow , '' in your issue of
April 1	DATE	has doubtless met with the general commendation of those persons who were so fortunate as to read a much needed protest so well put .

		In the strong dramatic poem , `` Barabbas , '' by Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, published since his death in '' Book News , '' there is a striking line , '' Bird-witted ever , these light minded Greeks ! ''

		The younger race of Americans , if one may judge from the samples met with in clubs , private homes , social gatherings , wherever men come together , seems to be producing an undue proportion of the '' bird-witted . ''

		One wonders how much of this degeneration is due to the influence of French literature and to the aping of the Parisian attitude of mind .

		A prominent American physician , himself of French stock , a part of whose summer vacations is spent in
Paris	LOCATION	, not long ago said that the degeneration of the Parisian was beyond hope of redemption , nothing could ever be expected of him again .

		One is puzzled at times to know whether the '' bird-witted '' Americans are merely '' putting up a front '' or whether their mental fashion is the one nat - ural to them and worn because it is within their limita - tions .


America	LOCATION	, however , is so earnest a country that there is good reason to hope as between the '' bfrd - witted '' and the '' high-brows '' the latter will win out .

		^ ' `` ANTI-BABEL '' AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		One of your recent issues contains a communication entitled `` Anti-Babel , '' from Mr.
E. M. Bacon	PERSON	, who asks what will become of
Norway	LOCATION	should she adhere to a language that the rest of the world is too busy to learn .

		Travelling English folks , living as they do within a few hours ' sail of
Norway	LOCATION	, frequently visit that charm - ing country , and are quite content to put up with its language .

		Indeed , Norwegians are seafaring folks , and pick up enough English to answer our questions when in
Norway	LOCATION	.

		In the same way we pick up a good many Norwegian words and phrases .

		I am not afraid to prophesy that the Norwegians will remain the happy people they have always been .

		They might become more wealthy , but wealth is not the main factor in happiness .

		In
England	LOCATION	, though so small a country , dialects still prevail .

		A Southerner often fails to understand a
Yorkshire	LOCATION	peasant , or a Lancashire lad to understand a girl from
Somersetshire	LOCATION	; a Sussex man can not always understand a man of Kent , or a Devonian a
Dorset	LOCATION	man .

		You speak of the
United States	LOCATION	and ourselves as using the same language ; but we constantly meet with phrases , not only in your press , but in books written by well-educated men and women , which are not understood by us .

		Even THE DIAL , which is unusually free from what we term Americanisms , now and again uses some word which is unknown to an Englishman who has not been in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It must be borne in mind that the great majority of all races travel little beyond their own homes , and read little but the Bible , cheap magazines , and local news - papers .

		They pass happy lives , which is far more important than amassing wealth .

		A PUBLISHER 'S EARLY MEMORIES .

		* The same pen that has chronicled so accept - ably the chief events in the life of
George Palmer Putnam	PERSON	, founder of the publishing house long and widely known by his name , now traces in more intimately personal detail , and with con - sequent gain to the vividness and charm of the narrative , the early and rather unusually varied experiences in the life of the writer himself . ''

		Memories of My Youth , '' by Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, is little likely to incur the cen - sure pronounced upon the great mass of modern literature by
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	when he com - plained that so few who can write ever have anything worth writing about .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	has the gift of pleasing narration and suggestive comment , and also a store of varied recollections well worth the narrating .

		Nor does it lessen the readability of the narrative , but rather adds to it what might be called a pathetic interest , to learn that the book 's preparation has been attended with unusual difficulties arising from defective eyesight and the disability of the writ - ing arm one a lifelong affliction , the other a memento of service in the Civil War .

		Eldest of seven sons in a family of eleven children , young
Haven Putnam	PERSON	, as he appears to have been called , is shown to us as a sturdy , self-reliant , resourceful lad , dependent on his own industry and enterprise for most of his spending money , and so successful in this particular that when at the age of seventeen he set forth for
Europe	LOCATION	, primarily to seek expert advice on the care of his eyes , and secondarily to pursue such studies as their condition per - mitted , he had accumulated no less a fund than
three hundred dollars	MONEY	toward defraying his ex - penses .

		Though this was his first visit to con - tinental
Europe	LOCATION	, it was his fourth crossing of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	; for he was born in
London	LOCATION	, three years after his father had established there a branch of the
Wiley	PERSON	and Putnam publishing house , and four years before the dissolution of the partnership called the junior member back to
America	LOCATION	with his family .

		Again in
1851	DATE	the father had occasion to visit
England	LOCATION	, and he took his seven-year-old son with him , partly in the hope that the voyage would benefit the boy 's eyes .

G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		still linger with the septuagenarian autobiog - rapher .

		He says : '' The feeling of homelike reminiscence that comes to me in arriving from year to year at Euston or at
Waterloo	LOCATION	, I am disposed to connect with the first whiffs of that wonderful compound of soot , fog , and roast mutton that go to the making of the atmosphere of
London	LOCATION	, and to the association of these familiar odours with the earliest breathings of my infancy in the paternal cottage in
St. John	LOCATION	's Wood . ''

		Of chief interest in the book , and constitut - ing the greater part of its contents , are the pages describing the writer 's boyhood home in and about
New York	LOCATION	, his student life at
Gottingen	LOCATION	and elsewhere in
Europe	LOCATION	, and his volunteer ser - vice in the great war that cut short his academic course in foreign lands .

		In his memories of the family life at
North Yonkers	LOCATION	the author writes : '' Mention has been made in the Memoir of my father of his own active work in organizing a village library and in carrying on in connection with this institution a series of lecture courses .

		The lecturers brought to
Yonkers	LOCATION	, largely at his own personal solicitation , were most frequently guests at our house .

		As a result , we children came to have a personal impression of repre - sentative citizens like Beeober ,
Bethune	PERSON	,
Storrs	LOCATION	,
Wen	PERSON	- dell
Phillips	PERSON	,
Curtis	PERSON	,
Hale	PERSON	, and many others .

		Curtis came to the house also from time to time in connection with the business of
Putnam 's Magazine	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was at that time quite a youngster , but I remember even then being impressed by the maturity and tinish of his talk and by a certain grace of dignity and manner which made me think of
Sir Roger de Coverley	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- The wise mother was at that time giving to us older children some reading in
Addison	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		Another of the younger men who came to the house with matters belonging to the publishing office was
Frederick Beecher Perkins	PERSON	, a nephew of
Henry Ward Beecher	ORGANIZATION	.

		My father and others who knew him spoke with large hopefulness as to the promise of his career .

		It was an expectation which was , however , never fully carried out .

		Perkins remained until his death ,
forty years later	DATE	, a clever man who was on the point of doing noteworthy things but who never quite arrived . ''

		From those early years , too , we must take the description of Lincoln as he impressed him - self on the youthful listener at that
Cooper Institute	ORGANIZATION	gathering presided over by
Bryant	PERSON	and made forever memorable by the first public appearance in
New York	LOCATION	of him who was so soon to be called upon to play a supremely im - portant part in the nation 's history .

		The elder
Putnam	PERSON	, as a member of the committee having the meeting in charge , was able to smuggle in his son and to give him a seat in a corner of the platform , whence a good view of the speaker was obtained . ''

		The first impression of the man from the
West	LOCATION	did nothing to contradict the expectation of something weird , rough , and uncultivated .

		The long , ungainly figure upon which hung clothes that , while newly made
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 379 for this trip , were evidently the work of an unskilful tailor ; the large feet and the clumsy hands of which , at the outset , at least , the speaker seemed to be unduly conscious ; the long gaunt head , capped by a shock of hair that seemed not to have been thoroughly brushed out , made a picture which did not fit in with
New York	LOCATION	's conception of a finished statesman .

		The first utterance of the voice was not pleasant to the ear , the tone being harsh and the key too high .

		As the speech progressed , however , the speaker seemed to come into control of himself , the voice gained a natural and im - pressive modulation , the gestures were dignified and natural , and the hearers found themselves under the influence of the earnest look from the deeply set eyes and of the absolute integrity of purpose and of devotion to principle which impressed the thought and the words of the speaker .

		In place of a ' wild and woolly ' talk , illumined by more or less incongruous anecdotes , in place of a high-strung exhortation of general principles or of a fierce protest against Southern arrogance , the
New Yorkers	ORGANIZATION	had presented to them a calm but forci - ble series of well-reasoned considerations upon which was to be based their action as citizens . ''

		When a little later this young listener found himself in
Europe	LOCATION	he was amazed and often also amused at the false and absurd notions current among the otherwise well-informed as to the questions at issue in our great national contro - versy , and even as to the geographical location of the contestants themselves .

		One university professor went so far wrong as to place the scene of the war on the Isthmus of
Panama	LOCATION	, making the North Americans and the South Americans the contending parties ; and he begged young
Herr Putnam	PERSON	to explain to him how a war of such apparent magnitude could be carried on within so contracted an area .

		To the youthful patriot placed amid so much of misapprehension and of prejudice in favor of the Southern Con - federacy , the situation was trying in the extreme ; and a class-room fight , precipitated by an En - glish student 's sneer at the North , left the Amer - ican participant , who now chronicles the battle , stretched helpless on the floor .

		Speaking in another chapter of public sentiment in
England	LOCATION	at this time , he says : '' Among the noteworthy friends of the North , men who understood that the contest was not simply for the domination of the continent , but for the maintenance of a republican form of government and for the crushing out of the anachronism of slavery , were
John Bright	PERSON	,
Richard Cobden	PERSON	, the
Duke of Argyle	ORGANIZATION	,
W. E. Forster	PERSON	, and
Richard Hargreaves	PERSON	.

		In
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	may be recalled
Jowett	PERSON	and
Reade	PERSON	, both of them young men , and in
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, who , youngster that he was in 1861-5 , was able , by the use of authoritative knowl - edge and of earnestness of conviction and of readiness to make a fight from the minority , to maintain some backing in the
University	ORGANIZATION	for the cause of the North .

		I own a copy of a pamphlet , now very scarce , printed by
Stephen	PERSON	in
September , 1865	DATE	, in which he shows up a long series of false statements and bogus news in regard to our war printed in the
Times	ORGANIZATION	between
1861	DATE	nd
1865	DATE	. ''

		Of the author 's student days in
Paris	LOCATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	, and Gbttingen , he writes most entertainingly and with a remarkable memory of detail .

		At the Hanoverian university he became acquainted with
James Morgan Hart	PERSON	in fact , introduced him to the town and roomed with him at the pension of
Frau von H. Neither	PERSON	of the two could then have dreamed how many American students would be turned toward
Gottingen	LOCATION	by
Hart	PERSON	's future delightful book -LRB- `` German Uni - versities '' -RRB- relating chiefly his own experience of student life at that famous seat of learning .

		Concerning Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's premature return home to enlist in the regiment of which he ultimately became Brevet Major , and all the stirring events he has to relate in his memories of those critical times , there is room here to give but a hint .

		His harsh experience as prisoner in
Libby Prison	LOCATION	and at
Danville	LOCATION	has been nar - rated by him more fully in a previous volume , '' A Prisoner of War in
Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		That the young
New Yorker	LOCATION	, only eighteen when he en - listed in the
summer of 1862	DATE	, rendered valiant service to the cause of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, becomes ap - parent even in his own modest narrative .

		As a detailed account of individual experience in that war this part of the book is excellent and of more than passing interest .

		With the close of the war and the writer 's completion of his twenty-first year the autobiography comes to a pause , but not to a full stop , since we are promised a continuation -LRB- leisure and strength permitting -RRB- under the title , `` Memories of a Publisher . ''

		Portraits of the author in his adolescence are inserted in the volume , and an index brings it to a close .

		THE FUTURE OF
INDIA	LOCATION	.

		* And what of to-morrow ?

		In travelling about
India	LOCATION	, one finds this question ever on the lips ; but alike from En - glish friends and from
Mohammedan	DATE	or Hindu acquaintances one receives only the most frag - mentary and inconclusive answers .

		Nor does the thoughtful student at home , appealing to scores of seemingly authoritative volumes , fare a whit better .

		The veil that hides the future of all nations from the thinker 's searching gaze seems to grow jealously thicker and more im - * THE PASSIKG OF EMPIKE .

		By
H. Fielding-Hall	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		380 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	penetrable when
India	LOCATION	is the land into whose destiny one fain would peer .

		Yet what a compelling and enchaining prob - lem it is !

		It is needless to recall the thronging millions of diverse habitants , to dwell upon the vast geographical complex , to recite the historic vicissitudes of native and foreign rule , or to insist upon the unescapable charm of this in - credible land .

		It has all been done a thousand times ; and each time seems to deepen our help - less discontent as we stand with strained eyes and keen longing before the relentless veil .

		And ever there is the temptation to listen to the philosophic dreamer or the vaticinating nationalist , when he summons our puzzled eyes to visions beyond the sunset .

		But inevitably we return with our question to some quiet Hindu or Mohammedan thinker , or to some English worker who has toiled for years beneath Indian suns and can tell us of such lowly things as the crooked stick that serves for a plow , the hapless villager in the bewildering law court , and all the countless minutiae of life and administra - tion .

		The realities of to-day must be the key of to-morrow .

		And in this connection , I think , will be found the chief significance of Mr.
Fielding-Hall	PERSON	's latest book .

		He can see , albeit ever so dimly , the distant day when
India	LOCATION	shall be a daughter nation ; but he speaks of present conditions with the detailed knowledge of experience , and pro- poses definite changes looking to a larger and better future which he believes must dawn . ''


India	LOCATION	sees life through different windows than we do ; but her eyes are as our eyes , and she has the same desires as we have .

		She has been nearly dead or sleep - ing for long , but at last she moves .

		She is awake or waking .

		Should it not be our task , our pleasure and our pride , to help her early steps along the path of conscious strength that leads to a national life such as that we have been proud of ?

		And to do so must we not try to understand her ? ''

		Have we ever tried ? ''

		I do not think we have ; but the time is coming when , unless we can go hand in hand with her along her path to nationhood , she will desert us .

		Her des - tiny is calling her ; shall we keep her back ? ''

		We can not keep her back . '

		No one can be more wise than Destiny . '

		And if we stand in her way , who will suffer like we shall ?

		For her sake and for ours should we not try to understand ? ''

		After such an introduction we are prepared for something radically different both from the ordinary '' interesting '' superficial volume on
India	LOCATION	and from the traditional apology for British rule .

		And it is well that we are thus prepared ; for Mr.
Fielding-Hall	PERSON	is in deadly earnest , and with the very first chapter , headed `` Indian Unrest , '' we are plunged into a stream of contention from which we never wholly emerge .

		In dealing with the discontent manifested in various parts of
India	LOCATION	, most writers declare that it is more or less local and temporary and instigated primarily by dissatisfied Brahman s ; but this view is regarded by our author as a fatal mistake .

		He believes that the unrest is caused by the slowly growing consciousness of an energy that desires an advance in every direc - tion and has no outlet . ''

		Throughout
India	LOCATION	all progress of all sorts is barred ; can you wonder there is unrest from this one cause alone ?

		And this feeling goes down to the very lowest ranks as an unnameable , unanalysable fever and un - happiness ; you see it everywhere . ''

		And in pondering this opinion one must remember that the writer is not some globe-trotting American or some radical English member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, spending a few weeks in
Bombay	LOCATION	or Delhi or
Calcutta	LOCATION	, but a veteran official who has served in
Burma	LOCATION	for many years .

		Moreover , he believes that all this unrest is not a bad symptom , but a good one , `` a sign of an increasing life . ''

		It is at once '' the greatest compliment our rule could have , and the happiest omen that could be .


India	LOCATION	was our patient ; now she is recovering , shall we make of her a subject , or a daughter ?

		She must be one or other , or leave us altogether , for the past is passed . ''

		Then the author proceeds to set forth how the factors of success in British rule disappeared , and to explain how unsuitable the present system of government has become .

		In the first place he is sure the personnel of the whole service has greatly deteriorated in the last fifty years .

		The men of former times went out younger and with less education .

		They were without prejudices .

		They were enthusiastic and friendly ; and they had individualities .

		They knew the people 's talk , made Indian friends , and looked upon the natives as fellow-humans .

		But now , alas , the victims of education come out '' with their minds already closed , and , as a rule , closed they remain . ''

		They disregard all the facts about the natives ; and having no real understanding of the people , they have no sympathy with them .

		In short , they are an impossible lot .

		And this shade of Stygian pessimism falls over every chapter that deals with the present .

		Everything is wrong .

		Nothing , apparently , could be worse ; yet everything threatens to grow worse , unless prompt and energetic remedies are applied at once .

		But the destructive criticism of the volume
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 381 is its least satisfactory feature ; and I hasten to the constructive proposals , reserving any comment on the former until we have considered the latter .

		Incidentally , in weighing the sug - gested improvements , we shall gain a fair idea of the strictures we have omitted .

		Passing , then , to this more pleasing phase of the book , we find our author insisting first that the necessary personality must be '' restored '' to the task of governing
India	LOCATION	.

		Now the import - ance of personality is the only point on which all critics of things Indian agree : the question is how to attract the right sort of men .

		And here Mr.
Fielding	PERSON	-
Hall	PERSON	says emphatically there will be no improvement until English education is entirely remodelled .

		At present , he declares , women and clergymen control English educa - tion , and the supreme ideal is '' authority . ''

		This system must be replaced by a virile plan of development that shall evoke independent minds and sympathetic hearts .

		Then the prospective Indian civil servant should be caught young , not later than nineteen or twenty , and should only be appointed if he possesses the following quali - fications : * ' A good physique and a liking for sport .

		Good manners and a knowledge of eti - quette .

		Discipline in act .

		Freedom and courage in thought .

		Knowledge of life and humanity as they are round him . ''

		Our youthful civilian 's real education will begin when he lands in
India	LOCATION	.

		Once arrived , he should learn the language -LRB- presumably the language of the district wherein he is likely to work -RRB- .

		Then he must get an understanding of the principles that underlie the Codes and Acts .

		He must acquire a genuine insight into the cus - toms of the people and the meaning thereof .

		He should know something of the economic side of native life .

		In particular he should de - termine to encourage amusements , including all sorts of manly sports for the boys and dancing for the girls .

		When the personnel has been reorganized on this basis , it will be feasible to revive the legal system , beginning with the penal law , criminal courts and procedure .

		In criminal procedure the most pressing need is to have an accused person , when arrested , taken directly to the magistrate without being questioned by the police .

		The magistrate should investigate each case ; and on trial no one but the magistrate should be allowed to speak directly to any party to the case .

		-LRB- '' There is no such curse now to justice as cross-examination by a clever pleader or barrister . '' -RRB-

		If this system were adopted , there would not be much false evidence , because the native idea that the trial is simply a fight would largely disappear .

		And then some day might come the possibility of self-government .

		But this must begin with the village .

		The village organism must be re - stored to the state in which the British found it , and from that point be helped and encouraged to grow to greater things .

		Using
Burma	LOCATION	as an example , the author urges that every village should have a
Council	ORGANIZATION	, with a Headman chosen by the
Council	ORGANIZATION	from its own members and con - firmed by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		This important official should be responsible to the village Council ; and the British would retain ultimate control by authorizing the District Officer to suspend the
Council	ORGANIZATION	when it failed too seriously in its duties .

		To the village communities thus constituted should be handed over all the rights and responsibilities that could possibly be de - volved upon them .

		They should be encouraged to do everything ; and they should form the basis for all development .

		Gradually , larger divisions should be organ - ized as unified groups , and from the new `` Districts '' representatives might be sent to a
Provincial Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		We should thus have real though indirect representation of the people .

		At present the
General Council	ORGANIZATION	and the Pro- vincial Councils are merely '' suspended in the air . ''

		`` They rest on nothing ; they mean noth - ing ; they have as much solidity and reality as kites would have .

		Was there ever in history a reductio ad absurdum like these Councils of Despair ? ''

		In the education of the natives , reading , writing , and arithmetic are not fundamental .

		The essential things are qualities of character .

		To develop these , education must be entirely separated from religion , and must be native to the province concerned .

		Here again we must begin with the village and work outward .

		With regard to the policy of admitting more Indians to the civil service , our author declares flat-footedly that they ought not to be encour - aged , and that they themselves are happier out - side of it . ''

		Government must do its work in its own way , and that is the English way .

		No Indian can tell what this is . ''

		He denies also that the placing of natives in office would placate the people .

		In the foregoing paragraphs I have essayed an absolutely impartial summary of the essential phases of a book that is to me most irritating .

		The author is an able man , a clever writer , a trained administrator .

		He has spent in
India	LOCATION	more years than many writers spend months .

		382 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	He proposes certain improvements that I con - sider vital and fundamental .

		Thus , he is cer - tainly right when he insists on the importance of the village as the unit of reform .

		The average traveller knows nothing of the village and cares less ; but the resident administrator , or absent student , realizes that here is to be found the real
India	LOCATION	.

		In fact , I think Mr.
Field	PERSON	ing -
Hall	PERSON	's treatment of this question is more significant than half a dozen ordinary volumes on
India	LOCATION	.

		Furthermore , he is undeniably sound in dwel - ling upon the importance of personality , and in pointing out the possibility of reforms in legal procedure .

		He inevitably evokes the sympathy of a believer in free government and democracy , when he looks forward to comparative independ - ence for this richest domain of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		But after conceding all this , I must respectfully and modestly plead that he is frequently un - trustworthy .

		He constantly proves too much ; and I think a fair idea of his attitude may be gathered from the following explosion against '' things at home '' : '' Can we , with whom representation except of the wire-pullers of the party has ceased to exist , in whose schools of all kinds and in whose universities there is no education , whose legal system is bad beyond all ex - pression , who have under free forms less real freedom than most other countries , can we give to
India	LOCATION	what we have not ? ''

		Now it will be very difficult to convince any intelligent American that such a sentence rep - resents a lucid or dispassionate estimate of the present situation in
Great Britain	LOCATION	; and I need only say that this same sweeping ferocity of condemnation vitiates page after page of a rather remarkable book .

		There is enough to condemn and bewail in Indian administration , as any student knows , and lurid coloring may help to attract the general attention necessary to ensure reforms ; but surely a man of Mr.
Fielding-Hall	PERSON	's experience and attainments might have favored us with a judicial exposi - tion instead of a diatribe .

		Not all the British in
India	LOCATION	a hundred years ago were brilliant administrators , nor is every civilian to-day an impenetrable blockhead .

		There is some good in the enlarged
Council of India and Provincial Councils	ORGANIZATION	.

		Occasionally a law case is settled justly .

		Now and again the Headman of a village does faithfully represent his villagers .

		Once in a while a District Officer is even all that our au - thor demands .

		In fact , I am prepared to say that the
Indian Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	is attracting many men of the very finest type .

		All of this , and much more , our critic might have conceded , and thereby strengthened the real points of his contentions .

		As to his conclusion that Indians should not be admitted to the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	, I must raise the query whether their admission would not gradually prepare a supply of fairly trained men for the desired day when British rule may be relaxed .

		Certainly , representative Hindus and
Mohammedans	PERSON	are insisting that their countrymen ought to be admitted in greater numbers and ought to be entrusted with more responsible posts .

		Again , when he maintains that Indian education should be made non - religious , Mr.
Fielding-Hall	PERSON	assuredly contra - dicts the general opinion of both Oriental and
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	writers ; although my own belief is that in the long run his contention will be justified .

		Herewith I have left myself little space for specific corrections ; but one is naturally dis - turbed to find the population given sometimes as three hundred millions and sometimes as three hundred and fifty .

		If I remember rightly , the last available census gives three hundred and fifteen millions .

		Again , it is not reassuring to find the following generalization taken as a basis for law reform : '' Everyone instinctively hates and fears crime ; everyone is honest by nature ; it is inherent in the soul . ''

		Nor does a reader receive the impression of careful statement from the declaration that the
Government	ORGANIZATION	has delib - erately -LRB- italics mine -RRB- made sixty thousand or more criminals in
Burma	LOCATION	.

		But if the book is marred by such major and minor defects as these , why spend so much time about it ?

		Just because it is exactly what I have described , an improbable mingling of valuable suggestions and stimulating mistakes .

		And I have no hesitation in saying that it will be pro- fitable reading for any American desiring to understand Indian problems .

		Only it must not be accepted as holy writ .

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 383 ous edition , the facsimile plates forming the third volume , although possibly over-vivid in color , are especially well done .

		Before discus - sing Dr.
Budge	PERSON	's treatment of his subject in volumes one and two , it is perhaps worth while to state briefly the developments in Egyptian mortuary beliefs which led to the manufacture and use of such documents as the Papyrus of Ani .

		The oldest known remains of Egyptian re - ligious literature are the Pyramid Texts in the pyramids of the last five important rulers of the Old Kingdom .

		These inscriptions will have been cut on the walls during the period from
2650	DATE	to
2500	DATE	B. c. , though internal evidence indicates that some portions originated as early as 3500 B. c .

		Their content is a jumbled mass of funerary ritual , hymns , myths , magical charms , and prayers , the whole clearly directed to the great end of protecting and prospering the king in a future life .

		Two main strands of Egyptian belief are now to be separated .

		To the humble folk , in their agricultural pursuits , the fructifying Nile gave each year a vision of life arising out of death , the same lesson upon which we ourselves dwell at the Easter season .

		This principle of fertility , exemplified in the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, its waters , and the springing grain , they called Osiris .

		The long myth which arose about Osiris pictured him as reigning ultimately in a kingdom of the dead .

		His conquest of death made possible for others the same victory .

		Already in the
Pyra	ORGANIZATION	- mid Texts we find the dead king identified with Osiris and passing to his realm , side by side and intermingled with a belief in a royal Here - after spent in the sky with the Sun-god .

		With the decentralizing of power at the breaking up of the Old Kingdom -LRB- after
2500	DATE	B. c. -RRB- and the rise of a group of feudal lords several centuries later , came the thought that the blessed future life previously imputed to the king alone might , like the power he had pre - viously wielded , be shared by his subjects .

		This innovation is evidenced by coffins of the
Middle Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- about
2000	DATE	B. c. -RRB- .

		These also show that , though the Sun-god had definitely become the chief deity of living
Egypt	LOCATION	, Osiris had be - come preeminent among the dead .

		The deceased , whatever rank he may have possessed or lacked on earth , now identified himself in his tomb with Osiris the king .

		So on the coffins of the non-royal in this age are found painted both kingly regalia and utterances corresponding in function to the ancient Pyramid Texts .

		Though the latter lent certain sections to these
Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts	ORGANIZATION	, gradual but constant additions to this type of literature furnished the greater part .

		The magical element which had all along been present now began to receive more and more emphasis .

		Grotesque newly-imagined dangers of the Other World , illustrated by vivid vignettes in addition to verbal descriptions , were to be escaped through newly-invented charms .

		Ma - terials such as these , with a few survivals from the earlier groups , to which some commentary was often appended , constituted under the Empire -LRB- roughly
1500	DATE	B. c. ff . -RRB-

		what is to-day commonly called the '' Book of the Dead . ''

		But this title is misleading .

		The distinct elements , which in the Pyramid Texts we call '' utterances '' and in the later material '' chapters , '' clearly arose in different ages and in different localities .

		From the earliest times they are grouped in vary - ing numbers , in varying order , and with varying phraseology .

		With the increasing dependence on magic , the
Empire Egyptian	ORGANIZATION	found the texts which he deemed necessary for use in gaining a happy Hereafter too numerous to be written on his coffin as had been done for his Middle King - dom ancestors .

		Hence sections of the mortuary literature , varying with individual preference , were assembled on a long roll of papyrus , which was then placed inside the coffin .

		Such a roll is our Papyrus of Ani .

		Not until long centuries afterward , during the Restoration , the last flicker of
Egypt	LOCATION	's glory before its conquest by
Persia	LOCATION	in 525 B. c. , or later under the Ptolemies , do the parts of the '' Book of the Dead '' regularly appear with fixed phraseology and in a fixed order .

		The introductory material provided by Dr. Budge in volume one , although individual facts are abundant , shows but slight appreciation of the continuous development of Egyptian reli - gious thought during millenia .

		He extends the designation '' Book of the Dead '' to cover the whole field of Egyptian religious texts , distin - guishing those of the different ages merely by the unfortunate term `` recensions . ''

		Again , in his discussions of individual divinities , little suggestion is found of the continuous tide of religious thought down the ages , as a result of which primitive local concepts became amalga - mated and modified to form the complex and inconsistent maze of attributes of the Egyptian gods as he pictures them .

		Copious proof-texts cited in hieroglyphic form , sometimes left untranslated -LRB- e. g. , pp. 92 , 180 , 183 -RRB- , impress the lay reader with the learning of the author but fail to throw added 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	light upon his theme .

		Frequent rendering of titles or epithets by transliterations tends like - wise to obscure the thought .

		It might be in place here to caution the reader that he will find no consistency in the spelling of proper names .

		Thus the same god appears as Atem -LRB- p. 109 -RRB- , Atmu -LRB- p.llO -RRB- , Tem -LRB- p. 113 -RRB- , andTemu -LRB- p.ll4 -RRB- .

		Incorrect readings sometimes vie with more cor - rect ones , e.g. , `` Kesta '' -LRB- pp. 386 , 655 , etc. -RRB- , ''
Kesta	PERSON	-LRB- Mesta -RRB- '' -LRB- pp. 127 , 626 , etc. -RRB- , '' Amset '' -LRB- pp. 89 , 131 , etc. -RRB- A similar lack of coordina - tion may be noticed even in the title-pages , which vacillate between a two and a three volume preference .

		Dr.
Budge	PERSON	contends that the Pyramid Texts were for general use , a situation opposite to that which we have indicated above .

		Incident - ally ,
Maspero	PERSON	's early edition of these texts , the one quoted throughout this work , is surpassed in both accuracy and convenience of reference by that of

		The chronology adopted by Dr.

		The modern studies of the great historian
Eduard Meyer	PERSON	* have been over - looked in this work , though in
1908	DATE	our author considered them in the Introduction to his '' Book of the Kings of
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		On the inter - pretation of the ka -LRB- pp. 73-4 -RRB- and of the title of the '' Book of the Dead '' -LRB- p. 28 -RRB- , Professor Breasted 's recent volume , !

		briefly referred to -LRB- p. 74 -RRB- , offers interesting data .

		In his second volume Dr.
Budge	PERSON	has given not only the hieroglyphic transcription and the translation of the portions of the '' Book of the Dead '' contained in the Papyrus of
Ani	PERSON	, but has supplemented them from other papyri with many selections omitted by
Ani	PERSON	.

		Although within the Ani text itself he has occasionally noted corrupt passages -LRB- e.g. , pp. 625 , 627 -RRB- , on the whole he leaves aside textual criticism .

		Now since the '' Book of the Dead '' is in all its copies quite corrupt , careful comparative study is often indispensable , though not always effec - tive , for arriving at the original sense .

		Our editor , by his publication in facsimile of many valuable documents belonging to the British Museum , has done much to facilitate such com - parative study , but has himself been singularly slow to employ it .

		gest the good old days of Egyptology when it was not yet evident even that the Egyptian language , like Hebrew and Arabic , writes no vowels but only the consonants .

		Although the author claims in his preface that the work is `` fully revised to the date of issue , '' it reminds one strongly of perusing the aviation records of
1903	DATE	in search of the latest developments in man 's control of the air .

		The transcription of the plates into hiero - glyphic type is quite successful , in spite of minor errors .

		A GREAT AMERICAN ARCHITECT .

		* From its opening page , Mr.
Alfred Hoyt Granger	PERSON	's study of
Charles Follen McKim	PERSON	raises the great question of architectural ideals on which the judgment of McKim 's work must depend .

		To Mr.
Granger	PERSON	, a disciple , a wor - shipper , we must not look for a solution of this question .

		His is , rather , a passionate advocacy , raised at times above the level of prose by enthusiasm for his master : '' He stood for a national architecture , inspired by beauty and built on the solid foundations of law , order , and tradition . '' ''


Richardson	PERSON	was a poet of a Southern clime , rich , exuberant , and endowed with the superabundant vitality of the Middle Ages .

		McKim was a poet , too , but of a later day , when men were alive to the power of reason and awakened by the renaissance to the potency and charm of order and simplicity . ''

		`` No lover ever served his mistress with a more tender and entire devotion than McKim served Architecture .

		To him she was emphatically the Mother of the Arts , the fount of creative beauty , and for her embellishment he pressed into cooperation with himself all whose work was needed for the perfection of any building . ''

		To Mr.
Granger	PERSON	's enthusiasm we may all heartily subscribe , without at the same time committing ourselves to adoption of the archi - tectural forms which McKim employed .

		The difference of opinion will come in the interpre - tation of the words `` beauty '' ' and `` national . ''

		The road to the beautiful , we moderns believe , is through expression , as the road to the good is through duty .

		Expression in architecture may be of many things of structure , of use , of eternal order , of spiritual inheritance , of * CHAKLEB FOLLEN McKiM .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 385 national individuality .

		The times are rare when conditions are so happy that all can be achieved in equal measure .

		The present moment , with its contradictions of historical retrospect and fresh material creation , is scarcely of these times .

		To express either phase alone is partial and anachronistic .

		To express the very con - tradiction itself as an irreconcilable antagonism , like the conflict of duties , creates tragedy , where it does not create farce .

		The solution lies in a harmonization of the conflicting ele - ments by emphasis on one or the other , the harmony either of the conservative or of the radical .

		McKim was the conservative , who chose to express pervading order rather than specific variety , continuity with the past rather than proud renunciation .

		That he was not always able to achieve these without sacrifice is un - deniable .

		The regularity of the side facades of the
Boston Library	ORGANIZATION	is gained by disguising the interior arrangement ; the imperial splendor of the
Pennsylvania Station	LOCATION	, by the addition of extraneous parts and by literal reproduction of some elements , at least , which suggest another civilization than that of to-day .

		In this , McKim was behind his masters of the Ecole des Beaux Arts , for whom scrupulous obedience to prac - tical requirements was fundamental , and for whom the details of classic form were merely the traditional language for embodying the charac - teristic dispositions and structure of the present .

		The
Bibliothque St. Genevive	ORGANIZATION	, with its single room justifying regularity , its construction frankly exposed on the interior ; the
Gare du Quai d'Orsay	ORGANIZATION	, with its simplicity of plan , its emphasis on the essential and the modern , are buildings parallel to those of McKim 's which show a higher synthesis of qualities within the classic tradition .

		Already the classic tendency in
America	LOCATION	, which McKim helped to restore after a half century of interruption , is catching up with this progress of the interim the exaltation of character as the sine qua non .

		The militant tendency of secession , to be sure , has here been beforehand in this , with its superb solution of the artistic problems of the steel frame and other requirements of modern commercialism .

		Applied to problems more consecrated by time , the buildings of government and of the church catholic for instance , its novel forms might in their turn show some lack of signif - icance .

		A final victory for one or the other of these tendencies , or a fusion of them , it is too early to predict , nor is prophecy necessary for the appreciation of such work as McKim 's .

		Both tendencies are expressive of the present , neither can truly claim an exclusive right to the title of a modern or an American style .

		For one can be pleaded the individuality of American life , for the other its essential cosmopolitanism .

		To a greater extent than with the work of many others , it is true , McKim 's work involved close imitation of prototypes in previous styles .

		This must be recognized as a passing phase of the movement he helped inaugurate , hav - ing , to be sure , its own extenuation in the historical spirit of the nineteenth century by which the still more literal revivals of its earlier years were inspired .

		With McKim himself , moreover , there was always criticism of his orig - inals modifications , refinements , and thus essential originality .

		The
Boston Library	ORGANIZATION	is no more renaissance in its forms than its ancestor , the temple of the
Malatesta	PERSON	at
Rimini	LOCATION	, is Roman .

		The plagiarism is the plagiarism of Shake - speare .

		McKim 's reputation , however , has no need to rest on such achievements .

		The
Bank of Montreal	ORGANIZATION	,
Harvard Hall	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Morgan Li	PERSON	- brary in
New York	LOCATION	, to mention but a few , are fresh creations , perfectly adapted to their func - tions , and alive with expression of character , as well as sympathy for materials and purely architectural harmony .

		Dignity , monumen - tality , and respect for environment are never absent from McKim 's work .

		As a great artist in the handling of brick and stone , wood and metal , to bring out their characteristic beauties , he was surpassed only by his partner
Stanford White	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the purity and assonance of his architectural language , the delicate beauty of proportion and of line , the music of forms , McKim was the first of our time .

		THE GRAIL , ix A NEW LJGHT .

MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		386 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	facts , all these have given her a place in the front rank of authorities in her field .

		In her latest book , '' The Quest of the Holy Grail , '' she summarizes in a coherent statement the theory which her data have at last forced her to form about the many confused and conflicting Grail legends surviving in the tales of
Chretien	LOCATION	,
Wolfram	PERSON	,
Borron	LOCATION	, and other poets of their time .

		Miss
Weston	PERSON	discards , as is now for that matter the fashion , the hypothesis that the Grail came into literature as originally a Christian relic , the cup of the
Eucharist	LOCATION	, and the bleed - ing lance also , the lance of
Longinus	LOCATION	, admit - ting with
Alfred Nutt	PERSON	and others that both talis - mans were of popular origin .

		She nevertheless profoundly modifies the '' folk-lore '' explanation by turning its facts , and some additional ones , into proofs that a consistent ritual ceremony lay at the basis of the Grail story .

		She sums up the now generally accepted evidence as to the nature of the Adonis cults , with their bands of lament - ing women and their mystery service of a dying and reviving god ; in which service a cup and a lance , both equally '' well-known phallic sym - bols , '' played the part of emblems of fertility .

		She assumes that the Grail legend in its account of a solemn procession before a wounded king , a procession in which lance and Grail were carried with awe by a band of wailing maidens , is a revelation of an attempt to initiate a new worshipper into some similar Mysteries .

		She goes further , and offers this suggestion : '' At one time the nature-ritual , upon the due per - formance of which the fertility of the land was held to depend , was celebrated publicly and generally ; but in consequence of the insults offered by a -LRB- probably local -RRB- chieftain and his men to the priestesses of that cult , or maybe to the temple maidens , the open celebra - tion ceased .

		The tradition of these rites , their signifi - cance , and their continued life in some secret stronghold , was , however , preserved in the families of those who had been , perhaps still were , officials of the cult . ''

		Miss
Weston	PERSON	supposes -LRB- and this supposition at least is not far-fetched -RRB- that the Druidic religion , which held `` views on the origin and transmission of life of a profound and compli - cated character , '' and the Irish gods , who bore the double character of '' deities of increase and fertility and lords of life '' -LRB- a character possibly derived from the introduction of the Adonis cult into
Britain	LOCATION	by Phoenician sailors -RRB- all con - tributed to the rite commemorated in the Grail poems .

		Moreover , she thinks the evolution of this account of a Mystery into a romance is easily traceable , since two kinds of story-tellers undoubtedly worked over the material : those who understood its significance , that is , the initiated , and the uninitiated .

		To the latter -LRB- among whom
Chretien	PERSON	is placed -RRB- the talismans , cup and lance , which are found in the tale , would inevitably , during the crusading centu - ries , suggest the instruments of
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's passion and would as inevitably lead to a Christian interpretation of the whole .

		To the others , represented by
Robert de Borron	PERSON	, those who knew the meaning of the story `` from the inside , '' the primitive symbolism of a nature cult became transmuted into the threefold sig - nificance of `` Christian esoteric teaching , '' in which the Grail as the Eucharist stood for the `` Feast of Communion , the actual Body and Blood of the Lord and the source of spiritual life '' -LRB- p. 121 -RRB- .

		A Mystery containing some such threefold meaning Miss Weston thinks may have been developed from the Gnostic heresies by the Knights Templars , whose fall was contemporary with the disuse of the Grail story as a minstrel theme -LRB- p. 136 -RRB- .

		In short , `` the Grail romances are a survival of that period of unrest '' during which there was much `` search for the source of Life , Life physical , Life immortal , '' a search that often preserved the forms of ancient services frowned upon and finally suppressed by the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such , stripped of many interesting details , is the outline of the theory presented in this little book .

		It will certainly command immediate attention , and will as certainly provoke much discussion and disagreement .

		One question that is bound to be brought up very soon is that of the relation of this hypothesis to the so-called '' Christ myth . ''

		Miss Weston leaves no very clear impression as to whether she identifies the Adonis cult with the heretical ceremonies of the Gnostics , or whether the two are different and if so as to which is to be taken for origin of the Grail story .

		Probably the reasonable solution is that the Gnostic heresy was so similar to the pagan beliefs and rites that there is no great need for differentiating them .

		But if that is true , why bring in the Adonis cult at all save as a parallel ?

		An increasingly large body of radi - cal New Testament critics are tending to find in the Gospel story of Christ 's passion the account not of an historic death but of the sac - rifice of the annually dying and reviving fer - tilization god of an obscure Jewish sect ; the Mysteries of this sect again are suspected of having been perpetuated by the Gnostics and of having spread rapidly over what became
Christendom	LOCATION	through their likeness to a toler - ably universal primitive method of invoking fertility at the change of the seasons .

		If this
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 387 basis for the Gospel story should coine to acceptance , it may smooth out some of the diffi - culties in the way of accounting for the
Chris	PERSON	- tianization of material itself probably the very `` Urstoff '' of Christianity .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS . ''

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	'' is a iniaterUfe .

		person to whom no small interest attaches in the minds of those who cherish the Johnsonian legend .

		A new volume , therefore , which has for its title `` The Intimate Letters of
Hester Piozzi	PERSON	and
Penelope Pennington	PERSON	: 1788-1821 '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Oswald G. Knapp	PERSON	, will appeal pleasantly to those readers who have wished for a more satisfying look at the hospit - able mistress of
Streatham Park	LOCATION	than is afforded in the pages of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	or
Madame D'Arblay	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the dates indicate , this correspondence occurred after the breaking of that brilliant circle which brought distinction , incidentally , to the household of the wealthy brewer and his talented wife ;
Thrale	PERSON	was dead ; Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	had married the Italian music master , thereby incurring the wrath of
Johnson	PERSON	, alienating the Burneys , and permanently estranging her own children ;
Johnson	PERSON	himself had died , and new friendships had replaced the old .

		In itself the second marriage appears to have resulted happily .

		Mrs.
Piozzi	PERSON	's literary activities continued , and there was no lack in contemporary appreciation of her intellectual and social gifts .

		Mrs.
Piozzi	PERSON	's corre - spondent , who first appears as Miss
Penelope Weston	PERSON	, was a woman of literary tastes , somewhat younger than her friend , whose acquaintance with the elder woman seems to have begun at about the time of the second marriage .

		The letters here published are almost exclusively those written by Mrs.
Piozzi	PERSON	, and they continue to the year of her death .

		To the casual reader these letters may appear rather incon - sequential ; they certainly contain very little of the Johnsonian sententiousness .

		But they are intimate and vivacious even to the last surprisingly viva - cious for a writer who has passed the three score and ten .

		Their style is obviously characteristic : '' How like herself , how characteristic is every line !

		wild , entertaining , flighty , inconsistent , and clever !

		`` wrote
Fanny Burney	PERSON	, after reading Mrs.
Piozzi	PERSON	's narrative of her continental journey -LRB- 1789 -RRB- ; the comment applies equally well to her correspondence .

		If her gossip on public affairs is not particularly astute , it at least reflects the popular opinion and sentiment of the time ; it is frank and intimate and altogether human . ''

		Dear , lovely , sweet Siddons '' is her effu - sive manner of referring to the queen of tragedy , with whom she and her correspondent were on terms of friendship , and whom she rarely mentions with - out one or more endearing epithets .

		These expres - sions are evidently an indication of an unusually amiable temper which characterizes her statements even when concerned with matters which might easily have called forth harsher terms .

		`` I never was good at pouting when a Miss , '' she says ; '' and after fifteen years are gone , one should know the value of Life better than to pout any part of it away . ''

		As illustrative of the lively humor and the easy colloquialism of her style the following para - graph may be quoted : '' Our Master -LSB-
Piozzi	PERSON	-RSB- is too bad to be diverted by any - thing : 50 hours has that unhappy Mortal lain on an actual rack of torment , nor ever dozed once except for 7 or 8 minutes , not ten .

		'T is truly a dismal life , and Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	has called home
Sally	PERSON	, and Mr.
Davies	PERSON	is making holyday at
Brighthelmston	LOCATION	, and there is nobody to make out whist with good old Mr.
Jones	PERSON	.

		I just had a peep of the Lees and
Greatheeds	PERSON	, it was , however , but a peep .

		We went to Town one night and saw
Euphrasia	LOCATION	, and caught a cold which
Piozzi	ORGANIZATION	attributes to the Kanquroo , etc. , that we carried the children to look at next morning . '

		Ah !

		those Ferocious Beasts are been my Ruin , ' quoth he . ''

		Such public matters as the occurrences in
France	LOCATION	and the scandal about Queen
Caroline	PERSON	are subjects for her comment .

		She is depressed by the suffering due to the hard times of 1799-1800 : '' When the Gardener came yesterday , scratching his head , and saying there would be no wall-fruit this year , I could hardly answer him civilly ; but I did say , For God 's sake , think about the hay and corn , and hang the fine people and their wall-fruit . ''

		Her remarks upon contemporary literature are numerous and interest - ing .

		Just after '' The Mysteries of Udolpho '' ap - peared , she wrote '' -LSB- Mrs.
Radcliffe	PERSON	's -RSB- tricks used to fright Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	and me very much ; but when somebody said her book was like Macbeth , ` Ay , ' replied
H. L. P.	PERSON	, ` about as like as Peppermint Water is to good French Brandy . ' ''

		Scott 's novels she found dull ; Irving 's `` Sketch Book '' was `` pretty enough . ''

		Thus these letters are a real addition to the human documents relative to an interesting age , as well as a frank expression of a notable woman .

		The volume is enriched with thirty-two illustrations , mainly por - traits .

		We notice in the editorial accompaniment two or three slips . ''

		The Vision of Mirza , '' is attrib - uted to
Steele	PERSON	; the line `` There is a tide in the affairs of men , `` etc. , is placed in `` Timon of

		Chronologically , these volumes cover the period from

South Africa	LOCATION	,
May 31 , 1910	DATE	.

		Mr.
Worsfold	PERSON	writes , in part at least , from personal observation , and he has made exhaustive use of the private diaries and papers of Lord
Milner	PERSON	, published official documents , newspapers , and other materials of value .

		He quotes freely from the letters and speeches of
Milner	PERSON	and of other South African officials and leaders .

		His service as editor of the
Johannesburg	LOCATION	`` Star '' during the years
1904	DATE	and
1905	DATE	gave him excep - tional opportunities to follow closely the events of those peculiarly formative years .

		By reason of the importance of the problem of Oriental immigration in the
United States	LOCATION	, the portions of Mr.
Worsfold	PERSON	's volumes which are most likely to prove of interest to American readers are those -LRB- Chaps .

		XI.-XIV . -RRB-

		in which is discussed the question of Chinese labor in the colonies .

		It is shown that the need of large quantities of unskilled labor in the mines is impera - tive , that the requisite laborers can not be found at home , that the attempt to supplement native labor by unskilled European labor has been futile and must ever be so , and that , as Lord
Milner	PERSON	early came to believe , the importation of Chinese coolies is an unwelcome , but the only practicable , solution of the problem .

		The introduction of Chinese labor , first authorized by ordinance in
1904	DATE	, is pronounced `` the cardinal act of Lord
Milner	PERSON	's reconstruction of the new colonies '' ; and the assertion is ventured that no one save Lord
Milner	PERSON	could have induced the
Balfour Ministry	ORGANIZATION	to sanction a proposal which was so certain to evoke a storm of opposition , not only in
South Africa	LOCATION	, but in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	and in
Australia	LOCATION	and
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		To the reviewer of books dealing W ^ ^ e moc ' ern 8ta g e it is surpris - ing that Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	should offer as an apology for writing his `` Studies in Stagecraft '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- the following remarkable statement : `` In this growing age of stagecraft , it is necessary that criticism should bestir itself to keep astride with rapid revolutions in dramatic artistry that are being effected before our very eyes . ''

		Not to mention the ephemeral emanations of the daily and
Sunday	DATE	papers , and the slightly less ephemeral articles in the weekly and monthly magazines , books are constantly being published on all phases of dra - matic activity .

		And there is , too , no lack of con - temporaneity in these treatises , for the plays of last season are passed in review in books published dur - ing the following
summer	DATE	.

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	's volume consists of a number of articles many of which have appeared in popular magazines , where they no doubt served a useful purpose .

		Very little exception may be taken to the ideas set forth ; they are in accord for the most part with the best modern criticism .

		One finds it hard , however , to agree with the defini - tion of poetry as '' in a large and general sense ... that solemn , tremulous happiness that overcomes us when we become unwittingly and poignantly aware of the existence and the presence of the beautiful . ''

		Since when has poetry become happiness , even on the stage ?

		One of the most suggestive chapters in the book makes a plea for a new type of play , for the `` extensive '' instead of the `` intensive '' drama , for the synthetic instead of the analytic .

		`` It will not content itself with the analysis of character within constricted bounds of time and place , but will attempt to represent the logical development of character in many places and through many times .

		It will not be realistic but impressionistic , not prosaic but poetic . ''

		This type of play will be made possible by the invention of stage devices , already seen in the revolving stage , and in the simplification of scenery , shown in the work of
Gordon Craig	PERSON	and
Max Rein	PERSON	- hardt .

		Is not the Irish theatre already doing what Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	predicts ?

		Certainly the Irish plays have poetry , they are not narrowly intensive , and they are not burdened by the demands of elaborate settings .

		Synge 's `` Deirdre of the Sorrows '' points to a larger drama than the intensive work in ``
Hindle Wakes	PERSON	, '' and is free from the technical artificiality of the plays of Pinero .

		Naturally , then , the list of volumes dealing with these tempting scenes is almost appallingly long ; but we have no hesitation in saying that Mr.
Harry Charles Lukach	PERSON	was justified in adding to the number with `` The Fringe of the East '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is always easy to say exactly what makes a successful book of travel , unless one begins to recall the vast range of differences among the classic works of this description , or even among those we describe as readable .

		In the present instance the explanation would seem to lie not merely in the catholicity of the author 's interest and his scholarly training , but also in his appreciation of little things , his enjoyment of fun , and a delightfully irrespons - ible habit of introducing unexpected bits of folk-lore and unfamiliar literature .

		Furthermore , he does not weary the reader by dwelling unduly on what is perfectly well known to everybody .

		Thus , in his
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 389 chapters on the Holy Land and the neighboring dis - tricts , while he does not neglect the often described scriptural sites , he directs our interest very agreeably to
Mohammedan	LOCATION	mosques , or to castles and other monuments of the incredible Crusaders , who give the impression that they must have built with one hand while they fought with the other .

		However , we may leave Mr.
Lukach	PERSON	's readers to make a further analysis for themselves ; whatever the causes , the book is enjoyable throughout .

		It is written in an easy narrative style , and contains nearly eighty illus - trations , most of them genuinely helpful .

		A useful map may be found in an obscure place after the in - dex , although no mention of it is made in the table of contents .

		_ The effect of mnt h series of Silliman Me - ttimuius in morial Lectures at
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, living subitance .

		delivered by Professor
Max Verworn	PERSON	of the
Physiological Institute of the University of Bonn	ORGANIZATION	, is now published in a volume entitled `` Irri - tability : A Physiological Analysis of the
General Effect of Stimuli	ORGANIZATION	in Living Substance '' -LRB-
Yale Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Press -RRB- .

		The author is a physiologist of inter - national reputation , and a specialist on the subject of irritability and its consequence in the living substance , fatigue .

		He views and analyzes life processes in terms of his specialty , though careful to acknowledge the arbitrary element in such a classi - fication and to admit the absence of isolated systems in the world of life .

		The work deals with the his - tory of the analysis of stimuli and irritability , with the principles underlying research upon living sub - stance and the conception of life as the entire sum of vital conditions and also as a property of the whole complex .

		Stimulus is defined as every alter - ation , positive or negative , in external vital conditions , while changes in internal states in the organism are conveniently designated as `` development . ''

		The quality of stimulus and its effects , quantitative and qualitative , upon metabolism , its relation to patho - logical conditions as well as to hypertrophy and atrophy , are discussed at length , as are also the physiological indicators of the process of excitation and fatigue .

		The results of exhaustive researches into the physiological analysis of normal stimulation are applied to the problems of fatigue , asphyxiation , and narcosis .

		The work is technical , being designed primarily for the physiologist ; but it is written with a view to the larger relations of the subject , so that its circle of service is much widened .

		The style is made piquant at times by some lingering Teutonisms .

		One marvels that a scientific book of this sort should be issued without an index , and should contain the misspelled names of
Weismann	PERSON	and
Strasburger	PERSON	.

		It is also to be regretted that the history of tropisms should be discussed at length in a series of lectures before an American audience without reference therein to the work of Professor
Jacques Loeb	PERSON	and his pupils , and that stimuli and oxidation should be analyzed without reference to Professor
Loeb	PERSON	's epoch - making discoveries in artificial parthenogenesis .

		The lets seriout tide of things .

		^ 8ort ^ mo ^ icrous iiu ' , oiisH < j uential - ity , with an underlying method in fa e ma -LRB- j ne88 o f ^ j s the keynote of Mr.
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	's `` Post Impressions '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , a book of brisk little sketches originally published in the ``
Saturday	DATE	Magazine '' of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' hence the title of the volume .

		The same nimble wit that gave delight in `` Through the Outlooking Glass '' and `` The American Cine - matograph '' banishes drowsiness when we dip into these `` Post Impressions . ''

		Among the favorite objects of the author 's playful satire we find the college curriculum , and the erudite German pro- fessor , and much of the educational machinery in general .

		In his most characteristic vein is the fol - lowing amusing absurdity : `` It is true that we are still without a definitive text of the Gilbert librettos .

		For this we must wait until Professor Rucksack , of
the University of Kissingen	ORGANIZATION	, has published the results of his monumental labours .

		So far , we have from his learned pen only the text for the first half of the second act of ` The Mikado . '

		This is in accordance with the best traditions of German scholarship , which demands that the second half of anything shall be published before
the first half	DATE	. ''

		In
Gilbert	PERSON	's self-made men Ko-Ko , the Lord High Chancellor , and others he finds `` matter enough for an entire volume , '' and adds : `` I throw out the suggestion in the hope that it will be some day taken up as the subject of a Ph.D. thesis in the
University of Alaska	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Admirable fooling will be found in plenty between the two covers of Mr.
Strunsky	PERSON	's little book .

		Avertatile Italian in
Mogul India	LOCATION	.

		Under the d l S ^ 1 `` A Pepys of Mogul
India	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Miss Margaret Irvine	PERSON	has prepared a convenient and readable abridgment of her father 's `` masterly edition '' of
Niccolao Manucci	PERSON	's `` Storia do Mogor . ''

		In the year
1656	DATE	this Venetian wanderer , then a boy of seventeen , found himself a friendless stranger in
India	LOCATION	; but he was a resource - ful youth , and resourcefulness often seems coupled with good fortune .

		At first he became an artillery - man ; but by degrees he qualified himself to practise medicine , or , at any rate , to impress even the highest class natives with his powers of healing .

		One way or another he found himself intimately associated with the court life of the day ; and his pictures of the daily farings and doings of princes and prin - cesses form one of the most attractive features of the book .

		At times he even rose to positions of considerable diplomatic influence , which made his notes a valuable source for political history .

		His career was almost fantastically picturesque , and fortunately he wrote voluminously , and often graph - ically , about everything that interested him , from the remarkable administering of a remarkable enema to important questions of imperial relations .

		In fact , his wide-ranging and human-hearted pages almost justify
Miss Irvine	LOCATION	in adopting for him the 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	conjuring name of the inimitable English diarist , although , of course , there is only one
Pepys	PERSON	.

		Manucci has long been a sort of mine for the scholar ; and the present redaction will introduce him favorably to a wider public as a very vital and interesting personality moving in a strange and varicolored environment .

		A volume of odds and ends having a wide ran S e of Vai 7 in g. interest appears from the pen of Miss
Mary E. Waller	PERSON	under the title , `` From an Island Out - post '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		If for no other reason than that
Miss Waller	PERSON	is the author of '' The Wood -
Carver	PERSON	of ` Lympus '' one is attracted by this pro- duction of hers in a very different vein , dealing with the facts of her own experience , outer and inner , rather than the fictions of her fertile inven - tion .

		Musings and memories indulged in during quiet weeks and months at
Nantucket	LOCATION	form the sub - stance of the book , and the pages are touched with a reality , sometimes a homely reality , that delights the discerning reader .

		`` I made some beach plum jelly
this morning	TIME	, '' the writer tells us in opening her third chapter ; `` it is the thing to do at this sea - son in
Nantucket	LOCATION	.

		It was a failure .

		Although it was firm and clear the taste was not right .

		I must try again . ''

		A little later she exclaims : `` Ah , these common things of life !

		What balance , what poise they give us when we are forced to breast alone the overwhelming flood of adverse circumstance ! ''

		On a theme quite different from beach plum jelly she writes : `` The ideal holds the truth in suspension .

		With Ibsen it seems to be ideals versus truth .

		The trouble seems to be that he has laid his foundation stones in wrong relation to the superstructure en delit , as is said of the quarried stratified rocks when placed in the walls contrary to their manner of lying in the stratum . ''

		Miss
Waller	PERSON	has fulness of life and wealth of thought to draw upon for the enrichment of such a book as she now offers to her readers .

		Counsel for Under the engaging title , `` Minds in mental Distress '' -LRB- Luce -RRB- , Dr.
A. E. Bridger	PERSON	sufferers .

		o f L on -LRB- j on endeavors to provide `` a psychological study of the masculine and the femi - nine mind in health and in disorder . ''

		The author is impressed , as are many of his fraternity on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, with the desirability of placing before those whose interest or whose nervous lia - bilities inspires them with the importance of mental hygiene , some words of insight and correction and aid .

		To offer a life-preserver to minds in distress is concentrated philanthropy .

		Would that the wish were as readily the father of the deed as of the thought ; unfortunately , good wishes leave no off -
spring	DATE	.

		The execution of Dr.
Bridger	PERSON	's task suffers from a doctrinaire attitude , which results in an estrangement of precept and practice or in an aim - less issue when they meet .

		The ingredients of the book are well chosen ; but the composite is hardly a Brief essays on books and life .

		composition , for the ingredients do not compose .

		The central distinction which makes the neuras - thenic the clue to the masculine , and the hysterical the clue to the feminine liability , is sound and is coming to be more and more recognized .

		But a clue is not a solution , any more than a plot is a story .

		The lay reader rightly demands a story , not a series of incidents out of which a story could be made .

		He is likely to find this volume disappointing , perhaps unduly so because of the allurement of its title .

		Their crisp brevity will recommend to many hurried readers the short papers included in Professor
Richard Burton	PERSON	's `` Little Essays in Literature and Life '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , collected chiefly from the pages of `` The
Bellman	PERSON	, '' and grouped under five heads : '' Nature , '' '' Man and Society , '' '' Art and Letters , '' `` Education , '' and `` Facetiae . ''

		Though allowing himself as a rule but a scanty five pages for each theme , the author contrives to say much that is significant and interesting on the matter in hand .

		In the course of a few paragraphs devoted to his own five-year-old daughter we note especially his quick perception of `` the exceeding silliness of ` talking down ' to a little one who looks up to you in the physical sense , since you are the taller ; but who looks down on you and patronizes you from a height of spiritual superiority that is beyond plummet - line , measure , or mark . ''

		And on the old , old theme , the nature of humor , he observes , not too tritely , that `` what is true of the nation is true of the indi - vidual ; a great humorist not a mere mountebank whose verbal somersaults in the paper amuse us for the moment is always one who has a big , sympa - thetic , sensitive soul , terribly aware of the tragic possibilities of the ticklish business of living .

		Aris - tophanes ,
Rabelais	ORGANIZATION	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, they are all brothers under the skin in this respect . ''

		Such essays as those on `` Criticism and Cant , '' `` Blunders and Blunderers , '' `` Loafing , '' `` Book One Hundred One , '' `` St.
Augustine	PERSON	and
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, '' and many more that might be named from the attractive table of contents , lure by their mere title ; nor is the lure deceptive or disappointing .

		Benedick said truly that '' Every one Can ^ USbBf * g rief but he that has * '' Such a book as Mr.
Bolton Hall	PERSON	's on `` The Mastery of Grief '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- must of necessity contain maxims much easier of utterance than of application .

		Yet it is a sane and thoughtful discus - sion of the subject , with apt quotations from other authors , and with wise avoidance of mysticism , of dogma , of anything that might fail to appeal to the common sense of the average reader .

		The succes - sive chapters , admirable for their brevity , treat of such themes as the tragedy of death , regrets , the diversion of the mourner 's thoughts , the course of nature , the funeral rites , the persistence of life , science and immortality , and the breakdown of faith .

		A single brief extract will indicate the spirit of the
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 391 book . ''

		They say to you ' Have faith . '

		They might as well say to those suffering in poverty ` Have money . '

		We have reason , and must satisfy the reason before we can have a reasonable faith . ''

		A timely word is uttered in the chapter beginning , `` One of the ways we have of adding to our own pain lies in our funeral customs .

		We are but little less heathen than our ancestors in this direction . ''

		The fact that Mr.
Hall	PERSON	is a man of affairs rather than a preacher gives his book a certain weight and value that it might not otherwise have .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
Jacques Loeb	PERSON	's '' Artificial Parthenogenesis and Fertilization '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a revision and enlargement , by the author , of an English translation of his '' Die chemische Entwicklungserre - gung des tierischen Eies '' which appeared in
1909	DATE	.

		It provides , in very convenient form , a digested summary of the brilliant series of researches which were origi - nally published in the form of short papers in many widely scattered technical journals .

		Experienced in the telling of stories to children -RRB- Miss
Julia Darrow Cowles	PERSON	writes wisely and well in her book on '' The Art of Story-Telling '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , a compact little volume with every one of its chapters very much to the purpose .

		She discusses story - telling in the home and in the school , the choice of stories and how to tell them effectively , the various kinds of stories suitable for children , the joy of story-telling , and the art of it , all this , and more also , in Part I. Part II .

		contains nearly half a hundred good short stories , old and new , a title index and a topical index to these , and a classified list of books for the story - teller .

		Miss Cowles writes persuasively , and her book will do good .

		Undoubtedly the most widely read and in many respects the most valuable book devoted to our Amer - ican aborigines is
Catlin	PERSON	's '' Indians , '' or , to give the work its full title , '' The Manners , Customs , Languages , History , and Conditions of the North American Indians . ''

		Its author ,
George Catlin	PERSON	, was a portrait painter who conceived the plan of making as complete a pictorial record as possible , direct from the subject , of the various types and customs of the American red man ; and for eight years -LRB- 1832-1839 -RRB- he gave himself wholly to this task .

		Of the book embodying his observations and ex - periences during this period , and containing reproduc - tions of his principal paintings , several editions were published ; but all have been long out of print , and un - obtainable except at prices prohibitive to the ordinary buyer .

		It is therefore a decided boon to have a new edition of the work , with both text and illustrations printed -LRB- as we are informed -RRB- from the original plates , and published at a price which is only an inconsiderable fraction of the sum usually brought by the early edi - tions at auction .

		Messrs.
Leary	PERSON	,
Stuart & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of this new edition , which is in two large volumes , well printed and substantially bound .

		The illustrations number one hundred and eighty full-page plates , printed in color by lithography .

		With this new edition available , there is now no reason why
Catlin	PERSON	's `` Indians '' should not be in every public library of the country , however small .

		NOTES .

		Mr.
H. De Vere Stacpoole	PERSON	, the novelist , has recently completed a philosophical work entitled `` The New Optimism , '' which
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish .

		The wide field of the author 's optimism may be inferred from the sub-title : '' An exposition of the evolution of the solar universe , incidentally of life , and finally of man . ''

		, A series of `` Elliott Monographs in the Romance Languages and Literatures , '' edited by Mr.
Edward C. Armstrong	PERSON	, is being projected by the

		A preliminary committee , headed by Gen.
Francis Henry Appleton	PERSON	, and including Mrs. Mar - garet

		Mr.
Winslow	PERSON	is secretary of this committee .


S. R. Crockett	PERSON	, the Scottish novelist , died on
April 20	DATE	, at the age of fifty-four .

		For several years he was a minister in the Free Church of
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		His first publication , issued in
1886	DATE	, was a volume of poems .

		This was followed seven years later by '' The Stickit Minister , '' which became a great popular success , and has always remained his most widely-read book .

		Since that time a long list of fiction and children 's books has issued from his pen , beginning with '' The Raiders '' and '' The Lilac Sunbonnet , '' and ending with ''
Sandy	PERSON	, '' published two or three months ago .

		The
New York Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	is raising a fund of
$ 18,000	MONEY	as half of the sum needed to purchase and preserve in the caskets in which
Robert Browning	PERSON	placed them the entire collection of love letters of
Elizabeth Barrett	PERSON	and
Robert Browning	PERSON	.

		The chief librarian of the
British Museum	ORGANIZATION	has announced that British funds to an equal amount will be forthcoming if
America	LOCATION	will do her share .

		The letters are obtainable from the present owner for approximately the purchase price .

		Contributions to the fund may be sent to the

		The papers of
Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar	ORGANIZATION	have been acquired by the

Texas	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	and for biographies of prominent Mexican and Texan his - torical characters , and of his more or less fragmentary manuscript histories and biographies based upon that material . ''

		It is also pointed out that while the collection is obviously most valuable for the history of
Texas	LOCATION	, espe - cially from
1821	DATE	to
1841	DATE	, it also contains material for the history of
Nicaragua	LOCATION	and
Costa Rica	LOCATION	in
1858-9	DATE	, when

		433 THE CONSECRATED LIFE .

		When the men who followed
Garibaldi	PERSON	from
Rome	LOCATION	asked what their reward should be , they got this answer : `` Fame , sete , marcie for - zate , battaglie , e morte . ''

		And they accepted the promise of this guerdon as that best be - fitting their high enterprise .

		When
Ibsen 's Brand	ORGANIZATION	had taken his followers half-way to the heights , they halted , demanding guaran - ties , and got this uncompromising speech from their leader : '' How long the war will last ?

		As long as life , till ye have cast All ye possess before the Lord , And slain the Spirit of Accord ; Until your stiff will bend and bow , And every coward scruple fall Before the bidding : Nought or All !

		What will you lose ?

		Your gods abhorr 'd , Your feasts to Mammon and the Lord , The glittering bonds ye do not loathe And all the pillows of your sloth !

		What will you gain ?

		A will that 's whole , A soaring faith , a single soul , The willingness to lose , that gave Itself rejoicing to the grave ; A crown of thorns on every brow ; That is the wage you 're earning now ! ''

		But it did not suit
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's satirical purpose to endow his Norwegians with the heroic at - tributes of the Italians who shed their blood at
Aspromonte	LOCATION	; the former were of different stuff , and made terms with the powers against which they had revolted .

		Yet the call was in both cases the same a call to make the most complete sacrifice of self in the interests of a lofty impersonal ideal , and it is a call that comes to most men at some time or other , offering the choice between security and peril , between comfort and hardship , between sav - ing life to lose it , and losing it to save it , ac - cording to the aspect of the problem upon which the individual 's eyes are set .

		In the eyes of the world , devotion to a cause or sacrifice for it without the prospect of reward is viewed as the act of a madman , so entangled are most minds in the network of sordid motives which seem to direct most human activities .

		And yet such disinterested endeavor is the very essence of the system which gives the name of `` Christian '' to our 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	modern civilization .

		`` Die to live '' is its categorical imperative , as the children of light know by both instinct and precept , but the thought is a jest to the children of this world , with their frozen sympathies and their dull self-interest .

		What does a man get by closing his eyes to the obligation of unre - quited service , which is the germinal principle of every religious and ethical system ?

		The whole world , perchance ; but only at the loss suggested in terrible and memorable words by the Founder of our official faith : `` How much do you think Homer got for his Iliad ?

		Or
Dante	PERSON	for his Paradise ? ''

		is
Ruskin	PERSON	's scornful question .

		`` Only bitter bread and salt , and going up and down other people 's stairs . ''

		The world calls it failure , because the world is set on hedonism , and can not see that above the good which is called happiness there is the purer good known to the poets and the saints and the knights of the spirit as blessedness .

		The material world is so very near and real to us , and the spiritual world so dimly apprehended save by the vision `` purged with euphrasy and rue . ''

		And yet , often enough for our example and sustaining comfort , individual lives shine out from the murky welter of our common humanity as beacons to light the pilgrim 's path toward the
Celestial City	LOCATION	.

		A Father
Damien	PERSON	, a
Florence Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	, a
Mazzini	PERSON	, a
William Lloyd Gar	PERSON	- rison , lives and dies from time to time in the service of mankind , and leaves an example to refute the cynical view of human nature .

		One of the most disheartening features of our modern life is the tendency , on the part of public servants , to reduce their relations with the community to a basis of dollars and cents .

		In voting themselves salaries , the mem - bers of the
English House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	have immeasurably lowered the standards of public life , and in the greed with which Ameri - can officials performing legislative functions almost everywhere filch as much as they dare from the public treasury we have a signifi - cant example of the blighting influence of the money motive .

		For in such cases as these the opportunity for service is everything , and the personal reward should count for less than nothing to persons who would keep their patriotism free from suspicion .

		Even the daily worker , dependent upon his wages for support , should find his chief satisfaction in performing the most work possible , and of the best quality of which he is capable , rather than in the contents of his pay envelope .

		The work is the thing , and its reward only the ac - cident ; and yet we find the progress of most industrial nations hampered by the purblind course of their workers , intent chiefly upon doing the smallest possible amount of work that will suffice to keep them at their jobs .

		And thus we find it in all the walks of life ; the thought of the pay comes first , and the quality of the performance is only secondary .

		The preacher in his pulpit , the teacher at his desk , the writer in his study , the lawyer or the physician in his office , are each and all preoccupied with the thought of what their labor is to bring them in material returns rather than with the conscious joy that comes from doing things as they should be done .

		There are of course exceptions to this sweep - ing condemnation all sweeping statements about human nature have their exceptions but the general attitude of men to their ap - pointed labors is discouragingly apparent .

		Can it then be wondered that , with this un - wholesome temper of the general mind , life should seem dull and joyless to most men and women ?

		Will they never learn that the one universal and unfailing
spring	DATE	of joy is in the exercise of the faculties to the fullest effect and with the largest result .

		This is equally true of the statesman and the brick - layer , and either will miss the meaning of life if satisfaction in the material returns from his labors fills a larger place in his con - sciousness than pride in the amount and qual - ity of his achievement .

		Out of the
East	LOCATION	comes wisdom .

		And the processes of the Oriental mind have always been such as to make that mind peculiarly fitted to deal with the larger abstractions which concern thought and conduct .

		Writing in `` The Hibbert Journal , '' the great Indian poet
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	thus reduces to their last analysis the reflections which we have sought to set forth more or less con - cretely : '' When a man begins to have an extended vision of his self , when he realizes that he is much more than what he is at present , he begins to grow con - scious of his moral nature .

		Then he knows that what he is yet to be , the state not yet experienced by him , is real , more real than what is under his direct experience .

		Necessarily , his perspective of life changes , and his will takes the place of his wishes .

		For will is the wish of the larger life , life whose greater portion is out of our present reach and most of whose objects are not before our sight .

		Then comes the conflict of our lesser man with our
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 405 greater man , our wish with our will , the desire for things that are before our senses with our purpose which is within our mind .

		Then we begin to dis - tinguish between what we desire and what is good .

		For good is that which is desirable for our greater self .

		Thus the sense of the goodness comes out of the truer view of our life , which is the connected view of the wholeness of the field of life , that takes into account not only what is present before us , but what is not , and perhaps never shall be .

		The man who is provident feels for that life of his which is not yet existent , feels much more for that than for the life that is with him ; therefore he is ready to sacrifice his present inclination for the unrealized future .

		In this he becomes great , for he realizes truth .

		Even to be efficiently selfish one has to recog - nize this truth , and has to curb his immediate im - pulses of selfishness ; in other words , he must be moral .

		For our moral faculty is the faculty by which we know that life is not made up of frag - ments purposeless and discontinuous . ''

		`` To distinguish between what we desire and what is good . ''

		This seems to be the innermost secret of life .

		It is the secret ap - prehended of the saints and sages and poets , the secret which is revealed through sympathy and the philosophic understanding , the secret displayed as in an open book by the human heart and by the aspects of nature , the secret which , fathomed by
Wordsworth	PERSON	, created in him that precious mood of exaltation in which he could say : '' To the brim My heart was full ; I made no vows , but vows Were then made for me ; bond unknown to me Was given , that I should be , else sinning greatly , A dedicated Spirit . ''

		There is no sphere or activity of life that does not have the need , and offer the oppor - tunity , for dedicated spirits .

		Theirs it is to have the only consciousness that has no touch of bitterness , to know the only joy that is pure .

		`` Men have such need of joy , '' is the cry of another poet , `` but joy whose grounds are true . ''

		Yet it can never come into the lives of men who have not penetrated the thought expressed by our Indian sage .

		THE LANGUAGE OF THE UNLETTERED .

		Dialectic regeneration is said to be the cry - ing need at present of our effete and anaemic language , and the attempt to restore to it some of the vigorous and racy words and ex - pressions of a ruder age is not to be frowned upon .

		There is something about the unaffect - edness , the directness , the rugged strength and artless picturesqueness of untutored speech that refreshes the ear wearied with the stud - ied correctness and self-conscious refinement of cultured utterance .

		In the mouths of the plain people , of those concerned much more with the vivid and often grim realities of life than with the literature and philosophy based upon those realities , words seem somehow to be very like living and breathing things , not the lifeless symbols , the intrinsically valueless counters of thought , that they tend to become in the speech and writing of the intellectual aristocracy .

		To a person with vigor and spontaneity unimpaired by meditation and introspection , words are , in a sense , the very things they stand for , and the application of a new name to a familiar object seems a gross absurdity , while the possibility that the same things may not have the same names the world over is hardly conceivable .

		A certain woman of little education , on being told by one versed in for - eign tongues that bread in
Germany	LOCATION	is called Eroi , in
France	LOCATION	pain , and in
Italy	LOCATION	pane , laughed asi a child might at the manifest absurdity of such a notion .

		`` For it is really bread , you know , '' she insisted , unable to im - agine its existence under any other designa - tion , and filled with an amused contempt for people so wrong-headed as not to call things by their right names .

		Popular intolerance of strange or obsolete words is illustrated by Mr.
Logan Pearsall Smith	PERSON	in the course of a recent article on dialect terms in `` The Eng - lish Review . ''

		Why in one 's particular social circle one is not suffered to use words and ex - pressions perfectly proper in themselves , but not of the prevailing mode , is somewhat of a mystery .

		`` The fact remains , however , '' says the writer , `` that with the best will in the world we can not speak of biding in the house , of delving in the garden , or of slaying pheas - ants ; indeed , anyone who should make the attempt would be likely to share the embar - rassment of the would-be sportswoman , who exclaimed in the hunting field : ' What a beau - tiful leap ! '

		and found it as well to leave the neighborhood soon afterwards . ''

		Perhaps she was from
America	LOCATION	, where her exclamation would have excited no more comment than it would have in the
England	LOCATION	of
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	's day .

		In like manner , a request in an English restau - rant for rare instead of underdone roast beef would probably bring upon one the ridicule of the waiter , whereas in this country the adjec - tive in the sense here indicated is in current use .

		It is , by the way , a good old Anglo-Saxon word , anciently written hrere , and not to be confused with the Latin rarus , which has given us rare in another sense .

		A number of what are now good and generally accepted terms , raised by common consent above the grade of 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	uncouth colloquialisms , are cited by Mr.
Smith	PERSON	as stigmatized by
Johnson	PERSON	with the condemna - tory adjective `` low . ''

		Clever -LRB- Anglo-Saxon gleawferhdh -RRB- , fun , and stingy were thus grudgingly admitted by the great lexicog - rapher to a place in his dictionary , while fad , fogy , dawdle , and nag were altogether ex - cluded .

		But , as
Johnson	PERSON	himself acknowl - edges , `` no word is naturally or intrinsically meaner than another ; our opinion therefore of words , as of other things arbitrarily and capriciously established , depends wholly upon accident and custom . ''

		A writer in the
London	LOCATION	`` Nation '' of recent date deplores the disuse of the word tempest in polite speech . ' '

		The country people every - where , '' he says , `` still speak of a storm as ' a tempest . '

		Above a certain level of ` culture ' the word has become obsolete .

		But what a glo - rious word it is ! ''

		Rather should he have ex - claimed , What a glorious word storm is !

		It is genuine English , akin to the German Sturm , and connected with the old French estor -LRB- bus - tle , noise , fight -RRB- , as also with our verb stir ; whereas tempest is a Latin word -LRB- tempestas -RRB- derived ultimately from tempus -LRB- compare the Greek temnein , to cut -RRB- , and so meaning merely a section of time , a season , weather , a feeble and colorless word compared with storm .

		Monosyllables are always likely to be better and stronger words than their longer syno - nyms .

		Curiously enough , moreover , in Amer - ica the use of the word tempest would indicate superior culture in the speaker rather than the reverse .

		An excellent book , full and scholarly , on `` Rustic Speech and Folk-Lore '' has lately ap - peared from the pen of Mrs.
Joseph Wright	PERSON	, helpmate of the well-known Oxford philolo - gist who has given us the `` English Dialect Dictionary . ''

		In the opening of her preface she remarks : `` Among common errors still persisting in the minds of educated people , one error which dies very hard is the theory that a dialect is an arbitrary distortion of the mother tongue , a wilful mispronunciation of the sounds , and disregard of the syntax of a standard language . ''

		This misconception is the counterpart of that of the unlettered per - son who , with greater reason , regards `` book - talk '' as the arbitrary and foolish creation of the educated .

		Obviously the departure from the natural and the spontaneous is on the side of the cultured speaker of a standardized lan - guage , not on that of the rustic who expresses himself in his local dialect .

		Toward the close of her preface , Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	, disclaiming any intention to pose as a specialist in linguistics , says : ' ' But the field of English dialects offers other allurements besides those which attract the philologist and the grammarian .

		The lan - guage specialist merely digs and quarries , as it were , in the bare soil and rock , where he finds rich ores amply sufficient to repay his pains and toil , but there remains plenty of room for the rest of us who are less laboriously inclined , and at every turn are enticing paths .

		The real charm lies in the fact that it is a ` faire felde ful of f olke , ' natural , homely , witty folk . ' '

		It is into some of these enticing paths that we are here venturing to stray for a brief space .

		In an early chapter it chances that Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	discusses the word rare , mentioned above , in the sense of half-cooked , evidently considering it obsolete or provincial at the present time .

		Like many another good old English word dropped by our trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	cousins but retained by us , rare is in good use with speakers and writers of this country , so that we can read our
Dryden	PERSON	with no sense of encountering an archaism in the lines : '' New laid eggs , with
Baucis	PERSON	' busy care , Turned by a gentle fire , and roasted rare . ''

		The same word , somewhat differently spelled and pronounced , but with a meaning suffi - ciently cognate to assure one that it is the same word , is found in Gay 's lines , quoted by Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	: '' O'er yonder hill does scant the dawn appear , Then why does
Cuddy	PERSON	leave his cot so rear ? '

		r In the same chapter she calls attention to the word piping -LRB- as in piping hot -RRB- , and considers it a dialect word , and in common use .

		It is , of course , one of the thousands of homely and expressive terms that we call , for lack of a simpler adjective , onomatopoetic expressing their sense by their sound .

		The bubbling noise of boiling water is supposed to be suggested by the word .

		Milton uses it figuratively in speak - ing of `` the book of
Santa Clara	LOCATION	, the popish priest , in defense of bishops which came out piping hot '' ; and
Chaucer	PERSON	has it in a literal sense in the line , ' ' And waf res pyping hote out of the glede , '' where another good old word , glede -LRB- a glowing coal -RRB- is less familiar to mod - ern readers .

		Other self-defining dialect terms cited by Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	are cappernishious , crumpsy , f ratty , glumpy -LRB- `` If he 's glumpy , let him glump '' -RRB- , muggaty , perjinkety , snip - pety .

		A quarrelsome person engaged in heated debate may fittingly be addressed by his oppo - nent , `` You nasty , brabagious creature ! ''

		A fine , mouth-filling , anger-relieving adjective in such a situation in
America	LOCATION	would not improb - ably be rambunctious ; and the somewhat sim - ilar word rampagious -LRB- compare on the ram - page -RRB- is also pressed into use in moments of wrath .

		Amusing to the educated listener is the sim - ple rustic when out of his proper linguistic
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 407 element and trying to express himself in the language of that listener .

		His lapse into what have been called Malapropisms is frequent .

		There comes to mind the utterance of a person oppressed by the warm dampness of the weather ' ' There is so much humility in the atmosphere '' ; and the elegant variant used by another for bachelor , bacheldor .

		Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	tells of a farmer who , on being asked if he would clean out a pond , replied : `` No , sir , I ca n't undertake the job ; there 's a sight of sentiment in that there pit , '' meaning sedi - ment .

		Again , her old nurse , having engaged in chicken-raising in her later years , spoke of collecting a `` sitting '' of a certain kind of eggs because she hoped to get from them `` a profligate hatch , '' that is , a prolific hatch .

		This is equalled by the young girl received as a probationer in the parochial guild and proudly announcing that she was `` took in as a reprobate . ''

		Unction and unctioneer are cited by Mrs. `` Wright as sometimes used for auction and auctioneer ; and a man crossed in love in his youth was said to have been `` a woman-atheist ever since . ''

		Among local peculiarities of speech , the same writer notes the chariness with which proper names are used in address in southern
England	LOCATION	, the pronoun you sufficing even be - tween intimate friends , whereas in the North one 's remarks are freely interspersed with `` Mr.
Smith	PERSON	^ ' or `` Mrs.
Jones	PERSON	, '' in speaking to a mere acquaintance , and with `` John '' or ' '
Mary	PERSON	' ' in addressing a friend ; and the use of the baptismal name , instead of the formal Mr. or Mrs. or Miss So-and-so , is noticeably more frequent in the northern than in the southern counties .

		In our own country this disinclination to make free use of personal names is often observed in a curious unwilling - ness on the part of married persons in the rural districts to refer to their wives or hus - bands by any more specific designation than he or she , him or her , as if the taking of the mar - riage vows rendered unthinkable and therefore virtually non-existent any extra-conjugal he or she .

		A not dissimilar dodging of the issue was noted in a certain timid gentleman re - ported to us , who , it was said , when he at last fell a victim to the enticements of an enterpris - ing widow we will call her Mrs.
Judkins	PERSON	never got over the habit of calling her `` Mrs.
Judkins	PERSON	, '' both to her face and behind her back , despite the fact of her sharing his bed and board .

		Referring to the dialect of
Warwickshire	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	makes the following significant assertion : `` The Shakespeare-Bacon theory , if not too dead and gone to be worth further combat , could easily be completely overthrown by any one who chose to array against it the convincing mass of evidence which proves
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's intimate acquaintance with the
Warwickshire	ORGANIZATION	dialect .

		Numbers of the words which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	used , and which we have since lost , still exist in his native county , and in the other counties bordering on
Warwick	PERSON	- shire .

		Some of them were at that date part and parcel of the standard vocabulary , and might be put by
Shakespeare	PERSON	into the mouths of his highest personages ; others again must even then have been regarded by him as dia - lect , and natural only to the speech of lower folk . ' '

		Then follow instances from the plays .

		Dialect is , obviously , not a plant that thrives under cultivation ; and no man likes to use his native Doric just for the sake of having it studied with amused interest by the visiting philologist .

		Rich and rare dialect words must be caught on the wing , and the best way to catch them is to appear not to be stretching one 's ears out for them .

		Those who have the knack of gathering them into their net , and can help to introduce some of the best of them into our standard language , render a service to speakers and writers , to listeners and read - ers -
PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE LITEKAEY ACTIVITIES OF A GREAT LOGI - CIAN might be expected to range not far be - yond the field of formal logic .

		Too great attention to the machinery of reasoning dead - ens the creative faculty .

		Yet the late
Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce	PERSON	his death last month in his mountain cabin at
Milford	LOCATION	,
Pa	LOCATION	, , has received too little notice showed him - self to be a thinker and writer of marked originality and a wide range of interests .

		From his father , Professor
Benjamin Peirce	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, one of the leading mathematicians of his time , he seems to have inherited a de - cided fondness for mathematics , a branch of science to which he made some notable con - tributions .

		But it was to woo his first love , the theory and art of reasoning , that he re - tired to the solitudes of
Pike County	LOCATION	,
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania , in
1887	DATE	, at the age of forty-eight ; and from then to the time of his death his life of learned seclusion and miscellaneous literary industry was but little interrupted , though he was tempted forth to lecture at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- his alma mater -RRB- in
1903	DATE	, and to deliver a course of
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	lectures in the
winter of 1903-4	DATE	.

		A treatise entitled `` Photometric Re - searches '' was his first important published work , followed by less elaborate studies in optics , astronomy , gravitation , the color sense , 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	map-projection , chemistry , engineering , meta - physics , mathematics , early English pronun - ciation , library cataloguing , the history of science , and , not least of all , logic .

		He ed - ited , with considerable additions , `` Studies in
Logic	LOCATION	, '' by members of the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, and `` Linear Associative Alge - bra , '' by his father .

		He contributed largely to the `` Century Dictionary , '' to
Baldwin	PERSON	's `` Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology , '' and to a number of encyclopaedias .

		But per - haps the most memorable of his achievements was his early formulation of the philosophical principles now so widely known as `` pragma - tism . ''

		The name itself is his own , and Wil - liam
James	PERSON	made due acknowledgment of indebtedness to him .

		It is said that the ref - erence library collected by
Peirce	PERSON	in his rural retreat was among the most complete in exis - tence on the subjects with which it dealt .

		A greater passion for learning , especially ab - stract learning , for its own sake , has seldom been cherished than by this secluded scholar .

		ALLUSIONS , LITERARY AND OTHER , are often made a test , and a sufficiently severe one , of a young person 's general information .

		As already noted by us , there has been compiled by the
Detroit High School	ORGANIZATION	librarian a list of eight hundred and thirty-seven `` Allusions Which Every High School Student Should Know '' ; and a casual turning of the pages brings to light not a few allusions that even a college professor might not like to be exam - ined on without warning .

		Some of these not too easy allusions are , for example ,
Maha	LOCATION	- bharata ,
Hippolyta	LOCATION	,
Gari Melchers	PERSON	,
Loki	LOCATION	,
Frigga	LOCATION	,
Fidei Defensor	PERSON	, Procrustes , nebu - lar hypothesis ,
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise ,
Night Watch	ORGANIZATION	, Land of
Goshen	LOCATION	, Cry of the Children , Baptistry of
San Giovanni	LOCATION	, and the Bay Psalm Book .

		A perusal of the entire list must bring to almost any reader a renewed sense of the variety and extent of his ignorance .

		In this day and generation it is difficult to know even a little of everything .

		At a recent examina - tion in the
Baltimore	LOCATION	High School , an amusing but not surprising lack of information on cer - tain current topics of interest was revealed .

		Concerning Ulster one pupil wrote : ' ' Ulster is a great artist , '' while another was of opin - ion that `` Ulster is concerned in the oyster fight . ' '

		The name of a famous military char - acter in an adjoining country brought forth the following : `` General Villa is a
summer	DATE	home , '' and on the subject of disarmament it was affirmed that ' ' disarmament is the proc - ess of disrobing . ' '

		Other original replies were these : `` Franklin 's autobiography was writ - ten by
George Washington	PERSON	, '' '' Good examples of martyrs
Wilson	PERSON	and
Roosevelt	PERSON	, '' `` A fleet is a group of fish , '' and `` A star shoots , while a planet does n't . ''

		Well , we all live in glass houses , and it is not the present intention to throw stones .

		Possibly this amusement might have been indulged in with impunity by
Felix Berol	PERSON	, `` the man with three hundred thousand facts in his head , '' but he has just died , and we can think of no one to take his place as a memory expert .

		THE DISENCHANTMENT OF NEARNESS often plays sad havoc with our fond preconceptions of noted authors as , indeed , of noted men and women in whatever walk of life .

		Genuine worth , of course , never suffers loss from any degree of proximity ; rather the reverse .

		But , not to indulge in too many preliminary plati - tudes , let us quote a paragraph from
Madame de Hegermann-Lindencrone	ORGANIZATION	's current instal - ment of reminiscences in ``
Harper	PERSON	's Mag - azine . ''

		In a letter written at
Rome	LOCATION	in
February , 1881	DATE	, she says : `` The celebrated
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	honored this feast -LSB- a dinner and ball given by the Scandinavian Club -RSB- with his presence , and especially honored the
Chianti	LOCATION	and
Genzano	LOCATION	wines , which were served copi - ously in fiascos .

		When you see
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, with his lion face and tangle of hair , for the first time , you are fascinated by him , knowing what a genius he is , but when you talk with him , and feel his piercing , critical eyes looking at you from under his bushy brows , and see his cruel , satirical smile , you are a little preju - diced against him .

		We meet him often at our friend
Ross	PERSON	's studio at afternoon teas , where there is always a little music .

		Ibsen sits sul - len , silent , and indifferent .

		He does not like music , and does not disguise his dislike .

		This is not , as you may imagine , inspiring to the performers .

		In fact , just to look at him takes all the life out of you .

		He is a veritable wet blanket .

		I have read all his works in the orig - inal .

		I think they lose a great deal in being translated .

		The Norwegian language is very curt and concise , each word conveying almost the meaning of two in English , which enables the author to paint a whole situation in a few words .

		I can see the difference , in reading the English translations , and where they fail to convey his real meaning .

		Strangers who wish to see
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	must go to the cheap Italian restaurant , ` Falcone , ' where he sits before a small iron table , eating deviled devil-fish .

		No wonder that he is morbid and his plays weird ! ' '

		THE PROLIFIC PEN OF ' ' GATH , ' ' after giving to the world a greater quantity and variety of reading-matter than it often falls to one man to produce , is now at rest .

		Indeed , for
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 409 more than a dozen years preceding his recent death at the age of seventy-three
George Alfred Townsend	PERSON	had ceased to add to his long list of writings had perhaps lost the power to interpret the events of the times as he once so acceptably did interpret them .

		He was born at
Georgetown	LOCATION	,
Delaware	LOCATION	,
Jan. 30 , 1841	DATE	, and entered journalism at nineteen , upon his graduation from the high school in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The `` Inquirer '' and later the ' ' Press ' ' of that city gave him a chance to see what he could do as a news - writer ; but in a short time he secured a place as war corre - spondent on the
New York	LOCATION	`` Herald . ''

		In a few months , however , his restless spirit drove him to
England	LOCATION	, where he wrote for Ameri - can and English periodicals and lectured on the great conflict whose events he had so re - cently been reporting .

		In 1864-5 he acted as war correspondent for the
New York	LOCATION	`` World '' and gained considerable fame as a descriptive writer under the pen-name `` Gath . ''

		For the same journal he wrote de - scriptive articles on the Austro-Prussian War of
1866	DATE	.

		Soon afterward we find him engaged in the daily dictation of those long letters , from two to four columns each , which ap - peared simultaneously in the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Trib - une , '' the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	`` Enquirer , '' and many other journals , under his widely-known pseu - donym .

		But in the midst of this extraordi - nary productivity as a journalist he found time for more ambitious literary undertakings , and he is known as the author of lives of
Gari	PERSON	- baldi ,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and
Levi P. Morton	PERSON	, of two vol - umes of poems and two novels , ' ' The Entailed Hat '' and `` Katy of Catoctin . ''

		He also wrote `` Campaigns of a Non - Combatant , '' `` The New World Compared with the Old , '' `` The Bohemians '' -LRB- a play -RRB- , `` Lost Abroad , '' ``
Washington	LOCATION	Outside and Inside , '' `` Wash - ington Rebuilded , '' `` Tales of the
Chesa	PERSON	- peake , '' `` Tales of Gapland , '' `` Columbus in Love , ' ' and more besides .

		If he did not write books that will live , he at least wrote books and articles that enabled him to live in com - fort if not in luxury to the end of his life .

		THE FUNCTION OP THE PLATITUDE is one not to be despised .

		A Fourth-of-July oration , a political harangue , an after-dinner speech , or a baccalaureate sermon , composed entirely of new and original matter , would be as difficult to follow with intelligence and appreciation as would a supper of caviare , curry , and cay - enne pepper be impossible of digestion .

		Both speaker and hearer need a short rest between each two pregnant and pithy utterances , but a dead pause would be embarrassing ; hence the indispensability of the platitude as a space - filler .

		In print the need is far less , for the reader can suspend his reading as often and as long as he chooses ; but even here the usefulness of the platitude could be demon - strated .

		In view of the near approach of our annual library conference , the following ex - tract from the facetious Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's latest contribution to the gaiety of nations , `` The Secret Book '' -LRB- more formally noticed on another page -RRB- , may be not untimely .

		It is the Librarian who speaks , or writes -LRB- he is preparing an address with which to electrify the
Buncombe County Library Club	ORGANIZATION	at its next meeting -RRB- . ''

		` The public library is an integral part of public education , ' I dictated .

		Then I paused , and addressed
Miss Sims	PERSON	, my stenographer .

		` That 's rather neat , I think ? '

		She bit her pencil , doubtfully .

		` Seems to me I 've heard it before , somewhere , ' she sug - gested . '

		I should hope so !

		You would n't have me make a new and original statement at a meeting of librarians , would you ?

		That would never do !

		Part of them would de - nounce me as flippant , and the rest the library magazines , for instance would refer condescendingly to what I said .

		as ' ' clever , ' ' which means ' ' smart but shallow . ' '

		The great art of a library meeting speech , ' I continued , ` is to utter as many solemn platitudes as possible with a very solemn face .

		It is always sure to be called both ' ' scholarly ' ' and `` sound . '' ' ''

		Without the plenteous plati - tude how would our educators and our social workers , our politicians and our publicists generally , our reformers and our men and women of light and leading in every depart - ment of human progress , be able to conduct their conventions ?

		A NEST OF SINGING BIRDS seems to have estab - lished itself in Devonshire Street ,
London	LOCATION	, where Mr.
Harold Monro	PERSON	maintains his Poetry Bookshop , already noticed by us .

		The place has become a rendezvous for poetry-lovers , and in an adjacent out-house , whitewashed and provided with chairs , semi-weekly read - ings of poetry by the poets themselves are con - ducted .

		Over the shop are half a dozen bedrooms occupied by young men who assist Mr.
Monro	PERSON	in his work and are themselves not unknown in the world of poetry .

		The presid - ing genius of the place is , of course , himself a poet ; and he is also a critic of poetry and editor of the excellent quarterly , `` Poetry and Drama . ''

		He is described as an alert , sensi - ble , progressive , and capable person , about thirty years of age , and filled with a desire to do some good to mankind in his chosen calling .

		One detail of his work that is interesting him especially at present is the perfecting of some scheme whereby the poetry-readings 410 -LSB-
May 16	DATE	mentioned above may suffer less from the bashfulness , the affectation , the poor elocu - tion , or some other defect , in the reader .

		An arrangement of the desk in such a position as to hide the reader and yet not intercept the sound of his voice is under consideration .

		But better than this , he thinks , would be the organ - izing of a company of trained rhapsodists or elocutionists , with a true feeling for poetry , to take the place of the author-readers them - selves , who are so often least capable of ren - dering effectively what they have so admirably written .

		THE UNIVERSAL APPEAL OF THE STORY OF `` HUMAN INTEREST '' is something that one likes to believe in , on psychological and other grounds .

		The editor of one of our most widely - circulated monthly magazines became early convinced that what interested readers in one part of the country would interest readers in all parts of the country ; and considering him - self a good example of `` the average reader , '' he published the stories that he liked and re - jected those for which he had no relish .

		His method , judged by visible results , seems to have justified itself .

		Disconcerting , therefore , is it to find another rather competent author - ity in these matters giving evidence directly opposed to this editor 's testimony .

		Miss
Eva L. Bascom	PERSON	, member of the
Wisconsin Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and head of the
Book Selection and Study Club Department	ORGANIZATION	of that commis - sion , says in an article published in the cur - rent ``
Iowa	LOCATION	Library Quarterly '' : `` I do not have to tell you that all good novels are not suited to all communities , that many excellent authors find few readers in some localities .

		I know a small town where books are more popular than bridge , yet
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's stories are fixtures on the shelves while De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's are never in . ' '

		Of course it is easy enough to point to factory villages where
George Meredith	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	would be sure to find fewer readers than
Bertha M. Clay	PERSON	and `` the Duchess '' ; but why the same community should be eager readers of ' '
Alice	PERSON	- for-Short '' and wholly indifferent to `` The Old Wives ' Tale , '' is not so easy to under - stand .

		THE CINEMATOGRAPHED NOVEL , following hard on the heels of the dramatized novel , seems destined to enjoy an even greater meas - ure of popular success .

		Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	tells of a certain
London	LOCATION	publishing house that
last year	DATE	did a more profitable busi - ness in selling moving-picture rights in some of its works of fiction than in its proper field of publishing .

		Meanwhile the unauthorized use of novel-titles and play - titles on the part of unscrupulous producers of moving pictures is giving annoyance to authors and play - wrights , and a test case is soon to be carried into the English courts .

		If an adverse deci - sion is rendered , remedial legislation will be asked for .

		To a reflective on-looker the whole matter is interesting as a development in the literary-theatrical world that could not have been dreamt of twenty years ago .

		The drama - tized novel and the novelized drama , compara - tively recent creations that are still in some quarters looked upon as hybrids with no legiti - mate claim to recognition in either the dra - matic or the literary world , have nevertheless secured for themselves a certain standing , and will have to be reckoned with in the future .

		The photo-play , too , is another manifestation that has already ceased to be a novelty and made a place for itself that is not without promise of permanence .

		But the cinemato - graphed novel is distinctly of the new century , and its possibilities are not yet exhausted .

		Shall we ere long witness the appearance of its complement , or logical successor , the ' ' nov - elized cinema ' ' ?

		A NOVELTY IN LIBRARY SERVICE IS advocated by the Hon.
Joseph P. Tracy	PERSON	,
Commissioner of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	and Manufactures of Leth - bridge ,
Alberta	LOCATION	.

		With a zeal worthy of a less unwise and impracticable scheme he urges the substitution of a postal library for the present public library system .

		Every post-office would be a branch library , with a supply of books equal in number to the population of the town in which it is situated ; and a fee of
two cents	MONEY	a week for each book drawn -LRB- by mail -RRB- would , it is expected , pay the expense of the new service .

		Existing book-collections in public libraries `` could be absorbed into the postal library at their actual value .

		The real estate can be converted to other uses without loss , '' and let the tax-payer take note and rejoice `` grants by cities , provinces , etc. , to main - tain such public libraries will no longer be necessary . ' '

		Instead of going to the library to make his own researches , the student would write to the postmaster , and he or an assistant engaged for such work would furnish the de - sired information -LRB- or try to -RRB- for a fee of
fifty cents	MONEY	per hour for the time spent in obtaining it .

		And best of all , or next best to the saving of expense by the abolition of library build - ings , `` there will be no waste of time in con - versation -LRB- between librarian and patron -RRB- . ''

		Personal intercourse would be entirely elim - inated , the post-office machinery would auto - matically respond to every demand as soon as one dropped the properly stamped card through the slot of the letter-box , and the economy and efficiency of the system would
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 411 excite universal admiration .

		For further de - tails write to Mr.
Tracy	PERSON	and ask him for a copy of his printed prospectus of this mar - vellous impending development of the library idea ... THE SAD FATE OF A BOOK-SCORNER IS vividly set forth in rhyme on the final page of the
Gary Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's annual Report .

		Abim - elech
Easterley	ORGANIZATION	was the name of this misguided person who was destined always to toil ' ' in the rear , too busy to reach for the help that was near . ''

		Librarians might do worse than to commend their literary wares to the public in such stanzas as those before us , the last two of which , whatever else they may lack , show no wavering or uncertainty in the rhythm of their anapaests , which run thus trippingly on the tongue : `` An hour with a book would have brought to his mind The secret that took him a whole year to find .

		The facts that he learned at enormous ex - pense Were all on a Library shelf to commence .

		Alas !

		for our hero ; too busy to read , He was also too busy , it proved , to succeed .

		`` We may win without credit or backing or style , We may win without energy , skill , or a smile , Without patience or aptitude , purpose or wit We may even succeed if we 're lacking in grit ; But take it from me as a mighty safe hint A civilized man can not win without print . ''

		INTELLIGENT READING is supposed to be taught in the first years at school ; but that it is not always and everywhere thus taught may be inferred from the fact that at
Oberlin College	ORGANIZATION	, where for the past three years a searching investigation of that institution 's methods of instruction has been carried on , provision has just been made for teaching the student a thorough mastery of the printed page .

		Reading that is at once close , careful , critical , rapid , and retentive , is an accom - plishment not to be despised ; and it is not promoted by the daily skimming of the yel - low press , or even by the periodical cramming for college examinations .

		Probably no drill in the art of intelligent reading , and in the appreciation of a logical and lucid presenta - tion of the writer 's thought , can compare with that which is gained in an early study of the Greek and Latin classics , under efficient guid - ance .

		It is told of a certain Greek professor of the old school that he was wont to grow indignant whenever the suggestion was made in his hearing that pupils ought to be taught to read Greek `` like English . ''

		On the con - trary , he maintained , they would profit far more if they could be made to read English like Greek .

		Slipshod reading goes hand in hand with , and is one of the chief causes of , slipshod writing .

		A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE for this COUU - try , similar to the
Brussels International Institute of Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	and the
Paris	LOCATION	Asso - ciation for Scientific , Industrial , and Commer - cial Bibliography and Documentation , has long been advocated by Mr.
Aksel G. S. Josephson	PERSON	, of the

		THE FUNCTION OF THE FAIRY TALE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The defense of
Grimm 's Fairy Tales	ORGANIZATION	, in your issue of
April 16	DATE	, pleased me more than anything I have seen for a long time .

		It has always been my deep conviction that the child from whom these stories are withheld is forever cheated of a price - less treasure .

		For the stories must be read in childhood ; the deficiency can not be remedied by reading them in maturity .

		They must grow in our minds with our minds .

		I should not want - I should not dare to read them now , for fear of destroying the illusion that still hangs over them .

		Perhaps that is what is the matter with teachers and parents who lean toward the insipid modern fairy tale .

		There were two reasons why I first took to those legends which , I understand , were not written by the
Brothers Grimm	ORGANIZATION	at all but were merely col - lected by them mostly from an old woman '' who knew a hundred . ''

		Those reasons are that the tales were forbidden , and that the book containing them had a beautiful red cover .

		It came into the house , for me , at
Christmastime	ORGANIZATION	, and I bless the aunt who sent it , but through the rigid censor - 412 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	ship of
Santa Glaus	LOCATION	it was hidden away and I did n't discover its hiding-place until
summer	DATE	.

		I must then have been between nine and ten .

		How old I was when I stopped reading that book I do n't know twelve , probably , when the remains of the worn volume went up in `` our fire . ''

		It did n't matter , I knew it all by heart .

		Their horrors , as I recall them now , were not horrors to me then .

		I felt never a shiver when the robber 's luckless bride , hiding behind the chest , saw the finger of another poor girl chopped off to get her ring , when the miller was forced to cut off the hands of his own child , or when a witch was impaled upon some torture .

		There was nothing for me but wide-eyed wonder , palpitating enthrall - ment , breathless expectancy .

		What would happen next ?

		It was always something less harsh .

		Considered from whatever viewpoint , they are marvellous things , those tales ; and their greatest value lies in the fact that they teach the child that he can withdraw into a world of his own , that there is some escape from the humdrum world about him .

		Just because they are so foreign to all rhyme or reason in the order of his own existence , they are infinitely more effective than the wishy-washy sub - terfuge of '' fairyizing '' objects with which the child is perfectly familiar , or of inventing unin - spired and wholly artificial creatures .

		In such stories he can not possibly lose himself as he does in
Grimm	LOCATION	; nor do they contain half the invitation to explore other fields of literature .

		You quote Professor
Neilson	PERSON	's objection that the
Grimm	PERSON	stories hold a pronounced suggestion of revenge .

		The passion for '' getting even '' is one of the most elemental of childish traits , and one of the most spontaneous .

		Nearly all normal and lively children will '' go the limit '' in that direc - tion , regardless of what literary food they are fed on .

		Besides , the professor seems to overlook the fact that often and often the tables were turned on the revenge-seeker , a proceeding with which most normal and lively children are well ac - quainted .

		On the other hand , why should he ob - ject when wrong is righteously avenged ?

		We learn many things in childhood that we have to outgrow , or which are even transmuted with age .

		All unconsciously to him at the time ,
Grimm	PERSON	's stories equip the child with a mine of facts about life in general .

		When the poverty-stricken mother and father turn their children out it seems only an adventure for the youngsters ; but when in after years we find that such unnatural things can and do happen , the edge of the shock has been taken off the discovery .

		In their vivid , dramatic way these fairy tales emphasize over and over the obligation of keep - ing one 's word ; the fact that kindness pays ; the beauty of modesty and patience ; the ugliness of ill-temper , haughtiness , and envy ; the penalties of lying ; the reward of faithfulness and of persever - ance ; the dire results of breaking into forbidden precincts -LRB- and perhaps inferentially of readirg secreted books -RRB- .

		And how , if they please , can the detractors of Grimm bring up their children with a finer ideal of `` true love '' ?

		One prince and one princess him or her only , with a devo - tion that makes the word '' unswerving '' seem pale and weak indeed .

		I am not saying that children soak up these virtues like little sponges .

		They do n't , neither from
Grimm	LOCATION	's -LRB- fairy tales nor from the Bible .

		The best we can do is throw into their way every influence against unseeing eyes and an unfeeling heart , as examples of which influences the two books just named stand out pre - eminently .

		It will be hard work to '' dismiss ''
Grimm	PERSON	's fairy tales , even '' charitably , '' because in their fundamental essentials they are grippingly real ; tinged with cruelty often , and sometimes wryly humorous ; yet with other passages full of the dignity and beauty of life .

		It is the combination of underlying reality , fascinating strangeness , and haze of romance and ideality that makes them deathless .

		FAIRY TALES AND THE TRAINED IMAGINATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Every now and again objections are raised , on some ground or another , to some of the classic nursery rhymes and fairy tales , but none of the objectors appear to be able to offer satisfactory material that can really take the place of this liter - ature in children 's reading .

		Nearly thirteen years ago I took up the cudgels in your columns on behalf of these rhymes and fairy tales , in an article entitled '' The Right Read - ing for
Very Young Children	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		What I said then was based upon years of careful observation of children , and subsequent experience has not served to change the views I then expressed .

		The note in your issue of
April 16	DATE	on Professor
William A. Neilson	PERSON	's plea for the discarding of the tales by the brothers
Grimm	PERSON	is thoroughly in ac - cordance with what I believe is the experience of most of us who have taken the pains to study chil - dren and the effect of fairy tales upon them , rather than to study fairy tales and predict the effects that it is supposed will follow from the reading of them by children .

		There is , so far as I can discover , no other ma - terial that so well lays the foundation of a trained imagination in the child as this sort of literature , for these stories deal with the crude things , the things children can understand , and not with the refinements which civilization and education enable them later to grasp .

		Many of the world 's great workers and thinkers have testified to the value and influence of nursery rhymes and fairy tales , but not every one stops to think of the enormous influence that this literature has upon that training of the imaginative faculty which enables men to do the world 's work .

		The late Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	has said : '' The imagination is the supreme intellectual faculty , and yet it is of all the one which receives the least attention in our common systems of edu - cation .

		The reason is not far to seek .

		The ima - gination is of all the faculties the most difficult to control , it is the most elusive of all , the most far-reaching in its relations , the rarest in its full power .

		But upon its healthy development depend

		All great deeds in every department of human endeavor are the outcome first of all of an idea , and no man can produce an idea unless he has imagination , and the man who has a trained ima - gination is the most fertile in productive ideas .

		The principle of the steam engine existed in the imagination of its inventors before ever it was interpreted into terms of hard iron and steel .

		Wireless telegraphy existed in the mind of Mar - coni before he raised a pole ; the railroad , electric lights , electric traction , the telegraph , telephone , stenography , typewriting , all these things ex - isted in the imagination of someone before they were realized .

		The germ theory , photography , typesetting machines , sewing machines , anesthetics , reaping , harvesting and printing machines , one might continue the whole catalogue of those prac - tical inventions that are absolutely essential in our daily life and say that they owe their origin to the trained imagination of the human mind .

		The imagination is the Archimedean lever which moves the universe .

		A trained imagination , there - fore , is an invaluable asset to every business and professional man .

		Foresight is the imagining of conditions which may have to be met .

		The man with a trained imagination marshals these condi - tions in their order , places them in their proper relations with each other , and not until that is done are his plans matured and his work of actual construction sent forward .

		I verily believe also that the lack of a trained imagination is responsible for a very large number of the crimes that are committed daily .

		The trained imagination that can forecast results from causes would prevent many a crime from being committed .

		But this is a larger question , and to my mind a strongly thought-provoking one that might be well worth following out .

		that he -LSB- Luther -RSB- did not translate the
New Testa	LOCATION	- ment into German in about ten weeks -LRB-
January March , 1522	DATE	-RRB- but simply revised an older transla - tion . ''

		In support of this very interesting contention , Professor
Vedder	PERSON	in his book -LRB- page 171 -RRB- has the following to say : `` This version -LSB- the pre-Lu - theran High-German version of the Bible -RSB- was certainly in the possession of Luther and was as certainly used by him in the preparation of his version .

		This fact once entirely unsuspected and then hotly denied has been proved to a demonstra - tion by the ' deadly parallel . '

		It appears from a verse-by-verse comparison that this old German bible was in fact so industriously used by Luther that the only accurate description of Luther 's ver - sion is to call it a careful revision of the older text . ''

		It has already been pointed out , in '' The Ave Maria '' of
April 18 , 1914	DATE	, that Professor
Vedder	PERSON	's work would be a still better one if he had read Fr .


Hartmann Grisar	PERSON	. ''

		His independent judgment needs more facts to play upon than it has yet ac - quired . ''

		And in this very important question with regard to Luther 's use of the pre-Lutheran versions , the reader has a right to demand some - thing more than a sweeping statement about the '' deadly parallel . ''

		If time or space forbade the introduction of such additional material , reference should at least have been made to the more recent critical investigation on the subject .

		Professor
Vedder	PERSON	's statements about Luther 's translations of the bible would have been more accurate and con - vincing if he had read an article on '' Luther 's Use of the Pre-Lutheran Versions of the Bible , '' by Professor

		A careful examination will clearly show the striking resemblance between the editions of .

		1483 and
1522	DATE	.

		Such a similarity can - not be , as Geffchen stated , accidental ... The fact remains that the editions are quite simi - lar and that Luther borrowed more from the ear - lier versions than recent scholars have inferred , and that the suggestions of men like
Geffchen	PERSON	and others before him have not been heeded .

		They have been passed over as casual and unimportant , or else have been forgotten ... The follow - ing selections are fairly typical . ''

		Then follows a series of selections from the Gos - pels arranged so as to illustrate the '' deadly parallel . ''

		These comparisons lead to the conclu - sion -LRB- page 32 -RRB- : '' Even from a comparison of the above chapters one may assume that Luther used this Koburger version , or a reprint thereof , as a source for his translation ; and further , that with - out such a source it would have been impossible for him to finish the manuscript of the Complete New Testament by

		THE STORY OF AN ACTIVE LIFE .

		* Although the author of `` Cheerful Yester - days '' and `` Army Life in a Black Regiment '' virtually wrote his own biography , he omitted much that is interesting , especially as regards his formative years , and , not attempting a formal autobiography , gave little heed to co - herence and proportion .

		The memoir prepared by his wife ,
Mary Thacher Higginson	PERSON	, now published , is by no means superfluous .

		Avoid - ing , so far as possible , duplication of what Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	had written in his autobiog - raphic papers , she tells the story of his life with commendable brevity , in a tone so deli - cately personal that it seems almost imper - sonal , and , mainly by skilful quotation from his journals , she succeeds in placing before us one of the most active and benevolent and brave figures of American life in the nineteenth century .

		Descended from Puritan ancestors whose temper in considerable degree foreshadowed his ,
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	was born , in
1823	DATE	, in
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		At the age of twelve began his life-long habit of keep - ing a journal .

		Some of the earliest entries tell of his reading `` The Select British Poets '' -LRB- `` a great big book '' -RRB- and of his enjoying `` Philip Van Artevelde '' for the third time an early token of the omnivorous reading hab - its that characterized him to the end .

		When thirteen years old , he entered
Harvard Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege as the youngest of forty-five freshmen .

		At college he exhibited a love of study , espe - cially of Greek , mathematics , and natural his - tory , together with great fondness for sports and outdoor recreation .

		He was president of the
Natural History Society	ORGANIZATION	, became a member of
Phi Beta Kappa	LOCATION	, and won a first Bowdoin prize .

		Somewhat reserved in attitude , he was also sentimental : '' It is dreadful to me , ' ' he writes , ' ' to see a woman kill an insect . ' '

		After meeting a certain ' ' best scholar and very agree - able girl , ' ' he escorted her home from dancing - school and wrote in his journal : `` To bed at lli ^ .

		Smitten . ' '

		Though a platonic affection , he finds it very disturbing : ' ' Dulcinia absent for which I am glad , for to have seen her would have used me up for some days . ' '

		The future minister regarded prayers as `` rather a bore , '' and was summoned by `` the Prex '' for `` cut - ting '' on seventeen occasions .

		time a sign reading `` Negroes bought and sold . ''

		After graduation , he taught for a short period in a school for boys at
Jamaica Plain	LOCATION	.

		He was at this time somewhat of a dandy , and his frivolous ways caused uneasiness in his family .

		One of his imprudent acts consisted in `` riding on horseback with one of the girls from the opposite boarding-school , this damsel quietly climbing out of the window to take these rides in the
early morning	TIME	, while her schoolmates were still asleep . ''

		Next he be - came a private tutor in the family of a relative who lived at
Brookline	LOCATION	, at whose house he met his second cousin ,
Mary Channing	PERSON	, sister of the poet , who later became his first wife .

		Giving up his position in order to fulfil a plan of study , he returned to
Cambridge	LOCATION	; he had no goal other than the pleasure of studying , `` Oh , the delicious pleasure of learning whatever there is to be learned . ' '

		Then came the call of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Under the influence of
James Freeman Clarke	PERSON	, one of whose disciples was Miss Channing , Mr.
Hig	PERSON	- ginson began to think of studying for the min - istry , and at length , after a struggle , he found himself `` in a quiet corner of
Divinity Hall	ORGANIZATION	, looking toward the sunset and close by the
Palfrey Woods	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		Toward the end of the year came a revulsion , and a determination to aban - don the routine of the school in favor of soli - tary study ; this determination was carried out , though subsequently he made application for readmission .

		As the time of putting on his min - isterial responsibilities drew closer , his rest - lessness if anything increased , and
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's serene radicalism acted as a solvent on what was left of his orthodoxy .

		However , in
1847	DATE	, at the age of twenty-three , Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	be - came pastor of the
First Religious Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Newburyport	LOCATION	.

		Although the forms of religion still caused him to feel at times `` terribly false , '' he contrived to make his work gen - uine and profitable by placing emphasis on the accidents rather than the essence of relig - ion , by taking an active part , that is , in the social and political departments of church enterprise .

		He spent much time in preaching and lecturing elsewhere ; he wrote for various newspapers , and was drawn into politics .

		Al - ready he had espoused the causes of abolition , temperance , and women 's rights .

		After two years , he resigned on account of his political views , ' ' Not a dozen are really opposed to me , but they have all the wealth . ''

		During the next two years he remained in
Newburyport	LOCATION	leading the same life as before , with the eccle - siastical part omitted .

		But his preaching days were not quite over : in
1852	DATE	he was invited to assume direction of a
1914	DATE	-RSB- 415 Free Church in
Worcester	LOCATION	, an organization of radicals of every description that had just been formed .

		`` They want me to stay at
Worces	LOCATION	- ter , '' he wrote in a letter , '' where there are 600 come-outers and a very thriving city and a clear Free Soil majority and no anti-slavery preaching , and 40 conventions in a year . ' '

		This was a combination that he could not resist .

		Accordingly , he entered upon what proved to be prolonged and varied and happy service in
Worcester	LOCATION	.

		To consider the remainder the more fa - miliar part of Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	's eventful career even in a cursory manner would be im - possible in the limits of a brief review .

		Suffice it to say that he engaged with fervor in the anti-slavery struggle , going out to
Kansas	LOCATION	as brigadier-general of the
Free State	ORGANIZATION	forces , and all but going to
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry with
John Brown	PERSON	.

		In
1862	DATE	he accepted a captaincy of the Fifty-first
Massachusetts Volunteers	ORGANIZATION	, and later in the same year he was appointed colonel of the first of the slave regiments .

		In
1864	DATE	he resigned his commission on account of a wound .

		For more than the decade ensuing he lived at
Newport	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	; and after
1879	DATE	, the year in which he married a second time , he led a happy and useful life in
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Nothing has been said , in this survey of Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	's life , of his acquaintance with distinguished men of his time , including
Emerson	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Darwin	LOCATION	, Glad - stone , and Cardinal
Manning	PERSON	, of all of whom and many others there are sketches and anec - dotes in this volume .

		Nor has anything been said of his constant and versatile writing , even though the bibliography which the author of this memoir has compiled runs to twenty-five pages .

		Nor has there been more than a hint regarding his very charming and immensely energetic personality .

		Of his personality more ought to be said .

		Here are a few quotations that tell a great deal : `` I never read of but one thing which thor - oughly came up to my idea of enjoyment , and that was the Charge of the Six Hundred .

		All the rest of existence would I freely give for one such hour . ''

		When he had accepted the commission of colonel of the black regiment , one of his nieces exclaimed , `` Will not Uncle Went worth be in bliss !

		A thousand men , every one as black as a coal . ''

		-LRB- And he was in bliss with his `` dear , blundering , dusky darlings . '' -RRB-

		`` The trouble with me '' he was quite right about this `` is too great a range of tastes and interests .

		I never was happier than when in the army en - tirely absorbed in active duties ; yet I love lit - erature next indeed almost better ; and I need either two lives or 48 hours in the day to do all . '' ''

		THE REAL , RESTORATION COMEDY .

		* `` The present volume , '' says Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	in his Introduction , `` is an attempt to fill a gap in English dramatic criticism ; and , if it be possible , to reform our point of view as to the drama of the Restoration . ''

		Within the limits suggested by this clear-cut statement , the book is a notable one .

		It is an excellent piece of `` literary-historical criticism '' if so clumsy a term may serve to designate a genre essentially distinct from history of lit - erature on the one hand and from pure criti - cism on the other .

		A work of this kind has the twofold purpose implied in Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's statement : it aims to reconstruct and account for some certain literary mode of the past , and to judge the authors who were swayed by that mode solely in reference to the criteria it provides .

		Such an attempt is characteristic of our age ; so also are the dangers which be ^ set it , consequent upon the confusion of criti - cal standards occasioned by the Romantic movement .

		Above all , the writer may be tempted to overvalue the literary mode with which he has been preoccupied .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	yields , somewhat , to this temptation ; but mainly as the result of a strong and com - mendable effort to dissipate the mists which the moralists have thrown over Restoration comedy .

		The author notes that since the appearance of
Jeremy Collier	PERSON	's `` Short View of the Pro- faneness and Immorality of the English Stage , '' in
1698	DATE	, `` nearly every printed opin - ion , with one or two celebrated and conspic - uous exceptions , leaves the impression '' that the Restoration dramatists `` have been meas - ured by standards they would neither have respected nor understood . ''

		To the invectives quoted by Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	, one might easily add innumerable others : ranging all the way from
Taine	PERSON	's lurid remarks on the subject to the Restoration chapter in the latest school his - tory of English literature published in this country .

		Indeed , a fling at Restoration ob - scenity has come to be one of the literary his - torian 's favorite devices for dramatic relief .

		416 THE DIAL book that it is `` the first attempt , by a writer who has en bloc digested the historical evi - dence , to put right the injustice of two centu - ries . ' '

		Thus long has the spirit of Restoration comedy had to wait for a complete and , on the whole , just interpretation from the literary - historical standpoint .

		In his opening chapter , `` Critical Prelim - inaries , '' Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	clears the ground with a sharp assault on those who have echoed Col - lier 's `` monstrous blast '' :
Steele	PERSON	, Swift ,
John	PERSON	- son ,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, yes , even
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Meredith	PERSON	.

		He should have taken time to con - sider more exactly just why it was that the two last-named writers who themselves re - sumed and carried on , in a way , the tradition of the English comedy of manners felt im - pelled to utter hard things of Restoration drama .

		It is misleading to state that in this matter
Meredith	PERSON	was `` conspicuously a vic - tim '' of `` the inflamed Puritan conscience . ''

		Thackeray evinces , notably in ' ' Vanity Fair , ' ' a combination of Puritan conscience and humor which is a foe to the purely comic .

		But quite different from the Puritan con - science was that heightened Commonsense which , when it led to social didacticism , blurred the comic vision of Meredith ; and was the source of the too severe judgment he passed , in his `` Essay on Comedy '' -LRB- 1877 -RRB- , upon Restoration drama .

		At the same time this essay is almost epoch-making for the light in which it presents the story of English comedy .

		It must have contributed much to that revival of interest in comic drama , and comprehension of the purely comic stand - point , which has given many evidences of itself in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	during recent years .

		These evidences can not be detailed here ; but Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's own work is one of the most distinguished of them .

		It marks a general change of attitude since
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's time of which Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	himself seems barely conscious .

		At the present day even Macaulay could scarcely have written the re - view he did in
1849	DATE	of
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's edition of the Restoration writers .

		But in any case , that review has long needed the keen analysis , and its author 's blind vigor the sound drub - bing , which Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	gives them in his first chapter .

		The ensuing six chapters trace the rise and fall of Restoration comedy , and are excep - tional for the degree in which they avoid the dangers and develop the possibilities of literary-historical criticism .

		Addressing him - self always to `` the merely literate , '' Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	has here managed to do what the literary-historical pen usually staggers from : namely , to write literature .

		His wide and thorough scholarship , obvious to anyone at all acquainted with the Restoration period , is allowed to appear only in its results ; and these are given with admirable concreteness and concision .

		Only the five most typical writers are treated : Etherege ,
Wycherley	PERSON	,
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	,
Vanbrugh	PERSON	, and
Farquhar	PERSON	.

		In each case the personality of the author , presented as far as possible through his own utterances or those of his contemporaries concerning him , is made a glass for the social and artistic ideas of the time .

		These ideas are then traced in his works , by means of judicious excerpts and illuminating comment .

		As a result , even the reader who has had least previous knowledge of the subject must be drawn gradually into a real comprehension of the strange , almost exotic , atmosphere in which he finds himself .


Charles Lamb	PERSON	turned that atmosphere into a fascinating dream-haze ; Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	wins our sympathy for it by distilling its everyday facts .

		Lamb said that the characters in Res - toration comedy `` have got out of Christen - dom into a land of what shall I call it ?

		of cuckoldry , the Utopia of gallantry , '' etc. .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	makes the reader intimately real - ize that the society in which the dramatist moved `` had no horror of promiscuous exog - amy '' ; that `` the anxieties of ridiculous hus - bands '' in his plays are only `` the anxieties of men of property '' ; that
Wycherley	PERSON	in seventeenth century eyes `` was undoubtedly , astonishing as it may seem , a moral force '' ; and so on .

		In regard to the trend of Restoration com - edy , our author has some interesting conten - tions .

		The type owed , he argues , `` almost as little to
France	LOCATION	as to the English school which it displaced . ''

		He makes out a clear case for its artistic originality , which has been so largely obscured in the history of literature .

		At the same time we must still believe that the type was the outcome of a mood essentially foreign to English society : the impulse came from abroad , though it was so thoroughly narrowed and heightened by the English ca - pacity for artistic extremes -LRB- not well recog - nized by English writers -RRB- that it produced swiftly an original art-form .

		In this connec - tion , we should have been grateful if Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	had faced the question as to just how far the mood was actually current in English society at the time .

		At this late date it is impossible to count heads ; but it seems cer - tain that the term `` Restoration Society , '' with its connoted attitude toward sex , should stand for a comparatively small number of persons , rather than for the wide social revo - lution so glibly assumed by many writers .

		On the other hand , the chapter on
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	makes clear that the Restoration mood merged much more easily than is ordinarily supposed
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 417 into that of the moralistic era which suc - ceeded . ' '

		The popular idea , ' ' says the author , `` is right in assuming that
Congreve	PERSON	is King
Charles	PERSON	and his spaniels at their highest ex - pression .

		It is wrong in not having realized that
King Charles	PERSON	and his spaniels at their highest expression is Queen
Anne	PERSON	and her dish of tea .

		Pope is the perfection of Ether - ege .

		The Essay on Man is the polished ex - pression of
Rochester	LOCATION	's attitude towards life . ''

		Especially interesting is Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's dem - onstration of the manner in which Restoration comedy declined in the hands of its later ex - ponents .

		While still clinging to the type which reached its height in
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Way of the World , ' '
Vanbrugh	PERSON	and above all
Farquhar	PERSON	undermined that type by allowing intrusions of the moralistic and emotional standpoint .

		`` Adultery is no longer treated in the dry light of comedy .

		It is passionate ; it takes to itself fine names .

		It is a comedy of heaving bosoms and seductive phrase .

		Vanbrugh , in fact , killed the comedy of sex for the English theatre . ''

		And `` where the critics find in Farquhar humanity and fresh air , we shall detect an emotional and roman - tic treatment of sex stifling the parent stem of a comedy whose appeal depended upon an entirely different system of moral and imag - inative values . ''

		The fact is that we find in
Vanbrugh	LOCATION	and
Farquhar	PERSON	some of that cloaked appeal of indecency which since their day has frequently blotted English literature .

		It ap - pears in the latest works of prominent English novelists , although their master ,
Meredith	PERSON	-LRB- who , to be sure , found difficulty in making a living -RRB- , had revived the batteries of the
Comic Spirit	ORGANIZATION	against it .

		* In his final chapter , ' ' Critical Conclusions , ' ' Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	analyzes
Collier	PERSON	's `` Short View '' in connection with the replies of
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	,
Vanbrugh	PERSON	, and the anonymous author of `` A Vindication of the Stage '' -LRB- 1699 -RRB- .

		He makes clear that the comparative futility of these replies , which contributed largely to
Collier	PERSON	's triumph over his own and succeeding gen - erations , is easily understandable from the critical inaptitude of the writers and from the nature of the atmosphere in which they moved .

		Thereupon , however , our author leaves the field of literary history and attempts -LRB- pages 288 to 297 -RRB- , from the standpoint of literary criticism , a justification of Restoration com - edy which adds no strength to the book .

		It was the necessary sequel , however , of a ques - * Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	suggests that there is epochal significance in the exclamation of
Farquhar	ORGANIZATION	's Sir
Harry Wildair	PERSON	upon listen - ing to
Angelica	LOCATION	's sentimental verses : '' This is the first whore in heroics that I have met with . ''

		There have indeed been many since .

		See , for instance , the amazing verses quoted for disapprobation on page 302 of the
March	DATE	'' At - lantic . ''

		tion which he had raised , infelicitously in the opinion of the reviewer , at the close of his first chapter .

		This question was whether we `` are aesthet - ically justified in accepting
Hazlitt	PERSON	and
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	in the teeth of the giants ,
Johnson	PERSON	and Swift ,
Thackeray	PERSON	and Meredith . ''

		Certainly the question finds no satisfactory answer later on in the book ; although the author had already quoted with evident approbation eulogies of Restoration comedy from the pens of
Haz	PERSON	- litt ,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and Hunt .

		Now , these three critics were touched by the Romantic mood of their day ; and `` the detached historian , '' as Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	once calls himself , ought to recognize that their views , as well as those of
Collier	PERSON	and his tribe , are obsolescent .

		It will suffice to point out here that they felt the fascination of what we may call the Romantic `` pleasure of escape . ''

		Especially delightful to
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	was an imaginary escape from the region of moral law into the atmosphere of Restoration comedy where , he claims , `` there is neither right nor wrong , gratitude or its opposite , '' and so on .

		But obviously , true comedy can not move , nor ever has moved , in such a world : since it is a heightened rep - resentation of polite social life , which is never a-moral .

		This ground , in fact , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	virtually assumes , without recurring to Lamb , in his final chapter .

		His contention is that the life-stuff of Restoration comedy is a lim - ited , but nevertheless real and harmonious , system of social morality .

		Here he is right ; but he fails to see how very limited , as mate - rial for comedy , that system really is .

		In urging that it comprises `` a mood of the human spirit which is in every age , though in this particular age it was more conspic - uous , '' he shifts his premise and obscures the issue .

		For many a mood of the human spirit has persisted in every age without attaining that social stamp which alone can render it a fit foundation for comedy .

		That the social validity attaching to the Restoration `` mood '' is very slight indeed , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	himself fre - quently makes us feel in the course of his work ; for instance , when he reminds us that to be in full sympathy with that mood we must `` forget that sexual pleasure is abom - inable unless it be tempered with exalted sentiments and a keen delight of the parties in each other 's society '' -LRB- page 42 -RRB- .

		Indeed , the swift decline of Restoration comedy , and even the wrong-headed batterings of the mor - alists , are testimony to the slightness of hold which this artistic mode had on social reality .

		In short , we must partly agree with that pro- nouncement of
Meredith	ORGANIZATION	's which Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	quotes to reject -LRB- page 27 -RRB- .

		`` Our so-called Comedy of Manners , '' says
Meredith	PERSON	, `` is the 418 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE
Comedy of Manners of South Sea Islanders	ORGANIZATION	under city veneer ; and as to comic idea , vac - uous as the mask without the face behind it . ' '

		The second half of this statement is false criticism ; but the first part neatly expresses the limited and obsolete nature of Restoration comedy .

		`` Whites in
America	LOCATION	number approxi - mately ninety millions , Asiatics number less than one hundred and fifty thousand ; yet we face an ominous racial situation ... Mis - understanding , foreboding fear , humiliating treatment , on the side of
America	LOCATION	; disap - pointment , indignation , resentment , on the side of
Japan	LOCATION	; such are the mutterings of a threatened international storm . ''

		-LRB- `` The American Japanese Problem , '' p. 3 . -RRB-

		Both authors discuss the recent agitation in
California	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	believes that political expediency dictated the hostility to the Japanese , but Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	seems to have come nearer the truth when he says : `` Months of study of this question in
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia have convinced the writer that the popular approval of the anti-Japanese agita - tion and legislation does not concern the de - tails of the proposed bills nor the insulting language used by a few , but rests entirely on the conviction that there should be no swamping immigration from
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Their universal and unqualified approval of this position , which is fundamental , has led the good people to keep silence in regard to details which they consider are but incidental . ' '

		Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	then shows that this anti-Japanese leg - islation is needless , misleading , and humiliat - ing to
Japan	LOCATION	, while it disgraces the
United States	LOCATION	as well .

		Again , both authors take up the question of assimilation .

		They agree that the Japanese are capable of assimilation , and that the
United States	LOCATION	is able to Americanize them .

		Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	brings out clearly the three factors in race assimilation : `` biological assimila - tion through intermarriage ; biological assimi - lation without intermarriage ; and social assimilation . ' '

		Both believe that the Japanese will respond readily to social assimilation pro- vided they are given equal opportunities with other immigrants in this land .

		Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	also believes that Japanese born in
America	LOCATION	will `` tend to certain structural and physio - logical characteristics of the dominant race . ''

		But concerning assimilation through inter - marriage we have little data to enlighten us .

		Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	believes that `` such unions have , as a rule , been successful . ' '

		Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	, on the other hand , considers mixed marriages to be `` highly undesirable .

		In only excep - tional cases can there be a ` happy home . ' '

		In addition to the topics which find treat - ment in both volumes , Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	de - scribes the achievements of certain Japanese in this country , such as Dr.
Takamine	PERSON	, Dr.
Noguchi	PERSON	, Mr.
Shima	PERSON	-LRB- the `` potato king '' -RRB- , and Mr.
Furuya	PERSON	, a merchant of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		He also describes the life of the Japanese immigrants on the farms and in the cities ,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 419 pointing out the important place of the Jap - anese in certain Californian industries .

		He then devotes five chapters to the Japanese in
Hawaii	LOCATION	and in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		It is a matter of surprise to find in a book devoted to the re - moval of racial prejudice a survival of that very spirit .

		On several occasions the conduct of the Chinese in
California	LOCATION	is cited as a con - trast to that of the Japanese , and in one place
Hawaii	LOCATION	is warned `` against the undesirable influence which must inevitably result from the increasingly greater influx of immigrants from
Russia	LOCATION	and
Southern Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		There are two chapters in Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	's vol - ume which should be read by every American having to do with Japanese as employees , for in `` Misunderstandings , Explanations , and Interpretations '' will be found much light on otherwise unintelligible actions .

		Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	's treatment of `` The Perils Yellow and White '' and of `` Illusions Occidental and Oriental '' shows a thorough grasp of the great world-movements in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		Finally , Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	presents the `` Outlines of a New American Oriental Policy . ''

		It is founded on a general immigration law , which will apply to all peoples and which will admit only as many immigrants in a year as we may be reasonably expected to assimilate , while other features call for the granting of Ameri - can citizenship `` to every qualified individual regardless of race , '' and the establishment of `` direct federal responsibility for all legal and legislative matters in which aliens as such are involved . ''

		Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	and Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	have ren - dered a real public service .

		They have clearly shown the significance of the clash of races which may arise around the shores of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and they have indicated the desira - bility and the possibility of turning this meeting of different peoples into a `` golden advantage '' instead of a yellow or a white `` peril . ''

		The two volumes -LRB- for one supple - ments the other -RRB- should be read by all for - ward-looking Americans , and especially by those whose official position gives them the opportunity to be of service in meeting this great world-problem , in the solution of which
America	LOCATION	must take a leading role .

		time , is more appreciative than ever before of the charm and significance of this form of poetry , for Professor Child 's work is having its fruition in a generation trained in the traditions of British ballads and aware of their wayward and primitive beauty .

		More - over , the investigations now being carried on regarding cow-boy ballads , mountain ballads , and many others , keep constantly before us a sense of the vitality and permanence of this folk literature .

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	's volume of translations of the folk-ballads of
Southern Europe	LOCATION	is a contribution of distinctive and enduring value , for it has material new to most readers , and the translations themselvesv are masterpieces .

		In reading the folk-ballads of the south one receives a wholly new impression of the inter - relationships of the ballads , and of the slight - ness of barrier of race and country in regard to elemental feeling .

		An unexpected similar - ity of motif and of manner seems to unite these ballads of the south with ballads of the north .

		The tremendous intensity of life , the swiftness and suddenness of emotion , the changes from violent love to pitiless reveng - ing hate , the sinister belief in malign super - natural powers , all are to be found in these poems drawn from various sources but hold - ing perfect agreement as to the passionate facts of human life .

		It is impossible to read the ballads without surrendering to the naive mood of the recorders .

		One is bound to for - get centuries of conventional restraint , and to live once more in the fierce and poignant fashion pictured in these narratives .

		The re - sponse is immediate , complete , and testifies to the skill and art of the translator who could so effectively turn southern accents into verse that never suggests mere translation , but seems like the original forms of the ballads themselves .

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	was engaged for many years in studying southern ballads , translating some of them for use as illustrative material in her course in British ballads at
Wellesley	LOCATION	.

		As the fascination of these old tales worked upon her imagination , she continued to translate , gathering together a group of varied ballads which she intended to arrange for publication .

		Her death in
1909	DATE	, before the projected vol - ume was quite completed , made its postpone - ment inevitable , until her literary executors could revise the material .

		The book has been prepared for the press by Professor
Katharine Lee Bates	PERSON	, to whose loyal and devoted care is due the fact that the form and content of the work are in perfect accord with
Miss Jewett	PERSON	's plans .

		With unerring skill
Miss Bates	PERSON	has arranged the Introduction and Notes , and has added the necessary annotations , going very 420 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	carefully over the translations and verifying each one with utmost exactness .

		The translations are arranged under the following heads : Ballads of Love , Ballads of Murder , Ballads of Prisoners , Biblical and Apocryphal Ballads , and Ballads of the Su - pernatural .

		Under each division are grouped the translations from various sources , includ - ing Roumanian , Sicilian , Piedmontese ,
Vene	PERSON	- tian , Neapolitan , Corsican , Castilian ,
Catalan	LOCATION	, French ,
Gascon	PERSON	, and Provengal .

		In every case the original is printed on one page , with the translation facing it , so that the student can refer to the exact text from which the translation was made .

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	's apparent audacity in translating from so many differ - ent dialects merely shows her intense preoccu - pation with her subject .

		By no means a linguist , and never ambitious to display the real depth of her actual learning , she began her work under the challenge of an imagin - ative interest which forced her to undertake tasks that demanded patient , exact , and scru - pulously objective interpretation .

		Nothing has been forfeited , nothing added ; the bal - lads are faithfully rendered , with a fine sense of literary integrity .

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	's familiarity with Italian made easy her work in the various dialects of
Italy	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	; but in translating Roumanian she used French renderings , poring over these and comparing them with the Roumanian until she became , in a way , familiar with that language and able to interpret its phrases .

		Precision and accuracy are to be noted in all the renderings , which are not the work of a few days but of months of prolonged study .

		Sheer enjoyment of the beauty and the vigor of these foreign ballads lured her deeper into the work of interpretation , and in this volume we have an impressive instance of the way in which the genuine lover of literature over - comes difficulties , solves problems , and perse - veres to the end in the endeavor to get truth at its source .

		With slow and cautious exact - ness she felt her way into the very heart of these ballads , and gained that completeness of sympathy which distinguishes the transla - tions .

		On every page one realizes how keenly she enjoyed the revelations of grim , undisci - plined , spontaneous emotion , and how effec - tively she preserved the naturalness of the originals .

		A satisfactory translation is almost like an original creation , for it requires the power of grasping the essential unity behind details , and it demands the gift of subtly interpreta - tive style and diction .

		The dramatic vigor and relentless simplicity of the ballads are brought out with consummate art by the trans - lator .

		The rapid dialogue , with its terse and tense movement and its ominous omissions , is reproduced with vital understanding of that primitive directness of speech .

		In rendering rhythms and cadences ,
Miss Jewett	PERSON	has been remarkably successful , keeping enough of the original to suggest its form , and yet never offending against the harmonies of English verse .

		Perhaps the best example of the translator 's art is to be seen in her own favorite , ``
Donna Lombarda	PERSON	, '' a ballad which in the
Piedmont	LOCATION	- ese is singularly full of potent suggestiveness , and which in the translation seems to keep all the terrible brevity of the original .

		With its perfectly modulated cadences , its haunting simplicity of diction , and its concentrated expressiveness , the translation is perfectly wrought .

Donna Lombarda	PERSON	Calls her confessor to shrive her and save ; '' With the third drop
Donna Lombarda	PERSON	Calls for the sexton to dig her a grave . ''

		By the vigor and delicacy of her sympa - thetic insight as revealed in the translations , and also in the quick and clear suggestiveness of the Introduction and Notes ,
Miss Jewett	PERSON	has guided her readers to a keen sense of the quivering and exultant passions of the folk .

		The translations interpret a past that can not seem remote or insignificant , for some magic of literary art and of human intuition has recreated vanished beings and endowed them with lasting life .

		To give this quickening im - pulse to the laggard imaginations of readers is to do literature a memorable service .

		RECEXT FICTION .

		* `` Katya '' is a novel translated from the Danish of
Herr Fran / de Jessen	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
W. J. Alexander Worster	PERSON	.

		Both author and trans - lator are unknown to us by name , but the latter has done his work in so masterly a way that he leaves us quite unconscious of any struggle in the effort to express the thought and style of his original in a foreign medium , while the former has produced one of the big - gest pieces of fiction that has come to us from a continental source for many years .

		It is a revelation of power and beauty comparable with that given us by `` War and Peace , '' by the great trilogy of
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, by ``
Jorn Uhl	PERSON	, '' and by ' '
Jean-Christophe	PERSON	. ''

		The best work now being done in English seems trifling , sophisticated , and insincere , when set by the side of this masterpiece of psychological in - sight and dramatic power .

		parison with the work of Dostoieffsky ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and Tourguenieff , and so unquestionably does it exhibit the qualities that have made the great Russians the masters of them that write fiction in our modern age .

		Had it been signed with one of their names , we should have been unable to dispute , from any internal evi - dence , the authenticity of the ascription .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has recently said of the author that he `` seems to know exactly not only the de - tails of daily life on an estate in the
Ukraine	LOCATION	and the manner in which Russian diplomats pass their days in the capitals of
Europe	LOCATION	as well as at isolated posts in small Turkish and Servian towns ; he also knows how young and older people of both sexes in those parts think and feel . ''

		This judgment gives some idea of the substance of the work .

		It opens on the estate of
Priluka	LOCATION	, the ancestral home of the Prilinskis ; and , however far afield the action may take us ,
Priluka	LOCATION	, the home , always lies in the background of our vision .

		Prince
Pri	PERSON	- linski , and his wife , their three children , the young men and women who are the intimates of the household , and the servants who are its faithful retainers , constitute a group of peo - ple who are characterized , one and all , with unfailing sympathy and minute fidelity , and individually realized as are few such groups anywhere in the field of fictive art .

		From this company emerges the central figure of
Katya	PERSON	, the younger daughter of the house , whose vivid personality dominates the narrative , and shapes the destinies of the men who come within the sphere of her influence .

		For some inexplicable reason , the American publishers call her ' ' the
Becky Sharp	PERSON	of
Russia	LOCATION	, ' ' which is a comparison so amazingly inept that we do not see how it could have suggested itself to any intelligent mind .

		In common with
Thackeray	PERSON	's hateful creation ,
Katya	PERSON	has am - bition , it is true , but otherwise she is a crea - ture of air and fire , lovable in her most wayward aspects , and the men who proudly bear her chains are richly rewarded for their glad servitude .

		Our own comparison would be with
Mary Stuart	PERSON	rather than with
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, but here also with a difference ; the severest indictment that may be brought against her is that she is over-avid of admira - tion , that sordid considerations have some share in her marriage , that she is a little less than the perfect mother to her children , and that she is a little reckless of consequences at critical moments .

		We have an impression that the author would have us view her more harshly than we can find it in our heart to do , and that the sadness and futility of her late years are to be taken somewhat as a judg - ment upon her for her hardness , her selfish - ness , and her vacillation of spirit .

		But if 422 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	this be his wish , we can only say that his heroine has escaped from the control of her creator , and that she still holds our allegiance , as she held that of the Englishman who gave her the full measure of his devotion , and of the naval officer who entered the path of de - struction when he thought that she was lost to him .

		She remains imaged to us , despite her faults , as a splendid creature to whom our deepest sympathies go out , and who is the sport of malign fate rather than the destroyer of men 's souls .

		Only a few words may be spared for a suggestion of the plot .

		Prince
Prilinski	PERSON	has gone into extensive building oper - ations in a suburban quarter on the water front of
Odessa	LOCATION	, with the aid of capital bor - rowed from
General Karatayef	ORGANIZATION	, a man whose great wealth is of dubious origin .

		The Prince becomes overloaded with debt , and is in dan - ger of losing all his means , when the General , ambitious for his only son
Niki	PERSON	, offers to re - lieve the situation on the condition of an alli - ance between
Niki	PERSON	and
Katya	PERSON	.

		The condition is accepted , and
Priluki	ORGANIZATION	is saved .

		Now
Katya	PERSON	is really in love with
Niki	PERSON	, and makes him a faithful wife throughout his long career in the diplomatic service .

		After that career is ended by a Turkish bullet in an uprising at
Stradova	LOCATION	, where he is the Russian consul , she yields to the solicitations of
Farringham	LOCATION	, the English lover who has given her a doglike devotion for many years , and pledges herself to him .

		But she is not sure of herself , and puts him off from month to month .

		Mean - while ,
Petya Orloff	PERSON	is in the distance , an offi - cer in the Russian navy .

		Katya has been the lodestar of his life , and in his youth she had given him just enough encouragement to keep the spark of hope alive in his breast .

		Lost to him once when she married
Niki	PERSON	, he now finds her seemingly lost to him again when she pledges herself to Farringham .

		This im - pels him to a desperate course .

		It is the time of the war with
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The Russian defeats have given the forces of disorder their oppor - tunity , and the revolutionary uprising in
South Russia	LOCATION	breaks out .

		In the scenes of carnage that follow , a child of the people , who has for years been
Orloff	PERSON	's mistress , is killed in the street .

		He is distracted by her death , and with the surplus of emotion over logic that marks the Russian temperament , offers himself to the revolutionary party as a leader .

		In the roadstead of
Odessa	LOCATION	lies the battleship of which he is second officer , and
Orloff	PERSON	heads a mutiny by which he obtains command of the vessel .

		Placing it at the service of the revo - lution , he is ordered to shell the very quarter of
Odessa	LOCATION	which the Karatayef-Prilinski en - terprise had built , and which has become a nest of conspirators .

		Their cause is already lost , and only this heroic measure will save their papers from seizure and their leaders from arrest .

		The work of destruction is ac - complished , and then
Orloff	PERSON	, accepting full responsibility , surrenders himself , is tried , and , despite the frantic efforts of
Katya	PERSON	in his behalf , is sentenced and executed .

		Katya has now lost the truest of her lovers , and Far - ringham has gone out of her life , having learned of her feelings for
Orloff	PERSON	.

		The bom - bardment of
Odessa	LOCATION	has bereft her of most of her fortune , and she ends by accepting an offer of marriage from a neighboring land - owner , a commonplace person who had also been one of her admirers in the careless days of youth .

		The movement of the novel , at first deliberately measured , receives rapid ac - celeration when we come to the tragedy of
Stradova	LOCATION	, and the scenes of the mutiny are flashed upon the screen in swift and bewil - dering succession .

		We know of few things in fiction as stirring and tense as are these later chapters .

		And from beginning to end , we are given the sense of knowing in their habit as they lived the figures that people these pages .

		They become intimate acquaintances , and arouse both interest and sympathy in the deepest degree .

		Slow as is the development of the plot before the stage of its whirlwind finish , there is nothing that we would call superfluous , and the sure instinct of the artist makes every touch effective .

		The name of Franz de
Jessen	PERSON	must now be added to the list of the greatest living novelists .

		It is in - deed a new star that has swum into our ken .

		The exotic fictions of Mr.
Stacpoole	PERSON	are mul - tiplying rapidly , and exhibit a growing power which is making this writer a man to be reck - oned with .

		His '' Children of the Sea '' is a grim and vivid story of
Iceland	LOCATION	, with a pro- logue on the Japanese coast , where are sown the seeds of the tragedy that later ripens under the Arctic circle .

		A sailorman named
Ericsson	ORGANIZATION	on shore-leave runs foul of a com - pany of Japanese merrymakers , and becomes captivated by the provocative witchery of a girl of the party .

		Then the scene shifts to
Iceland	LOCATION	, whither he returns , and where he sets out to establish a fishing business in rivalry with the local monopolist .

		He wins the love of
Schwalla	LOCATION	, a beautiful girl whose parents are forcing her into a marriage with this octo - pus of the fisheries , and then he makes the appalling discovery that his Japanese esca - pade has infected him with leprosy .

		Like a wounded animal , he crawls off to a cave which he may use as a hiding-place in which to meet his miserable fate alone , but
Schwalla	PERSON	tracks him to his lair , and the two put out in a boat together that the sea may swallow them up .

		This tense and colorful history is told with
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 423 sharp verbal economy , and with a strong sense of the values of the rugged sea-girt land - scape of the island of fire .

		It exhibits an intimate knowledge of the life and the psy - chology of the
Iceland	LOCATION	fisher-folk , and is deeply impressive in its directness and simple strength .

		Something of the spirit of the saga-writers has got possession of the author and controlled his pen .

		In its reduction of sentiment to a minimum , and in its clear - visioned presentation of the bare facts of life , it comes near to being a masterpiece .

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	could hardly have told the story to better effect , although he would have told it with much more of indirection , and with a profusion of the analysis in which Mr.
Stac	PERSON	- poole is so conspicuously lacking .

		`` Carmen and Mr.
Dryasdust	PERSON	'' is not at all the story we should have expected from the author of `` The Joyous Wayfarer , '' although we can understand its having been written by the author of ' ' Patchwork Comedy . ' '

		Mr.
Jor	PERSON	- dan seems to be well on the way toward match - ing Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	in the matter of versatility and the command of various manners .

		Mr.
Dry	PERSON	- asdust is a
Cambridge	LOCATION	don , of the dons don - nish , a typical specimen .

		Why he should have married
Carmen	PERSON	, or she him , is a good deal of a mystery , for
Carmen	ORGANIZATION	is a young woman of Spanish ancestry , and her advent into
Cambridge	LOCATION	society considerably flutters the dovecotes of dondom .

		To begin with , she can not take college society seriously , and its gossiping and petty intrigue seem to her only a parody of real existence .

		Further , she knows exactly what she wants , and exactly how to get it , which means that her husband is as wax in her hands .

		She loves him , and just because of that she seeks to get him out of the academic rut and to widen his horizon .

		This she accomplishes , but so deftly that he hardly realizes the compulsion of the silken web of constraint that she spins around him ; it is true that he makes an apparent struggle from time to time , but he knows that he will have to yield , and does it gracefully enough after just enough protest to appease his self - respect .

		And when he finds himself in the end a denizen of the strange extra-university world , he recognizes the fact that all has worked out for the best , and that
Carmen	PERSON	has been his good angel .

		He has become undesic - cated while there is yet time for him to become a man , and to appreciate the fact that life is something more than an affair restricted within cloisters and quadrangles .

		It is a very human story and a highly entertaining one , albeit its course is placid and the depths of emotion are nowise sounded .

		Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's story of `` The Fortunate Youth '' begins in a
London	LOCATION	slum .

		At this early stage of his career , the youth has pic - turesque powers of speech which may be illus - trated by this choice specimen of repartee : `` You could no ' knock hell out of a bug . ''

		A little later , we find him conversing after the following fashion : `` You may find happiness and peace of soul under the stars . ''

		During the interval that has elapsed , he has run away from home , lived on the road with a vagrant peddler , found his way to
London	LOCATION	, and be - came an actor in a humble way .

		The reform of his speech is the result of several factors : the root of the matter is in him ; he has extraor - dinary powers of imitation and adaptation ; he cherishes the delusion that he is a lost child of noble parentage .

		In addition , he is extraor - dinarily handsome , and things come his way so fast that we are breathless as we follow his fortunes .

		It all seems to be a fairy tale as we go on to read of his being picked up by a county family and adopted into the house - hold , of his becoming secretary to an
M. P.	PERSON	and later a candidate himself for political honors , of his brilliant social career , and of his success in winning the love of a princess .

		Toward the end , the dream of his life is rudely shattered by the discovery that his long-lost father is a fried-fish magnate and ex-convict , not the noble Italian whom he had confidently expected sometime to discover .

		But while this is a setback , it does not really matter in the end , for the princess becomes reconciled to the situation , and her hero wins the elec - tion , incidentally inheriting a fortune when his father dies .

		The narrative has but slight relation to reality , but it appeals to the roman - tic instinct that has little use for reality or even verisimilitude , and it is written with the sprightly and whimsical touch that always makes Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's work interesting .

		And it has strong characters ,
Paul	PERSON	himself ,
Barney Bill	PERSON	, who saves him from the slum , the Win - woods , who make a man of him , and
Silas Finn	PERSON	, the religious zealot who turns out to be
Paul	PERSON	's father .

		These make engaging com - pany for the hours spent in reading the story .

		The Indian Mutiny is a subject of appar - ently inexhaustible interest for the novelist .

		The latest in the long line of good stories based upon this theme is Mr.
Talbot Mundy	PERSON	's ' ' Rung Ho ! ' '

		which takes us up to the very edge of the outbreak , but has nothing to do with the hackneyed horrors of
Delhi	LOCATION	and
Lucknow	LOCATION	and Cawnpore .

		The hero is
Ralph Cunningham	PERSON	, who comes into the Indian military service backed by the prestige of his father and grandfather , long imbedded in the heroic legend of the country .

		The Mutiny has not yet been declared , but its imminence is apparent to the informed , and the episode which is the climax of the present narrative and of which
Ralph	PERSON	is the hero is one that serves to strengthen the Brit - ish resistance to the coming storm .

		Roman - tically , it is concerned with the rescue of
Rosemary MacLean	PERSON	, daughter of a Scotch missionary in
Rajputana	LOCATION	, from a perilous sit - uation in which her life is placed by the wooing of a treacherous native prince .

		The hero and the heroine are predestined for one another , but no sentimentality is wasted upon their romance .

		When the time comes , they simply accept the situation as a matter of course .

		In fact , there seems to be no waste or surplusage anywhere in the story , which is told in singularly forthright fashion , and is for that reason , as well as for its insight into native character , extraordinarily effec - tive .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	could hardly have done it better , and Mrs. Steel could not have done it in less than three times the space .

		When
Christine Wyndham	PERSON	is a little girl of seventeen , in charge of a governess on the seashore of
France	LOCATION	, she makes a playmate of a young French officer , and is implicated with him in an innocent escapade which has serious consequences .

		They are caught in a cave by the tide , and forced to remain overnight .

		The resulting scandal is such that
Christine	PERSON	is bundled post-haste back to
England	LOCATION	.

		When she grows up , she marries an Englishman who is almost painfully good , but the memory of her childish attachment does not fade from her heart .

		Meanwhile , the Frenchman has been made the victim of a treacherous plot which results in his being convicted of trea - son , and sentenced to a term of imprisonment .

		When set free , he takes refuge in
England	LOCATION	, and suffers the direst poverty , until he is rescued by
Christine	PERSON	* s husband , and taken into the family as his private secretary .


Chris	PERSON	- tine , all this time , has made the mistake of concealing from her husband the romantic episode of her childhood ; and when he learns of it from other sources , an estrangement re - sults , which ends in her taking flight .

		She can not restrain her love for the Frenchman , but their mutually avowed passion is without sinful consequences .

		In the course of time , the plot which had led to his degradation is exposed , and he is shown to have been a sec - ond
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	, just as he is at the point of death from heart failure .

		His vindication is complete , but only death can unravel the knot of his personal fate , and so he is conveniently disposed of , leaving the way open for a recon - ciliation between
Christine	PERSON	and her husband .

		I ` The Rocks of Valpre '' is a deft old-fash - ioned novel , with much variety of interest and some effective character drawing .

		It comes dangerously near shipwreck on the rock of sentimentality , but never becomes quite mawkish .

		Miss
Ethel M. Dell	PERSON	, who wrote that strong novel , `` The Way of an Eagle , '' is the author .

		Heralded by much advertisement , and with all the notoriety attendant upon the winning of a substantial money prize , `` Diane of the Green Van '' makes a clamorous appeal for our attention .

		It is the work of Miss
Leona Dalrymple	PERSON	, a young woman hitherto unknown to fame , and now disclosed as a writer of tricksy charm and astonishing fertility of in - vention .

		We frankly confess that the plot baffles us .

		It would require the analytical skill of a
Poe	PERSON	or a
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	to exhibit the complication in diagrammatic form .

		New intricacies and unexpected relations are de - veloped in every chapter , until at the end we are utterly bewildered , and can make no con - fident guess at the writer 's intentions .

		All that we are sure of is that here is a charming heroine , impelled by the wanderlust to roam gypsy-fashion from
Connecticut	LOCATION	to
Florida	LOCATION	in the green van of the title , attended on her way by a train of devoted lovers and des - perate villains .

		The secret of her love for the open appears to be that she is of Seminole descent , and the varied machinations of which she is the victim are accounted for by some sort of connection with the royal line of an obscure European kingdom called
Houdania	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whether she really is thus connected , or whether her Indian strain is authentic , we have been unable to discover with certainty .

		When the ancient document concealed in the old wooden candle-stick is found to have been a mystification , the solid ground slips from under our feet , and we are left helpless .

		How - ever , the gypsy pilgrimage is vividly de - scribed , and the faithful suitor who guards the heroine is rewarded for his devotion .

		Of this much , but of little more , we are certain .

		The book offers the very delirium of romance , set forth in a manner of which a feeling for nature and a smart slangy type of conversa - tion are the chief ingredients .

		`` The Light of Western Stars , '' by Mr.
Zane Grey	PERSON	, is a stirring romance of the south - western desert , the scene being laid in
New Mexico	LOCATION	, close to the Mexican border .

		This enables the author to work the Mexican revo - lution into his plot , and raids in both direc - tions are among the incidents .

		A young woman of wealth and social distinction is the heroine .

		Becoming weary of the round of gaiety which has been her normal existence ,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 425 and fairly loathing its emptiness , she cuts loose from it all , and sets out to visit her brother , who is a rancher in
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Her adventures begin the moment she steps off the train at the frontier station , for her brother , who has not known of her coming , is not on hand to meet her , and she falls into the hands of a drunken cowboy , who insists that she shall marry him forthwith .

		A Spanish padre is produced , who mumbles words that she does not understand , and the distracted girl says `` Si '' without knowing to what the vocable commits her .

		It is not until near the close of the story that she learns herself to have been the wife of the cowboy all the time .

		Mean - while , the desert fascinates her , and she casts in her lot with it , purchasing a ranch , and thus becoming the employer of many other ador - ing cowboys .

		Her unknown husband , not daring to reveal the secret , protects her from many perils , and worships her from afar .

		His love works in him a regeneration that makes him worthy of her , for he has been a gentle - man , and is only temporarily fallen from that estate .

		After many melodramatic happen - ings , the truth comes out , but not before she is ready to be reconciled to the revelation and its consequences .

		The situation is not unlike that of `` The Great Divide . ''

		It is all stagy and conventional stuff , but good of its kind , skilfully managed , and effective .

		Now and then , the writer seems to be planning effects for us which do not quite come off and leave us rather disappointed , as in the case of the elaborate preparations made for fooling and thrilling the lady 's visitors from the east , and in the case of the Mexican bandit who seeks to abduct the heroine .

		But there is no lack of excitement in the narrative , which has also a considerable admixture of romantic glamour and poetic charm .

		It `` reads '' from begin - ning to end and mingles a good deal of humor with its melodramatic plot .

Jules Verne	PERSON	, Sir Rider

Allan Stern	PERSON	and
Beatrice Kendrick	PERSON	, a civil engineer and his stenographer , wake up one morning on the fortieth floor of a sky - scraper to behold a world in ruins , and come gradually to realize that they have been in a state of suspended animation for a thousand years or more .

		A cataclysm has swept man - kind from the earth , and these two alone sur - vive of the human race , unless we style human the debased and bestial creatures whom they afterwards encounter in their adventures .


New York	LOCATION	has become a jungle and the lair of wild beasts , and nearly everything of organic na - ture has rotted away , leaving only objects of stone and metal unchanged .

		Precession has made a notable change in the direction of the earth 's axis , and increased speed of rotation has shortened the day by an hour or more .

		A new satellite has been formed by ejection from the earth , and revolves about its parent as a dark attendant , although no attempt is made to explain why it does not receive illumina - tion from the sun , which shines as usual .

		This object seems to have been torn from the earth in the region of the Great Lakes , presumably taking
Chicago	LOCATION	with it , and in its place there is a huge abyss , inhabited by a race of degen - erate descendants of civilized man .

		These discoveries are made by the enterprising cou - ple in the course of their explorations , which are extensive , being made with the aid of an airship fortunately unearthed , and put into commission by the engineer 's skill .

		Strange to say , they find abundant stores of alcohol in the cities , although the gasoline has all evap - orated , and this provides them with fuel for motive power .

		In fact , they find most of the things they really need for carrying on life , and learn to make those that they do not find , aided by a copy of the '' Encyclopaedia Brit - annica '' printed upon nickel leaves , and thus preserved from decay .

		When they discover the men of the abyss , they attempt to civilize them , and take them forth into the world of sunlight by means of the aeroplane , hoping to rear a new race of men upon this debased foundation .

		Allan proves a most resourceful person , and
Beatrice	PERSON	a sturdy helpmate in the series of fantastic perils to which they are exposed , and from which they always escape after reaching a point at which there seems to be no possible way out .

		They are predes - tined to be lovers , and the chinks of the weird narrative are filled in and thickly plastered over with sentiment .

		We should say that for those who like this sort of thing the tale will provide just the sort of thing that they like .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS .

		The establishment of the Re - public in
China	LOCATION	, with the conse - quent intensified interest in the Chinese people , and also the consequent dis - appearance , in large measure , of the old rev - erence for the royal family , seems to have been a fortunate event for students of history .

		A rich new field for research has thus been opened to scholarship .

		Among those who are availing themselves of this tempting oppor - tunity , Messrs.
Backhouse	PERSON	and Bland , joint authors of ``
China	LOCATION	under the Empress Dow - ager , '' have already taken very high rank , and this rank has been well sustained by Mr. 426 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	- Bland in `` Recent Events and Present Poli - cies in
China	LOCATION	. ''

		It is gratifying , therefore , to have a study of court life during 1 the Manchu dynasty under the same joint author - ship .

		In `` Annals and Memoirs of the Court of Peking '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- historic Chinese char - acters , both men and women , become alive again , and a thrilling tale is unfolded of the degeneration and ultimate ruin of an Oriental dynasty .

		The authors have availed themselves of original sources of information probably quite inaccessible during the continuance of the dynasty , and the first-hand accounts of stirring and terrible events from the begin - ning of Manchu rule down to the end of that sway in
China	LOCATION	furnish as interesting reading as any historical romance .

		Indeed , there is a sort of interest attaching to this book which is wanting in the best romance : the stamp of veracity on the numerous excerpts from con - temporary documents which the authors use adds tremendously to the genuine human ap - peal of the book .

		One feels that for the first time the very roots of the hidden life at Peking are being laid bare .

		The authors are to be criticised for having omitted needed ref - erence to authorities in a good many passages where interpretations of vitally important events are offered to the reader , interpreta - tions by no means so obviously true as to carry conviction with the mere statement ; but in the main the work is a product of painstaking scholarship , and evidences quite unusual preparation and ability for research in Chinese history .

		While recognizing the great qualities of the Chinese race , the writers are temperamentally pessimistic in their out - look , and the present reviewer believes that a more hopeful attitude toward the near fu - ture in
China	LOCATION	is perfectly reasonable even in the light of the ugly pictures convincingly drawn by these writers of the court life in Peking .

		Believing in the almost ineradicable nature of race traits , the writers do not make sufficient allowance for the gradual modifica - tion of race traits with the alteration of environment .

		Moreover , the faithful and courageous personalities revealed though in a sad minority in every one of the terrible and repulsive situations described constitute the saving remnant which is destined to give a higher tone to Chinese history in the not too distant future .

		Chips from a psychologist 's workshop .

		A lenient judge of Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's `` Psychology and Social Sanity '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- would comment upon the volume as an inter - esting collection of studies in a psychological vein , reflecting the views of a fertile mind .

		The attraction of the titles displays a versa - tility not unsuggestive of the caterer 's art .

		These consist of the following : `` Sex Edu - cation , '' a defense of the policy of silent discretion as against noisy discussion and dramatic exposure ; `` Socialism , '' an arraign - ment of its insufficiency as a solution , versus the inner bulwark of reasonable content that makes its proposed remedies needless ; `` The Intellectual Underworld , '' specimens of the `` crank '' correspondence in a psychologist 's mail ; `` Thought Transference , '' showing the weakness of the premises in the case ; `` The Mind of the Juryman , '' a psychological de - fense of the jury system when confined to men ; `` Efficiency on the Farm , '' a plea for a scientific analysis of the processes of rural industry ; `` Social Sins of Advertising , '' a disclosure of the bad influence and bad busi - ness of mingling advertisements with reading matter ; `` The Mind of the Investor , '' am attempt to set forth why Americans specu - late ; `` Society and the Dance , '' explaining the dangers and the benefits of dancing , ac - cording to how it is carried on ; '' Naive Psy - chology , '' as reflected in the popular wisdom of literature .

		A critical view of the volume by the Professor of Psychology in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	would deplore not the popularisa - tion , but the journalistic condescensions of the presentations dominated by the approving presence of the magazine reader .

		The critic conversant with the evidences of the author 's scholarly abilities in other volumes would re - gret the more than occasional lapses from good taste and modest restraint .

		He might be tempted to draw a lesson , which is not drawn , from the ingenuous reversal of the prophecy that Socialism would not gain head - way in
America	LOCATION	-LRB- as set forth in a former volume -RRB- to the present prophecy that it will , both conclusions being psychologically sup - ported .

		He might be particularly offended at the far from ingenuous implications as to the author 's relations to the Faladino dis - closures .

		Returning to the lenient mood , he would deplore rather than censure the yield - ing to temptation that besets exponents of popular themes , who assume professorially the white man 's reforming burden .

		The criti - cal layman might well conclude by question - ing whether the psychology that confers the authority of speech on so wide and various an array of subjects , thickly saturated with practical difficulties , is in reality a science or a papal perquisite .

		In the author 's book on `` The Americans '' he set forth with de - ductive lucidity what would be wrong with Americans , and how these wrongs would be righted , if only Americans happened to be Germans .

		The present volume is open to the interpretation that the course of social sanity
1914	DATE	-RSB- 427 lies in avoiding the dictates of a psycholo - gist 's disaff ections .

		A straightforward story , unem - bellished by exaggerated tales of hardships or danger or spec - tacular exploits of any sort , is that which Dr.
Hudson Stuck	PERSON	, archdeacon of the Yukon , tells in his volume entitled ' ' The Ascent of
Denali	ORGANIZATION	' ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , in which he recounts the well - laid plans for the conquest of the peak , the daily incidents of the toilsome ascent , and the very fortunate weather that favored the party on the day when the summit was finally con - quered .

		From the base camp at tirnberline on the inner flank of the range , established
April 10	DATE	, the explorer and his two hardened Alas - kan aids toiled until
June 7	DATE	through the snow and across crevassed glaciers and up an earth - quake-shattered ridge of ice to the summit , whose altitude was computed from barometric determinations to be 20,700 feet .

		The moun - tain .

		is not one presenting technical moun - taineering difficulties , except those created by the shattered ice-ridge presumably created by a recent earthquake .

		Its difficulties lie in its remoteness , its size , and its wide expanses of snow and ice .

		Its problems are those of transportation of supplies .

		The writer esti - mates the actual linear distance from the foot of the glacier to the summit as twenty miles ; yet his party , in order to have adequate sup - plies for the weathering out of persistent storms such as actually did hold up their progress , were compelled thrice to retrace their steps and to climb 60,000 feet , in bring - ing the requisite food supplies and shelter to the uppermost camp from which the final sally to the summit was made .

		Possibly some persons may regret that the author has seen fit to replace the name of President
McKinley	PERSON	with the not unpleasing Indian name
Denali	ORGANIZATION	, `` the Great One , '' as a designation for the mountain .

		But the latter at least has Alas - kan priority , and might fittingly remain to show that there once dwelt in the land a sim - ple and hardy race who braved successfully the rigors of its climate and flourished , until the septic contact of a superior race put cor - ruption into their blood .

		It is perhaps ` need - less to say that the author found no evidence to corroborate Dr.
Cook	PERSON	's claims to having ascended the mountain , but rather evidence that his description of the summit is wholly inapplicable .

		The relation , * ?

		`` Architecture and the Al - of architecture lied Arts '' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Professor
Alfred M. Brooks	PERSON	has repeated anew in popular form the current dicta on the art of
Europe	LOCATION	in the middle ages and in classic times .

		The need for such a repetition is not obvious ; discussions of art in its relations with historic environment have been the commonplace of criticism since the middle of the
last century	DATE	.

		To do the greatest service , a new treatment should have taken into account more recent critical move - ments tending to modify certain over-hasty conclusions of the founders of evolutionary - aesthetics .

		At least it should have embodied the latest acceptations in the realm of archae - ological fact .

		One is disappointed , then , to find again the well-worn generalizations on the importance of art to the historian and of history to the artist ; and to encounter , in too many cases , the discredited conceptions of yesterday .

		The old popular idea of Greek curvatures and inclinations still persists .

		They are thought intended `` to overcome the illu - sion which makes tall posts appear to spread , parallel-sided posts appear to hollow-in , and vertical posts seem to lean , '' although it has recently been pointed out that this explana - tion is devoid of every vestige of psychological or artistic authority .

		Even in elementary matters of fact there are disquieting slips , as when the sack of
Rome	LOCATION	is placed in 476 , or the plan of the temple of Apollo at Selinus is given for that of the
Parthenon	LOCATION	.

		Merit in the presentation of traditional views was per - haps all that was attempted , but the literary value is hardly so superlative as to justify the lack of other positive qualities .

		Clear and readable the book usually is .

		The illustra - tions are well selected , the photographs of de - tail and sculpture being especially beautiful .

		The frequency of quotation will be welcomed by some .

		If this is all an American book buyer demands , however , Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	is to be reproached for not showing himself supe - rior to his public .

		In view of the equal em - phasis of the sub-title on `` Greek , Roman , Byzantine , Romanesque , and Gothic '' arts , and the very independent treatment given to
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, one is surprised to learn that the purpose of the book is to serve those interested in history and art of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		One would have expected , then , a more summary and a more dynamic treatment of earlier periods .

		Less elaborate circumscrip - tions of the subject , subdivisions , and defini - tions would also fit the book better for general use .

		It is the same indecision of purpose , the failure to remain within the genre tranche , that is to be lamented in so much present-day writ - ing on the fine arts .

		If we must resign our - selves to popular treatment , by all means let it be divorced from sententiousness and labored convolution .

		Yet we may be permitted to hope that not every professor will content 428 THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 16	DATE	himself with disclaiming the idea of contribut - ing to the history of art .

		The life of an imperial misfit .

		The anonymous memoir of the
Empress Frederick	PERSON	, wife of the unfortunate young German Em - peror whose reign lasted only three months , now published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the first biography of
Kaiser Wilhelm	ORGANIZATION	's mother which has appeared .

		Although it is a frank justification of the much-maligned English princess who was never understood by her German subjects , and is consequently a spirited arraignment of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, the old Emperor , and the others who thwarted her , it bears the marks of sincerity and accuracy from beginning to end .

		The author admits that the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	's difficulties were due in a large degree to her own inability to read the character of others ; but he qualifies this very inability as a merit , since he traces it to the fact that , being herself absolutely candid and invariably generous , she could never be brought to see that the great majority of the men and women she had dealings with were neither candid nor generous .

		The story is a deeply pathetic one .

		The warm-hearted and somewhat strong-minded daughter of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	and Prince
Albert	PERSON	is betrothed to the young nephew of the
King of Prussia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The alliance pleases neither English nor Prussians , even before either country knows the char - acter which the young couple will develop .

		The ardent young Princess , with the spirit of a missionary , sets about converting savage
Prussia	LOCATION	to constitutional government and En - glish gardens .

		Prussia fails to appreciate her own benighted condition , and resents patron - age from a country which she disliked fifty years ago almost as much as she does to-day .

		Moreover , this versatile blue-stocking was not content with woman 's sphere , as Prussians men and women alike delimited it .

		So the devoted efforts of the Princess to be useful to her adopted country , her charities , her hos - pitals , her generous devotion to the wounded in the Austrian and French wars , her unmis - takable evidences of real love for
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, went for very little because she never grew shrewd enough to conceal the fact that she reckoned the country of her birth a country to imitate and envy .

		So it came about that she lived and died unappreciated , and when she died , a Church of
England	LOCATION	clergy - man came and read the Anglican service over her body !

		An interesting supplement to the present biography is a pedigree showing the family connections of the Emperor and Em - press
Frederick	PERSON	, and their common descent from
King James I. of England	LOCATION	.

		One of the most fascinating problems in Elizabethan dra - matic literature consists in the determination of the share each author had in the plays that go under the joint author - ship of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	.

		Internal and external evidence , dates and verse tests , diction and other stylistic qualities have been scrutinized in order to lead to a solution of this problem .

		The most thorough-going con - tribution so far made is Professor
Charles Mills	PERSON	Gay ley 's ``
Beaumont	LOCATION	, the Dramatist '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This work seeks not only to distinguish the personality of
Beaumont	LOCATION	from that of
Fletcher	PERSON	as shown in his plays , but also to bring together a body of biographical facts which will show his relation to the time and the stage and his more especial asso - ciates .

		Thus , the first part of the book is taken up with ``
Beaumont	LOCATION	's life , his acquaint - ance , and his career as poet and dramatist , '' and the second part with `` The collaboration of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	. ''

		The criteria applied to the three test plays , `` Philaster , '' `` A King and No King , '' and '' The Maid 's Tragedy , ' ' which are indisputably the product of the joint authorship , are primarily versifi - cation , `` then successively and cumulatively ... diction and mental habit . ' '

		These criteria are applied to the admitted works of each man , and then to those in dispute , so as to determine which is
Beaumont	LOCATION	's and which
Fletcher 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The result is that , as Professor
Gayley	PERSON	says , the judgment of Swinburne passed in
1875	DATE	may be accepted pretty fully to-day , that `` in those tragic poems of which the dominant note is the note of
Beaumont	LOCATION	's genius a subtler chord of thought is sounded , a deeper key of emotion is touched , than ever was struck by
Fletcher	PERSON	, ' ' and that '' if a dis - tinction must be made between the Dioscuri of English poetry , we must admit that Beau - mont was the twin of heavenlier birth . ' '

		Pro- fessor
Gayley	LOCATION	, it may be noted , refuses to accept the opinion that the last romantic comedies of Shakespeare were influenced by the romantic plays of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	.

		Shakespeare is his own predecessor in that the qualities regarded as distinctive of the later plays are already present in his earlier comedies , though to a less extent .

		Mr.

Edward Russell	PERSON	, the chronicler of these varied journalistic experiences , was reared in an at - mosphere redolent of printer 's ink ; but when he left his native West and for weary , dis - heartening months tried to get a foothold in
New York	LOCATION	as a cub reporter , he found that there were more things in metropolitan jour - nalism than he had dreamt of in his philos - ophy .

		His ultimate winning of success and rise to high position in his calling brought him into contact with many strange varieties of human nature and disclosed to him many astonishing things in the world about him .

		Incidents too incredible even for fiction came again and again to his notice , and from this fund of unusual experience he draws for the entertainment of his readers .

		His chapters deal with such topics as `` Old Days with the Tramp Printers , '' `` The Man out of Work '' -LRB- vividly autobiographical -RRB- , `` The
Haymarket	LOCATION	and Afterward , '' `` Why
Harrison	PERSON	was Nomi - nated in
1888	DATE	, '' `` The Rocky Road to
Johns	PERSON	- town , '' `` Travels with the Cholera Fleet , '' and `` The Art of Reporting . ''

		But with all his harking back to the ' ' good old times , ' ' Mr.
Raissell	PERSON	believes that still better times are ahead , and with them better newspapers .

		Almost too good to be true is his vision of this coming newspaper .

		`` Out of this condi - tion , '' he prophesies in his closing paragraph , `` will come in time the ideal newspaper , which can be produced only as a communal enter - prise ; which will be published for informa - tion and not for profit ; which will not attempt to combine the two desirable but properly distinct functions of telling us how goes the progress of the world and where to get hams . ' '

		May he live to see that glad day !

		Few of the rest of us can hope for such lon - gevity .

		Mr.
Edward Legge	PERSON	, the En - d g lish Journalist whose `` King Edward in His True Colors '' appeared a year or so ago , has been encour - aged by the success of that book to go over the same ground again , in a volume entitled `` More about King Edward '' -LRB- Small ,
May	DATE	- nard
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's cautious and impartial biography of the late King in the `` Dictionary of National Biography '' comes in for quite as liberal a share of abuse as was inflicted upon it in the earlier book ; and the author is as insistent as ever that
Edward	PERSON	was the ablest public character of his time and substantially free from faults .

		A writer who questions the value of the painstaking and accurate Dictionary , and suggests that contemporary newspaper utterances pro- vided always that they are complimentary to the King are more to be depended upon , is scarcely to be taken seriously .

		But with all its serious faults of style and manner , Mr.
Legge	PERSON	's book is decidedly interesting .

		There are two chapters on the
King	PERSON	's personal at - tributes ; one on the theft of the
Dublin	LOCATION	Crown Jewels , which the writer mysteriously characterizes as a very significant event , but about which he tells us very little ; a chapter which maintains that the monarchy , brought to a critical condition by the aloofness of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, was saved by the skill of her son and successor , the shrewdest of all dip - lomats ; one a marvellous example of the noble craft of making bricks without straw on the ' ' official ' ' biography of the
King	LOCATION	, which has not yet appeared , and perhaps never will appear , and about which it is clear that Mr.
Legge	PERSON	knows exactly as much as the rest of us ; one on the
King	PERSON	's appreciation of poetry , which tells us quite as little as the preceding chapter , for the excellent reason that there is nothing to tell ; a history of the
King	PERSON	's ill - ness ; a long and really delightful chapter of anecdotes , of the complimentary sort , con - cerning His Majesty ; and a final chapter which deals with various members of his fam - ily , particularly with that beautiful character , Queen
Alexandra	PERSON	.

		The volume is handsomely illustrated , largely with reproductions of photographs which have not appeared else - where ; but typographical errors are more fre - quent than they should be .

		What this `` se - cret book '' is , and how the narrator almost had the unspeakable pleasure of handling it , is told in the first chapter ; how a friend of his actually got possession of it -LRB- a unique copy -RRB- in
Paris	LOCATION	, and brought it home to sell for a fabulous sum to the richest book-col - lector in the world , is briefly indicated , with due accompaniment of mystery , in the clos - ing chapter .

		Between these two , which suffice to justify the book 's title , are a half - score of other chapters that take the form chiefly of papers read by different members of `` the Club . ''

		to the to attempt to say anything new about the devotion of `` Vernon Lee '' to the Spirit of Places , or about her dainty personal treatment of the themes sug - gested by her wayfaring .

		Her latest volume , after opening with an allegorizing eponymous chapter , `` The Tower of the Mirrors , '' wan - ders in amiable haphazard fashion from `` French Roads '' and `` Chablis '' to `` Winter Days at
Ravenna	LOCATION	'' and `` Divinities of Tuscan Summer Fields '' ; and the entertainment it offers is almost as uneven as it is varied .

		While some of the essays are so slight that one is compelled to question the advisability of including them , others are most delightful , and all of them manifest the characteristic touch of our essayist , who combines an insa - tiable thirst for travel with a keen apprecia - tion of countless little human-hearted things and an intimate knowledge of the art and literature of
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		Among the most enjoyable chapters to the present re - viewer are ' ' The Gooseberry Garden of
Jena	PERSON	, ' ' `` The Victor of Xanten , '' and ``
Castiglione	PERSON	d'Olona . ''

		But it would be idle to expect our readers to agree with this selection , or any other .

		The great charm of ``
Vernon Lee	PERSON	's '' essays will be found in their individ - uality ; and individuality , one notes with joy , must naturally make most diverse appeals .

		-LRB- Lane . -RRB- '

		The same scholarly wit that Diaries that , _ _ _ _ .

		* _ .

		, might have made Mr.
Maurice Barings	PERSON	`` Dead Dialogues '' and `` Di - minutive Dramas '' a delight to the discerning , animates also the third number of the same series , `` Lost Diaries '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which comprises twenty selections from journals that might have been written by as many celebri - ties , historical and fictitious , had these illus - trious persons only been more alive to their opportunities .

		Among these potential dia - rists are
King Cophetua	ORGANIZATION	,
Froissart	LOCATION	, Wash - ington ,
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, Mrs.
James Lee	PERSON	's husband ,
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	,
Harriet Shelley	PERSON	,
William	PERSON	the Conqueror , Mrs.
John Milton	PERSON	,
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	, and Hamlet .

		Here is young
George Washington	PERSON	's account of a cer - tain famous incident with which his name is associated .

		The date is
October 13 , 1744	DATE	.

		`` A pretty little episode happened at home to-day .

		The gardener 's boy asked me if he might try his new axe on the old cherry-tree , which I have often vainly urged mother to cut down .

		I said , ` By all means . '

		It appears that he misunderstood me and cut down the tree .

		My mother was about to send him away , but I went straight to her and said I would take the entire responsibility for the loss of the tree on myself , as I had always openly advo - cated its removal and that the gardener 's boy was well aware of my views on the sub - ject .

		My mother was so much touched at my straightforwardness that she gave me some candy , a refreshment to which I am still par - tial . ' '

		Again we are reminded of the lamenta - ble inaccuracy of history and tradition .

		Like its predecessors , this book is made up of mat - ter that has stood the test of periodical or newspaper publication .

		Not himself a naturalist , but none the less a lover of na ture , Mr.
C. DuFay Robertson	PERSON	tells us in `` Down the Year '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- some of the interesting thoughts and fruitful suggestions that come to him in his contem - plation of the periodic changes that pass over the face of the outside world with the progress of the seasons .

		The approach of
spring	DATE	, the country in
summer	DATE	, the tranquil delights of a parsonage back yard , the coming of dawn across the fields , the beauty of gently falling snow , the mystery of winter twilight these and other like themes receive fitting treatment in either prose or verse at Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's hands .

		Keenly appreciative of color effects in nature , he writes thus of the
summer	DATE	land - scape as seen through rain : `` I have just learned where the old tapestry weavers got their delightful , soft , filmy colors .

		There is nothing more beautiful in all art than old tapestries , with their mysterious , veiled , rem - iniscent neutral tints and colors , brilliant yet subdued .

		I have long wondered where the old artists got their ideas for such color schemes , and have speculated much upon the question .

		I know now , for I have been in the country when it rains . ''

		A rich harvest of the quiet eye is stored in Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's book , to which the camera has contributed a half-dozen beautiful views of rural scenes if one of them , showing a portion of the starry heavens , can be called rural .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 431 BEIEFEE MENTION .

		`` A
Stevenson Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
J. Herbert Slater	PERSON	, is the first volume of a forthcoming series which promises to be decidedly useful to collectors of books , as well as to librarians and booksellers .

		Instead of the old chronological arrangement , the titles are entered in alphabetical order .

		Each entry is followed by a bibliographical note , giving full information about the size , the publishers , the dif - ferent editions that have been issued , and the pres - ent auction prices .

		A valuable little introduction to the
Swedenbor	PERSON	- gian religion has just been issued by Messrs. Lip - pincott , under the title , '' The Path of Life . ''

		It is a compilation from the writings of
Swedenborg	PERSON	, and represents much careful and loving research , mostly on the part of the late
John Curtis Ager	PERSON	.

		As the title indicates , emphasis is placed in the selection upon the practical conduct of life , and so the volume should prove fruitful even to those who are unable to make contact with
Swedenborg	PERSON	's metaphysics .

		A study of ''
Cavour	PERSON	and the Making of
Modern Italy	LOCATION	, 1810-1861 , '' by
Pietro Orsi	PERSON	, forms the latest volume in the '' Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		As its title indicates , the book is not essentially a biography , but rather a history of the period of
Cavour	LOCATION	.

		Though '' the father of modern
Italy	LOCATION	'' is the central figure of the work , his real character and personality are emphasized little , if any , more than in the corresponding sections of general histories .

		In other words , we have here the skeleton of the history of
Italy	LOCATION	in
Cavour	LOCATION	's time , the externals of
Cavour	ORGANIZATION	's deeds ;
Cavour	PERSON	himself is lacking .

		But , as we have said , the volume does not pretend to be a biography , and it does well what it sets out to do .

		The most famous bell in
America	LOCATION	tells , briefly and simply , with a proper blending of chronology and sentiment , of history and patriotism , the story of its origin and the record of its distinguished ser - vice , in a little book entitled `` A Silent Peal from the Liberty Bell '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , written by Miss
Ada	ORGANIZATION	- line
May Conway	DATE	.

		Five illustrations show the bell itself , the old
State House	ORGANIZATION	where it once hung and where it is now preserved , the Declaration Cham - ber in that building , and portraits of
John Nixon	PERSON	and
John Marshall	PERSON	.

		In closing its somewhat pa - thetic tale , the cracked old bell pleads to be left in peace and not sent on any more journeys across the country for exhibition purposes .

		It was a happy thought that gave rise to this attractive little book , which is designed especially for young readers .

		In adding the principal works of
William Morris	PERSON	to their '' Pocket Library , '' Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	are performing a service for which book-lovers gener - ally will be heartily grateful .

		Fourteen volumes have recently appeared , comprising '' Poems by the Way '' and ''
Jason	PERSON	, '' `` A Dream of
John Ball	PERSON	, '' and seven of the prose romances , '' The Well at the World 's End , '' `` The Water of the Wondrous Isles , '' '' The Roots of the Mountains , '' and '' The Sundering Flood , '' in two volumes each ; and '' The Story of the Glittering Plain , '' '' The Wood beyond the World , '' and `` The House of the Wolfings , '' each in a single volume .

		The books are faultlessly printed , of convenient size , and inexpensive in price . ''

		News from Nowhere '' and
Mackail 's Life of Morris	ORGANIZATION	were published in the same series a year or so ago .

		Street 's '' Gothic Architecture in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' which has held its own for nearly half a century as the best work on the subject , is now republished by Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	in two conveniently-sized and low - priced volumes , under the editorship of
Georgiana Goddard King	ORGANIZATION	.

		The revisions and additions are not extensive , as the editor remarks , '' Street was very thorough , and
Spain	LOCATION	is very slow '' ; a few necessary notes on the `` primitives , '' discovered since Street wrote , are included , and the material is brought up to date in other respects .

		It was wisely decided to retain the author 's own sketches , cut on wood for the original edition , rather than to introduce photographic substitutes .

		These beauti - ful drawings are , indeed , an integral part of the book .

		In its new form , Street 's work belongs with
Baedeker	PERSON	in the equipment of every art-loving tour - ist in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The translation of Mr.
Max Rooses	PERSON	's admirable little handbook on `` Art in Flanders '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- gives one more proof of the cosmopolitanism of interest in art that is growing to be one of the strong ties binding European races together .

		This particular volume belongs to a series written by well-known critics and published simultaneously , in five languages , in
New York	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
Stutt	LOCATION	- gart ,
Bergamo	LOCATION	, and
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		Each volume is illus - trated by hundreds of cuts , small but very clear , illustrating the architecture , painting , and sculp - ture of the country dealt with .

		Mr.
Rooses	PERSON	makes in addition a special effort to present the minia - tures and manuscript paintings of early Flemish art , thereby greatly enriching the history and clari - fying the evolution of his subject .

		For an under - standing of the racial conventions that are worked out before the great individualities of art can ap - pear , this small book furnishes excellent material .

		Wise counsel to the young , especially to young students of the male sex , is offered in short , per - suasive , often unusually readable and richly sug - gestive form , in a book edited by Mr.
Homer H. Cooper	PERSON	, superintendent of
Spiceland Academy	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- delightfully alluring name -RRB- and a man who evi - dently knows the needs and temptations peculiar to adolescence .

		Eighty-seven bits of practical wis - dom from nearly as many educators , thinkers , preachers , authors , reformers , and statesmen , are collected under the title , '' Right Living : Messages to Youth from Men Who Have Achieved '' -LRB- Mc - Clurg -RRB- , and the greater number of these short arti - cles were prepared primarily for the
Spiceland	LOCATION	students .

		Among the passages dealing more espe - cially with literature , one notes with approval Rev.
Jenkin Lloyd Jones	PERSON	's commendation of Xenophon 's '' Memorabilia '' as a better book for the beginner in Greek than the same author 's `` Anabasis , '' a mili - tary history unfruitful of good to the young reader except as a dreary drill in grammar and syntax .

		Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	closes his book with some true words on '' Practical Day Dreams . ''

		FROM NEBULA to NEBULA or The Dynamics of the
Heavens Every	ORGANIZATION	new approximation to a fundamental truth involves a multitude of readjustments .

		When , there - fore , we introduce -LRB- as this work does -RRB- into the theory of Astronomy so far-reaching a factor as the Prime Resultant -LRB- that is , the reciprocal attraction between the Solar System , as a gravitational unit , on the one hand , and the rest of the universe on the other -RRB- , and identify this power as the vera causa of the rotatory motions of the planets and satellites , it behooves us to reexamine our previous reasonings with a view to detecting and correcting latent errors .

		As one result of such a review , the author finds that Science has been altogether too precipitate in discarding the funda - mental law of equilibrium , namely , that bodies seek their lowest center of gravity .

		Reaffirming this law , then , and applying it , in combination with the prin - ciple of the Prime Resultant , to celestial phenomena , the writer is enabled to explain dynamically and cor - relate , with very little effort , such difficult and diverse matters as : the fixation of the
Earth	LOCATION	's axis ; the geographical distribution of her continents ; crustal flexures ; tectonic earthquakes ; terrestrial magnetism ; the
Moon	PERSON	's rotation , librations , and secular accelera - tion ; the behavior of comets ' tails , and , most impor - tant of all , the diurnal rotation of the
Earth	LOCATION	.

		442 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	A BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE OPEN COURT PUBLISHING COMPANY If one asked for a brief description of the work of the
Open Court Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	, one would probably get the answer that the
Company	ORGANIZATION	publishes books and articles on Science , Religion and Philosophy .

		That is not quite exact ; for that describes the ideal to which the
Open Court Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	is con - tinually striving rather than the actual work it is doing .

		The ideal is Religion on a firm basis of Science , a
Science of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, and a Philosophy of Science : the only path which can lead to this great ideal synthesis is the detailed and careful study of sciences , religions and philosophies .

		It is this ideal that prompted the late Mr.
Edward Carl Hegeler	PERSON	, of La Salle ,
Illinois	LOCATION	, to found a com - pany to publish books with the object of establishing ethics and religion upon a scientific basis .

		Such ideals are as old as philosophy itself .

		Among modern philosophies , that founded by Comte tries , probably in the most explicit fashion of all , to found a religion on the basis of positive science ; and at one time it appeared likely to have a lasting success .

		But it is now quite plain that no philosophy which hopes to be permanent can neglect history or put itself into uncritical opposition to the systems that have for centuries expressed some of the dearest and highest aspirations of mankind .

		It is unprejudiced and fearless his - torical and critical investigation non-sectarian in the widest sense in both religion , science and phi - losophy , that must go before any satisfactory synthesis .

		This is a great part of the work of the
Open Court Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	.

JUNE	DATE	Discovering Our Parents By
Burr Chapman Cook	PERSON	Starting out with a charming plea for the crumbling walls of the palace of childhood , Mr.
Cook	PERSON	develops a deeper significance in this paper ; for he has heard the cry of the children `` growing up , darkened , massed , danger - ous , '' into the American future , and he asks us to care tenderly for all our children .

		A Watcher by the Dead By
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	This powerful story is the fourth of a series that will run through twelve consecutive numbers of NEALE ' s MAGAZINE .

		By many
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	is thought to be the greatest writer of short stories .

		His `` Collected Works , '' complete in twelve volumes , were recently published by the Neale house .

		Thought and Its Expansion By
Lily Young Cohen	PERSON	This paper the fourth of a series of twelve critical literary studies that
Miss Cohen	PERSON	has written for NEALE 'S is noteworthy for the reason that in it is drawn the line that separates plagiarism from the development of thought expression .

		Like the published papers of this series `` Apostles of the Commonplace , '' `` Lords of the Realm of Fiction '' and `` The Function of the Critic '' this article is highly important as a contribution to
America	LOCATION	's scant literature of criticism .

		The Tomb of the Beautiful Spirit By
J. Stanford Edwards Tense	ORGANIZATION	, dramatic , engrossing , this short story which is no tepid tale bears the imprint of rich originality and is worthy a place among the great short stories of American literature .

		Our Hireling Presidents By
Walter Neale	PERSON	, the Editor `` Mediocrity , incompetence , servility , inefficiency , cowardice , absence of self-reliance , lack of initiative , inability to succeed alone in any walk of life , dependence on others for a livelihood '' - these , says Mr.

		474 A GREAT DANE .

		The present visit of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	to the
United States	LOCATION	, although it is covering only a fortnight , is an event of the utmost impor - tance in our cultural annals .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	is one of the half-dozen most famous men of let - ters now alive and incomparably the greatest of living Scandinavians .

		`` We doubt if this country has ever entertained a more distin - guished representative of European letters .

		We have had of recent years , it is true , visits from
M. Bergson	PERSON	and
Lord Morley	PERSON	, we had about ten years ago the great Danish poet
Drachmann	PERSON	, and thirty years ago the great Norwegian poet
Bjornson	PERSON	, and the visits of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Dickens	PERSON	are marked by red letters in our calendar .

		The appearance of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	is at least as mem - orable as any of these , and will long be remem - bered by those who have come into contact with his vital and powerful personality .

		It has fulfilled a hope that we had cherished for many years , and almost abandoned as the flight of time brought him within measurable distance of the brink of years from which mor - tality takes its final plunge .

		We trust that the welcome accorded our guest has made him realize more fully than he could have realized it from a transatlantic dis - tance the strength of his hold upon all Ameri - cans who are interested in the greater problems of art and life , and who have found their way into the main stream of the world 's mod - ern thought .

		No one has helped them more '' Im ganzen , guten , schonen Resolut zu leben , '' and their debt of gratitude is correspondingly great .

		For many years , a few of us have been reading him in his own tongue and many more of us in German translation , while dur - ing the last decade his major works have been reproduced in the English language .

		They have been to us a revelation of cosmopolitan thought , interpreted in the spirit of the broad - est freedom , and handled with deep penetra - tion and philosophical insight .

		Many are the minds that have found enfranchisement in his pages and learned from him that literary criticism , in a master 's hand , may become com - 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	prehensive enough to cover the whole - of life .

		Of what may be called creative criticism , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	is the best example of our time .

		He has the power which bestows upon this form of writing the qualities which make it worthy to be classed with the literary categories of belles-lettres , with fiction , the drama , and poetry .

		His work has made good this claim for literary criticism , in the sense in which it has been made good before him by
Lessing	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, by Sainte-Beuve and
Taine	PERSON	and Bru - netiere , by
Coleridge	PERSON	and ``
Walter Pater	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		What is needed to raise criticism from the status of a narrow discussion of technical aesthetic principles to the creative plane is a method which brings it into intimate relations with life .

		Such a method was boldly outlined by Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	in the second volume of his ' ' Hovedstromninger , '' published in the early seventies : '' First and foremost , I endeavor everywhere to bring literature back to life .

		You already have observed that while the older controversies in our literature for example , that between
Heiberg	PERSON	and
Hauch	PERSON	, and even the famous controversy be - tween
Baggesen	PERSON	and Oehlenschlager have been maintained in an exclusively literary domain and have become disputes about literary principles alone , the controversy aroused by my lectures not merely by reason of the misapprehension of the opposition , but quite as much by reason of the very nature of my writing , has come to touch upon a swarm of religious , social , and moral problems .

		- .

		.

		It follows from my conception of the relation of literature to life that the history of literature I teach is not a history of literature for the drawing - room .

		I seize hold of actual life with all the strength I may , and show how the feelings that find their expression in literature spring up in the human heart .

		Now the human heart is no stagnant pool or idyllic woodland lake .

		It is an ocean with submarine vegetation and frightful inhabitants .

		The literary history and the poetry of the drawing - room see in the life of man a salon , a decorated ball-room , the men and the furnishings polished alike , in which no dark corners escape illumination .

		Let him who will look at matters from this point of view ; but it is no affair of mine . ''

		To this method the author has remained true all his life , and this is what makes of his work one of the impressive monuments of modern thought .

		A living literature , he says , ' ' brings problems up for debate , '' and '' for a litera - ture to bring nothing up for debate is the same thing as to lose all its significance . ' '

		Thus our author has found the literature of modern times to be bristling with debatable problems , and he has stood in the arena for nearly half a century engaged in the struggle over these problems , and always championing the cause of justice and individual freedom , and the emancipation of the soul from all the degrading fetters of hide-bound prejudice and inveterate superstition .

		He has been a fighter for ideas all his life , a true
Ritter vom Geist	PERSON	, a doughty warrior for the cause upon which
Heine	ORGANIZATION	based his chief claim to the world 's re - gard .

		Engaged in this conflict primarily for his fellow-countrymen , who seemed to him to be living in the eddies and backwaters of thought , he sought to drag them by pure force of reason out into the main current , and han - dled them so roughly in his efforts for their salvation that they would have none of their rescuer , and turned upon him , and drove him from among them .

		Whereupon he went forth , lived in foreign lands for a term of years , and returned to his fellow-countrymen a world - figure , with weapons freshly forged and tem - pered , and forced them to give him heed .

		Meanwhile , his eloquence had evoked responses in all the cultured nations of the earth , and he was fast becoming the commanding figure which he is to-day in the intellectual world .

		What are the qualities that have made
Georg Brandes	PERSON	thus preeminent ?

		One of them is the wide range of his knowledge , which has al - lowed nothing deeply significant in modern life to escape his attention .

		Another is the possession of a clear-cut and incisive style which makes the full weight of conviction tell in his thrust .

		The title of this article might be flippantly taken to suggest what has been called '' the big bow-wow style , '' than which no comparison could be more absurdly inept .

		A third quality is a burning passion for intel - lectual freedom and social justice , coupled with an unfaltering belief in the power of truth eventually to prevail over error , .

		As long ago as
1872	DATE	, he said to the critics who were fero - ciously attacking him in the Danish press : '' I am treated as if the ideas which inspire me and which I express , were my own inventions .

		They are the ideas of all intelligent
Europe	LOCATION	.

		If a man is guilty for maintaining them , then the guilt is not mine , but that of European scientific thought .

		Or rather , if the men of the younger generation are guilty , when they cherish these convictions , the real guilt lies upon the men of the older generation .

		Why did you not bring us up better ?

		If these ideas can be confuted , why did you not refute them for us ?

		If it were possible to equip the present generation for a victorious battle against free thought , why did you not thus equip us ?

		You did not do it , because you could not do it , because thesa ideas are not to be confuted . ''

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 449 A fourth quality , which is perhaps little more than an amplified statement of the second one mentioned , is the possession of that incom - municable gift of genius to give interest to any subject under discussion , to present even familiar matters from such unexpected points of view and with such exquisite turns of phrase as to make them seem fresh and new .

		This is the gift that makes us feel that even the most hackneyed themes , in his handling , will acquire a vital significance hitherto un - realized , that we may go , for example , to a lec - ture upon Shakespeare or
Napoleon	PERSON	, with the assurance that we will bring from it something that we did not take to it , however familiar we were with the subject .

		This power of giving interest and charm to simple and commonplace matters is what makes the autobiography of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	a work ' comparable with `` Dich - tung und Wahrheit . ' '

		The better part of the work of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	is now to be had in English translation .

		We have the monumental `` Main Currents in the Literature of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' in six volumes , the ``
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' in which a Dane has done for the creator of ' ' Hamlet ' ' what a Frenchman did for the his - tory of our literature , the
Beaconsfield	LOCATION	, the
Lassalle	LOCATION	, the
Bjornson	PERSON	, the
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, the fascinat - ing study of
Poland	LOCATION	, the `` Recollections of Childhood and Youth , '' already referred to , and the essays upon the `` Moderne Gjennem - brudsmasnd ' ' the men of the modern ' ' break - ing through . ''

		It is to be hoped that the pres - ent visit , now so nearly ended , of their dis - tinguished author may send thousands of new readers to these works , which are among the most significant and influential that our age has produced .

		And it will be the hope of all of his friends that his ripened wisdom may continue to be poured out for many years to come , for our helpful guidance and spiritual refreshment , and for the furthering of the great cause of intellectual freedom .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE SHAME OF THE BOOK TARIFF , an imposi - tion endured by only two of the great powers of the world , our own country and
Russia	LOCATION	, was .

		mercilessly exposed by Mr.
Edwin H. Ander	PERSON	- son in his presidential address before the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at AVashington last week .

		Of course it is an old story , but it is likely to be considerably older before the disgrace is wiped out and we are able to hold up our heads and claim a place among the nations enlightened enough not to lay a pen - alty on the acquisition of knowledge .

		Fifty per cent higher now than before the Civil War , the present duty on imported English books fails ridiculously to yield any considerable revenue or to foster home industry in the manufacture of books .

		Our annual publishing statistics show a production of only six per cent of the total book-publication of the world .

		In proportion to population ,
Switzerland	LOCATION	is - sues each year ten times as many books as we ; the Scandinavian countries six times as many ;
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	, Hol - land ,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	, each from three and one-half to five times as many ; Rou - mania more than three times as many ; and
Russia	LOCATION	, even with its arbitrarily censored press , manages to put on the market a yearly book-product amounting to more than one and one-half times our own in proportion to population , as already indicated .

		With
Spain	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	-LRB- grouped together -RRB- somewhat ahead of us , we seem-to hold .

		the humiliating position of tail-enders in this procession .

		As to annual revenue accruing from '' the tax on ideas '' -LRB- to quote the heading of Mr.
Ander	PERSON	- son 's paper -RRB- , our treasury is enriched to the extent of about half a
million dollars	MONEY	by those who each year pay for the privilege of helping to keep this country among the best educated , the most enlightened , of the nations .

		If , then , as a tariff for revenue , the book-tax yields only a negligible return compared with our total revenue , and if as a protective tariff it fails to protect , or , at most , furnishes ignoble shelter to an unworthy few , why suffer it to remain on the statute-book ?

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	says , `` We put a tax on the enlightenment of all the peo - ple to serve the selfish interests of the few . ''

		But even these few , or those of them whose utterance on the subject commands a respect - ful hearing , announce their entire willingness , as one of their number , Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, has repeatedly declared , that the book-duty should be removed .

		Our copyright laws furnish such protection to both author and publisher as to render a tariff on books as needless as it is stupid .

		It is well to have , in Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's address , a formal and em - phatic statement of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	's position on this question a position all the more significant because , pro- fessionally , the librarian is unaffected by the tariff ... THE JOYS OF THE LITERARY ARTIST , more particularly the newspaper artist , are splen - didly painted by Mr.
Charles Edward Russell	PERSON	in the closing chapter of `` These Shifting Scenes , '' an admirable piece of journalistic 450 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	autobiography recently noticed in these pages .

		After a quarter-century of newspaper expe - rience he feels himself justified in declaring that `` the best job on earth is that of the city editor of a
New York	LOCATION	daily .

		Other employ - ments are but rubbish in comparison . ''

		For , observe , `` the city editor is an artist .

		As a painter before his easel , so sits every day the city editor before the paper he is to make .

		Here in his hand he holds all the colors of all the news of the day ; upon his schedule as upon canvas he lays them to suit the taste before mentioned -LSB- that is , the
New York	LOCATION	reader 's taste -RSB- .

		He can lay on the crimes and give to his paper a red hue ; he can develop the humorous side of a day 's life in the city ; he can seize `` a story in low tones from the heart of the lost-and - found advertisements ; he can work out every contrast of scarlet and purple , for every variety of tint is supplied by the events before him .

		He has but to choose , to combine , and to study the results .

		And all the time he can derive from his weav - ings the satisfaction that pertains only to the exercise of art , which is now and always a means to transfer a feeling .

		Provided , to be sure , he is blessed with reporters that in their turn have the instinct of artistic craftsmen ; for when reporting is true and free from the taint of advertising and the business office and allowed to deal according to its princi - ples , it is an admirable art . ''

		Editor-in-chief and managing editor and editorial writer are poor creatures compared with the city editor , thinks Mr.
Russell	PERSON	.

		`` The editorial writer emits great thoughts for the exclusive perusal of the proof-reader , ' ' he tells us .

		The obvious weakness in the city editor 's position as above pictured , the drop of bitterness in his goblet of nectar , is the confessed necessity he is under `` to suit the taste before mentioned , '' to please the sensation-loving throng `` that the newspaper must please if it is to succeed , ' ' as Mr.
Russell	PERSON	views the matter .

		Preferable , by far , is the part played by him who , as we are told but are not bound to believe , ' ' emits great thoughts for the exclusive perusal of the proof-reader . ' '

		PAINLESS PRELIMINARIES TO THE ENJOYMENT OF A FOREIGN LITERATURE are surely a desid - eratum in the educational world , though their possibility may be doubted by those who hold , rightly enough , that there is no royal road to learning .

		Some recent paragraphs in these columns on the subject of Latin will perhaps have prepared the reader to receive without too great protest the remarks of a veteran teacher of that language on the right way to initiate a pupil in its mysteries .

		Writing anonymously to a prominent journal , he says , in part : `` One speaks first of the ` beginners ' because teachers of Latin so often declare the first-year work to be the most critical .

		The most difficult it is necessarily ; the most bene - ficial and the most loved it is if so made by the teacher .

		But commonly this first-year work on which so much depends is horribly mismanaged .

		Year after year , one may go into these classes and see the same old meth - ods work too hard for the pupils , too little understood , and stupid , dry , tiresome beyond expression .

		Any boy or girl of spirit is justi - fied in getting out of it , as a very large num - ber 01 them do , in the course of the first half-year many before
the end of the first month	DATE	.

		Break away from these methods , one longs to urge upon every beginners ' Latin teacher -LRB- only exceptionally capable teachers should be in charge of this class , of course -RRB- ; whatever you do , do n't start another class with the first lesson in a book , by making the pupils learn paradigms , whole ones stupid things with a lot of new English words so captivating as ` paradigm , ' ` inflection , ' ` de - clension , ' ` genitive , ' ` dative , ' ` accusative , ' ` ablative , ' etc. ... Use no book for at least a month preferably two possibly six months .

		This is , of course , perfectly prac - ticable with a class of reasonable size , as is done to some extent in
America	LOCATION	, to great ex - tent in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Then can class-work be made suitable , appealing , inspiring , the class interested , eager , confident or gladly , persis - tently plucky , able to work hard out of class without help or lamentations ... This is simply to say that the study must be alive enough for very live boys and girls a na - tional pursuit , spirited , full of sense ; at pres - ent , the study is commonly irrationally dull , quite too dead for
Young America	ORGANIZATION	.

		May teachers and pupils soon very generally enjoy first-year Latin find it the favorite class - work , such as it certainly can be made . ''

		FIRST AID TO THE INQUIRING READER is freely and expertly rendered by most librarians , though some insist that the visitor should reach the end of his own resources in cata - logue and reference-book consultation before soliciting professional assistance .

		Probably a judicious mixture of self-help and expert aid is wisest as a general rule .

		In sharp con - trast to the
Lethbridge	LOCATION	plan -LRB- described in our last issue -RRB- of mechanizing the public library by bringing it into gear with the post-office machinery , thus eliminating much waste , in - cluding that of time taken up in personal intercourse between librarian and patron , an `` ex-librarian '' has something to say , in the
May	DATE	`` Public Libraries , '' in favor of extend - ing that personal side of library work which
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 451 the
Lethbridge	LOCATION	scheme would abolish .

		We quote a few sentences : `` With no reflection upon any library in particular , it is the expe - rience of many readers that the atmosphere among the assistants of the average free library is of a forbidding type .

		Many library helpers seem to be so afraid that they will give an inquirer one word too many in extending information .

		Perhaps the writer erred in the other direction ; but in her expe - rience in library work she was never so happy as at the time when an earnest reader made inquiries , and an opportunity presented itself to gather together all the literature upon a specified subject which might be found in indirect ways hidden chapters of books with irrelevant titles , etc. .

		Certain experiences in library work in one of the largest libraries in this country , together with two seasons of lecture-recital programmes , have brought to vision the possibility of broadening the influ - ence of the free library as an educational centre in all branches . ''

		Of course there is liability of imposition upon a too complaisant librarian : he may find that he is expected to write club papers , prepare outlines for de - bates , decipher difficult manuscripts , trans - late whole books from the lesser-known foreign tongues , and in other similar ways occupy his supposedly abundant leisure ; but the compe - tent and tactful librarian will know how to decline an unreasonable request and at the same time maintain his reputation for urban - ity and omniscience .

		A THOUGHT FOR THE COMMENCEMENT SEA - SON , now upon us , is offered in the following extract from `` They Who Knock at Our Gates , '' which receives more particular notice on another page . ' '

		Next after liberty , ' ' writes the author , in considering the quality of our alien element , ' ' the Puritans loved education ; and to-day , if you examine the registers of the schools and colleges they founded , you will find the names of recent immigrants thickly sprinkled from A to Z , and topping the honor ranks nine times out of ten .

		All readers of newspapers know the bare facts , each commencement season the prize-winners are announced in a string of unpronounceable foreign names ; and every school-teacher in the immigrant section of the larger cities has a collection of picturesque anecdotes to con - tribute : of heroic sacrifices for the sake of a little reading and writing ; of young girls stitching away their youth to keep a brother in college ; of whole families cheerfully starv - ing together to save one gifted child from the factory .

		Go from the public school to the public library , from the library to the social settlement , and you will carry away the same story in a hundred different forms .

		The good people behind the desks in these public places are fond of repeating that they can hardly keep up with the intellectual demands of their immigrant neighbors .

		In the experience of the librarians it is the veriest commonplace that the classics have the greatest circulation in the immigrant quarters of the city ; and the most touching proof of reverence for learning often comes from the illiterate among the aliens .

		On the
East Side of New York	LOCATION	, ` Teacher ' is a being adored .

		Said a bedraggled Jewish mother to her little boy who had affronted his teacher , ` Do n't you know that teachers is holy ? '

		Perhaps these are the things the teachers have in mind when they speak with a tremor of the immense reward of work in the public schools . ''

		CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED is the pros - pect avowedly confronting the misguided `` reformers '' of our spelling .

		A communica - tion sent out by the secretary of the -
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	to all its members notes the action of that body in adopting , two years ago , `` the rules and rec - ommendations of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	... as the norm of spelling in the official publications and correspondence of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' and now invites an individual expression of opinion on the whole question of joining the simplifiers , whole-heartedly , half-heartedly , or not at all .

		It is known that at least a strong minority still preserves its sanity on this subject .

		Among other observa - tions of the secretary , our attention is arrested by the following : `` The official spelling does not call itself reformd ; it is at most in process of reformation , or of simplification ; and , as ` simplified , ' it is not at a stage that anybody regards as final . ' '

		Too true ; and will it ever reach that stage , or will not rather the tin - kering process , once begun , be considered per - missible on the part of anybody and everybody to the end of time ?

		Will the genie so reck - lessly released from the bottle ever be got back into it again ?

		A questionnaire appended to the circular letter contains three interro - gations as to the degree in which the receiver of the letter favors the new forms of spelling , with two blank columns for replies , headed , `` Anser , '' and , immediately beneath , `` Yes , '' ' ' No . ' '

		A cross in the proper place is all that is required .

		Honest Dogberry was inconsola - ble because he had not been writ down an ass .

		The Modern Language Associate of anserine predilections will have only himself to blame if he is not now writ down an anser .

		TRIUMPHS OF STAGE REALISM meet with a popular acclaim absurdly disproportionate to 452
June 1	DATE	their real artistic worth .

		What did the Greeks of Sophocles 's time care for the paltry details of realism ?

		How much did realism have to do with the success of ^ Eschylus 's Oresteian trilogy ?

		How meagre was the setting of an Elizabethan drama !

		Shakespeare 's art knew nothing of realism .

		But to-day the play-goer demands that nothing shall be left to the imagination ; he delights in such products of stage-carpentry as Mr.
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	de - scribes in the current ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		Concerning one very popular play he writes : `` For weeks , the author , the producer , and several assistants -LRB- I am now quoting press authority -RRB- had been searching the city for the exact model of a hall bedroom in a theatrical boarding-house such as the playwrights had in mind .

		They found what they were looking for .

		When the curtain rose on the opening night , the public , duly kept informed as to the progress of the quest , naturally rose with enthusiasm to the perfect picture of a mean chamber in a squalid boarding-house .

		The scene was appalling in its detail of tawdry poverty .

		Except for the fact that the bed - room was about sixty feet long , forty feet wide , and fifty feet high , the effect of destitu - tion was startling . ' '

		And all the time no one disputes that the highest art achieves its re - sults with the severest economy of means .

		THE MOST WIDELY TRANSLATED BOOK IN THE WORLD is , of course , the Bible .

		This fact is impressed upon us anew by the statement of the secretary of the
New York Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	, at its recent quarterly meeting , that the scrip - tures are now being distributed in fifty-three languages in the city and harbor of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Nearly a thousand vessels at that port have been visited in the
last three months	DATE	by a missionary of the Society for purposes of Bible-distribution , a work that is also exten - sively carried on at
Ellis Island	LOCATION	, where every immigrant is sure to find at his disposal at least one book in his own language amid the Babel of tongues that there assails his ears .

		Among other items of interest in the secre - tary 's report , we note that nearly a thousand copies of the Bible were lately placed in the hands of those connected with the circus .

		Whether half a thousand will be read by the devotees of the sawdust ring may be doubtful .

		A like query arises in connection with the several hundred copies bestowed upon the per - formers in the Wild West show .

		An ex - amination of the figures showing the many editions and the wide circulation of Shake - speare and the Bible , and a comparison of that circulation with the acquaintance that the people seem to have with
Shakespeare	PERSON	and the
Bible	ORGANIZATION	, might induce a belief that in order to be really read and appreciated an author should appear in only strictly limited editions .

		CULTIVATION OF THE INQUIRING MIND is evi - dently not neglected in
Atlanta	LOCATION	, as may be inferred from a significant paragraph in that city 's current library Report .

		A single sen - tence will make this sufficiently evident . ' '

		Dur - ing the year , '' writes the librarian , `` 17,284 -LRB- nearly 5,000 more than in
1912	DATE	-RRB- sought here information on subjects varying from cor - poration tax laws ,
Dingley	PERSON	tariff , telephotog - raphy , German Hussar uniform , Easter hare , picture suitable for soft drink poster , laundry machinery , social work of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, modern novelists , tension on the strings of a piano , Polish costume , census reports , Yazoo fraud , wireless stations of the world , pictures of Lookout Mountain for the local theatre , pic - tures for the mural decoration of the
Ansley Hotel	ORGANIZATION	, statistics of the production of tin , to the
Potsdam Giants	ORGANIZATION	, blue sky laws , and the address of many people of note . ''

		All these inquiries , made by frequenters of the refer - ence room ranging ' ' from the Governor of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, who has been a frequent visitor , to mechanics , seeking latest developments in electric elevators , '' were , we doubt not , promptly and intelligently answered .

		A STORY OP BOOK-RESCUE WORK on the part of an alert and faithful janitor contributes an element of novel interest to the `` Thirteenth Annual Report of the
Brumback Library of Van	ORGANIZATION	W ^ ert County . ''

		Van Wert County is in
Ohio	LOCATION	, as nearly everyone knows , and it was the
Ohio	LOCATION	flood of
1913	DATE	that imperilled the government documents and other less-used books stored in the basement of the aforemen - tioned library .

		First those on the floor and lowest shelves were moved so that no volume was within a foot of the floor .

		But the water rose , inch by inch , compelling a further rais - ing of the literary level , until high-water mark was reached at twenty-three inches , with all books safely above that limit : and then , after remaining stationary for some anxious hours , the ebb began and the flood subsided , doing no further damage than the warping of the basement cupboard doors , the extinguish - ing of the furnace fire , and the suspension of the library 's usefulness for a day .

		The jani - tor himself writes the account of the occur - rence in the library report , and it is safe to conclude that he is worthy of the position he holds in the library world .

		HOW ONE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IS STRENGTH - ENED is explained in a recent news item from
New York	LOCATION	, where a branch of the great public library of that city has just been established THE DIAL 453 at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, in a room of the Low Library Building , for the benefit of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	professors and students .

		A first instalment of books , three thousand in number , is placed in the care of an experienced library assistant , and additions to this supply will be made as needed .

		By the inter-branch loan system a total of about thirty thousand books is at the command of those using this branch , an auto - mobile delivery system facilitating the trans - mission of any desired volume from its place of deposit to the branch where the request is made .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The letter of
Lewin Hill	PERSON	, in your issue of
May 1	DATE	, will hardly be accepted as a complete refutation of the objections raised against the adherence by Nor - way to a language unintelligible to the rest of the world .

		The unwholesomeness of the hermit life , for an individual or for a nation , is no longer u matter of doubt , in these days of enlarged interna - tional interests .

		Narrowmindedness and a mere blind devotion to the forms and ideas of the past do not make for the nobler kind of race building .

		On the other hand , the argument for the pre - servation of the lesser languages and even dialects as permanent and ever living forms of expression is entirely unanswerable .

		Every race , to whom the call has not come too late , does well to resist the tendency toward linguistic amalgamation with any other people , however closely related by blood or by political connection .

		The many reasons for this are too familiar to require enumeration .

		Here , then , is an apparent dilemma , for which there is but one possible solution , which will stand the acid test .

		To save the small languages from destruction , on account of the need of mutual com - prehension , between the few who cherish them and the immense number who use the few dominant tongues , a simple and easily acquired means of international communication must be provided as supplementary to the mother language .

		There are numberless other valid grounds for the develop - ment and use of an international auxiliary lan - guage ; but I venture to rank its service to the weaker peoples and the saving of the lesser lan - guages as among the strongest .

		It is fortunate that such an instrument already exists , and that it has been proved by all conceiv - able tests , over a long period of years , to be fully capable of meeting all the requirements .


Esper	PERSON	- anto long since passed from the domain of theory to that of actual and habitual use for international purposes of every character , by a large number of persons in all parts of the earth .

		It is almost incredibly easy to learn , and is flexible and expres - sive to a degree which staggers the belief of those not familiar with it .

		Those who have fairly tested its advantages find it a help with which they would not dream of dispensing .

		The people of
Norway	LOCATION	will in no way be cut off from the world by the exclusive use of the Norwegian tongue for domestic purposes , if they are wise enough to supplement it by the general adoption of Esperanto for interna - tional relations .

		TOWARD A BROADER TO-MORROW .

		* Now whoso loveth the peace of established order and hath set his heart upon things as they are to-day , must never be lured into the restless , forward-sweeping pages of Mr.
H. G.	PERSON	`` Wells .

		He is so mercilessly disturbing , this un-English Englishman .

		He assails without pity and questions without ruth .

		Perhaps because he loves his own countrymen best -LRB- although I fear his love is not very generally reciprocated -RRB- he goads and flays them most persistently , declaring them to be formal , stupid , ill-read , unscientific , unenterprising , unthinking , unimaginative , and un-every - thing-else requisite for real progress .

		Nat - urally , the institutions of such an impossible nation must be belated and benighted to correspond to the stupidity and blindness of its citizens .

		However , we in
America	LOCATION	can not complain of neglect ; for we come second in his conscientious flagellation and presumably , therefore , also in his affection .

		In his latest novel he generously concludes that ' ' the
United States of America	LOCATION	remains the greatest country in the world and the living hope of mankind ' ' ; but it is in spite of ' ' coarseness and blundering and rawness and vehemence and a scum of blatant , oh !

		quite asinine folly . ''

		Yet , with all his relentless assailing of what is wrong in the world , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is constantly constructive in spirit : so far from being merely a Genius of Storm , he holds that Faith can and should create what Love desires .

		And in this belief he is willing to have his most serious arguments refuted , his brightest Utopias demolished , if haply in the useful clashing of mind stuff there may emerge some vital spark of truth to light us on the upward way .

		A prolific writer , animated by such a spirit , must naturally make many mistakes .

		But even when we convict him of incon - sistency , we remember that such is the in - evitable penalty of growth ; and when we are confident his predictions are wrong , we often feel a tiny ghost of doubt within our hearts , or an unvoiced choking prayer that he may be right .

		Along with the countless would-be prophets among the present generation of authors one may find a few genuine seers , and to this distinguished group Mr.
Wells	PERSON	as - suredly belongs , although his relative place therein can only be decided by that imme - morial tribunal to which we reluctantly re - * SOCIAL FORCES IN ENGLAND AND

		Wells .


New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
H. G.	PERSON	linquish so many judgments , even the stern , impartial years .

		For the present , however , I think we may safely rank him with the most delightfully vigorous and helpfully prescient .

		In Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's new volume are twenty - eight papers of varying length and merit .

		They represent gleanings from the last five years , and range from '' The Coming of Bleriot '' to '' The Contemporary Novel . ''

		Now if Mr.
Wells	PERSON	were asked to give the chem - ical formula for the reaction of sulphuric acid on zinc , I am perfectly sure he would include in his correct answer at least two paragraphs on the unsatisfactory conditions of human life at present and the possible betterment thereof in the future .

		Accordingly , with this unde - tachable tendency of our author and the avowedly social or economic subjects of many of the chapters , we are prepared for a volume treating scores of vital topics in the spirit suggested by our first two paragraphs .

		Obviously , then , it would be better not to attempt to notice each of the papers , but to set forth our author 's present general attitude and then take up a few particular points .

		As to the former we may first quote a force - fully worded passage from '' The Passionate Friends , '' a novel that must have been in Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's mind concurrently with the matter presented in many of these essays .

		It will be recalled that
Stephen Stratton	PERSON	, an English - man , and
Gidding	PERSON	, an American , both '' want to do something decent with life , '' and that the former records for his son their profession of faith : `` And it is not only a great peace about the earth that this idea of a
World State	ORGANIZATION	means for us , but social justice also .

		We are both convinced altogether that there survives no reason for lives of toil , for hardship , poverty , famine , infectious disease , for the continuing cruelties of wild beasts and the greater multitude of crimes , but mismanagement and waste , and that mismanage - ment and waste
spring	DATE	from no other source than ignorance and from stupid divisions and jealousies , base patriotisms , fanaticisms , prejudices and sus - picions that are all no more than ignorance a little mingled with viciousness .

		We have looked closely into this servitude of modern labor , we have seen its injustice fester towards syndicalism and revolutionary socialism , and we know these things for the mere aimless , ignorant resentments they are ; punishments , not remedies .

		We have looked into the portentous threat of modern war , and it is ignorant vanity and ignorant suspicion , the bargaining aggression of the British pros - perous and the swaggering vulgarity of the Ger - man junker that make and sustain that monstrous European devotion to arms .

		And we are con - vinced there is nothing in these evils and conflicts that light may not dispel .

		We believe that these things can be dispelled , that the great universals ,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 455 Science which has limitations neither of race nor class , Art which speaks to its own in every rank and nation , Philosophy and Literature which broaden sympathy and banish prejudice , can flood and submerge and will yet flow over and submerge every one of these separations between man and man . ''

		Of course it is as impossible to find the real Mr. `` Wells in any one page as it is to depict him in any one review ; but I think the foregoing is perhaps the most enlightening single excerpt that could be made for our purpose .

		To it I would add the following considerations from two of these papers , '' The Great State '' and '' The Human Adventure . ''

		In the former , the great central belief is that ' ' a state may solve its economic problem without any section whatever of the people being condemned to life-long labor . ''

		This is based on the tenets that '' the absolutely un - avoidable labor in a modern community in its ratio to the available vitality must be of very small account indeed , '' and that '' there exists a real disposition to work in human beings . ''

		For the small irreducible residue of undesirable toil , our radical falls back on a suggestion of the late Professor
William James	PERSON	, and inasmuch as this seems to me about the most important point in the whole book , I again quote verbatim : '' He -LSB- Professor
James	PERSON	-RSB- was profoundly con - vinced of the high educational and disciplinary value of universal compulsory military service , and of the need of something more than a senti - mental ideal of duty in public life .

		He would have had the whole population taught in the schools and prepared for this year -LRB- or whatever period it had to be -RRB- of patient and heroic labour , the men for the mines , the fisheries , the sanitary services , railway routine , the women for hospital , and perhaps educational work , and so forth .

		He believed such a service would permeate the whole state with a sense of civic obligation . ''

		As to the few creatures actually unwilling to work , a type almost inconceivable to our energetic reformer , he takes the bull by the horns with perfect composure and firmness , and declares they may remain idle , subsisting on their presumptive rights as shareholders in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Touching the much stressed dan - ger of the disappearance of individual free - dom , he insists that all men , women , and children must be given every opportunity , even every inducement , to work out their finest potentialities .

		On the question of the family , always the most delicate problem in any communistic or socialistic scheme , and perhaps the most difficult , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is ob - served to hedge in a manner that suggests many mental reservations .

		He ventures the innocuous suggestion that '' a new type of family , a mutual alliance in the place of sub - jugation , is perhaps the most startling of all the conceptions which confront us directly we turn ourselves definitely towards the
Great State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But his positive proposals are des - perately irresolute ; and one begins to draw a picture of a respectable paterfamilias who has been given furiously to think by the colossal stature of the little things of everyday life .

		On two points , however , he is perfectly clear .

		One is that the cruel and pitiless sex-jealousy that thwarts so many thousands of lives to - day must be replaced by something higher .

		The other is that motherhood should be pub - licly endowed .

		Then he goes on to insist that wealth must be watched , land the legislator no less .

		Books must be made common as air , a proposal developed at greater length in `` The Passion - ate Friends '' ; and criticism upon all con - temporary institutions and processes must have the utmost liberty .

		Education must be made a vital , pulsating force .

		`` Whatever increases thought and knowledge moves towards our goal . ''

		Clearly it is with this generalizing Mr.
Wells	PERSON	that we are primarily concerned ; but it is a pleasure to note that many of the more specifically directed papers also offer a val - uable and enjoyable pabulum .

		Thus , `` The Common Sense of Warfare '' fights with both slashing sabre and piercing foil for a sane view of world peace .

		Again , in `` The Philos - opher 's Public Library , '' he delicately en - forces the truth that the essentials of a library are books , not bricks .

		In `` The Disease of Parliaments '' he presents a telling and care - fully elaborated plea for an intelligent system of elections , based on the single transferable vote .

		And so our commendations might run on through various titles .

		On the other hand , the reader will note many evidences of fallibility in our author .

		I suppose one man can only be one man , so we must not rage when even Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is inaccurate about his facts , half-hearted in his conclusions , or misguided in his criticisms .

		We must even be patient when his venerable prophetic mantle opens to reveal , for the mo - ment at least , a mere ephemeral journalist .

		Yet it is provoking to read such a feeble piece of hackwork as '' The Possible Collapse of Civilization '' when one is cherishing the memory of that striking passage in '' The Passionate Friends '' where
Stratton	PERSON	is con - sidering the same question .

		Again , the paper on '' Doctors '' and that on '' Divorce '' are undeniably weak , the former being superficial and the latter inconclusive .

		For the author 's insistence on education we must be grateful ; THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	but he really progresses no farther than a thousand other interested and intelligent ob - servers who see in a general way what is amiss but can not prescribes practical remedy .

		Herewith I have left myself no space for differences about details ; but I can not help wondering how the greatest believer in the modern annihilation of space can think that the mere geographical location of our national capital must inevitably prove a serious ob - stacle to progressive government .

		Nor can I accept the placidly recorded verdict that many of our State Universities are no ' ' more than mints for bogus degrees . ' '

		I am bitterly aware of weaknesses in our
State Univer	LOCATION	- sities ; but they do not deserve this particular condemnation , with its horrible connotations .

		Again , the declaration that `` America cher - ishes the rights of property above any other rights whatever '' is well worth weighing ; but our Civil War would seem to suggest that we have been capable of other ideals .

		How - ever , I may cheerfully leave his readers to do their own quarrelling with Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		It is half the fun of reading him .

		In '' The
New Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, '' which Mr.
Walter Lippmann	PERSON	calls the spiritual biog - raphy of a searching mind , we read the fol - lowing account of the progress from being a reformer of concrete abuses to being a revo - lutionist in method : '' You see , I began in my teens by wanting to plan and build cities and harbors for mankind ; I ended in the middle thirties by desiring only to serve and increase a general process of thought , a process fearless , critical , real-spirited , that would in its own time give cities , harbors , air , happiness , everything at a scale and quality and in a light altogether beyond the match-striking imaginations of a contemporary mind . ''

		On the whole , it is this more advanced Mr.
Wells	PERSON	that is represented in the new col - lection of essays , as well as in his later novels .

		Indeed , such a development is the normal thing in all reformers and prophets who are not carried away by the inner force of some persistently brooded special idea ; and gen - erally speaking it is to be desired .

		With it , however , comes the danger that the broaden - ing seer may see so broadly as to lose his perspective on modest specific reforms .

		It is so easy to think for Man and forget men .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	may speak lightly in disparagement of what he considers the misdirected efforts of the Fabians ; but the work of Mr. and Mrs.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	deserves unstinted praise , and may live to be blessed by posterity when some of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's most resplendent vaticinations are either forgotten or cherished only as a quaint source of quiet amusement .

		I do not mean that we can tarry where Fabianism seems to be resting .

		or where anything else seems to be resting , for that matter ; I only mean that something is gained when we merci - fully allay a particular hunger or justly smite a particular wrong .

		It is well to peer eagerly down the widening vista of the future ; it is ill to miss the evils before one 's feet .

		However , it would be unfair to impute to Mr.
Wells	PERSON	any remissness of practical attitude , and I have introduced my plea only because I believe so thoroughly in the union of a self-sacrificing effort to meet the specific evils of to-day with a keen-eyed vision that is set upon a better and brighter to-morrow .

		In conclusion , I would say that this book deserves a wide circle of thoughtful readers .

		But even as I write , there arises the irritating reflection that where it is needed most it will be read least .

		The binding is simple and the type legible .

		There are very few slips in the four hundred and fifteen pages of text ; and I suppose `` jerrymander '' is a deliberate English spell - ing , but it spoils a delightfully picturesque American word .

		The `` Synopsis , '' which was evidently prepared for the original title , `` An Englishman Looks at the World , '' makes a crude misfit in its present connection .

		And , to end with a complaint that is really a com - pliment , I am sure many readers will share my regret that the volume has no index .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 457 with an able chapter on
Dryden	PERSON	, not by Pro- fessor .

		Saintsbury -LRB- as one might have pre - dicted -RRB- , but by the Master of Peterhouse him - self .

		Needless to say , the treatment of
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	by this celebrated historian of dramatic litera - ture is competent and readable ; though he has permitted himself many long sentences with parenthetical qualifications , and has a trick of using French words , such as venue , revue , revanche , and remaniement , when there is no adequate ground for not writing English .

		Morigeration , too , on p. 39 , would seem to be an unnecessary freak of style .

		And for `` less rigidly adhering to ... rules , '' may an American suggest '' less rigorously , '' etc. , as better usage ?

		As for substance , it is unde - sirable to speak of `` the conclusions reached '' in `` An Essay of Dramatick Poesie , '' where , according to
Dryden	PERSON	, all he has said '' is problematical '' that is , tentative , and in keeping with the nature of a dialogue .

		Since the chapter , all things considered , though sound and true , is not inspired , one might supplement the good things in it with the following little-known but vigorous criticism of
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	by
Wordsworth	PERSON	, who writes to
Scott	PERSON	concerning the latter 's great edition : '' I was much pleased to hear of your engage - ment with
Dryden	PERSON	; not that he is , as a poet , any great favorite of mine .

		I admire his talents and genius highly , but his is not a poetical genius .

		The only qualities I can find in
Dryden	PERSON	that are essentially poetical are a certain ardor and im - petuosity of mind , with an excellent ear .

		It may seem strange that I do not add to this , great com - mand of language ; that he certainly has , and of such language , too , as it is most desirable that a poet should possess , or , rather , that he should not be without .

		But it is not language that is , in the highest sense of the word , poetical , being neither of the imagination nor of the passions I mean of the amiable , the ennobling , or intense passions .

		I do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in
Dryden	LOCATION	, but as little , I think , as is possible , considering how much he has written .

		You will easily understand my meaning when I refer to his versification of '
Palamon	LOCATION	and Arcite , ' as con - trasted with the language of Chaucer .


Dryden	PERSON	has neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity .

		Whenever his language is poeti - cally impassioned , it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects , such as the follies , vices , and crimes of classes of men or of individuals .

		That his can not be the language of imagination must have neces - sarily followed from this , that there is not a single image from
Nature	ORGANIZATION	in the whole body of his works ; and in his translation of
Virgil	LOCATION	, whenever
Virgil	PERSON	can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object ,
Dryden	PERSON	always soils the passage . ''

		In the same volume , Professor
Schelling	PERSON	con - tributes one chapter out of three on the drama of the Restoration , paying due attention to French influences .

		Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	writes well on
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	,
Farquhar	PERSON	, and
Gibber	PERSON	, and later on the ' ' Court Poets . ' '

		Mr.
J. Bass Mullinger	PERSON	does not write so well on `` Platonists and Latitudinarians . ' '

		The trouble is not so much with what the erudite gentleman says as with his way of saying it .

		Here , for example , is a passage that almost defies interpretation .

		After a long quotation from
Whichcote	LOCATION	, we read : `` The drift of the above passage is unmistakable .

		Tuckney believed that Whichcote , when at Em - manuel , had come under the influence of certain students and admirers of Plato , not that he had influenced them ; had he done so , indeed , it is difficult to understand how the fact could have failed to attract the notice of his former tutor , and the latter have omitted to make any reference to the same in the above controversy . ''

		This actually means : At
Emmanuel Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , so Tuckney believed , Whichcote had been influenced by certain enthusiastic stu - dents of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, not they by him .

		Indeed , had the influence come from
Whichcote	LOCATION	, how could it have escaped the notice of his tutor there , and what would keep the tutor from men - tioning it in the subsequent controversy ?

		Substance and form considered , the best chapter in the volume is the last , on '' The Essay and the Beginning of Modern English Prose , '' by Mr.
A. A. Tilley	PERSON	.

		This writer is fond of expressions like '' a lucid survey , '' a '' straightforward and simple style , '' '' the clearness and readableness of diplomatic dis - patches , '' and '' a writer of clear and agree - able prose ' ' ; and similar terms are applicable to the chapter and its writer .

		Volume IX .

		we must pass over rapidly .

		It - opens with an interesting account of Defoe by Professor Trent , containing various refer - ences , naturally , to ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	. ''

		There is , however , no exhaustive treatment of this masterpiece in itself , and but passing allusion to the literature of travel and dis - covery to which it is heavily indebted .

		Some - thing was said on this topic in THE DIAL for
October 1 , 1907	DATE	; but the whole subject still awaits a patient investigation .

		Light is needed also on the relations existing between ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' and subsequent narra - tives like '' Gulliver 's Travels '' and the fas - cinating ''
Peter Wilkins	PERSON	'' of
Robert Pal	PERSON	- tock ; and between all of these and the sources they may have in common .

		If the indexing is complete , the only reference to Paltock in the present three volumes of the
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	is in one of the bibliographies -LRB- Vol .

		X. , p. 478 -RRB- .

		No censure of Professor
Trent	PERSON	is implied in the foregoing remarks ; a sep - arate chapter for the discussion of the in - fluence of geography upon literature in the 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1 England	DATE	of the eighteenth century would have fitted well enough into the scheme of the gen - eral editors .

		Still another desideratum would be the separate treatment of the character - sketch and its influence throughout the cen - tury ; an influence which was exerted not least upon the literary periodicals , their very titles betray it : '' The Tatler , '' '' The Idler , '' '' The Rambler , '' '' The Spectator , '' and so on .

		-LRB- The subject has been dealt with by Professor
Edward Chauncey Baldwin	PERSON	in the '' Publications of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	'' for 1903-4 . -RRB-

		In this volume we have twenty-eight pages on
Defoe	PERSON	, forty-three on
Steele	PERSON	and
Addison	PERSON	, twenty-seven on Pope , and forty - four on Swift , no unfair division of space , as it seems ; in English scholarship generally Swift has not of late received the attention he deserves .

		The chapter on Swift here is very matter-of-fact , especially at the beginning .

		One could wish for as many pages , had they come from Dr.
Elrington Ball	PERSON	.

		What we have from Mr.
Aitkin	PERSON	makes better reading toward the close , partly because of the quotations from his author .

		In Chapter XIII .

		-LRB- '' Scholars and Antiquaries '' -RRB- the first section , on the '' Scholars , '' was not in - trusted to Professor
Sandys	PERSON	, who could have written in masterly fashion on
Bentley	LOCATION	; for the section on the `` Antiquaries , '' by Mr.
H. G. Aldis	PERSON	, no substitute could be desired .

		In the last chapter , XV. , on the history of education from the Restoration through the reign of
George the Third	ORGANIZATION	, there is an allusion to '' the anonymous Latin book ' Nova Solyma ' -LRB- 1648 -RRB- . ''

		Mr.
Adamson	PERSON	is safe in not mentioning the attribution of this work to
Milton	LOCATION	.

		As a writer in '' The Library '' -LRB-
July , 1910	DATE	-RRB- has proved almost beyond doubt , the author was a contemporary of Milton at
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Samuel Gott	PERSON	.

		No chapter in this or the next volume deals with the history of literary criticism during the period concerned , something really more needful under the circumstances than a history of education .

		To tell the truth , the development of criticism in the eighteenth century , except for
Addison	PERSON	,
Johnson	PERSON	, and one or two others , is imperfectly known .

		The course of many critical ideas must sometime be traced in the thought of authors who are now well-nigh forgotten .

		With Volume X. we come to a period which in some sense is our own , and to men like
Richardson	PERSON	, Fielding ,
Smollett	PERSON	, and
Sterne	PERSON	, who belong to a literature with which we feel ourselves akin .

		The authors of several chap - ters have not previously distinguished them - selves in treating the subjects now allotted them .

		It might have been better to select Professor Cross to write on
Sterne	PERSON	, and Pro- fessor
John Edwin Wells	PERSON	to write on Fielding .

		Of the many valuable studies in Fielding by
Professor Wells	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Harold	PERSON	Child seems to be quite unaware .

		In Chapter IV .

		Professor
Nettleton	PERSON	has given in advance the main con - clusions of his more recent book entitled '' English Drama of the Restoration and
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
A. Hamilton Thompson	PERSON	writes of ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	and Natural Description in Poetry , '' not uninterestingly , though there is little that is new in his way of looking at things , and something thread - bare in the talk about ' ' nature , ' ' but for the democratic use of '' lower case '' through - out the
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	, the magic word would doubtless be spelled with a great N .

		The chapter is unexpectedly severe in its strictures upon
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's `` Castle of In - dolence . ''

		A melancholy interest attaches to the chapter on Gray , the last contribution of the late
Duncan C. Tovey	PERSON	to the study of a poet he had made peculiarly his own .

		From beginning to end it is vital .

		Unfortunately , the author did not live to correct the proofs , or , it would seem , to compile a bibliography that would match the excellence of the chap - ter .

		The final touches , then , are wanting , though there is no lack of essential finality in the substance .

		A slight omission may be noticed : there is no reference to
Isola	LOCATION	, assist - ant to Gray , and subsequently
Wordsworth	PERSON	's instructor in Italian .

		In Chapter VII .

		the Panurgic Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	discusses after his own fashion `` Young ,
Collins	PERSON	, and Lesser Poets of the Age of Johnson . ''

		His own fashion , as usual , is distinctive enough ; one is forced to borrow a word from the style itself to describe it , that is , `` journalese . ''

		The lesser poets are familiar domain to Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	; but it appears that he is in sympathy with none of them save
Collins	PERSON	.

		That the others are ' ' minor ' ' is assumed in the title ; why , then , reiterate the notion in the text ?

		`` A true critic , '' says
Addison	PERSON	, '' ought to dwell rather upon excellencies than imperfections , to discover the concealed beauties of a writer , and communicate to the world such things as are worth their observation . ''

		Chapter VIII .

		is on
Johnson	PERSON	and
Boswell	PERSON	.

		Is it difficult or easy to write on
Johnson	PERSON	?

		Many have written well besides
Boswell	PERSON	, many ill besides
Macau	LOCATION	- lay .

		On the whole , since the researches of
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	, there is no good reason for mis - understanding either
Johnson	PERSON	or
Boswell	PERSON	.

		Professor
D. Nichol Smith	PERSON	has done superla - tively well with both .

		So , too , has Mr.Austin
Dobson	PERSON	with
Goldsmith	PERSON	.

		Of the more general chapters , one may single out for approbation that of Professor Ker on '' The Literary In - fluence of the Middle Ages '' ; that of Dr.
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 459
Henry B. Wheatley	PERSON	and the Ven .


W. H. Hutton	PERSON	on the '' Letter - writers '' ; and the sec - ond of the two essays on the `` Historians , '' that is , the chapter on
Gibbon	PERSON	by Sir
Adolphus Ward	PERSON	.

		The sketch of
Gibbon	PERSON	's life , in the main , it seems , extracted from his autobiog - raphy , is followed by an illuminating account of his critics , and this by an estimate of his style and personality , thus : ' ' But it is quite obvious to any candid student of ` The Decline and Fall ' that its author had no sympathy with human nature in its exceptional moral devel - opments in a word , that his work was written , not only without enthusiasm , but with a conscious distrust , which his age shared to the full , of enthusiasts . ' '

		Herewith we must close these casual re - marks upon three volumes which it is vir - tually impossible to describe in a general way apart from those that have gone before .

		One thing , however , at least to the present re - viewer , is very evident .

		Though the editors do not ignore the existence of American scholarship in the field of English , and in general have chosen their American collabora - tors with skill , many of the bibliographies appended to the separate chapters show a lamentable want of information concerning special books and articles that have been pro- duced in this country .

		It was to be expected that a careful scholar like Professor
Ker	PERSON	would know such things as
Farley	PERSON	's '' Scan - dinavian Influences in the English Romantic Movement ' ' ; and so he does ; his list of books is admirable .

		But in other cases , as the bibliography of Gray , the omissions pass belief .

		Professor
Cook	PERSON	's Concordance , indis - pensable in the apparatus for a study of the poet , is not mentioned ; nor is Professor
Northup	PERSON	's edition of '' Gray 's Essays and Criticisms , '' in spite of the favorable review in the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' -LRB-
Aug. 24 , 1911	DATE	-RRB- , not to speak of his article on `` Addison and Gray as Travellers '' in the
Hart	PERSON	memorial volume .

		More astonishing yet is the reference to translations and parodies of Gray ; for these , so we read in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	History , '' see
Bradshaw	PERSON	's bibliography , ''
Bradshaw	PERSON	's edition of Gray appeared in
1891	DATE	; Professor
Northup	PERSON	's far more extensive list of adapta - tions appeared in `` Notes and Queries '' just
twenty years later	DATE	.

		Under Biography and Criticism we are referred to an appendix on `` Gray 's Knowledge of Old Norse '' in a vol - ume of selections bearing the date 1894 , and not to
Farley	PERSON	's `` Scandinavian Influences , '' which appeared in
1903	DATE	.


Rolfe	PERSON	's edition of Gray is nowhere included .

		In view of these omissions , which are chance discoveries , it is obvious that the talented author of the chap - ter had very little to do with the bibliog - raphy ; he may have furnished some of the titles , but we owe it to his memory not to hold him responsible for the final form .

		LANE
COOPER	PERSON	.

		Ax ENGLISH STATESMAN 'S REFLECTIONS ON POLITICS AND HISTORY .

		* In a delightful essay , `` On Old Men in Public Life , '' Plutarch remarks that states - manship `` is the career of a civilized being with a gift for citizenship and society , and with a natural disposition to live a life of public influence , worthy aims , and social helpfulness for as long as occasion calls . ''

		Among the few modern instances of those who fit into this high conception of the Greek biographer is Lord
Morley	PERSON	.

		At the age of seventy-six he is still contributing to a long career of public influence and social helpful - ness , and any utterance from him suggests a pause for thoughtful consideration .

		His re - cent volume , ' ' Notes on Politics and History , ' ' the expansion of an address which , as Chan - cellor , he delivered last year before the Uni - versity of
Manchester	LOCATION	, is the application to some public questions of the same admirable temper which his readers are familiar with , for example in `` Compromise '' and the biog - raphies of
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	's ideas in this new book , though some - what detached , are , as we should expect , heightened in their effect of fruitfulness by choice illustrations out of his treasures of knowledge both new and old .

		This essay , invoicing the author 's reflec - tions upon a variety of political subjects , possibly invites a wider appeal by virtue of its possessing an oral style .

		Its value is undoubtedly enhanced by the historic view from which its topics are considered and appraised .

		The writer reminds his reader that the national atmosphere , as well as the machinery of government , undergoes change .

		This does not imply instability , for it is also true that the `` national character is slowest of all things to alter in its roots . ''

		However , believing that respect for law and its admin - istration is the `` keystone of all civilized gov - ernment , '' Lord
Morley	PERSON	notes with some seriousness the `` latter-day antinomianism , '' which he regards as a decline of popular reverence for institutions as such .

		He ob - serves that this attitude toward law affects both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		He concludes that , although loss of confidence in Parliament * NOTES ON POLITICS AND HISTORY .

		A
University Address	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Viscount Morley	PERSON	,
O.M. New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		460 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	would be `` formidable , '' and loss of respect for courts of justice would be `` taking out the linch-pin , '' the popular sense of political obligation has not declined .

		So far as the greatly increased number now sharing the electoral privilege is a test , the feeling of political obligation is stronger than ever , and the sense of social duty `` has vastly grown alike in strength and range . ''

		This extension of privilege and social feel - ing has remote beginnings .

		It does not date , we are reminded , merely from
Rousseau	PERSON	's time , nor yet from that of
Milton	LOCATION	.

		The civilized European of the present day repre - sents a birth two thousand years old .

		The feud between History , or established institu - tions , and the
Law of Nature	ORGANIZATION	and Rights of Man carries us back many centuries .

		Deeper than men 's opinions is the complex of moral feelings and character out of which opinions grow .

		Events , more than books and doctrines , determine the course of human life .

		Is there , then , such a thing as political science ?

		Are the methods and processes of politics com - parable with those of biology ?

		Many readers of Lord
Morley	PERSON	's book will recall at this point the plausible analogy between the life-history of social organisms and the forms of organic life presented in Mr.
Benjamin Kidd	PERSON	's `` Social Evolution . ''

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	finds himself in agreement with the late Professor
Maitland	PERSON	in the belief that , despite the politician 's use of biological terminology , we are far away from the creation of an `` inductive political science . ''

		The atmosphere of what we call such a science is , in its present state , as rarefied as that of economics in the
earlier years of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		It is still very artificial .

		The tests and standards of a real knowledge of history and its actors are relative ; and to interpret matters by political mechanics instead of by the varieties of social impulses behind them is to miss their driving force .

		With the judgment that `` the value of political forms is to be measured by what they do , '' the Pragmatists , at least , will be in hearty accord .

		It is good democratic philos - ophy that holds that political forms `` must express and answer the mind and purposes of
the State	ORGANIZATION	, in their amplest bearings , '' if we mean by `` State '' the people .

		Yet , as the author feels , the Weltanschauung , or world outlook , of men in general is vague .

		In the world-changes that arise men still `` live but in a corner . ''

		In men 's creeds , forms , and habits it is the Weltanschauung that `` fixes vision , moulds judgments , inspires purpose , limits acts , gives its shades , colors , and texture to common language .

		Even for superior natures , narrow are the windows of the mind . ''

		How , then , shall we estimate the conception of History ?

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	speaks luminously of the `` historic method '' : `` Its sway is now universal in the field of social judgment and investigation .

		It warns us that we can not explain or understand , without allowing for origins and the genetical side of the agents and conditions with which we have to deal .

		It substitutes for dogmas ... search for two things .

		The first , the correlation of leading facts and social ideas with one another in a given community at a given time .

		The second , the evolution of order suc - ceeding to order in common beliefs , tastes , customs , diffusion of wealth , laws , and all the arts of life !

		Stripped of formality , this only expands the famil - iar truth that laws and institutions are not made but grow , and what is true of them is true of ideas , language , manners , which are in effect their source and touchstone . ''

		`` Inquiry what the event actually was , vital and indispensable as that of course must be , and what its significance and interpretation , becomes sec - ondary to inquiry how it came about .

		Too exclusive attention to dynamic aspects , weakens the energetic duties of the static .

		More than one school thus deem the predominance of historic - mindedness excessive .

		It means , they truly say in its very essence , veto of the absolute , persistent substitution of the relative ... There is no more conscience in your comparative history than there is in comparative anatomy .

		You arrange ideals in classes and series , but a classified ideal loses its spark and halo .

		Every page abounds in ironies ... talk of ' eternal political truths , ' or ' first prin - ciples of government / has no meaning .

		Stated summarily , is not your history one prolonged ' becoming ' -LRB- fieri , werden -RRB- , an endless sequence of action , reaction , generation , destruction , reno - vation , ' a tale of sound and fury signifying nothing ' ? ''

		Every reflective reader of history has many a time felt the force of the question of his - toric truthfulness .

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	quotes Free - man , whom he regards as the most `` learned and laborious '' historian of our time , as having come to doubt whether there `` was such thing as truth in the world . ''

		Freeman had found that no two people , though eye - witnesses , exactly agreed except when they copied from one another .

		This , he observes , gives some support to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's dictum that ' ' the only form of truth is poetry . ' '

		It would be difficult to find elsewhere an epitome of historians and historic theories at once so instructive and readable as is contained in Lord
Morley	PERSON	's volume .

		One rises from read - ing it with the feeling that history has its own troubles , clear enough .

		One agrees heartily that `` we have no business to seek more from the past than the very past itself '' ; that
Cicero	PERSON	is indisputable when he says , `` Who
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 461 does not know that it is the first law of history not to dare a word that is false ?

		Next not to shrink from a word that is true .

		No par - tiality , no grudge . ''

		But there 's the rub !

		Again , shall the historian , as Treitschke main - tains , find his surest aim by sticking close to the
State	ORGANIZATION	; or , as
Burckhardt	PERSON	has done , and Mr.
Gooch	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	asserts is proper , admit a large sympathy for Kulturgeschichte ?

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	speaks with true vision , no doubt , when he gives to the history of the Church the immense force of political reality , when he insists that `` contemporaries and historians , more often than they suppose , miss a vital point , because they do not know the intuitive instinct that often goes farther in the states - man 's mind than deliberate analysis or argu - ment . ''

		He gives a telling illustration of this in
Bismarck	LOCATION	's own words , and concludes that `` Improvisation has far more to do in politics than historians or other people think . ''

		This view raises afresh the persistent ques - tion whether history does or does not make a clear case for human progress .

		Is progress a spontaneous force or a fixed historic law ?

		Of course , as Lord
Morley	PERSON	says , progress may stand for a hundred different things .

		If by the word we mean `` progress in talents and strength of mind '' the case is doubtful , for many thinkers find these as much , often more , in evidence in ignorant as in cultivated times .

		Among such thinkers is
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, but Mill nevertheless believed in human progress and saw a great advance `` in feelings and opinions . ''

		Mill challenged the contention that mechanical inventions had improved the lot of the workers .

		This recalls
Ruskin	PERSON	's misgivings on the same subject .

		Although the author sees beneficence in the abolition of child labor and the restrictions that guard the labor of men and women , he thinks that , as a `` universal law , for all times , all States , all Societies , Progress is not . ''

		Many of his readers will probably regard his intimation of the ' ' decline of the Latin race in the southern half of the American hemisphere '' as open to serious argument .

		All will assent to the ' ' ma - terial prosperity and mental vigor of the English , Scotch ,
Irish	LOCATION	, and French stocks among their northern neighbors , '' but must think it curious that the list does not include the German .

		, He finds a common ground for both optimists and pessimists in the view that `` progress is no automaton , spontaneous and self-propelling , '' but `` depends on the play of forces within the community and external to it . '' ''

		It depends on the room left by the
State	ORGANIZATION	for the enterprise , energy , and initiative of the indi - vidual ... on the absence from the general mind , at a given time , of the sombre feeling , Quota pars omnium sumus , how small a fraction is a man 's share in the huge universe of unfathomable things !

		It depends on no single element in social being , but on the confluence of many tributaries in a great tidal stream of history ; and those tides , like the ocean itself , ebbing and flowing in obe - dience to the motions of an inconstant moon . ''

		From the summit of his long experience and ripe scholarship ,
Lord Morley	PERSON	speaks nowhere in this book with more effective calm than , in its concluding pages , on the two divergent schools of modern statesmanship .

		Treitschke in the nineteenth century , answer - ing to
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	in the fifteenth , represents one school in his bristling phrase , ' '
The State is Force	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		This is the theory of bureaucracy ; that `` right and wrong depend on ... what is done by other people . ''

		As one of its champions has put it , `` War and brave spirit have done more great things than love of your neighbor . ''

		This political practice , freed from the `` wholesome exigencies '' of debate and compromise , is more depressing for po - litical energies than parliamentary discussion .

		The other school has a great spokesman in
Burke	LOCATION	, whose political wisdom stands high in Lord
Morley	PERSON	's affections .

		In
Burke	PERSON	's view , `` The true lawgiver ... ought to love and respect mankind , and to fear himself . ''

		-LRB- This is thoroughly Wordsworthian also . -RRB- ' '

		Political arrangements , as a work for social ends , are only to be wrought by social means ... Time is required to produce that union of minds which alone can produce all the good we aim at . ''

		In `` Politics and History , ''
Lord Morley	PERSON	has contributed one of those delightfully rare books that no reader can afford to take up in a hurried state of mind .

		It is a small volume , but one that must be given a place among the well-prized acquisitions of the library .


L. E. ROBINSON	PERSON	.

		THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR OF THE TERROR .

		* It was a singular fate that gave the man - agement of the most redoubtable tribunal in history to a broken-down attorney .

		Fouquier -
Tinville	PERSON	was one of those whom the insur - rectionary torrent of
August 10 , 1792	DATE	, rolled up from the deeps of
Paris	LOCATION	life .

		He seems to have owed his first official position to
Camille Desmoulins	PERSON	, the journalist , the friend of
Danton	PERSON	, the chief personage of the new revo - lution and now minister of justice .

		Fouquier * THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR OF THE TERROR : ANTOINE QUENTIN FOUQUIER - TINVILLE .

		Translated from the French of
Alphonse Dunoyer	ORGANIZATION	by
A. W. Evans	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		462 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	was made one of the directors of the jury which was to indict those accused of the `` crime of
August 10	DATE	, '' that is , of having attempted to save the monarchy .

		He was grateful for the appointment , for he had seven children to support and was poor .

		In this way his connection with Revolutionary justice was begun ; and when in
March , 1793	DATE	, the Extraordinary Criminal Tribunal , com - monly called the Revolutionary Tribunal , was created , he was chosen assistant prosecutor , and finally public prosecutor , as the man ap - pointed to that office had the good sense or the good fortune to decline the honor .

		No one in the
Spring of 1793	DATE	, while the Girondins were still influential in the Conven - tion , dreamed of the role which the new tribunal was destined to play a few months later .

		Fouquier , like any job-hunter of the present day , might well have congratulated himself upon his success .

		He was now to stand elbow to elbow with the most notable politicians who ruled the Republic .

		This was certainly better than moving from apartment to apartment to escape one 's creditors .

		In reality
Fouquier	ORGANIZATION	's appointment was for him , as well as for
France	LOCATION	, a calamity of tragic magnitude .

		He had done nothing hitherto which deserved more than continued obscurity .

		His new position was , however , soon to bring him days and nights of labor and anxiety , eventually a terrible punishment for the errors or crimes of which he was guilty , and an immortality of infamy .

		The fundamental cause of his ruin is to be found in his lack of character .

		It is the study of such a personality under the extraordinary strain to which it was subjected that gives
M. Dunoyer	PERSON	's book its unusual interest .

		This is not the first time that
M. Dunoyer	PERSON	, who is a distinguished
Paris	LOCATION	lawyer , has attempted to throw light upon the operations of the
Revolutionary Tribunal	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few years ago he published biographical sketches of Vilate and
Trinchard	ORGANIZATION	, two typical jurors .

		In reading these sketches , as well as the study of Fouquier-Tinville , one is reminded of
Eva	PERSON	- riste
Gamelin	PERSON	, the hero of
Les Dieux	ORGANIZATION	ont soif by
Anatole France	LOCATION	.


M. Dunoyer	PERSON	has treated his subject with the thoroughness of the sci - entific historian and with the skill of the lawyer long accustomed to weigh evidence in the court-room .

		His aim is not to give a history of the Tribunal , but simply to show the part taken by Fouquier in its manage - ment .

		In order to define this more exactly he has presented analyses of all the evidence given both at the preliminary examination and at the trial .

		Fouquier 's dossier was un - usually full , for the hearings lasted several months .

		There is so much testimony from all sorts of persons , ushers , registrars , jurors , judges , and a few of the rare victims that escaped the guillotine , that the figure of the terrible prosecutor is outlined with remarkable clearness .

		M. Dunoyer divides
Fouquier	ORGANIZATION	's career as prosecutor into two parts .

		During the first year he '' drew up his indictments conscien - tiously enough and in accordance with the cross examination of the accused persons and the documents which had been transmitted to his office ... He did not discuss the component parts of the accusation that he had in his hands .

		He criticized neither their value nor their origin .

		... He admitted in its entirety the most questionable evidence .

		... He adapted himself exactly , with ac - tivity , zeal , and application , to the designs and intentions of the legislators , '' in other words , of the Jacobin rulers of
France	LOCATION	during the Reign of Terror .

		Just before the
Danton	PERSON	trial in
April , 1794	DATE	, a change took place in
Fouquier	ORGANIZATION	's attitude . ''

		Now , '' as
M. Dunoyer	PERSON	says , '' he was to give proof of initiative , to play a personal part , to show himself ... He would suggest to his chiefs of the two Committees of General Security and Public Safety that the powers at his command were too small , that it was possible , by decrees adapted to circumstances , to go farther , to strike conspirators and suspects more surely . ' '

		Thus Fouquier came quite naturally to ' ' sym - bolise Terror and Dismay , at first almost insensibly , then in crescendo to the final butchery . ''

		In the last forty-nine days of the Tribunal before the overthrow of Robes - pierre , 1,366 were condemned to death .

		It is not surprising that as the activities of the prosecutor 's office assumed the propor - tions of a great business operation Fouquier acquired a frightful notion of efficiency .

		If any prisoners were acquitted , he fell into a fury , especially if he had had too much wine at dinner .

		He would demand the names of the jurors , and would exclaim '' Things must move .

		There must be 400 or 450 this decade ; for the next one so many are always to be had . ''

		In important cases he selected the jurors himself , his '' solid men , '' '' firers of uninterrupted volleys , '' as he called them . ''

		Pass through it '' was one of his favorite phrases for obtaining the condemnation of a prisoner . ''

		Make them mount '' was another choice bit of official slang .

		His idea of effi - ciency is also illustrated in his practice of ordering the carts for the condemned before the opening of the trials .

		Fouquier and his associates considered themselves men of esprit .

		One of the judges
1914	DATE	THE DIAL 463 showed Fouquier a caustic letter from the
Comte de Fleury	ORGANIZATION	, a prisoner , and remarked , ' ' Does it not seem to you that this fine fellow is in a hurry ? ''

		Fouquier replied , '' Yes , he appears to me to be in a hurry , and I am going to send for him . ''

		The prisoner was accordingly added to a group charged with conspiring against
Robespierre	LOCATION	's life and was condemned to die in the red shirt of a par - ricide .

		The most serious accusation against Fou - quier was that of grouping persons absolutely strange to one another under the same charge .

		This was the famous amalgamation .

		Fouquier defended himself on the ground that he was authorized by a decree passed on the 23rd Ventose .

		His fault in this case , as in the equally execrable case of the conspiracy of the prisons , was that he gave the most sinister interpretation to the decree .

		Towards the last his indictments were vague , made up of turgid Jacobin phraseology , and names were erased or inserted upon the lists of those indicted without any change in the indict - ment .

		He did not even take the time to obtain the full names of those sent before the Tribunal .

		As a result in two or three cases the wrong person was condemned .

		On one occasion he sent for a astellane , and when the usher reported that there were two in prison , he retorted : ' ' Bring them both , they must both pass through it . ''

		After all , it was certain members of the governing committees that were responsible for such villainies , rather than a wretched pettifogger like Fouquier .

		He only erred through excess of zeal .

		His conduct and theirs are fine examples of what happens when revolutions are directed by men who have neither strong character nor clear intelli - gence .

		advanced , we have assumed duties toward the various peoples of the archipelago on one hand , and toward the family of nations on the other , which are not now to be avoided .

		Few of the writers seem in any degree con - vinced that we shall ever be able in the future to disregard these obligations , internal and external , to the islands themselves , and they place the time when the Filipinos shall be capable of self-government generations , if not centuries , hence .

		It may also be noted that all five writers regard this state of affairs with complacency , if not with pleasure .

		The books are written either by former office-holders under Republican appointments in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, or by those who are in sympathy with and have obtained their facts and opinions from Republican appointees .

		In so far as they touch upon the Anti-im - perialistic movement in this country and the position assumed by the Democratic party in the campaign of
1900	DATE	, they regard both as unmixed evils , leading to an extension of the movement for national independence in the archipelago and to a lengthening of the time required to bring our new subjects under the yoke .

		It is notable that , while varying ac - counts of the preliminary dealings between the
United States	LOCATION	through its consular and naval officers are given , all tending to show that these officials quite effectually misled the revolutionary Filipino chiefs into the belief that independence awaited them on the ex - pulsion of the Spaniards , there is nowhere in any of the books either a word to indicate the complete break with our own wise traditions or any attempt to justify our actions subse - quent to the victory of
Commodore Dewey	ORGANIZATION	in
Manila Bay	LOCATION	by an appeal to principles recog - nizable as American .

		Expediency , the god of the Republican Party from the moment the War between the
States	LOCATION	ended , is still the one divinity worshipped here .

		There is positive insincerity in one or two of the books regarding the price we have had to pay for this experiment in governing with - out the consent of the governed .

		From none of the books is it possible to obtain facts or figures regarding our expenditures in money or in blood .

		The nearest approximation to a fact is the round statement that
$ 300,000,000	MONEY	has been expended from the national treasury to reduce the Filipino people to such a point of exhaustion that our rule had to be accepted ; and there goes with this statement nothing to indicate that the money has not been well used .

		Bearing in mind that the
$ 300,000,000	MONEY	admittedly spent in bringing an alien and distant population under subjection has been raised largely by taxation bearing far more 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	heavily upon the poor than upon the rich among us , and it would seem that a paragraph of two in these various books which urge us to keep our hold upon the islands might have been devoted to an apology for our seizure of them .

		Much the fairest and best of the volumes under consideration are the two which com - prise the late
James A. LeEoy	PERSON	's `` The Ameri - cans in
the Philippines	LOCATION	. ''

		The author was for two years officially connected with the
United States Philippine Commission	ORGANIZATION	, which established such civil rule as the islands now possess .

		Seized with a fatal illness , he wrote the greater part of his history while in our consular service in
Mexico	LOCATION	, receiving every assistance possible at that distance from the archives at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		His preliminary survey of the condition of the islands under Spanish rule is a marvel of compact and lucid statement , and the book is uniformly well written .

		Unfortunately the story ends with the reelection of President
McKinley	PERSON	in
1900	DATE	, and so we are denied the satisfaction of fol - lowing the account of so conscientious and well-informed an historian into the present .

		The writer devotes comparatively little space to the dealings between
Aguinaldo	PERSON	and his junta with American officials , though he brings out clearly enough the bringing of the Filipino leader to
Cavite	LOCATION	by
Commodore Dewey	PERSON	and the subsequent armament of Agui - naldo 's followers with American rifles .

		The shifting and indeterminate policies at Wash - ington following the capture of
Manila	LOCATION	, the final steps which led up to the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	, and our succeeding to the ill-starred Oriental empire of
Spain	LOCATION	in consequence , and the mistakes made by us in our relations to the friars , are alii told with candor .

		The evils and absurdity of the military censorship , the backing and filling of the military govern - ment , and the errors of its chiefs are made clear .

		The chapters relating to the military movements in scattering the Filipino armies and pursuing Aguinaldo are as interesting as fiction .

		The book abounds in notes , often containing information as important as that in the text , and it is buttressed everywhere with citations to original documents .

		The attitude of the writer throughout is , of course , that of the imperialist .

		Former Civil Commissioner
Worcester	LOCATION	, who has also required two volumes to express him - self regarding ``
The Philippines	LOCATION	, Past and Present , '' writes to tell of the enormous ad - vance made by the Filipinos in good govern - ment under his paternal administration of their affairs .

		From this account it appears that the islanders are being put in the way of being much more prosperous than any similar number of human beings in the continental
United States	LOCATION	.

		He is , in places , rabidly par - tisan , inevitably discrediting his own narra - tive by ill temper .

		His criticisms of the Democratic administration in the islands , based upon newspaper rumors that he should be the last to place reliance upon , are in the worst possible taste , especially in light of the extravagances of his own administration which have recently been brought to light .

		To bring home to Americans the excesses of the guerrillas during the war , he writes as follows : `` In a letter ...
Legarda	PERSON	complained that a bad impression had been produced by the news from
Dagupan	LOCATION	that when the Insurgents entered there , after many outrages committed upon the inmates of a girls ' school , every officer had carried off those who suited him .

		`` What should we say if
United States	LOCATION	troops entered the town of
Wellesley	LOCATION	and raped numerous students at the college , subsequently taking away with them the young ladies who happened to suit them ? ''

		Mr.
Worcester	PERSON	has a pleasant fancy ; but Mr.
LeRoy	PERSON	, with more fairness , devotes a large part of one of his chapters to a recital of the evils done by our own
United States	LOCATION	troops , due in part to the reprisals which guerrilla warfare brings out at all times and places , but still more to a lack of proper discipline .

		After describing the prevailing conditions , Mr.
LeRoy	PERSON	writes as follows : `` Unless every American command was offi - cered by prudent , humane , and vigilant men , the contagion of guerrilla methods would spread from the Filipino to the American camp .

		And in many , indeed , almost certainly most , places it did infect American officers , both high and low , and their soldiers . ''

		It would seem hardly necessary to intrude an American woman 's college into the discussion in view of the facts which Mr.
Worcester	PERSON	prefers to suppress .

		It is even more in - structive , after Mr.
Le Roy	PERSON	's account of the shuffling policy of
Washington	LOCATION	, before the cheerful phrase `` benevolent assimilation '' had been invented , to learn from Mr.
Worces	PERSON	- ter about `` a divine Providence that is all - seeing , all - wise , and inexorable . ''

		But im - perialism and the cant of religion and patriot - ism have always been near of kin .

		Mr.
Frederick Chamberlin	PERSON	, a Republican campaign speaker , presents in `` The Phil - ippine Problem '' a Republican campaign speech .

		His conclusions are remarkable for their frankness , and deserve quotation .

		After discussing , in his final chapter , the Oriental characteristics of the Filipinos , he observes : `` We must know , then , once for all , that there
1914	DATE	-RSB- 465 will never be a real
United States	LOCATION	of the
Phil	PERSON	- ippines , no matter when we turn the Islands back to their people .

		`` And more , there is no assurance that we ever shall turn them back .

		Indeed , there is consid - erable probability that the gente illustrada and the American Anti-Imperialists are correct in assert - ing that if Americans invest heavily in the
Phil	LOCATION	- ippines , the
United States	LOCATION	will never relinquish the Islands . ''

		A page further on contains this extraor - dinary paragraph : '' If stay there we do , there are some results that can now be foretold with considerable accu - racy .

		For one thing , there is to be faced the continual murmur of the word ' Independence / that ever since
Aguinaldo	ORGANIZATION	's rebellion has been in the mouths of the gente illustrada .

		The English and other European colonizing peoples know what they are talking about when they criticise us for telling the Filipinos that we shall set them free , that everything we are out there for is to prepare them for that state , and that we are giving them schools because that will make them our equals .

		These foreign critics have always said that the natives would some day rise against us .

		It cer - tainly is extremely probable , considering the resil - iency of that term ' Independence . '

		It acts like a germ that never leaves any system it enters .

		It multiplies until the fever of it possesses men utterly .

		It grows by what it feeds upon .

		It seems endowed with magic and boundless power .

		It possesses immortality . ''

		Yet this extraordinary something , so mys - teriously veiled by this candid American of presumably Revolutionary descent under the quoted term `` Independence , '' seems to be what our forefathers understood as nothing more or less than freedom and liberty , to which independence was the first step .

		That Mr.
Chamberlin	PERSON	should now be confused by it need surprise no one , for it is precisely that mysterious somewhat which has brought man up from the beasts , and will carry him to greater heights .

		Note , too , the `` weasel '' words , `` since
Aguinaldo	PERSON	's rebellion , '' which do not refer to the revolt against Spanish misrule in
1896	DATE	, two years before
America	LOCATION	knew of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, but to the war for independence against the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Note , too , the sensitiveness to European opinion , against which our forefathers so carefully warned us , and against which , and to baffle which , by affording the Latin republics to the south their chance for independence , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	was formulated .

		Surely if `` Independence '' is a germ , imperialism is a specific poison .

		Mr.
Daniel R. Williams	PERSON	, who has been con - nected with the civil government in the islands from its beginnings , transcribes from his letters home `` The Odyssey of the
Phil	PERSON	- ippine
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, '' a pleasant and cheerful account of the efforts made by the commission to fit the Filipinos for self-government .

		Spe - cifically , it tells of the travels of the Com - mission to establish such measures of local autonomy as it deemed expedient , of the formulation of laws and procedures , or the cheerfully endured hardships it went through , and of much else that is readable and interest - ing .

		The office-holder , as such , speaks little until the final chapter .

		From that chapter we learn of the `` somewhat wobbly
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, '' without drawing the conclusion that the wobbliness proceeds chiefly from American occupancy of the islands .

		There - upon ensues this remark : `` As to ' Neutralization ' the granting of inde - pendence under an international protectorate the scheme is wholly chimerical and impossible .

		It would require , for success , the unanimous con - sent of the world powers , for which consent there is neither motive nor moving necessity . ''

		Even Mr.
Chamberlin	PERSON	did not venture to differ from Mr.
Moorfield Storey	PERSON	, whom he describes as `` one of the ablest lawyers in the English-speaking world , '' on this important point , but contented himself with inferring that a people requiring neutralization could not maintain a stable government , forgetting that the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, which has effectu - ally neutralized
Latin America	LOCATION	, has been able to point to a number of stable governments there .

		But Mr.
`` Williams	PERSON	does believe in Filipino autonomy , and ventures to look for - ward to a time when the situation shall be relieved from `` personal prejudice and the baneful influence of party politics , '' without setting any time when that point will be reached .

		But such books as his and Mr.
LeRoy	PERSON	's will make toward that end , which is more than can be said for the others .

		The question will be removed from partisanship only when Americans are educated to the point that permits them to follow their oldest and best traditions , without losing them through the desire to exploit a subjugated people .

		Mr.
Carl Crow	PERSON	's `` America and the
Phil	PERSON	- ippines '' deserves careful reading , for it ap - pears to be not the work of an office-holder , past or present , but the conclusions of an American who is proud of what we have been able to do toward elevating a strange and distant people , and who believes that this people can be brought within a reasonable time to complete autonomy .

		For example , while most of the other writers assume that one solution of the problem will come through the investment of American capital , he says frankly : 466 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	'' But should the agricultural development of the islands by Americans be encouraged ?

		A few who have established themselves successfully on planta - tions have added to the country 's prosperity by their improved methods of cultivation ... But each one has added to the number of tenant farm - ers and unskilled laborers .

		If this development by Americans is good for the islands , then we should hope that , say , 5000 Americans , each sup - plied with a liberal amount of capital , would go there and engage in the profitable business of raising hemp , copra , sugar , or tobacco .

		... If all remained and all prospered , we would at once have an enormously increased production .

		Railways would be built ; new steamship lines would run to
Manila	LOCATION	; that and every other
Phil	PERSON	- ippine city would thrive ; there would be new banks , an increased revenue , and the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	would be the busiest and most prosperous place in the far East .

		But in the meantime , what of the Filipino ?

		What benefit would he derive from this development ?

		He would be drawn from his little farm to work on the big farm of the American , and even then the demand for labor would not be satisfied .

		With every American who goes to
the Philippines	LOCATION	to plant sugar , cocoanuts , tobacco , or hemp , the number of small farmers who help to build up a conservative community would decrease .

		-LSB- Mr.
Crow	PERSON	forgets the lesson in this regard taught us by
New Zealand	LOCATION	. -RSB-

		With the natives all employed by Americans ,
America	LOCATION	might add to her prosperity and to the prosperity of the islands , but where then would be our high ideals about building a nation for a dependent people ? ''

		This is a spirit too seldom shown in these volumes .

		The other writers have not learned the sad chain set forth by
Byron	PERSON	, `` Wealth , vice , corruption , barbarism at last , ' ' which we are so earnestly struggling against ; Mr.
Crow	PERSON	has .

		Yet he can write , in all seriousness , of `` the American bromide about ` governments ... deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . ' '

		If
America	LOCATION	has any characteristic policy , or if there is any feeling in the breasts of its people to set them apart from
Europe	LOCATION	, that is not derived from the Declaration of Independence , it has been unknown to every great statesman we have produced .

		A chapter of the book entitled `` Pesos and Centavos '' sets forth a most interesting account of tariff manipulation in favor of the harvester trust , whereby American purchasers of hemp for binding twine secured all the benefits of a high duty and the Filipino pro- ducer rather less than none .

		This account is commended to the consideration of those who wondered at the masterly silence preserved by the
Progressive Party	ORGANIZATION	two years ago regard - ing the whole question of the Filipino people .

		Mr.
Crow	PERSON	, like most of the other writers , falls into the palpable error of regarding as essential to freedom a high degree of indi - vidual education ; he states with far too much certainty that the Filipino is able to show marked intellectual status only when he has been ancestrally crossed with other races , white or yellow .

		The case of the
American Negro	ORGANIZATION	is brought up to show a similar state of affairs at home .

		But it is submitted , with full consciousness of the room for vast differ - ences of opinion , that the Negro in
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts , under that state 's admirable school system , is better educated than the Caucasian in the black belts of the South , and is quite as \ vell fitted for self-government .

		Mr.
Crow	PERSON	, too , has a fear that every evil will result from the falling of the government under Filipino autonomy into the hands of the gente illustrada , the educated and astute natives , who are estimated at one-tenth of the whole population .

		Without minifying the evils that have resulted in the
United States	LOCATION	from a similar state of affairs , it should be fair to quote once more the late
Pierpont Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's observation to Senator
Cummins	PERSON	, to the effect that the time was at hand when a dozen men in
America	LOCATION	could sit about a table and settle the affairs of the nation .

		Senator
Cummins	PERSON	replied , so the report runs , that he was afraid such a plan would not work unless
God Almighty	ORGANIZATION	sat with them as chairman .

		The point is that we in the
United States	LOCATION	are prone to view with complacency our own shortcomings , while we point with alarm to precisely the same state of affairs in aliens .

		Yet , to take a minor instance , the temperate Filipino is able to survive the consumption of certain native beverages , which the exist - ing government has had to prohibit to the intemperate American because they killed him .

		The trade of the archipelago doubled the year after the
American Congress	ORGANIZATION	estab - lished free trade between the States and the islands ; yet it took thirteen years to bring this about .

		Is the Filipino government ever going to follow a more foolish course than we did in this respect from
1896	DATE	to
1909	DATE	?

		It is doubtful .

		Let it be said in conclusion that all the books under consideration here convey between their lines , even when it is least in their lines , the fullest promise of a complete autonomy for the Filipino people within a time greatly less than they report as possible .

		Every American school-teacher in the archipelago is a force making for the independence which some as - sume to dread ; but the innate native feeling for independence is a still greater force .

		Every American who retains his self-respect in the presence of a people he realizes to be as human as himself is also such a force , because of the universal acceptance among us of the
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 467 spirit of equality of the great Declaration , al - most unknown to the peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	, albeit it is the reading of the Golden Rule into prac - tical politics .

		The relief is coming from the common peo - ple of the islands , and not from the gente illus - trada , just as it is coming in
Mexico	LOCATION	from the same source .

		The
United States	LOCATION	seized
the Philippines	LOCATION	when at the nadir of their political idealism .

		We have travelled an enormous dis - tance since toward the stars of a destiny suffi - ciently manifest to all not blinded by the merest materialism .

		The fundamental criti - cism against our occupation comes now from President
Wilson	PERSON	himself , in words recently spoken of another situation but capable of universal application ; and they are words too truthfully hopeful to be omitted here : '' I challenge you to cite me an instance in all the history of the world where liberty was handed down from above !

		Liberty always is attained by the forces working below , underneath , by the great movement of the people .

		That , leavened by the sense of wrong and oppression and injustice , by the ferment of human rights to be attained , brings Freedom . ''

		WALLACE RICE .

		BRIEFS ox BOOKS .

		A dubious introduction to literature .

		Last year
M. Emile Faguet	PERSON	pub - lished a little volume -LRB- `` Initia - tion Litteraire '' -RRB- intended as a guide to literature for beginners , in the form of a summary outline of literary history from the time of the Vedas .

		Such a volume , if thoroughly well done , would be convenient for reference ; but its value to a beginner may be doubted .

		Almost necessarily it must employ critical terms which are 1 beyond a beginner 's understanding ;
M. Faguet	PERSON	's sur - vey abounds in such terms .

		The quality of the book suggests that the author regarded it as a piece of hack work .

		Writing for French readers , it is proper enough that he should have given most space to French litera - ture ; but he should have paid more attention to proportion and accuracy in dealing with other literatures .

		Some slips are plainly due to carelessness ; such is the remark that one of
Xenophon	PERSON	's principal works is the Mem - orabilia of Plato .

		Others seem to be due to plain ignorance ; such is the observation that
Bacon	PERSON	was perhaps a collaborator of Shake - speare , and the surprising information that the Lake poets were so called because they were Scotch !

		The last error is omitted in the English translation ; but the others stand .

		As to proportion , it is astonishing to find most of a paragraph devoted to
William Habington	PERSON	in an outline of - English literature which makes no mention of
Beowulf	LOCATION	,
Alfred	PERSON	,
Piers Plowman	PERSON	,
Smollett	PERSON	,
Jane Austen	PERSON	, or
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	-LRB- we select almost at random a few of the omitted great -RRB- .

		We find , too , some rather absurd literary judgments , such as the characterization of the style of Thu - cydides as limpid , and the remark that Klop - stock 's `` Messiah '' is one of the finest products of the human mind .

		It is difficult to see why such a volume should be translated into English at all ; it is more difficult to see how any reputable publisher could have put out so schoolboyish a version as Sir Home Gor - don 's , published under the title , `` Initiation into Literature '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		An idea of the baronet 's quality as a translator may be gained from the fact that he renders `` fabliau '' as `` fable , '' '' insaisissable '' as `` insatiable , '' and `` Trouvere '' as `` found - ling . ''

		Not only is he guilty of these and other gross blunders as to the meaning of words , but he utterly perverts and destroys the sense of whole sentences .

		One instance must stand for many .

		Speaking of the nine - teenth century novel ,
M. Faguet	PERSON	writes : `` II arrivait meme qu'un esprit , ne pour voir d'une maniere admirablement juste la realite , la voyait en effet , mais , a cause du temps , ou en partie a cause du temps , 1 ` associait a une imagina - tion grossissante et deformante , a une sorte de megalomanie litteraire et ce fut le cas d'Honore Balzac . ''

		This Sir
Home Gordon	PERSON	transmogrifies as follows : `` It even happened that a mind born to see reality in an admirably accurate manner , saw it so only by reason of the times , or at least partly due to the times , associated it with a magnifying but deforming imagination converting it into a literary megalomania ; and this was the case of Honore de Balzac . ''

		The book abounds with minor errors and inaccuracies , not all of which can be charged to bad proof-reading .

		Thus we find ' '
Perseus	PERSON	' ' for `` Persius , '' `` Lucian '' for `` Lucan , '' `` Philostrates '' for '' Philostratus , '' `` Ana - creonotic , '' `` Gower 's ` Speculum Medi - tatus , ' '' etc. , etc. .

		The title-page announces `` additions specially written for the English version , '' but these consist only of a few sentences .

		It is a pity that so - wretched a travesty should thus seem to have the authori - zation of M. Faguet .

		The adage ' ' Traduttore , traditore '' has seldom been better exem - plified .

		Europe in the The second volume of the `` Cam - seventh and bridge Medieval History ' ' -LRB- Mac - eighth centuries .

		m jn an -RRB- '' covers the stormy per - iod of about three hundred years from Jus - tinian to Charles the Great inclusive . ''

		These 468
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 1	DATE	three centuries are among the most important in the world 's history : during this period the Germans who had invaded the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	were settling down among the conquered peoples ; new states were being created ; new languages were in formation ; a new civiliza - tion was being developed ; the foundations of modern
Europe	LOCATION	were being laid .

		The story of this interesting but imperfectly known age is told after the
Cambridge	LOCATION	fashion in a series of monographs by scholars who have achieved distinction as investigators in various sections of the mediaeval field .

		Most of the contrib - utors are from
Great Britain	LOCATION	, but other nations have also been drawn upon .

		Among the better known continental contributors are the French professors ,
Charles Diehl	PERSON	, who writes on the age of Justinian ,
Christian Pfister	PERSON	, who deals with the Merovingian period , and
Camille Julian	PERSON	, who discusses Celtic heathendom ; Dr.
Gerhard Seeliger	PERSON	, who contributes two chapters on the
Caro	PERSON	- lingian monarchy ; Dr.
Rafael Altamira	PERSON	, the noted Spanish historian , who writes on the Visigothic kingdom ; and Professor
Paul Vino	PERSON	- gradoff , who discusses the origins of Feudal - ism .

		Our own country is represented by Professor
George Lincoln Burr	PERSON	, who con - tributes a chapter on the reign of Pepin and the Frankish intervention in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Burr	PERSON	's chapter is of the suggestive type , and his account has certain stylistic graces that are not general in the volume as a whole .

		Worthy of particular mention is the chapter on the expansion of the Slavic peoples by Dr.
T. Peisker	PERSON	of
Graz	LOCATION	, whose discussion of the Huns and kindred Mongol tribes was one of the more important contributions in the first volume of this history .

		On the English side the volume contains an important chap - ter by Mr.
W. J. Corbett	PERSON	, in which the author sums up what is known about the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	kingdoms in the seventh and eighth centuries .

		In this account , as generally throughout the volume , minor details are suppressed and the space devoted to a dis - cussion of the larger aspects .

		The subject of heathendom and conversion is split up into five sections , each of which has a separate author .

		This is scarcely a satisfactory plan ; w r hen several writers deal with closely related themes , there is likely to be an overlapping and often a difference in viewpoint and con - clusions -RRB- that are confusing to the general reader .

		How T ever , it must be said that
Miss B. Phillpotts	PERSON	's discussion of German heathen - dom , though all too brief , is excellent and unusual in that it takes into account the rich sources of the heathen North and the writings of Scandinavian scholars on this subject .

		While the work is chiefly concerned with the new peoples of
Western Europe	LOCATION	, an attempt has been made to comprehend all the Medi - terranean and European countries : more than one-third of the space is given to the Byzantine and Saracenic empires and civiliza - tions .

		Like all the
Cambridge	LOCATION	volumes , the work is a vast storehouse of information ; but the editors have succeeded in producing more readable accounts than was the case with the heavy and detailed narratives of the `` Cam - bridge Modern History . ''

		The bibliographies are of the usual complete type , and the maps Mail prove of particular value .

		At last there is a book in English on the greatest of all Scandinavian writers .

		Hitherto , students of literary history , knowing
Ludvig Holberg	PERSON	by name , and knowing that he is to Scandinavian literature what
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is to English , and
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	is to French , have been unable to find in the English language any extended account of his life and work .

		The fullest statement accessible has been the monograph of Dr.
William !	PERSON


Morton Payne	PERSON	, published in the `` Warner Library , '' and , with additions , in `` The Sewanee Review . ''

		Beyond this , a few passages in the essays of
Boyesen	LOCATION	, Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, and Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, together with a few scant pages in Mr.
Oliver Elton	PERSON	's `` The Augustan Age '' have provided about the sum total of information upon the subject .

		Yet
Holberg	PERSON	was so towering a genius that he transcended the parochial limits of
Denmark	LOCATION	and
Norway	LOCATION	, and has even been characterized as an intellectual force second only to Vol - taire in the eighteenth-century European world .

		The work which we now welcome is Professor
Oscar James Campbell	PERSON	's `` The Comedies of
Holberg	PERSON	, '' published as one of the `` Harvard Studies in Comparative Litera - ture . ''

		Its title shows it to be of restricted scope , and there is still a place and a need for the comprehensive work that will survey
Holberg	PERSON	's career in all its aspects for he was at once the
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, the
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, and the Montaigne of
Denmark	LOCATION	; but we are thank - ful for what we have , and also for the pros - pect of a translation of the best of the
Holberg	PERSON	comedies , now nearly ready under the auspices of the
Scandinavian-American Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's work , as far as it goes , is done with scholarly thorough - ness .

		It includes a biographical chapter , a section devoted to the plays , and a series of special studies of
Holberg	ORGANIZATION	's relations to Mo - liere , to the Commedia dell ` Arte , and to English , French , and classical literature .

		A chapter on ``
Holberg	PERSON	's Genius , '' with a bibli -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 469 ography and notes , rounds out the volume .

		The chapter on
Holberg	ORGANIZATION	's relations with English literature is probably the most inter - esting in the volume .

		The two years -LRB- 1706-8 -RRB- that he spent in
London	LOCATION	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	had a marked influence upon his creative develop - ment , as Olsvig pointed out several years ago .

		Holberg borrowed many ideas from
Jonson	PERSON	, and the influence of
Farquhar	ORGANIZATION	is seen in `` Erasmus Montanus , '' while ``
Jeppe	PERSON	paa Bjerget '' makes it fairly evident that he saw a performance of `` The Taming of the Shrew . ''

		But the most important influence of all was that of the English essayists the ' '
Tatler	PERSON	' ' and the ' ' Spectator ' ' and much of his satire of social foible is clearly trace - able to those papers as a source .

		It is also interesting to note that
Goldsmith	PERSON	knew of
Holberg	ORGANIZATION	's tramp through
Europe	LOCATION	, and prob - ably undertook his own peregrinations in imitation of that example .

		In closing his discussion , Professor
Campbell	PERSON	justly says : `` He will prove a source of delight because he was able to make his vividly realized facts concerning Danish life of the eighteenth cen - tury typical of universal human experience .

		Thus
Holberg	ORGANIZATION	's laughter , evoked by the folly of mankind two hundred years ago , bids fair to be immortal . ''

		Biological problems of to-day .

		The
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	exchange profes - sor at the
University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	in
1912-13	DATE	was the distinguished embryologist , Dr.
Charles Sedgwick	PERSON
Minot	LOCATION	.

		By special request of
His Royal Highness	ORGANIZATION	, the Grand-Duke of
Saxe	PERSON	-
Weimar	LOCATION	, Dr.
Minot	LOCATION	was invited to lecture at
Jena	LOCATION	as well as Ber - lin .

		The six lectures delivered in response to this invitation have been put together in a small volume under the title , `` Modern Problems of Biology '' -LRB-
Blakiston Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The problems dealt with by Dr.
Minot	LOCATION	either cen - tre in and about the cell , or at least are ap - proached by the cytological pathway .

		This is entirely proper and to be expected consid - ering what the author 's life work and interest have been .

		The viewpoint is altogether mod - ern , however , as is indicated by the conclusion of the first lecture on `` The New Cell Doc - trine , '' which is stated in the following terms : `` The living substance is more important to biologists than its tendency to form cells .

		Hence we consider the chief problem of biol - ogy to be the investigation of the structure and chemical composition not of cells , but of the living substance .

		The new conception has won its way gradually .

		It corresponds to so fundamental a change of our views that we are justified in describing the new conception as the new cell doctrine . ''

		Succeeding lec - tures deal with cytomorphosis , by which term of the author 's earlier invention are denoted the transformation of cells incident to the de - velopment , growth , and senescence of the in - dividual ; with immortality and the evolution of death ; and with the determination of sex .

		It is of interest to note the matured opinion of so acute and critical an investigator as Dr.
Minot	LOCATION	on one of the most doubtful questions of heredity .

		He says : `` We must admit that the protoplasm also participates in heredity .

		I do not see how we can accept the theory that the nucleus is exclusively the organ of heredity .

		On the contrary we must say that the essence of reproduction is the continua - tion of the growth of immortal protoplasm .

		The history of protoplasm is uninterrupted , and therefore we say : the immortality of the protoplasm and of the nucleus is also the explanation of heredity . ''

		The chapter on sex-determination reviews rather fully the cytological evidence that sex is an inherited character .

		The final chapter deals with `` The Scientific Conception of Life . ''

		The author concludes that it is still open to question and investigation as to whether all the phenomena of life can be explained mechanistically .

		This conclusion is one which would probably be subscribed to by the majority of conservative biologists .

		This book throughout is marked by the distinction of manner and absolute precision and clearness of statement which are characteristic of its author .

		A Spanish As a rule , histories of Spanish painter of the art have always shown a tend -
18th century	DATE	.

		f gw nameg at the expense of lesser artists .

		A school relatively so unimportant as the
School of Aragon	ORGANIZATION	has , indeed , been entirely ignored by some writers .

		Nevertheless , this provincial school contains works of art as interesting as any in
Spain	LOCATION	, and it produced one of the most original and distinctive of artists , not simply in
Spain	LOCATION	but in all
Europe	LOCATION	Fran - cisco
Goya	ORGANIZATION	.

		His position as an artist , how - ever , has suffered somewhat from the fact that -LRB- except for a few scattered examples -RRB- only in
Spain	LOCATION	can his pictures be found ; and that , only in
Madrid	LOCATION	can his peculiar char - acteristics be examined and appreciated .

		Moreover , English appreciation has been still further hampered by the fact that hitherto no real study of the work and personality of this eighteenth century Spanish painter and satirist has been offered in the English lan - guage .

		This lack is now remedied by Mr.
Hugh Stokes	PERSON	's large and copiously illustrated volume .

		Although extending to nearly four hundred pages , these are none too many for 470 THE DIAL
June 1	DATE	our enjoyment , dealing as they do with an art and a personality of such engrossing fas - cination .

		Although in his own land
Goya	ORGANIZATION	founded no school and left no pupils , and although his career did not signalize a renais - sance of Spanish art , his influence upon the art of
Europe	LOCATION	has been very great indeed .

		He refused to bow down to tradition , and used to say , `` My only masters have been
Nature	ORGANIZATION	,
Velasquez	PERSON	, and Rembrandt . ''

		i Mr.
Stokes	PERSON	classes
Goya	ORGANIZATION	as `` the link between the art of
Velasquez	PERSON	and the art of the future , '' and counts
Sargent	PERSON	as ' ' one of
Goya	ORGANIZATION	's artistic descendants . ''

		Dying in
1828	DATE	, at the age of eighty-two ,
Goya	ORGANIZATION	is not only the last great Spanish painter , but , judged by his best works , one of the great masters of art .

		He caught a peculiar quality of existence and vitality which no other artist in the history of painting has ever surpassed .

		This gift of energy and life was his supreme talent , and he possessed it because he worshipped life and the joy of living .

		Despite his apparent cyni - cism and his avowed materialism , he had an intense sympathy for his fellow-men .

		Added to this , he had a rare psychological insight and a depth of fantastic imagination which is one of the rarest gifts of the gods .

		So industrious and fertile was his life that the mere catalogue of his paintings , etchings , lithographs , etc. , occupies fifty pages , forming by itself a valuable handbook of reference for students of this remarkable master in many kinds of art .

		-LRB- Putnam . -RRB-

		with
Shakespeare Shakespeare-lovers	ORGANIZATION	have a treat and
Bacon	PERSON	at before them in Mr.
Howells	PERSON	s Seen and the Unseen at Stratf ord-on-Avon '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , wherein he describes a visit to the great poet 's birthplace at the time of the annual Shakespeare pageant , and reports his talks and walks with the shades of both Shake - speare and
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		The book is a pleasant mingling of
Stratford	LOCATION	topography , bank-holi - day customs ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	lore , good-natured ridicule of the Baconian theory , ripened re - flection on pertinent topics , just a sufficient touch of mysticism to heighten the interest and add to the spiritual reality of these re - markable communings with the illustrious dead , and , here and there , a not unaccountable tinge of Swedenborgianism .

		Lightness of touch and fertility of invention give the humorous-fanciful narrative a movement and a sparkle that insure the reader against any thought of weariness , which is rendered still further impossible by the writer 's refusal to exhaust his theme and by the division of the reading matter into short chapters .

		One is glad to learn , early in the book , that neither
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	nor
Bacon	PERSON	trouble themselves in the least about `` that silly superstition '' -LRB- the Baconian theory -RRB- , but are now , as heretofore , the best of friends .

		Bacon himself takes occa - sion to maintain , reinforcing his argument by citing
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's `` Shakespeare ,
Bacon	LOCATION	, and the Great Unknown , '' that , contrary to the accepted view of the matter , there is far more known of his famous contemporary 's life than of most authors ' lives ; to which the poet merrily replies : ' ' There 's more known in some particulars than I would have allowed if I could have helped it , ' ' for he admits that he was `` a wild enough boy '' in his youth .

		But
Bacon	PERSON	defends him .

		`` Will , here , prob - ably played his wild pranks , as he would own , but the man who ended as he did never went far in that way . ''

		The modernity of phrase in which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is made to express him - self in these talks is accounted for , or apolo - gized for , at the very end of the book .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has seldom if ever written in happier vein than in this fantasy .

		A plea for the poor immigrant .

		If there is anyone qualified to speak on the immigration ques - tion with intelligence and fair - ness , it should be the author of `` They Who Knock at Our Gates '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , she who is known in the world of letters by her maiden name of
Mary Antin	PERSON	, and whose earlier vol - ume on `` The Promised Land '' attained so wide and deserved a popularity .

		Herself an immigrant from
Russia	LOCATION	and therefore under - standing perfectly the immigrant 's point of view , she has adopted this country with a passionate devotion to the ideals it represents in her eyes , and with a loyalty to its best tra - ditions that would jealously guard it from corrupting influences .

		Her treatment of her theme divides itself into three parts , which answer successively the three questions : Have we any right to regulate immigration ?

		What is the nature of our immigration ?

		Is immi - gration good for us ?

		To the first question she replies , with appropriate amplification and illustration : `` Whatever limits to our personal liberty we are ourselves willing to endure for the sake of the public welfare , we have a right to impose on the stranger from abroad ; these , and no others . ' '

		In answer to the second she believes , and gives reasons for her belief , that `` what we get in the steerage is not the refuse but the sinew and bone of all the nations , '' arguing soundly enough that it is enterprise and not indolence that cuts loose from the old and makes its way to the new world .

		As to the third question , she feels that it is good for us both materially and spiritually to welcome the alien , and she quotes from another to show how fortunate
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 471 it is for
America	LOCATION	that great numbers are every year coming to remind us of the `` promise of American life , '' and insisting that it shall not be forgotten .

		The author 's love for her adopted country is beautiful to behold , her Americanism is as thorough-going as any true patriot could wish , and her enthusiasm in espousing the cause of both the immigrant and the new land to which he is hastening , is contagious .

		And , with it all , her command of her adopted language is remarkable .

		Mr.
Joseph Stella	PERSON	contributes three good drawings of immigrant types .

		A premature valedictory .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's `` Vale , '' being part three in his auto - biographic trilogy , `` Hail and Farewell '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , need not by any means be his last word to his readers ; for he is still in the prime of his powers , and it is unbe - lievable that he will shake off the habit of years and deny himself the pleasure of fur - ther literary production , even though that pleasure in this instance is pictured to the reader as nothing short of positive pain . ' '

		It was between
Mullingar	LOCATION	and
Dublin	LOCATION	, '' he con - fides to us in his closing chapter , `` that I realized , more acutely than I had ever done before , that this book was the cause of my being . '

		I have been led to write it by whom I know not , but I have been led by the hand like a little child . '

		It was borne in upon me at the same time that a sacrifice was de - manded of me , by whom I knew not , nor for what purpose , but I felt I must leave my native land and my friends for the sake of the book ; a work of liberation I divined it to be liberation from ritual and priests , a book of precept and example .

		I knew this book to be the turning point in
Ireland	LOCATION	's des - tiny and yet I prayed that I might be spared the pain of the writing it and permitted in - stead to acquire the
Clos St. Georges	ORGANIZATION	, a wife , and a son .

		But no man escapes his fate . ''

		One who takes his mission as a writer so seri - ously as that is not likely to throw down his pen in thoughtless haste .

		As in the two pre - ceding volumes of the trilogy , so in this there is a rich -LRB- not to say riotous -RRB- mingling of fragmentary autobiography , odds and ends of criticism and theory , studies of human nature , graphic character sketches , more or less racy anecdote , and miscellaneous matter not easy to classify , but seldom failing to hold one 's willing attention .

		The author 's pursuit of art in
Paris	LOCATION	, up to the point when he became convinced he was not born to be a painter , with sundry incidental experiences in the gay capital , fills a considerable portion of the book ; but the `` Irish Literary Movement '' and other themes of peculiar interest to
Irish	LOCATION	- men are not neglected .

		Yet it is not quite plain just how this work is `` the turning point in
Ireland	LOCATION	's destiny . ''

		That remains to be revealed .

		A town history Sparing neither labor nor ex - of national pense , the
Lexington	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Historical Society has issued a revised and enlarged edition of
Charles Hud	PERSON	- son 's history of that famous town , continuing the chronicle from
1868	DATE	, when
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	dropped it , to
1913	DATE	, the close of the second century of
Lexington	LOCATION	's history as an incor - porated town .

		In its present form this `` History of
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- fills two octavo volumes , the first being devoted to the history proper and run - ning to nearly six hundred pages , the second confining itself to genealogies and falling only three pages short of nine hundred .

		The excellence and accuracy of
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's work , the more commendable because of the difficulties he had to contend with half a century ago in preparing his book , are appropriately recog - nized by the revisers , who take occasion to say in regard to the historian 's account of the most memorable occurrence in
Lexington	LOCATION	's annals : `` Special care has been taken to examine the many volumes dealing with the Battle of
Lexington	LOCATION	, with the result , how - ever , of proving that , while some new light has been thrown upon that event by modern historians , few , if any , narrations of the Battle are so comprehensive , so well balanced , and so accurate as is Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	's . ''

		Ham - matt Billings 's drawing of the historic en - counter appears in engraved reproduction as frontispiece to the first volume , while the portrait of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, grandson of the Captain
John Parker	PERSON	who covered himself with glory in that encounter , adorns in sim - ilar manner the second volume .

		Numerous other views and portraits are supplied , with interesting notes concerning them in the list of illustrations .

		Printed in clear type on durable paper made especially for the work , these two substantial volumes give promise of a permanence befitting their subject .

		The edition is limited to one thousand copies , and is printed from type .

		Fruitless M r -
H. Addington Bruce	PERSON	con - '' psychical '' tributes some further `` Adven - adventures .

		turings in the Psychical '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to the series of books of similar import and equal inconsequence already available .

		It is difficult to under - stand why further volumes repeating the familiar accounts of ghosts and telepathy and clairvoyance and mediums and singular cases of personally puzzling incidents continue to 472 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	attract readers .

		Books of this kind are made on the basis of a dramatic interest which is well enough for a journalistic pen , but which seems quite out of place in book form .

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's mind is of that extremely tolerant kind that can entertain antagonistic explana - tions at the same time .

		If the familiar saying of Voltaire that , incantations together with a sufficient amount of arsenic will undoubtedly kill your neighbor 's sheep could be applied to the present volume , it would be indicated by saying that Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	believes in both arsenic and incantations .

		When the one applies the other is unnecessary , and vice versa .

		On the whole , books of this type do a considerable harm in spreading the notion that the chief business of psychology is to investigate happenings of this order ; and they do further harm in spreading the belief that many men of science are seriously concerned with this type of matter as evidence of the scientific principles that control thought .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Palgrave 's ''
Golden Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, '' with a liberal selection of additional poems , and some 250 pages of notes by Mr.
C. B. Wheeler	PERSON	, is published by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	in a volume whose attrac - tive and convenient form will commend it to many besides the young students for whose special use it has been prepared .

		The additional poems are se - lected with excellent judgment .

		We are glad to see
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	given the largest amount of space , with
Browning	PERSON	,
Tennyson	PERSON	, and
Swinburne	PERSON	following in the order named .

		Time 's ultimate ver - dict on the chief Victorian poets is not unlikely to agree with this sequence .

		Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	's notes are in the main purely explanatory , and are full enough to satisfy the needs of even the dullest student of literature .

		Mr.
Moritz Moszkowski	PERSON	has edited for the `` Musicians ' Library '' -LRB-
Ditson	PERSON	-RRB- the first volume of an `` Anthology of German Piano Music , '' devoted to the early composers .

		The introductory essay is in English and German , in parallel columns .

		The frontispiece groups the five portraits of
Bach	LOCATION	,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	,
Haydn	ORGANIZATION	,
Mozart	PERSON	, and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		These five represent the peaks of creative achievement illus - trated by the collection .

		The other names are little known except to special students .

		There are eleven of these others , from Froberger -LRB- 1605-67 -RRB- to
Hassler	PERSON	-LRB- 1747-1822 -RRB- .

		Of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's later works the writer says : '' It is not to be denied that his latest compositions reveal at times perhaps an increase of geniality and sublimity of thought ; but I can not rid myself of the impression that , owing to
Beethoven	PERSON	's deafness , his inner musical hearing was more and more withdrawn from the tones of the outer world , and there resulted a certain ab - stractness of musical thought in which fruits of the spirit grew to ripeness upon which no real sun had ever cast its rays . ''

Wright	PERSON	is known to every stu - dent of the dramatist .

		He also edited the letters and miscellaneous writings of

		Dr.
Wright	PERSON	was secretary to the Old Testament Revision Company , 1870-85 ^ and joint editor of the '' Journal of
Philol	LOCATION	- ogy '' from its beginning in
1868	DATE	.


Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	, the author and social worker , died
May 26	DATE	at his
summer	DATE	home in
Barre	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		He was born in
Denmark	LOCATION	in
1849	DATE	, and came to this country at the age of twenty-one .

		After six years
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 473 of poverty and struggle , he secured a position as reporter with a
New York	LOCATION	news bureau , and for more than a quarter-century thereafter he gave his remarkable energies to journalistic and social work in
New York	LOCATION	.

		His principal published books are the following : '' How the Other Half Lives , '' '' The Children of the Poor / ' '' The Making of an Amer - ican '' -LRB- his autobiography -RRB- , `` The Battle with the Slum , '' '' Children of the Tenements , '' '' The Old Town , '' ''
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	the Citizen , '' and '' Hero Tales from the Far North . ''

		The latest Bulletin received from the Philippine Library the issue for
March	DATE	has a noteworthy article in Spanish , by the head of the
Philippine Division	ORGANIZATION	, on the importance of Philippine periodi - cals and neAvspapers in the study of the history of those islands .

		Not far from a score of these pub - lications are named , the earliest having its origin in
1779	DATE	and confining itself to some meagre ac - counts of native depredations and the punishment administered to the marauders .

		The writer is a specialist in this department of Philippine litera - ture , and speaks with authority , but is debarred by limitations of space from a full treatment of his subject .

		In the same issue are lists of recent gov - ernment publications -LRB- insular -RRB- , of books and arti - cles on the Moros , and of late accessions to the library .

		Inadequacies will reveal themselves in any scheme of book-classification for libraries , all the more so because different libraries specialize in different departments .

		Perhaps the best that can be done is to adopt as far as possible a standard system like the
Dewey Decimal	ORGANIZATION	, and to modify and elaborate as special needs require .

		What has been done of this sort at the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, espe - cially in the ancient classics and in German litera - ture , is clearly set forth by Mr.
Philip S. Goulding	PERSON	, '' Catalogue Librarian '' at that seat of learning , in a paper , '' The Classification of Literatures in the
University of Illinois Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' read some time ago at a joint meeting of the
Illinois	LOCATION	and
Missouri Library Associations	ORGANIZATION	, and lately published in '' The Library Journal , '' from which it is reprinted in separate form .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' finds in the discovery of a new fragment of
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	's lyric poetry an earnest that we shall eventually recover most of her work .

		The new fragment is thus rendered in Part X. of '' The Oxyrhynichus Papyri '' : '' Some say that the fairest thing on the dark earth is a host of horsemen , others of foot , others of ships ; but I say that is fairest which is the object of one 's desire .

		And it is quite easy to make this plain to all : for
Helen	PERSON	, observing well the beauty of men , judged the best to be him who destroyed the whole majesty of Troy , nor bethought herself at all of child or parents dear , but through love
Cypris	PERSON	led her astray ... Even so have I called to mind
Anactoria	LOCATION	, though far away , whose gracious step and flashing glance I would rather see than the chariots of the Lydians and the charge of footmen in armour .

		We know that all things may not come to pass amongst men ; but to pray for a share ... '' '' The Oxyrhyriichus Papyri '' is edited , with trans - lations and notes , by Messrs.

South Wabash Avenue	LOCATION	-
New York	LOCATION	-
Boston Chicago	LOCATION	From Nebula to Nebula or The Dynamics of the Heavens This work shows that , contrary to the assumption of modern science , the Sun is neither cooling nor con - tracting , but is passing through a stage of maturity in which his volume , density and temperature are remain - ing practically stable .

		It is a remarkable fact , insufficiently appreciated by scientists , that , under the law of gravitation , the self - compression of a cosmic body rapidly increases with contraction specifically , inversely as the square of the radius .

		In the case of the Sun , for instance , the compression upon his inner parts at the time when he is supposed to have filled the orbit of Mercury was only .0001 of what it is now ; and , on the other hand , should he continue to contract until he attains the same density as our earth his present constriction will be doubled .

		Now it is clear that the thermal effects produced by the processes of condensation and contraction are not due primarily to these processes themselves , but to the driving force of gravitation behind them .

		Since , then , the efficient cause in the production of the Sun 's heat has been shown to be gravitation pure and simple ; since , further , this cause rapidly increases with the progress of condensation , finally reaching and maintaining a maximum when contraction wholly ceases ; and since , lastly , effects are necessarily con - current and commensurable with their causes , the con - clusion becomes inevitable that cosmic heat , whether of the Sun , stars or planets , is a staple and continuous product of Nature , and that celestial bodies , barring accidents , are permanently constituted as we now see them .

		To the energy thus created the writer has given the name , GRAVISTATIC HEAT .

		BRIEFER MENTION .511 NOTES .

		511 LIST OF NEW BOOKS ... 512 WHAT CHILDREN SHOULD KNOW .

		The
summer	DATE	months have long been known to English journalism as `` the silly season . ''

		This is the time when inane discussions are carried on in the newspapers by self-impor - tant and fussy contributors , burdened with the weight of ideas that they feel must find expression in print .

		The subjects range from veracious accounts of the sea serpent to proofs of the Baconian theory of the authorship of Shakespeare for which Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	the other day found exactly the right epithet when he called it ' ' that woeful hallucination ' ' based upon the kind of buttons figured in the portraits of the dramatist , or upon a count of the letters in carefully selected passages of the text .

		In our American journalism , it is doubtful if any season of the year may be specially designated as `` silly , '' so uniformly are communications and discussions upon such vital subjects distributed through the months , and made to enliven the columns whose avowed purpose is to provide the dear public with whatever pungent stimulus it is believed will provoke a reaction .

		Nothing could be more characteristic of a `` silly season '' than a recent ripple in the American newspaper sea .

		Dr.
Charles Wil	PERSON	-
liam Eliot	PERSON	, whom we are accustomed to regard as one of our sages , the other day innocently put forth the opinion that every child should know such poems as `` Abou
Ben Adhem	PERSON	, '' `` The Village Blacksmith , '' and the chaste lines `` To a Waterfowl . ''

		Acting upon this cue , the reportorial tribe was let loose upon all sorts of persons who happen to be in the public eye , to elicit their views upon the pro- nouncement .

		It was assumed to be of pon - tifical character , and editors took it up with a pontifical sense of their public responsi - bility , reminding us once more how '' God sends country lawyers , an ' other wise fellers , To start the world 's team wen it gits in a slough . ''

		What business had Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	thus to single out these poems for such distinction ?

		What wretched judgment it showed thus to call attention to such duffers as Hunt and Long - fellow and
Bryant	PERSON	, when Messrs.
Walt Mason	PERSON	and
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	were passed by in 484 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	silence !

		What ignorance of the mission of art was revealed when a mere pedagogue , thus pedagogically discoursing , ventured to sug - gest that certain poems were peculiarly fitted for the child 's reading because of their didactic qualities and their `` uplifting '' power !

		Thus sapient souls , '' Prerogatived , With reason , reasoned , '' and the hapless cause of all this pother must have rubbed his eyes to find out if he were awake or dreaming .

		So much for the incident that has pro- vided us with a text .

		The subject of `` what children should know '' is a large one , and may be viewed from many angles .

		The French , for example , have their ideas about it , and the contrast between what they think children -LRB- especially girls -RRB- should know and what they really do know is rather startling .

		Probably the same condition obtains in other countries , and with us , but we do not go quite so far with the smug pretence that the child - ish mind is uncontaminated with evil thoughts .

		We know too well what sort of things he picks out from the newspapers , what sort of revealing suggestions he gets from the popular songs , vaudeville shows , and moving-picture displays , of which his opening and curious intelligence is made free by the indulgence or criminal negligence of his par - ents .

		Some of the more portentously serious among us even take the bull by the horns , and , adopting the false psychology of the couplet , '' Vice is a monster of so frightful mien , As to be hated , needs but to be seen , '' while ignoring the couplet that follows , insist that it is our duty to bring childhood face to face with evil in the bluntest form of state - ment , and seem to believe that the right sort of moral reaction will ensue .

		Under the spe - cious name of `` sex hygiene , '' these misguided doctrinaires seek to introduce into public edu - cation the discussion of subjects that demand for their treatment not only the utmost deli - cacy , but , above all things else , privacy which qualities are entirely incompatible with such a scheme of exploitation .

		Turning now from the consideration of a precocity which is undesirable , to the consid - eration of the lamentable ignorance of our children concerning elementary matters in the stock of common human knowledge , we find a condition of things that is absolutely shock - ing .

		There is an admirable series of books devoted to the `` Things That Every Child Should Know , ' ' but it needs only a very slight acquaintance with the equipment of our boys and girls to convince us that very few chil - dren really do know more than a small frac - tion of the things thus specified .

		This series represents the veriest counsel of perfection , as far as the average child is concerned , al - though its standard falls far short of that embodied in
Macaulay	LOCATION	's famous schoolboy .

		When a boy or girl is old enough to be in a high school , there are some things that have to be taken for granted by both teachers and writers of text-books .

		These people ought to be able to assume that the children with whom they are concerned know , for example , within a century or so , when
Socrates	PERSON	and Shake - speare and
Napoleon	PERSON	lived ; that
Havana	LOCATION	is in
Cuba	LOCATION	and the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	in the
Pacific	LOCATION	; that the
Great Lakes	LOCATION	flow through the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	into the
Atlantic	LOCATION	and not the
Atlantic	LOCATION	into the Great Lakes ; but , as a matter of fact , our high schools are filled with children who do not know these things , or others of equally elementary character .

		There is next to nothing that the teacher can take for granted about their knowledge , and the text-books placed in their hands are almost invariably above their heads .

		There ought to be a considerable body of simple knowledge acquired in childhood by the mere process of absorption , by hearing it talked about , rather than by the painful methods of study ; in reality , a large proportion of our children reach high school age without having learned anything worth mentioning by this process , and without having retained ten per cent of what has been taught them in their earlier years .

		For this deplorable condition the responsibility rests , first , with the lack of any stimulus or guidance in the home ; second , with the senseless way in which children are passed , from stage to stage through the public school mill without undergoing any real test of their capacity for promotion .

		Taking the example most frequently ad - duced in illustration of the vacant minds of our boys and girls , we find that their ignorance of the Bible is simply appalling .

		Now we hold no brief for the Bible as the bulwark of any form of religious belief , but we do hold a brief for it as an indispensable component of culture .

		The meanings of history and lit - erature and ordinary speech are absolutely
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 485 sealed to the child who is not familiar with the Book which has , beyond all others , pene - trated the recesses of the English mind , and colored every mode of its expression .

		Yet the most commonplace Scriptural allusions evoke no response in the minds of most children to-day ; they are received merely as meaning - less mystifications , because the soil has never been prepared for the seed .

		We do not mean trifling and tricky matters like those of a recent questionnaire over which many biblical students stumbled , but the stories which chil - dren would eagerly grasp and safely hold in memory were they only made accessible at the right time , and imparted with the right touch of sympathy .

		What children should know and do not know is a theme upon which every teacher can wax eloquent .

		And the occasion for such eloquence will continue to exist until we have the courage to reform our demoralized public educational system altogether , to sweep the Augean stables clean of kindergarten methods and the fads and fancies of sentimentalism , and to restore most of the conditions of a generation ago .

		For the simple and indis - putable fact is that the old ways produced more substantial results than the new ones now produce , and that without one-half of the modern pother and palaver .

		The home factor and the school factor are the prime elements of the problem , and probably share about equally in the present disgraceful out - come .

		The school factor , at least , is in the hands of the public , and may be put upon a rational basis by concerted effort .

		The home factor must be left to individual parents ; if that has gone so far along the downward path that no return to sane and wholesome ideals is possible , then our civilization is indeed un - done .

		_____________ THE A. L. A .

		AT
THE NATIONAL CAPITAL	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was predicted that the
Washington	LOCATION	con - ference of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	would be a sightseeing conference ; perhaps it did not require much prophetic vision to predict it .

		The programme committee had
evi	ORGANIZATION	- dently done its part to promote sightseeing by cutting down the number of general sessions from five to four , and by planning a pro- gramme that would not necessarily attract great crowds from the rank and file .

		Still , the general sessions , three of which were held in the
evening	TIME	, were fairly well attended .

		The sessions and affiliated associations held their meetings , but did not seem to be as much in evidence as usual .

		* As a matter of fact the whole
A. L. A.	PERSON	was not as much in evidence as when it invades and occupies for a week a whole hotel on a countryside .

		Even for meeting other librarians , renewing old acquaintances and forming new , there was less opportunity even than at
Ottawa	LOCATION	.

		How - ever , it is to be hoped that the young librarians embraced the opportunity to see the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and other government libraries at work and to make themselves acquainted with the resources at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		At the general sessions of the Association the usual reports were made , and at the open - ing session the President , Mr.
Edwin H. Anderson	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, delivered the annual address which already has been noted in these columns .

		The speaker gave a cursory view of the history of the tariff on books and of the agitation for its abolishment .

		He showed very clearly that there can be no argument in favor of this tariff , if it be not that the im - portation of Bibles printed in
England	LOCATION	might deprive certain American `` manufacturers '' of part of their profit and lower the price of this Book , hardly a worthy reason .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	demonstrated that this particular tariff does not give the national government any revenue to speak of , does not protect any - body who needs protection , and -LRB- with the above mentioned exception -RRB- is not desired , either by publishers or by authors .

		Verily , it is a tariff of stupidity !

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	opened his address with the enumeration of the countries that do not impose any tariff on books , showing that in this respect the
United States	LOCATION	, in spite of its boasts , is on a par with
Russia	LOCATION	,
Brazil	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Portugal	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and some lesser countries .

		Professor
J. Franklin Jameson	PERSON	, of the Car - negie Institution of
Washington	LOCATION	, similarly opened his paper , `` On the Need of a National Archive Building , '' with a list of names of countries that possess archive buildings .

		It would seem that in this respect the
United States	LOCATION	stands nearly alone .

		This country has no central repository for its official records .

		But he has hopes .

		In
Great Britain	LOCATION	the first suggestion that such a building be erected was made in
1616	DATE	, though it was not until
1838	DATE	that the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	was erected in
London	LOCATION	; so , if it does not take our government any longer to wake up to its needs in this respect , we might have such a building in the year 2118 !

		In the meantime our manu - * For the papers read at the meetings of the
Special Libraries Association	ORGANIZATION	I would refer to the
June	DATE	number of its organ , '' Special Libraries , '' which contains advance issues of them .

		486 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	script records will rot in cellars , dry up to a crisp under roofs , disappear from under stair - ways , and other open spaces , and lie in ware - houses where nobody knows where anything is to be found !

		And the government will go on paying in rent for such warehouses more than the interest on the capital needed for the erection of a building large enough to hold all its present collections ; and soon there will be no room for the officials of the
Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION	, the
Pension Office	ORGANIZATION	, the
General Land Office	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , properly to perform their duties : all space within the walls of these buildings will be filled with documents .

		This is the result of what might be called the bureau system of archive management , by which each department , each bureau , each office takes care -LRB- ? -RRB-

		of its own documents .

		For example , papers on the government of territories are scattered so that they can not be found without a special guide ; some of these documents have gone to the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	; and so far , so good ; these are available for public use in a proper manner .

		But the rest ?

		They are found ' ' in the Stygian darkness of the
General Land Office	ORGANIZATION	files , '' in the Indian Office , the offices of the Adjutant General , of the Inspector General of the
U. S. Army	ORGANIZATION	, in the buildings of the
State	ORGANIZATION	,
Interior	ORGANIZATION	, and
Treasury Departments	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the Treas - ury building `` several miles of wooden shelv - ing contain old
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	papers , closely packed together and dry as tinder , which up to the present time have not succumbed to spontaneous combustion under our
August	DATE	sun . ''

		In the basement of the old
Corcoran Art Gallery	ORGANIZATION	is ' ' a body of government records so stored that in a dry season they can be consulted by any person wearing rubber over - shoes , while in a wet season they are accessible by means of some old shutters laid on the basement floor . ''

		The worst case of all is the
General Land Office	ORGANIZATION	; here we find `` a body of archives representing the titles to four hundred million acres of formerly public but now private lands , stored in a place , I think , as fit for the purpose as the average libra - rian 's coal cellar . ''

		Neglect is not the only or the worst feature of the manner in which invaluable records are kept .

		`` There are half a dozen places in
Washington	LOCATION	where , if an extensive fire should break out , it might in a few hours , by burning up documents with which claims against the government are defended , cause the govern - ment to lose several times the cost of a good national archive building . ''

		Under such circumstances , search and use of these records is sometimes impossible and always difficult .

		Interesting as these addresses were and im - portant as were the subjects dealt with , the most notable utterance during the conference was undoubtedly the address on `` Prestige '' by Mr.
W. N. C. Carlton	PERSON	of the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Prestige , he said , `` is an intangible quality the possession of which brings recog - nition and power . ''

		Its dictionary definition , which is `` ascendancy based on power , '' he finds somewhat incomplete . ' '

		During the past few years , '' Mr.
Carlton	PERSON	said , `` I have found myself asking , Do librarians possess Prestige ?

		For what kind of ` ascendancy based on power ' are they notable ?

		With what tradi - tions and ideals are they associated in the public mind of our time ?

		To what extent are they influencing men and opinions of the day ? ' '

		And he is constrained to answer : '' I do not feel that we possess an ` ascendancy based on power ' of any sort ; or that we exert a large influence on contemporary thought . ''

		The remedy for this condition he sees in a liberal , or rather , a humanistic education , a recur - rence to the ideal of a `` classical '' education , the subjects being : Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	,
Mathe	PERSON	- matics , Modern Languages , Philosophy , His - tory , and Literature .

		It is quite possible to disagree with this choice of subjects , without denying the fundamental truth of Mr.
Carl	PERSON	- ton 's thesis that `` the ancient heritage with which the library profession should unmis - takably connect itself , and association with which would give it a lasting prestige , is no other than Humanism and the Humanities : those precious depositories of what is best in man 's past , and matchless instruments for up - lifting him in the present . '' ''

		Ideals derived from the Humanities , '' Mr.
Carlton	PERSON	con - tinued , `` should inspire our daily work ; our object should be to inciilcate a desire for them in the minds of the people , they should color every activity with which we are concerned .

		Unless we make this the very heart and center of our striving we shall never be other than a petty office-holding class , a bureaucracy em - balmed in a dull , uninspiring routine .

		With - out Humanistic ideals and learning we can not have prestige truly worthy of our work . ' '

		Graduates of library schools requiring a preliminary education covering the above mentioned field , Mr.
Carlton	PERSON	believes , would `` begin library work with a prestige fully equal to that with which the graduates of the
Harvard Law School	ORGANIZATION	, the
Johns Hopkins Medical School	ORGANIZATION	, the
Union Theological School	ORGANIZATION	, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	enter upon their several professions .

		Add gifts of personality to this mental equipment , and the individual would inevitably be a dynamic influence within the institution or
1914	DATE	THE DIAL 487 community whose service he enters . ''

		Words to ponder for the directors of our library schools .

		Their graduates do not now possess , nor have they ever , as graduates , possessed anything near the prestige of the graduates of other professional schools .

		The reason for this is not only lack of mature scholarship in those who are admitted .

		The ' ' classical ' ' curriculum might be varied somewhat : it may be said that the ' ' freedom from convention , the bold experimentation , and the discipline of sanity and good taste '' which is said to be the result of the study of Greek might be attained just as well from a study of Greek literature in translations .

		Knowledge of Latin would seem to give rather a technical than a cultural equipment , in that even a reasonably fair knowledge of it gives an understanding of the meaning of many technical terms which without some knowledge of Latin we would regard as akin to magic formulas ; but the ' ' wide view ' ' which
Schop	PERSON	- enhauer claims for the Latinist will surely be attained as well through the study of German .

		AJS to modern languages , it is , of course , absurd for anyone to take up library work without a thorough knowledge of German and at least some familiarity with French , not only because , as Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	says , `` half the good things of the human mind are outside English altogether , '' while most of the important books of all kinds in other languages are to be found in German transla - tions , but also because the most important professional publications without the knowl - edge of which a librarian can not follow the movements in his profession , are in German .

		As for history , I would broaden its field to include not merely the history of the activities of the human race `` during holidays and workadays , in peace and war , '' but the his - tory of science , arts , and industry as well .

		A true humanistic education can not in our days omit a knowledge of the advancement of sci - ence , nor of the progress of the arts , both `` fine '' and `` useful . ''

		A narrow classical education , it may be feared , might breed a feeling of contempt for `` science '' as it is usually termed , and for the `` useful '' arts .

		Not until he has conquered this contempt can a librarian or anyone else , for that matter on himself use
Terence	PERSON	's words , `` Homo sum ; humani nihil a me alienum puto . ' '

		To those filled with the ambition to become executives the speaker addressed a warning that a victory of this tendency `` would lower what ought to be a learned profession to a ` line of business ' such as that of the depart - ment store or mail order house . ''

		`` Utility , '' he said , `` however excellent , does not carry prestige in the public mind '' ; and he added , `` Great librarianship implies sound scholar - ship , and the courage to proclaim the highest intellectual ideals . ''

		It is not enough for a librarian to be a scholar in general , a mere `` educated man . ''

		He must `` seek by long and continuous study to make !

		himself an authority and recognized expert in some special branch of knowledge . ''

		More than that , librarians should be men who , to quote Mr.
Wells	PERSON	again , `` will have the knowledge , nerve and courage to do splendid dangerous things . ''

		I have given so much space to consideration of Mr.
Carlton	PERSON	's address because it carries a wide application and exemplifies a character - istic attitude .

		It is quite true that in this country we have `` no such respect for learn - ing as the Germans have , and no such respect for literature as characterizes the French . ''

		The attitude of too many librarians toward their calling is only a reflection of the general attitude of the public toward them , and not only toward them , but toward the teaching profession and everything that savors of non - utilitarianism .

		Whether the young librarians of the present generation will improve by Mr.
Carlton	PERSON	's ex - hortation and turn to the scholarly rather than toward the executive side of librarian - ship depends in a large degree on the attitude of the chief librarians .

		In their hands lies the power to raise or lower the future stand - ing of real librarianship .


AKSEL G. S. JOSEPHSON	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		How JACOB Rus BECAME AN AUTHOR is told in characteristic manner by Mr.
Riis	PERSON	himself in his admirable autobiography , `` The Mak - ing of an American , '' a book that now gains an added interest from the recent lamented death of its author , the most energetic , re - sourceful , and efficient social worker the city of
New York	LOCATION	has ever seen , as well as one of the most genuinely eloquent and persua - sive speakers and writers of our time .

		`` For more than a year , '' he says , in the twelfth chapter of the above-named book , `` I had knocked at the doors of the various maga - zine editors with my pictures , proposing to tell them how the other half lived , but no one wanted to know . ' '

		Then he names a cer - tain prominent publishing house that `` took to the idea , '' but the editor to whom he was sent treated him `` very cavalierly . ''

		`` Hear - ing that I had taken the pictures myself , lie proposed to buy them at regular photog - rapher 's rates and ` find a man who could 488 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 16	DATE	write ' to tell the story .

		We did not part with mutual expressions of esteem .

		I gave up writing for a time then , and tried the church doors .

		That which was bottled up within me was , perhaps , getting a trifle too hot for pen and ink . ' '

		He had magic-lantern slides made from his negatives , and on
February 28 , 1888	DATE	, in the
Broadway Tabernacle	LOCATION	, he told the story they illustrated .

		Thereafter things mended somewhat .

		`` I had had my say and felt bet - ter , '' he tells us ; and further : `` The thing I had sought vainly so long came in the end by another road than I planned .

		One of the editors of Scribner 's Magazine saw my pic - tures and heard their story in his church , and came to talk the matter over with me .

		As a result of that talk I wrote an article that appeared in the Christmas Scribner 's ,
1889	DATE	, under the title ` How the Other Half Lives , ' and made an instant impression . ''

		In the very week of its publication there came a let - ter from
Miss Gilder	PERSON	, of `` The Critic , '' ask - ing if he had thought of extending his article so as to make a book .

		If so , she knew a pub - lisher .

		After that it was comparatively plain sailing , though the publisher 's reader and after him the proofreader came near to wrecking the book ; but the author joined battle at first sight of the blue pencil , had a heart-to-heart talk with the firm , and the volume was finally printed as it had been written .

		In telling the story of its publica - tion the writer records sundry amusing ex - periences and indulges in occasional sage reflections .

		Of luck he says : `` I hear peo - ple saying once in a while that there is no such thing as luck .

		They are wrong .

		There is ; I know it .

		It runs in streaks , like acci - dents and fires .

		The thing is to get in the way of it and keep there till it comes along , then hitch on , and away you go . ''

		His own hard experience had taught this sturdily self - reliant , self-made American that `` as to bat - tling with the world , that is good for a young man , much better than to hang on to some - body for support .

		A little starvation once in a while even is not out of the way .

		We eat too much anyhow , and when you have fought your way through a tight place , you are the better for it .

		I am afraid that is not always the case when you have been shoved through . ''

		As a story of hard-won and highly honorable success on the part of a poor im - migrant with all the odds apparently against him at the start , Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's autobiography is one of the great and lasting books of its kind .

		SURREPTITIOUS READING is not all done under shelter of the school desk .

		A member of the
Enoch Pratt Free Library	ORGANIZATION	staff tells in the
Baltimore	LOCATION	`` Sun '' of a certain regular bor - rower of books who always fetches and car - ries them carefully concealed in a market basket ; for `` in some of the poorer districts reading is looked upon as a luxurious in - dulgence , something for the rich .

		This is especially true in the case of the women .

		A woman who reads a book or two a week is supposed to be lax in her housekeeping a sort of pampered good-for-nothing who neg - lects her family duties in order to read worth - less novels . ''

		This discovery came to the person here quoted when she noticed the care with which a certain poor woman always wrapped and covered the books she borrowed and returned , always stowing them out of sight in a basket .

		`` I do it on account of my neighbors , '' explained the woman when ques - tioned . ' '

		If they knew that I managed to read two books every week they 'd talk about me , and the talk would more than likely reach my husband 's ears .

		They 'd think I was n't doing my duty by him if they saw me coming in and out of the house with books .

		They 'd say I could n't feed him right or keep his clothes mended .

		And he might believe it , too .

		And so ,
Miss	LOCATION	, I do n't say anything at all about it .

		I just get up early mornings and have my washing and ironing and cleaning all done before some of them are out of their beds .

		And then when I 'm going to the store or on some other errand , I stop by here and get my books .

		They 'd make my life miserable if they knew I was reading a lot .

		They 'd say I was getting above them and thought myself something .

		Do you blame me for keeping quiet about it ?

		It 's my only pleasure , read - ing .

		I do n't think I could live without it . ''

		It is rather a pathetic story .

		Pathetic , too , in a different way , is the glimpse one gets , both at this library and at others , of the human derelicts who use the reading-room in other ways than to feed their hunger for lit - erature .

		With no less stealth and artifice than that employed by the woman with the basket , they convert the library to their uses as a dor - mitory , a lunch-room , an intelligence office for those seeking employment -LRB- this without stealth except in the occasional cutting-out of help-wanted advertisements from the reading - room newspapers -RRB- , a dressing-room , and , in - credible though it sounds , a laundry .

		Truly , the public library is the place of all others in which to study both books and human nature , both literature and life .

		TEMPTATIONS TO MISQUOTATION are many , and of diverse character .

		For example , the strict grammarian is sorely tempted to cor - rect
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	when he says , `` I 'll make assur - ance double sure , and take a bond of fate , '' by substituting the regular form of the ad -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 489 verb in place of `` double . ''

		In the editorial columns of a leading metropolitan journal now open before us the eye catches this sen - tence : ' ' The one person who in his heart of hearts must be opposed to the spread of civilization is the anthropologist . ''

		Probably not one writer or speaker in a thousand who are commonly rather accurate in their quota - tions would be found to give Hamlet 's exact words in the foregoing familiar phrase .

		Ham - let says , addressing Hloratio : ' ' Give me that man that is not passion 's slave , and I will wear him in my heart 's core , ay , in my heart of heart , as I do thee . ' '

		Obviously the heart 's core is the very heart of the heart , not the heart of hearts .

		The latter is a manifest ab - surdity , but , perhaps after the analogy of such phrases as `` king of kings , '' is the ex - pression that comes most readily to the lips .

		Another familiar quotation , `` Be it ever so humble , there 's no place like home , '' holds out to the careful writer and speaker a temp - tation to put `` never '' in place of the illog - ical though popularly sanctioned `` ever '' a temptation all the stronger because in
John Clarke	PERSON	's '' Parosmiologia '' occurs the proverb , `` Home is home , though it be never so homely . ''

		In like manner , the common mis - quotation , `` Pride goeth before a fall , '' may have won its place in our every-day speech partly by reason of an early familiarity with the proverb -LRB- given in Hey wood 's collection -RRB- , ``
Pryde	PERSON	will have a fall . ''

		In
Heywood	PERSON	also is another well-known saying that is some - times misquoted , `` She looketh as butter would not melt in her mouth . ''

		It is a rather absurd bit of imagery , but somehow it appeals to the fancy and one likes to use it , except that it is often difficult to remember whether the butter should be represented as melting or refusing to melt in the mouth of a person of certain supposed characteristics .

		On the whole , it is the hope of bettering the original that probably causes the greater number of our misquotations .

		When we speak , as we are tempted to , of grappling a person to our soul with `` hooks '' of steel , we certainly use a more appropriate word than the authorized ' ' hoops . ' '

		Here , as in many other instances , one is torn by conflicting desires , wishing to be scholarly and accurate and at the same time vivid and forceful .

		OPINIONS THAT ONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE EXPRESSED DIFFERENTLY are , in not a few in - stances , as all the world knows , the opinions of publishers ' readers on manuscripts sub - mitted to their criticism .

		To the patient vic - tim of repeated rejections it is consoling , in those bitter moments that so often follow the postman 's ring or the expressman 's call , to run over once more the long and distinguished list of near-failures that have ultimately been converted into brilliant successes .

		The list is all but endless ; a few titles , however , will occur to any reader , such as ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' ``
John Inglesant	PERSON	, '' `` East
Lynne	PERSON	, '' `` We Two , '' ``
David Harum	PERSON	, '' and `` The Broad Highway . ' '

		The late Mr.
Arrowsmith	PERSON	, a pub - lisher not often caught napping when writers of genius knocked at his door , made one colos - sal mistake when he rejected the manuscript of an unknown young man in
India	LOCATION	and , con - ceiving his tone to be a little conceited -LRB- which in truth it may have been -RRB- , refused to have anything to do with the youth .

		A later and somewhat similar experience with a
New York	LOCATION	publishing house did not by any means suffice to silence the pen of the future author of `` Kim '' and `` Captains Courageous , '' or to suppress his endeavor to make himself heard in the great world of books .

		An interesting query prompted by a consideration of such instances as the foregoing is this : How many literary masterpieces , thrust with insufficient persistence upon the publishers , have perished un printed ?

		LITERARY EXPRESSION OF THE `` AMERICAN SPIRIT '' will by one critic be found in one author , by another in another , because no two will exactly agree as to what really is ' ' the American spirit . ''

		Is it something dash - ing and reckless , like our express trains ; or something spontaneous and original and wil - ful , like the supposedly typical American child ; or something vigorous , masterful , self - controlled , like the latest dreadnought added to our navy ; or all of these combined ; or none of these ?

		The eminent Danish critic , Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, was lately interviewed in characteristic newspaper fashion before he had fairly set foot on our shores , and was represented as singling out Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	among contemporary American novelists as distinctively representative of the American spirit , while places close to him were assigned to Mr.
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	and the late
Frank Norris	PERSON	.

		Incidentally
Poe	PERSON	was named as the foremost American poet .

		It would have been just as easy and just as natural for Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, with his eyes open to certain other qualities undeniably possessed by us , to name Mr.
Howells	PERSON	as our greatest and most truly representative living novelist , and Whitman or even
Emerson	PERSON	as the true type of the American poet .

		Probably the truth of the matter is that , just as in human experience whatever is most poignantly and peculiarly individual in our joys and sorrows turns out to be most universal , so whoever expresses himself most faithfully and fearlessly in lit - 490 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	erature will be found to have best expressed the thought and feeling of the millions within reach of his book .

		In other words , the gen - uine American spirit is not so much a parochial or provincial spirit as it is one of wide and universal appeal .

		DRAMA FOR THE RURAL DISTRICTS is chiefly conspicuous by its absence ; but the accepta - ble presentation of good plays by local talent , even in a small town , is not an impossibility .

		To prove this the
North Dakota Agricultural College	ORGANIZATION	has turned its attention a part of its attention , rather to amateur dramatics , with results as noteworthy in their way as the achievements of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and other large universities in the same de - partment of liberal education .

		One of the rooms in its administration building has been equipped with a stage and stage accessories , and with seats for about two hundred per - sons ; and here have been successfully pro- duced half a score of plays , such as `` Miss Civilization , '' `` Cherry Tree Farm , '' and `` A Fatal Message , '' all short and requiring no elaborate properties or costumes .

		Most of the actors have been country-bred youths and maidens , and what they have shown them - selves capable of in this branch of art at the college is no more than the young folks of almost any rural community could achieve in their own town hall or high school or other public building of moderate size and seating capacity .

		The city theatre has long been an attraction luring the young men and women from their country homes .

		It is now high time for the country to exert a counter - attraction , which the
North Dakota	LOCATION	Agricul - tural College is trying to show it how to do .

		* * POLYGLOT PUZZLES for the expert cataloguer seem to have presented themselves in plenty at the
Brooklyn Public Library	LOCATION	during the past year .

		The accomplished superintendent of the cataloguing department of that institu - tion calls attention , in the library 's current Report , to some of the difficulties encountered in handling books in little-known foreign lan - guages .

		Bibles in strange tongues , about one hundred and fifty in number , caused much time-consuming labor and research .

		`` To quote just a few of the languages and dialects : Rarotongan ,
Greenland	LOCATION	,
Eskimo	LOCATION	,
Malay	LOCATION	, Ma - layalim , Gaelic ,
Manx	ORGANIZATION	, Chinese , Modern Greek ,
Maori	LOCATION	.

		Persian , Bulgarian ,
Servian	ORGANIZATION	, Russian ,
Bhugelkhunda	LOCATION	, Manchurian ,
Mpongwe	LOCATION	, Ga , Tahitian , and many others in the American Indian dialects and the dialects of
India	LOCATION	, etc. '' The total number of books in foreign lan - guages added during the year was 2,354 , including works in Yiddish , German , French , Russian , Polish , Italian , Danish ,
Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	, Dutch , and Lithuanian ; and the cataloguing of these was necessarily more of a task than the similar treatment of a like number of En - glish books .

		Few outsiders realize how many entries a single work may require , whatever its language .

		Schmidel 's `` Histoire Veritable d'un Voyage Curieux , '' for example , called for fifty-eight cards , under as many headings , from the cataloguer , to ensure its greatest use - fulness to the public consulting the catalogue : and 5,696 books added to other departments than fiction demanded collectively the addi - tion of 26,132 cards to the catalogue .

		But the champion trouble-maker seems to have been a volume of pamphlets on the Bangorian con - troversy , which necessitated the writing of 243 separate cards .

		Was the book worth it ?


LORNA DOONE	PERSON	'S NARROW ESCAPE from an early and unmerited oblivion is told by Mr.
T. Herbert Warren	PERSON	, of
Magdalen College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, who contributes an introduction to the `` World 's Classics '' edition of Black - more 's masterpiece .

		When the novel was first published , in the day of three-volume fiction at the price of a guinea and a half , it naturally took that time-honored form ; and in that form and at that price it found no large number of purchasers .

		But the edition was at last sold out , and then arose the ques - tion whether the work should be reissued in a single volume or gently dropped out of sight altogether .

		Finally Mr.
Sampson	PERSON	Low put in a good word for its author : `` Black - more is a good fellow and an old friend .

		Give him the benefit of the doubt . ''

		Such inci - dents as this help to confirm belief in the part that luck and chance , as well as merit , have played and are still playing in the winning of popular literary success .

		LANGUAGE OF THE UNLETTEEED .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The article , '' The Language of the Unlettered , '' in your issue of
May 16	DATE	, recalls an occurrence of interest which came to my attention recently .

		The proprietor of a small store near a
summer	DATE	- resort hid away among the
East Tennessee	LOCATION	moun - tains was staggered by the demand of a youthful '' clod '' from the back hills for a '' race '' of chew - ing-gum .

		No a package of gum would not an - swer ; a race was what he wanted .

		After prolonged inter-interpretation , the boy 's meaning was made clear , and the satisfied '' brother to the insensible rock '' departed with only a single layer of the desired article .

		Investigation among the
summer	DATE	guests discovered one of professorial acquirements who recalled having seen in some out-of-date English dictionary the word '' race , '' defined as '' a
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 491 layer , as one layer of soap-cakes in a box , '' or words to that effect .

		Now , as the chief point of interest of the story , arises the query : Where did the boy get the word ?

		The prevalence of English surnames among those mountain folk would give authority to the historic statement that during Revolutionary times many of the royalists sought refuge among the mountains .

		The word '' race '' in the above signification may also serve as a '' pinnacle of some submerged civilization . ''

		AN INTERESTING LITERARY RESEMBLANCE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Has attention ever been called to a resemblance between
Thackeray	PERSON	's '' Vanity Fair '' and the first part of Miss Terrier 's '' Marriage '' ?


Henry Douglas	PERSON	, the hero of this part of '' Mar - riage , '' is , like
Rawdon Crawley	PERSON	, a dashing young guardsman .

		Like
Crawley	PERSON	, too , he makes a secret marriage , though in this case with opposition more from the bride 's people than the bridegroom 's .

		The Douglases , like the Crawleys , establish them - selves after a while in
London	LOCATION	.

		The wife is socially ambitious ; the couple live far beyond their means .

		Financial ruin follows , and then separation .

		In each case the woman is more to blame than the man .

		Though there are these resemblances between the stories , there are also differences .


Henry Douglas	PERSON	's wife ,
Lady Juliana	PERSON	, is a silly woman ;
Becky Sharp	ORGANIZATION	emphatically is not .

		Becky is socially ambitious because , having no position at all , her only way to get one is to conquer it .

		The position of Lady
Juliana Douglas	PERSON	, daughter of the
Earl of Courtland	ORGANIZATION	, is assured ; she wishes to shine in society because she is too frivolous to have other ambitions .

		Her debts accumulate because she has no idea of the value of money ; whereas
Becky	PERSON	's grow because she knows the value of money that is , ready money much too well to waste it in paying bills that may in any way be put off .

		And in '' Marriage '' there is no
Lord Steyne	LOCATION	.

		But these differences are not so striking as the resemblances , which once or twice are remarkable even in detail .

		In both novels the matrimonial crash is coincident with the financial .

		In both the husband is carried off to a debtor 's prison , though in '' Marriage '' without the connivance of Ms wife .


Henry Douglas	PERSON	, after his release , is sent away to end his days with a regiment of the line in
India	LOCATION	, a position secured for him by the in - fluence of his brother-in-law , who has now become
Earl of Courtland	ORGANIZATION	.

		In '' Vanity Fair '' the influ - ence of the
Marquis of Steyne	ORGANIZATION	sends poor
Rawdon	PERSON	to end his days in the tropical island which Thack - eray aptly names
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	.

		And in each novel the wife , quite at her ease , sends her husband , in the midst of his difficulties , a supposedly com - forting letter .

		Lady
Juliana	PERSON	's is short enough to quote entire : '' Dearest Henry I have been received in the kindest manner imaginable by
Frederick	PERSON	, and have been put in possession of my old apartments , which are so much altered I should never have known them .

		They were furnished by
Lady Lindore	PERSON	, who really has a divine taste .

		I long to show you all the delights of this abode .

		Frederick desired me to say that he expects to see you here at dinner , and that he will take charge of paying all our bills whenever he gets money .

		Only think of his owing a hundred thousand pounds , besides all Papa 's and Lady Lindore 's debts !

		I assure you I was almost ashamed to tell him of ours , they sounded so trifling ; but it is quite a relief to find other people so much worse .

		Indeed , I always thought it quite natural for us to run in debt , con - sidering that we had no money to pay anything , while
Courtland	PERSON	, who is as rich as a Jew , is so ham - pered .

		I shall expect you at eight , until when , adieu , mio caro ,
Your Julie	PERSON	. ''

		I am quite wretched about you . ''

		Becky 's letter to
Rawdon	PERSON	, sent to him in prison , is longer , and moister with crocodile 's tears : '' Mon pauvre cher petit , '' I could not sleep one wink for thinking of what had become of my odious old monstre : and only got to rest in the morning after sending for Mr.
Blench	PERSON	-LRB- for I was in a fever -RRB- , who gave me a composing draught and left orders with Finette that I should be disturbed on no account .

		So that my poor old man 's messenger ... remained in the hall for some hours waiting my bell .

		You may fancy my state when I read your poor dear old ill-spelt letter . ''

		111 as I was , I instantly called for the carriage , and as soon as I was dressed ... I drove venire a terre to
Nathan 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		I saw him I wept I cried I fell at his odious knees .

		Nothing would mollify the horrid man .

		He would have all the money , he said , or keep my poor monstre in prison .

		I drove home with the intention of paying that triste visite chez mon oncle -LRB- when every trinket I have should be at your disposal ... -RRB- and found Milor there ... who had come to compliment me upon
last night	TIME	's performances ... `` I went down on my knees to
Milor	LOCATION	; told him we were going to pawn everything , and begged and prayed him to give me two hundred pounds .

		He pish 'd and psha 'd in a fury told me not to be such a fool as to pawn and said he would see whether he could lend me the money .

		At last he went away , promising that he would send it me in the morning ; when I will bring it to my poor old monster with a kiss from his affectionate Becky . ''

		I am writing in bed .

		Oh , I have such a head - ache and such a heartache ! ''

		These letters differ not so much in spirit as in the greater brilliancy of Mrs.
Rawdon Crawley	PERSON	's .

		492 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	In both are the same sort of protestation , the same reference to irrelevant matters , the same affectation of foreign phrase -LRB- to be sure , in the one Italian , in the other French -RRB- , the use of the nickname in the signature , and finally the signifi - cant postscripts : '' I am quite wretched about you . '' ''

		I am writing in bed .

		Oh , I have such a headache and such a heartache ! ''

		If all of these resemblances are the result of coincidence , it is remarkable enough to be noted .

		But may they not be more ?

		Thackeray , we know , was an eager novel-reader ; and it is but natural that traces of his reading should appear in what he wrote .

		The death of Colonel
Newcome	PERSON	is reminis - cent of the death of Leatherstocking in '' The Prairie , '' whom

		AMERICAN POETS AND ENGLISH TRADITIONS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A reviewer in a recent number of '' Poetry and Drama , '' the English quarterly , berates certain American poets because , as he says , they are imi - tative ; they write to fit the English standards and there is nothing distinctively American in their works .

		For this reason , he declares ,
America	LOCATION	produces no great poetry .

		Is this a fair criticism 1 ?

		And is it true that poetry , to be great , must be national ?

		Looking back upon English literature , we find but few English poets who could be called typi - cally English .

		Shakespeare , the greatest of all , chose foreign scenes and foreign stories for most of his plays , and even in those plays in which the scene was laid in
England	LOCATION	, he did not deal with the
England	LOCATION	of his own day .

		Chaucer , perhaps , was English , but this is not the reason why his poetry appeals to us today .

		Spenser was not English ; he was Norman-French in his atmosphere .


Dryden	PERSON	, Pope , and all of the classical and meta - physical poets modelled their work upon that of the Greeks and the Romans .

		Byron was so un - English that the English could not endure to have him in
England	LOCATION	.

		Keats and
Shelley	PERSON	were surely not typical Englishmen .

		Scott was more English than Scottish .

		Burns stands alone as the national poet of
Scotland	LOCATION	, and for that reason , perhaps , has been rated greater than he might have been had he had rivals .

		But
Burns	PERSON	is not read by any but English-speaking people , and his reputation scarcely penetrates beyond the boundaries of English-speaking countries , whereas
Byron	PERSON	has en - joyed a vogue in
Germany	LOCATION	, in
France	LOCATION	, in
Italy	LOCATION	and even today is regarded by the Russians as the greatest English poet .

		Of the two Irishmen ,
Moore	PERSON	and
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	is certainly the greater , though he wrote as an Englishman .

		Among our own poets those who have followed the English tradition have enjoyed the greatest popularity and the greatest reputation , not only at home , but abroad .

		Poe , to be sure , is an excep - tion to this rule , but though
Poe	PERSON	was not English , he was not American either .

		He had more sym - pathy with the French manner of thought than he had with either the English or the American , and it is only natural that the French should have been the first to appreciate his genius .


Bret Harte	PERSON	was an American poet .

		So was Field , and so is
Riley	LOCATION	; but can any of these be ranked with
Longfellow	LOCATION	?

		Among our prose writers
Washington Irving	LOCATION	and
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	represent the two extremes , and it is safe to say that
Irving	PERSON	will outlast Twain , for
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	is not representative of the
America	LOCATION	of to-day ; he is , rather , representative of the
America	LOCATION	of the sixties , seventies , and eighties .

		But
Irving	PERSON	represents the traditions of English literature .

		He wrote for all men and for all times .

		His humor does not depend upon current customs or current jests for its point .

		Now , what is true of prose writers in this regard is also true of poets .

		The poet who aims to represent his own country in his own day , speaking only to his countrymen , is doomed to neglect in the future .

		His interest for posterity is purely antiquarian .

		The writer of the article in '' Poetry and Drama '' is mistaken in supposing that the resem - blance of American poetry to English poetry is due to servile imitation .

		Americans are taught English literature before they are taught American literature , and they are trained to regard the latter as being merely a continuation of the former .

		As long as American writers are grounded in English literature -LRB- and God help us if the time ever comes when they will not be ! -RRB-

		they will continue to write much like the English , and the more nearly their work approaches the work of the standard English authors , the more nearly that work conforms to the ideal which they have always before their eyes .

		Our whole life is colored by English traditions .

		We not only begin our reading with English books and our history with English history , but our clothing is English cloth - ing , our law is English law , and our customs are chiefly English customs .

		We have taken from other races practically nothing but people .

		We are , in short , transplanted Englishmen , and though our population is largely made up of people from other countries , these are Anglicized in the second generation , having Shakespeare for their premier poet and
King Alfred	ORGANIZATION	for their earliest boyhood hero .

		It would be absurd to expect us to be totally unlike the English in our literature .


Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	lived in the
South Seas	LOCATION	, but he was not therefore expected to write like a
South Sea Islander	LOCATION	.

		Neither should the English expect us to evolve a unique literature in a country which was inhabited by savages four hundred years ago .

		AN AGED POKT IN His DAII/V TAL , K. * With more than Boswellian faithfulness Mr.
Horace Traubel	PERSON	reports his revered master 's daily talk and minutest actions in a third volume under the now familiar title , `` With
Walt Whitman	PERSON	in Camden . ''

		The period cov - ered by the nearly six hundred ample pages of the book is but half a yea , r , and five days over , so that no reasonable reader will com - plain of insufficient industry on the reporter 's part .

		It must be added , however , that con - siderable space is occupied by the many letters printed from the poet 's correspondence .

		The time of this intimate intercourse between
Whitman	PERSON	and his disciple falls in the
spring	DATE	and
early summer of 1888	DATE	and , after an inter - val of three and one-half months , in the
autumn	DATE	and winter of that and the following year .

		In this `` most truthful biography in the language , '' as it has been called , there is no doubt that we have
Walt Whitman	PERSON	drawn to the very life , with no previous posing of the subject for his portrait .

		Every page of the book makes this apparent , as where we open at random and read : '' W. suddenly took a notion to get up .

		I helped him to the chair .

		His legs are little good .

		He leans heavily on you .

		Yet he on his own plane is comfortable just now . '

		One thing is gone utterly and forever my agility , ' he said as we walked across the room .

		Sat down .

		Stirred the fire . '

		I will get you to hand me the poker , ' he said .

		Then worked for fully ten minutes likes it with the embers , talking meanwhile leisurely and at perfect ease .

		Turned up light , too : brushed his hair back from his face and brow .

		Did he nap it always so in the evening as Ed said ? '

		No : I have no rule : I live , move , just as the spirit directs . '

		He had read some - where of Humboldt 's informal mode of life while in
Paris	LOCATION	eating , sleeping , etc. , not by hours , but by instinct .

		W. liked the idea . ''

		In this there is , of course , much more of the minute and unsparing fidelity of the photo - graph than of the broader treatment of the portrait-painter ; but as we are at perfect liberty either to take it or leave it there is no occasion for adverse criticism .

		Whatever else may be said , there is material here , in abundance , for the future portrait-painter of an undeniably picturesque subject .

		As an example illustrating how Whitman was repeatedly falling into and out of favor with critics who lacked the courage of their * WITH WALT WHITMAN IN

		convictions and could never quite decide what they ought to think about his work , the following passage is significant .

		Whitman speaks : '' ` It is with The Literary World much as with The Tribune : they occupy the same comparative position .

		For instance , let me give you a case .


Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	I have spoken to you of it was , years ago , exceedingly well disposed towards me towards Leaves of Grass , it was said , too : greatly so : personally he was always very kind to me .

		When I was in
New York	LOCATION	the trip seven or eight years ago he called on me , put a cab at my disposal : was courteous in that way , in other ways : I was lame : he respected it .

		Yet in spite of this apparent good feeling , when the change in ownership came
Reid	PERSON	's father-in - law becoming a heavy owner the stock running into a million or millions , I should say a con - ference of the staff was called : it was decided that the paper should pursue a certain policy : that any tendency towards too great a freedom social , sexual , religious freedom should be frowned down , should not be encouraged : that the Mrs.
Grundyisms	PERSON	should be cultivated the con - ventional , traditional , appealed to . '

		He knew ' this was not a novel procedure . ' '

		I was informed that among other things it was asked how
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, Leaves of Grass , the man , his writings , were to be treated .

		It was then settled that
Reid	PERSON	's f avorability should be toned down greatly that while nothing should be said absolutely adverse , neither should anything positive be said in the way of applause . ' ''

		In the selections from
Whitman	ORGANIZATION	's wide cor - respondence we note especially letters from

		Letters and other writings of Whitman 's are also given in abundance , in a few instances in facsimile .

		The relation existing between
Whitman	PERSON	and Mr.
Traubel	PERSON	has some light thrown on it by the following inscription in a copy of the poet 's complete works presented by the author to his future literary executor -LRB- or , more accu - rately , co-executor -RRB- : `` To
Horace Traubel	PERSON	from his friend the author WALT WHITMAN & my deepest heartfelt thanks go with it to H T in getting this book out it is his book in a sense for I have been closely imprisoned & pros - trated all the time -LRB-

Edward Dowden	PERSON	, written in

Tennyson	PERSON	has asked you to come to him .

		I hope you will come .

		And if to En - gland to
Ireland	LOCATION	too .

		And if to
Ireland	LOCATION	, would you not come to this house if you had not pleasanter quarters ?

		Your welcome , at least , would be very sincere . ''

		Commenting on
Dowden	ORGANIZATION	's cordial friendliness toward him ,
Whitman	PERSON	said : '' ' I confess men like
Dowden	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Symonds	PERSON	-LRB- there are others too of the same stamp -RRB- surprise me almost upset my applecart : they are schol - ars , in certain ways classicists , yet they are the promptest sort possible in analyzing and rightly estimating new things : it seems natural for men like
O'Connor	PERSON	, like Ingersoll , to like me : they are my kind through and through : but those other fellows have been trained in other schools as a rule we expect , in fact get , other things from them .

		Thank God I do n't have to solve all the mysteries : I am satisfied to have
Dowden	PERSON	's love , satisfied for him to have my love , without trying to match pennies with him . ' ''

		From bits of talk so fragmentary and mis - cellaneous and , necessarily , so frequently of a rather unimportant nature , it is difficult to select for quotation passages of a striking character and at the same time suitable for the purposes of such a review as this .

		Flashes of truth and gleams of beauty and poetry light up the page here and there , but it is all so disjointed and informal so faithful to the reality of the unpremeditated give and take of every-day conversation that a re - viewer is at a loss how best to make the qual - ity of the book apparent to the reader without being guilty of inadvertent misrepresentation or incurring the charge of doing less than justice to the author .

		Among references to men of note whom
Whitman	PERSON	had met in his goings and comings , we find more than one mention of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, of whom he declared that there never had been a good portrait , `` never a real portrait : there were certain ones of , us agreed on that . ''

		But , when asked the reason , he could not tell , `` none of us could : all we knew was , it was not there : had we seen it , had it been there , we should have been mighty happy , you can well believe . ''

		He spoke of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's `` wonderful reserve , restraint , of expression fine nobility staring at you out of all that ruggedness . ''

		In a mood of self-appraisal Whitman is reported as saying : '' ' I feel that at many points , in essentials , I share the Shakespearean quality except , ' he apologized ' of course ' here again a reflect - ing moment ` as to the last point the highest flights the latest plays in which the breadth is so great so unmistakably phenomenal . '

		But he must still state his dissent even from S. 1 Shakespeare , however , is gloomy , looks upon the people with something like despair : does so espe - cially in his maturer plays : seems to say : after all the human critter is a devil of a poor fellow full of frailties , evils , poisons as no doubt he is if you concentrate your light on that side of him consent that this , this alone , is the man are determined to take the pessimistic view . '

		But his own ' deep impressions run counter to such lack of faith . ' ''

		It is a richly human and also somewhat tenderly pathetic picture Mr.
Traubel	PERSON	has given us of the aged and physically failing poet .

		These chapters seem rather superior to the earlier ones in a certain increase of dig - nity and seemly reserve in their presentation of the poet 's daily doings and informal chats ; not that there is any apparent curtain of concealment or any perceptible trimming of the homely actualities , but there is something less of undignified unrestraint than seemed to make itself felt in the first volume .

		The whole story goes along , as the poet said , `` w r ith the history of those times with the fortuitous career of ` Leaves of Grass . '

		: In its pictorial equipment of likenesses , early and late , of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	and some of his friends , the book does not disappoint expectation , though the rough plaster model of the sitting poet chosen for reproduction in the frontispiece suggests rather an amorphous mass of putty or clay than a close likeness of Walt Whit - man .

		The index of proper names proves itself a useful and generally reliable way - finder to the miscellaneous wealth of material in the preceding pages .

		Our present parting with the poet leaves him with three years and more of life before him .

		Shall we have still further chapters from this sunset period ?

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 495 ination , be said to have contributed anything of value to the solution of any one of the per - plexing problems that we associate with the sonnets and their cryptic dedication .

		After a careful study of the two volumes , we are as far as ever from knowing when and to whom the Sonnets were written , who the poet 's `` friend '' was , who the Dark Lady who enthralled
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's heart was , why the poems were published without their author 's supervision , how
Thomas Thorpe	PERSON	obtained them for publication , how they came to be arranged as they are , who the rival poets were , etc. .

		It may be said without fear of contradiction that satisfactory solutions to these riddles would go a great way to clear up the mystery surrounding the man Shake - speare and to throw interesting and valuable light on some of his other poems .

		Mr.
Arthur Acheson	PERSON	sets himself the task of `` demonstrating '' the following proposi - tions : that the long poem ' ' Willobie his Avisa , '' published in
1594	DATE	, had a satirical in - tention regarding
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Henry Wriothesly	PERSON	, the
Earl of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	; that ' '
Henry Willobie	PERSON	' ' was a pseudonym adopted by
Matthew Roydon	PERSON	, the intimate friend and associate of the poet
Chapman	PERSON	; that the Dark Lady of the Sonnets was
Jane	PERSON	, the wife of
John Davenant	PERSON	, an innkeeper at
Oxford	LOCATION	; that the Sonnets w T ere private epistles written to the
Earl of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	and to Mrs.
Dave	PERSON	- nant , and were not intended for publication and sale ; that they were written between the years 1592-3 and 1598-9 ; that they are in - complete and out of their sequential and chronological order ; that some of them are not by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	; `` that the Sonnets were obtained and published surreptitiously by per - sonal enemies of our poet , in the endeavor to revamp an old scandal which was first circu - lated in
1594	DATE	. ''

		As corollaries to these prop - ositions , Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	sets up a large number of bold assertions not one of which has a par - ticle of evidence to support it .

		He begins with the statements that some time about
1594	DATE	the
Earl of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	had shown
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	some signal favor and that
Chapman	PERSON	, with his eyes on the young
Earl	PERSON	's liberal purse , sought to ingratiate himself with him by sub - mitting to him for his patronage the `` Hymns to the Shadow of Night '' ; that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	read this poem and prevailed on Southamp - ton to refuse sponsorship for it , and that thereupon
Chapman	PERSON	conspired with
Roydon	PERSON	, to whom he dedicated the rejected poem , to disrupt
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's relations with his pa - tron and , by means of new matter , to win
Southampton	ORGANIZATION	's favor for themselves .

		After this it was war between
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, Chap - man ,
Roydon	PERSON	, and others who were sub - sequently drawn into the quarrel which developed into the so-called `` Poetomachia '' or `` war of the theatres . ''

		It was in the interests of this feud that , according to Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	,
Roydon	PERSON	published the `` Avisa '' under the pseudonym of ``
Henry Willoby	PERSON	. ''

		Those not acquainted with this poem may be interested to know that it is an account of the licentious wooing of
Avisa	LOCATION	, a simple , pious , beautiful country maid of low birth and hum - ble estate , by several sorts and conditions of men , all of whose suits she scornfully rejects .

		In the second half of the poem one `` H. W. , ''
Henry Willoby	PERSON	himself , after some advice by his familiar friend `` W. S. , '' attempts the seduction of Avisa , who is now married , and is repulsed .

		The initials `` W. S. '' and ' '
H. W.	PERSON	' ' are responsible for the identification of these two characters with
Henry Wriothesly	PERSON	and
William Shakespeare	PERSON	.

		The burden of Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	's book is that if he can prove that
Roydon	PERSON	, the anonymous author of `` An Elegie , or Friends Passion for his Astrophell '' -LRB- 1595 -RRB- , wrote the pseu - donymous `` Willobie his Avisa , or the true Picture of a modest Maid and of a chast and constant wife , '' it must follow that this poem is a satire on the drama of love and betrayed friendship unfolded in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Son - nets , and that Avisa is Mistress
Jane Dave	PERSON	- nant , `` H. W. '' -LRB- cantos 48 to the end -RRB- is
Henry Wriothesly	PERSON	and `` W. S. '' -LRB- cantos 45 and 47 -RRB- is
William Shakespeare	PERSON	.

		Let us say at once that not only does Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	fail to prove his proposition , but that he does not even create the suspicion of a likelihood that
Roydon	PERSON	had anything to do with the author - ship of ' ' Willobie his Avisa . ' '

		We read much of `` evidence '' in Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	's book , but of that commodity we find not enough to choke a daw w ` ithal .

		And yet Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	has reasons , pretty ones , for his conclusions .

		-LRB- 1 -RRB-
Roydon	PERSON	had the habit of publishing anonymously or pseudonymously ; ``
Henry Willoby	PERSON	, '' it is generally conceded , was not the author of the poem ; ``
Hadrian Dorrell	PERSON	, '' the self-styled editor of the poem , is probably a pseudonym ; hence -LRB- ! -RRB-

		Roydon is Henry A ^ 7 illoby alias
Hadrian Dorrell	PERSON	.

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- In style , metre , language , figures of speech , etc. , Wil - loby 's `` Avisa '' exhibits the same character - istics as does
Roy don	PERSON	's `` Elegie '' ; hence
Roydon	PERSON	wrote the `` Avisa . ''

		A single reading of these two productions will convince anyone with even only half an ear for poetry that the `` Avisa '' and the `` Elegie '' could not have emanated from the same pen .

		Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	's parallel passages would move an Egyptian mummy to laughter could it read English .

		The `` Avisa '' is in many respects poetry of a high order ; whereas the `` Elegie '' is the 496 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	wretched , stilted , artificial contrivance of a stupid and unimaginative versifier .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Mr.
Aeheson	PERSON	has a very naive way of assigning all `` poems '' written toward the end of the six - teenth century in stanzas of six iambic tetra - meter -LRB- not `` pentameter '' -RRB- verses , rhyming ababcc , to
Roy don	PERSON	; and inasmuch as `` Avisa '' is so written it must , according to Mr.
Ache	PERSON	- son , have been written by
Roydon	PERSON	.

		It is really amusing to see how Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	accom - plishes this feat .

		`` A new Sonet of Pyramus and Thisbie '' -LRB- 1584 -RRB- is subscribed `` I. Thom - son , '' and inasmuch as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	may have glanced at this poem in `` Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	finds it perfectly evi - dent that `` I. Thomson '' was one of
Roy don	PERSON	's pseudonyms .

		`` The Sturdy Rock '' -LRB- 1596 -RRB- , a little poem by `` M. T. , '' written in the verse above described , he attributes without any hesitation to
Roydon	PERSON	because he knows of no poet with these initials and because `` M. T. '' may be a misprint for `` M. R. '' So , too , `` Penelope 's Complaint '' -LRB- 1596 -RRB- , by ``
Peter Colse	PERSON	, '' must be by
Roydon	PERSON	because ``
Peter Quince	PERSON	'' is , to Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	, a parody of ``
Peter Colse	PERSON	, '' and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	must have had
Roydon	PERSON	on the brain while writing `` A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream . ''

		A MS. play in
Latin	LOCATION	on Pyramus and Thisbie in the Brit - ish Museum is attributed to '' N. R. '' ; and of course this too must be
Roydon	PERSON	, the N stand - ing `` for
Nathaniel	PERSON	, the more classic form of Matthew . ''

		`` The
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	's Slumber '' -LRB- 1600 -RRB- , a composition of considerable poeti - cal excellence to which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	alludes , subscribed `` Ignoto , '' is also attributed to
Roydon	PERSON	, although it bears absolutely none of the earmarks of his invention .

		There is more of this kind of stuff , but one who has not been convinced by these arguments will not be by those we omit .

		The evidence to prove Mrs.
Jane Davenant	PERSON	the poet 's dark-eyed and dark-haired siren is of a quality with that proving
Roydon	PERSON	the author of `` Avisa . ''

		To save any possible reader the depressing task of hunting out Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	's reasons we shall summarize them .

		Avisa is beautiful , clever and witty ; she was married to an innkeeper -LRB- one of her wooers asks for wine and her house displays the badge of
St. Gleorge	LOCATION	-RRB- ; her initials are given as `` A. D. '' -LRB- it was very unkind of Mistress
Davenant	PERSON	that her name did not begin with an A ; but Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	gets around this very neatly : A is the initial letter of `` Avisa '' or `` avis , '' a bird ; a Mr.
Byrd	PERSON	is mentioned in
John Davenant	PERSON	's will ; the word `` bird '' is always spelled with a capital B in `` Avisa '' it is not , but Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	says it is , hence the A stands for `` Byrd , '' which must have been Mrs.
Davenant	PERSON	's maiden surname ! -RRB-

		; the scene of action of the poem must have been Oxford -LRB- because the poem is dated from that place -RRB- , and because there were scandalous stories afloat about Sir
William Davenant	PERSON	being
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's bastard son -LRB- Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	rejects this story , because it conflicts with his dating of the Sonnets , but retains the scan - dal -RRB- .

		The objections to this identification are numerous .

		Shakespeare 's sweetheart was not a beauty , according to the Elizabethan ideal , was not clever or witty , was not an innkeeper 's wife , was not poor and of low estate , and her husband 's name was `` William . ''

		From in - ternal evidence it is certain that Avisa in
1594	DATE	was at least thirty years of age -LRB- she was mar - ried at twenty and had been married some nine years when assailed by her post-nuptial wooers -RRB- , exactly
Shakespeare	PERSON	's age , and we have good reason to believe that the Dark Lady was much younger than the poet .

		And it is almost certain that the Davenants were not married as early as
1585	DATE	, the year of
Avisa	ORGANIZATION	's marriage .

		It is certain , therefore , that
Avisa	PERSON	was not the Dark Lady , Mrs.
Dave	PERSON	- nant was not Avisa , and the Dark Lady was not Mrs.
Davenant	PERSON	.

		In a supplementary pamphlet , `` A Woman Coloured 111 , '' Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	gravely an - nounces , in absolute confirmation of his theories , some very important recent Shake - spearean `` discoveries . ''

		First , that a certain Professor Bang has discovered that in Spen - ser 's `` Colin Clout 's Come Home '' `` Rosa - linde '' is an anagram for `` Els Roiden '' -LRB- sic -RRB- , a sister of
Matthew Roydon	PERSON	of whose exis - tence we have no record ; second , that `` Ha - drian Dorrell '' is an anagram for `` Harrolld -LRB- sic , = herald -RRB- Roidan '' ; third , that `` Vigi - lantius Dormitanus '' -LRB- the signature to the poem prefixed to `` Willobie his Avisa '' -RRB- is an anagram for `` Vigilant Mt. Roidan . ''

		Not to be outdone by Professor Bang , Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	quite accidentally `` discovered '' that the first thirteen letters -LRB- `` In Lavine Land t '' -RRB- in the first verse of this introductory poem are an anagram for `` 111 In -LRB- = Jn = Jane -RRB-
Dave	PERSON	- nant '' !

		If we remember that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	applied the word `` ill '' to the Dark Lady it follows that Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	's theories are `` proved . ''

		It may be only a trifling coinci - dence , but it is at least curious , that in Spen - ser 's '' Rosalinda '' I `` discovered '' `` Ros
Daniel	PERSON	, '' an actual personality , the sister of the poet
Samuel Daniel	PERSON	, and that in `` Hadrian Dorrell '' I discovered , also quite accidentally , `` Harrrold
Daniel	PERSON	. ''

		The three growling r 's in `` Harrrold '' -LRB- = herald -RRB- are really no objec - tion to the anagram ; on the contrary , their presence is a very subtle way of informing posterity that in publishing the wickedness of English ladies to the world ,
Daniel	PERSON	, whom we
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 497 must now consider the author of ' ' Avisa , ' ' was performing a dog-like office .

		It strikes me that Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	's anagram would gain tre - mendously in value if we substitute `` John '' instead of ' '
Jane	PERSON	' ' for the '' In . ''

		The change would explain why so many men expected to overcome
Avisa	PERSON	's virtue , why her husband nowhere interferes , why `` H. W. '' assures her -LRB- canto 53 -RRB- that her husband is `` a worthlesse thing that no way can that pleasure bring your flowring yeares desire to find , '' and it makes her resistance to their love suits the more commendable ; besides , it is not at all likely that she would have been wooed so ardently and persistently , or that she would have had the physical strength to resist her suitors , had she been ill .

		It will surely prove a task congenial to Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	's talents to ferret out the nature of
Avisa	ORGANIZATION	's husband 's illness .

		After the perusal of Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	's book , the
Countess de Chambrun	ORGANIZATION	's study is almost posi - tively pleasurable .

		Her publishers have co - operated with her in producing a large and attractive volume by a liberal supply of blank pages , wide margins , large print , and an abundance of portraits -LRB- some of which are not at all germane to the matter -RRB- .

		Although the ostensible purpose of the book seems to have been to discuss and rearrange the Son - nets and to prove Mrs.
Davenant	PERSON	to be Shake - speare 's Dark Lady , the Countess also reprints
Rowe	PERSON	's
Life of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, discusses the Baconian theory ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's legal knowl - edge and religious convictions , and gives us liberal extracts from
Stowe	PERSON	's `` Annals , '' Row - land
Whyte	PERSON	's correspondence ,
John Aubrey	PERSON	's `` Lives , '' etc. .

		For a book that pretends to offer a serious scientific contribution to the study of the most perplexing literary problems concerning
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the volume now under review is marred by an exceedingly large number of wholly inexcusable errors of fact .

		It is not true that
Massey	PERSON	was `` the pioneer Sonnet - critic '' ; that
Lee	PERSON	is the `` generally accepted authority on the time of Shakespeare '' ; that
Howe	PERSON	's Life is `` the chief source from which we draw our knowledge of the poet and his works '' -LRB-
Rowe	PERSON	is not the independent author - ity for a single fact concerning Shakespeare -RRB- ; that the
Countess	PERSON	has found `` much that is new '' concerning the Sonnets -LRB- she has not en - riched our knowledge by a single fact -RRB- ; that
Dowden	PERSON	's views coincide with hers on the arrangement of the Sonnets ; that Shake - speare 's character is to be found only in his early poems and comedies -LRB- a poet can never eliminate himself from his work , though it mav be more difficult to discover him in his later output -RRB- ; that `` an old tradition '' iden - tifies the
Earl of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	with the youth of the Sonnets -LRB- this `` identification '' was first made by
Drake	ORGANIZATION	in
1817	DATE	-RRB- ; that the poet was one of ten children ; that
John Shake	PERSON	- speare had difficulty in supporting his family ; that several editions of `` Venus and Adonis '' were printed in
1593	DATE	; that the critics do not read Shakespeare ; that the `` first
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan sense of the word ` begetter ' is ` one who procured documents for publication ' ' -LRB- the New English Dictionary records no such definition -RRB- ; that `` all comparative analytical criticism places the date of composition of the earliest Sonnets contemporaneously with the publication of Venus and Adonis '' ; that the `` Passionate Pilgrim '' contained three `` son - nets '' from `` Love 's Labor 's Lost '' ; that `` Willobie his Avisa '' was ordered out of print because it was libellous to some great person -LRB- this is only one of Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	's guesses -RRB- ; that there are `` more than a hun - dred pages '' to
Willoby	ORGANIZATION	's `` Avisa '' -LRB- there are only seventy-seven pages to the first edition -RRB- ; that `` H. W. '' in the `` Avisa '' is `` a dissolute nobleman '' -LRB- he is described as `` a new actor '' ; the dissolute nobleman wooes her before her marriage -RRB- ; that
H. W.	PERSON	's verses `` always '' end with Italian phrases ; that
Willoby	PERSON	exclaims against the wickedness of the world `` in a note '' -LRB- this occurs in a long introductory apology to the
1596	DATE	edition ; the Countess , we fear , has not even examined the `` Avisa '' -RRB- ; that
H. W.	PERSON	's verses in cantos 44 to 46 were the lines that were censored out of press ; that Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	`` has proved '' that the
Davenants	PERSON	' Inn bore the ensign of the
Cross of St. George	ORGANIZATION	in
1594	DATE	; that when
Shakespeare	PERSON	returned to
Stratford	LOCATION	he `` lifted the mort - gages from his father 's property '' -LRB- there werp none to be lifted -RRB- ; that all the rival poets are satirized in `` Love 's Labor Lost '' ; that actors were then `` denied the privilege of Christian burial '' ; that the
Shakespeare	PERSON	coat of arms was granted under
James I.	PERSON	-LRB- it was granted in
1596	DATE	-RRB- ; that
Minto	PERSON	and
Acheson	PERSON	identify ``
Marlowe	PERSON	,
Chapman	PERSON	,
Greene	PERSON	,
Nashe	ORGANIZATION	and
Florio	PERSON	'' as the rival poets -LRB- especially as
Greene	PERSON	was dead before the Sonnets were written and
Florio	PERSON	was not a poet -RRB- ; that according to `` an old tradition '' Holof ernes is drawn on the pattern of
Florio	PERSON	-LRB- the `` tra - dition '' had its origin in the horrible imagin - ings of
Warburton	PERSON	-RRB- ; that
Shakespeare	PERSON	used his art to shape the political destinies of
England	LOCATION	; that
Fulman	PERSON	's is the earliest bio - graphical record of Shakespeare -LRB- he was pre - ceded by
Fuller	ORGANIZATION	,
Aubrey	PERSON	, and Ward -RRB- ; that
Dyce	PERSON	is the only Shakespearean commentator sincere enough to mention Fulman 's state - ment that the poet died a Papist -LRB- many 498 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	mention and discuss it -RRB- ; that the Earl of Pem - broke would never have been accounted beau - tiful -LRB- we have the positive testimony of
Francis Davison	PERSON	that he was beautiful -RRB- , etc. , etc. .

		It is quite evident that very little re - liance can be placed in the
Countess	LOCATION	's state - ments in matters pertaining to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and that she lacks the fundamental pre - requisite of sound scholarship accuracy of detail without which all the superstructure topples to the ground .

		The
Countess	ORGANIZATION	's identification of the Fair Youth of the Sonnets Avith the
Earl of South	ORGANIZATION	- ampton rests upon the following grounds : that in the dedication prefixed to the `` Rape of Lucrece '' Shakespeare pledged all his future literary work to
Southampton	LOCATION	; that Sonnet 26 is only a rhapsodized paraphrase of the
1594	DATE	dedication ; that the `` W. H. '' of
Thorpe	PERSON	's sphinx-like dedication to the Son - nets are only the initials of
Southampton	LOCATION	in reversed order for the purpose of disguise ; that the physical charms of the patron are those of the young Earl ; that , like the Fair Youth ,
Southampton	LOCATION	was `` the only son of a widowed mother '' ; that the rival poets `` can be identified with men who eagerly sought
Southampton	ORGANIZATION	's favor '' ; that the subject mat - ter of the Sonnets pertains to incidents in
Southampton	LOCATION	's career , e. g. , refusal to marry
Elizabeth Vere	PERSON	, his dissipated life , his mar - riage to
Elizabeth Vernon	PERSON	, his liberation from prison ; that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's heroes ,
Hal	PERSON	,
Romeo	LOCATION	,
Bassanio	PERSON	,
Benedick	ORGANIZATION	, and
Florizel	PERSON	, are all one and the same and all that one
Henry Wriothesly	PERSON	, and the Desdemonas and Ophelias are
Elizabeth Vernon	PERSON	; that the testimony of
Rowe	PERSON	, `` a contemporary '' -LRB- ! -RRB-

		, shows that
Shakespeare	PERSON	and
Southampton	LOCATION	were friends ; that `` Willobie his Avisa '' is a satire on the Sonnet drama and that `` the dissolute young nobleman Harry W. '' who there wooes
Avisa	ORGANIZATION	is
Henry Wriothesly	PERSON	; that
Shakespeare	PERSON	fre - quently alludes to tennis , a game at which
Southampton	ORGANIZATION	was adept , and often quotes from
Florio	PERSON	,
Southampton	ORGANIZATION	's Italian tutor !

		Most of these `` proofs , '' which the Countess considers sufficiently good evidence to be ad - missible in a court of law , are of too trivial and light a nature to merit serious considera - tion .

		The
1594	DATE	dedication is a purely formal and conventional epistle repeating the phrases of self-depreciation and exaggerated praises of the dedicatee that we find in the `` Venus and Adonis '' dedication and in other dedi - cations to noble patrons ; both bear the for - mal address to the `` Right Honourable
Henry Wriothesley	PERSON	,
Earl of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	and
Baron Titchfield	PERSON	, '' and both are subscribed `` in all dutie . ''

		In the second dedication the poet speaks of his love and duty , but he relies on the Lord 's `` Honourable Disposition , '' not on his love , for the acceptance of the new poem .

		There is absolutely no reason why a poet might not pledge his love and duty to each new patron just as a lover to a new love .

		The fact that the poet employs some words and ideas in Sonnet 26 that occur in the
1594	DATE	dedication , apart from the fact that love and duty are conventionally mated , would rather show that they were not addressed to the same person .

		Even if
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	did pledge him - self to dedicate all his future work to one patron that did not impose on him the obliga - tion of making that patron the object of his love and the subject matter of his poems .

		For the truth is that the Fair Youth was not the poet 's `` patron , '' but his love .

		Besides , the Sonnets are in many respects wholly inap - plicable to
Southampton	LOCATION	.

		There is nothing in them to show that the youth was the only son of a widow .

		In the judgment of many excellent Shakespearean scholars a much bet - ter case can be made out for
William Herbert	PERSON	.

		The first folio -LRB-
1623	DATE	-RRB- was dedicated to him ; he prosecuted the poet and his works with favor ; he was beautiful and dissipated ; many poets sought his patronage and dedicated their books to him ; he was averse to marriage - , the initials of his name are those of
Thorpe	PERSON	's dedicatee ; if
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	needed a living model for some of his romantic heroes Pem - broke would have answered the purpose as well as
Southampton	LOCATION	; etc. .

		From the so-called `` Will Sonnets '' it is certain that the
Chris	PERSON	- tian name of the youth beloved of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was
William	PERSON	, and this alone is sufficient to disprove the
Southampton	LOCATION	theory , though of course it does not establish the contention of the Herbertists .

		To my thinking neither
Herbert	PERSON	nor
Wriothesly	PERSON	was the fair youth of the Sonnets , the master-mistress of Shake - speare 's passion , the object of his sublimated homosexuality .

		Who he was we may never know , and it does not much matter whether we do .

		Like Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	, the Countess tries to prove that Mrs.
Davenant	PERSON	was the Dark Lady of the Sonnets .

		There are ten counts in her indictment of the wealthy
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	vintner 's wife .

		-LRB- 1 -RRB-
Anthony	PERSON	a Wood records that Mrs.
Davenant	PERSON	`` was a very beautiful woman , of good wit and conversation very agreeable , ' ' and that
Shakespeare	PERSON	`` frequented '' her house in his journeys between
London	LOCATION	and
Strat	PERSON	- ford .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- At the age of eleven
William Dave	PERSON	- nant wrote an ode on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- A mid-seventeenth century wit ridiculed Sir
William	PERSON	's pretensions to noble
Norman	PERSON	descent by remarking that `` every one knows that d'Avonant comes from Avon . ''

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- Oldys records that one day when young
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 499
William Davenant	PERSON	was running to see his `` godfather Shakespeare '' he was admonished not to take the name of God in vain .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Sir
William	PERSON	's vanity permitted him to give his contemporaries the impression that he was
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's son .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB-
Aubrey	PERSON	heard
Parson Robert Davenant	PERSON	,
William	PERSON	's elder brother , say that he had received a hundred kisses from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- 7 -RRB- The description of the hostess of the Crown Inn tallies with that of the hostess in the `` Comedy of Errors '' -LRB- `` A wench of excellent discourse , pretty and witty , wild , and yet too gentle '' -RRB- .

		-LRB- 8 -RRB- The
Garrick	PERSON	bust of Shakespeare was discovered -LRB- in
1845	DATE	-RRB- in the wall of a warehouse which had been erected on the site of a theatre built by
Dave	PERSON	- nant in
1660	DATE	, and the Chandos portrait of the great poet was at one time the property of Sir
William	PERSON	.

		-LRB- 9 -RRB- Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	has `` proved '' that Avisa and Mistress
Davenant	PERSON	were one .

		-LRB- 10 -RRB- And this above all : in
1599	DATE	the
Lady Southampton	LOCATION	wrote her husband that `` Sir John Falstaff '' -LRB- = Shakespeare -RRB- `` is by his mistress Dame Pint-Pot '' -LRB- = Mrs.
Davenant	PERSON	-RRB- `` made father of a goodly
Miller	ORGANIZATION	's thumb , a boy that is all head and very little body . ''

		It is somewhat of a surprise that so indefatigable an investigator as the Countess should have overlooked two very significant contemporary references to the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	-
Davenant	PERSON	scandal .

		One is a six-line poem published in
1655	DATE	and the other an allusion in an elegy occurring in
Denham	LOCATION	's poems -LRB- 1668 -RRB- .

		Whatever these counts may ' ' prove ' ' as to Sir
William	PERSON	's paternity they do not prove that his mother was the missing Dark Lady .


William Davenant	PERSON	was born in
1606	DATE	and his elder brother in
1604	DATE	; and as his mother did not give birth to a son in
1599	DATE	, the
Lady Southampton	LOCATION	's letter could not have referred to her .

		Nor does it seem consistent with delicacy of feeling and refinement of man - ners to make
Lady Southampton	LOCATION	, the only begetter of the Desdemonas and Ophelias , write her husband the poet 's quondam rival for the illicit love of the Dark Lady of the birth of that miller 's thumb .

		And it is ex - ' tremely improbable that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was ever known as `` Falstaff . ''

		From the Will Sonnets , too , it is fairly inferable that the Dark Lady 's husband 's name was
William ; Davenant	PERSON	's name w r as
John	LOCATION	.

		The description of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Cleopatra does not tally with what we know of Mrs.
Davenant	PERSON	; she was not a beauty , was not distinguished for wit and did not excel in conversation .

		The affair with the Dark Lady was probably done with long before
William Davenant	PERSON	was born .

		The chapter on the rival poets is very amus - ing .

		Apart from asserting that in her opinion
Marlowe	PERSON	was the rival poet , thus disagreeing with Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	and Professor
Minto	PERSON	, the Countess devotes her talents to `` proving '' that
John Florio	PERSON	one of the most versatile Englishmen of his day was the original of the pedant '' Holof ernes . ''

		Her main argu - ment is the strange ' ' coincidence , ' ' discovered accidentally , that the letters H-o-l-o-f-e-r-n-e-s can be arranged so as to spell ``
John Florio	PERSON	'' !

		To get this wonderful result she , with the liberty accorded to all anagrammatists , changes `` Holof ernes '' to '' Hiolof erne '' and then omits an o and an i and inserts two e 's !

		Holof ernes has , as we know , also been identi - fied with Curate Hunt ,
Thomas Jenkins	PERSON	, and
Richard Mulcaster	PERSON	, and as all these `` identifi - cations ' ' were made in all seriousness and upon indisputable evidence by allowed scholars , we must conclude that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	must be cred - ited with the invention of composite pho - tography .

		Of the
Countess	ORGANIZATION	's rearrangement of the Sonnets , as of that of every other meddler since
Thomas Thorpe	PERSON	, including Mr.
Acheson	PERSON	, we must say that not only is it wholly un - necessary , but that no one ever takes the trou - ble to read them in the proposed order .

		As with emendations to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's text : they satisfy no one but the emendator .


SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM	PERSON	.

		LIFE or MIR ABE
ATI	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The collocation of the names of these two French statesmen is not without justification .


M. Barthou	PERSON	has written a life of Mirabeau .

		To many American readers
Barthou	ORGANIZATION	is known as a recent prime minister of
France	LOCATION	; but who was Mirabeau ?

		When it transpires that
Mirabeau	PERSON	was also a statesman and a would-be prime minister , it may create a presumption in favor of his importance to know that
M. Barthou	PERSON	has thought it worth while to write a book about him and that this book has been translated into English .

		That
Mira	PERSON	- beau is not well known either to American or English readers is not the fault either of Mirabeau or of the readers .

		M. Barthou assures us that he was one of the most signifi - cant figures in modern French history , `` a powerful realist , to whom destiny alone re - fused , between
Richelieu	PERSON	and
Bonaparte	PERSON	, a role fitting to his genius , a genius hardly in - ferior to theirs . ''

		Frenchmen have long known this , and there is no dearth of good biographies of Mirabeau in French , but none of them has ever been translated into English .

		To be sure , these other volumes , although very good books , better in some respects than * MIRABEAU .

		A Biography .

		From the French of
Louis Barthou	LOCATION	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		500 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	M. Barthou 's , were not written by prime min - isters .

		It is seldom that prime ministers can spare the time from affairs of state to write books about dead statesmen ; but when they do write , their utterances take on something of a Delphic importance , and are listened to with a respect such as the professional his - torian can never hope to command .

		And this attitude of the public is not so irrational as it appears at first sight , for what the public would have from a prime minister who writes books
M. Barthou	PERSON	, for example is not what he knows about
Mirabeau	PERSON	, but what he thinks of Mirabeau as a statesman .

		An opin - ion upon such a subject from such a source , although it may not be history , is well worth listening to ; and if the historical part is not badly done , the public prefers a biography of this kind to one of a more scholarly nature .

		Apart from the peculiar value attaching to it as the work of a practical statesman , the volume by
M. Barthou	PERSON	is the best short life of Mirabeau now available in English .

		The bibliography in the French edition -LRB- omitted from the translation -RRB- indicates that M. Bar - thou had at his command the larger part of the published sources and the secondary works in French relating to the life of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	; recent German and English studies were evi - dently unknown to him .

		How thorough his use of this material was it is impossible to tell from a short work of little more than three hundred pages ; but there is evidence that he used his sources carefully and intelligently , when he did use them .

		An additional and rather unusual value is given to the volume by the incorporation into the narrative of several letters , hitherto unpublished , written by
Mirabeau	PERSON	and his father .

		These letters occupy a disproportionate amount of space , but this fact will call forth no criticism from the student of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	's life , who had long supposed that these very important letters had been destroyed .

		They will give a permanent value to this short biography that even the prestige of
M. Barthou	ORGANIZATION	's name could not con - fer upon it .

		The book is well-proportioned and very readable , even in the translation , which is unusually good , although not the most satisfactory substitute for
M. Barthou	ORGANIZATION	's charming French .

		In
France	LOCATION	, the reviewers have criticized the amount of space about half the volume devoted to
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's life before the meeting of the states general , claim - ing that the treatment of the
last two years	DATE	of his life was not adequate .

		This criticism does not seem to be sound .

		The French work formed one in a collection called `` Figures of the Past . ' '

		It was not supposed to be a sim - ple study of the statesmanship of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	, but a biography of a man who would have been one of the striking figures of the past had he never been a member of the great French assembly .

		The criticism that occurred to us while reading the volume was that the second part -LRB- devoted to Mirabeau in the na - tional assembly -RRB- assumed too much knowledge on the part of the reader , it did not supply sufficient background to make the course of events clear to one not acquainted with the French Revolution through some other work .

		That may , however , be necessary in so short a volume .

		The important chapters of the work are those dealing with the relations of Mirabeau to the court and
Montmorin	PERSON	, and with his work as a statesman .

		Here
M. Barthou	PERSON	is evidently working sources in hand ; his inter - pretation is careful , sympathetic , and impar - tial .

		Especially valuable is his treatment of
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's ministerial aspirations and their significance in the history of the Revolution .

		He stresses , as it has never before been stressed , the fatal decree of
November 7 , 1789	DATE	, excluding all members of the assembly from the ministry , thus sealing the political doom of Mirabeau .

		In one of the most striking passages in his book ,
M. Barthou	PERSON	indicates what the course of the Revolution might have been had that decree not been passed : ''
Camille Desmoulins	PERSON	distinguishes in Mirabeau the tribune , whom he admired , and the consul , whose plans he feared .

		The time for a ' consul ' had not yet come .

		But would it ever have come if , in
November , 1789	DATE	, Mirabeau had been min - ister ?

		It was the opportunity he needed .

		Fate withheld it from him .

		If he had been called to the ministry then , not only would his fate have been different , but it is not too much to say that the destinies of the country would have been changed .

		What
Mirabeau	PERSON	, the secret adviser of the court , could not accomplish at the time of his death ,
Mirabeau	PERSON	, the responsible minister , would have attempted eighteen months earlier , and would no doubt have succeeded in doing .

		By reconciling the monarchy and the Revolution , the authority of the king and the liberty of the nation , the principles of
1789	DATE	and the prerogatives of the executive power , by making ' the royal power the patrimony of the people , ' he would have spared
France	LOCATION	the Terror , Ca3sarism , and invasion .

		He would have advanced by a quarter of a century the definite establishment of the political conquests of the Revolution ... Mirabeau had every quality necessary for playing such a game and winning , general culture and familiarity with practical affairs , talent and audacity , skill and force , pas - sion and self-possession , conviction and courage , and also that desire for a personal rehabilitation which accorded well with the national reconstruc - tion of which he hoped to be the architect .

		With - out making any essential change in the general lines of the programme which he subsequently offered to the court , he would have aimed at its
1914	DATE	J THE DIAL 501 realization by other means more worthy of him - self and , it must be said , of the Revolution .

		The tribune would have taken the place of the pro- posed police .

		There , in open debate , in the conflict of interests and parties , no man , in hours of crisis , could withstand him ... Lanjuinais was not mis - taken when he spoke of the influence that Mirabeau as minister would have exercised over the assembly .

		He would have been its master .

		But the gain would have been as great for the country as for
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	.

		The decree of
November 7	DATE	broke the only power which could consolidate the Revolution by moderating it .

		It was on that day really , and not on the day of
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's death , that l the ruins of the monarchy became the prey of faction ' and Revolution by way of the Terror won the first victory over Revolution by way of Law . ''

		The volume containing the English trans - lation is not as attractive or as artistic as the original French publication .

		The vignette on the title-page and at the end of the chapters , reproducing a seal made by Mirabeau while in
Vincennes	LOCATION	, has been omitted ; and the illus - trations are not as well done as in the original .

		Attention should be called to the exceedingly interesting reproduction of a crayon in two colors made from the death mask of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	.

		The original drawing forms part of the val - uable Mirabeau collection of the late
Paul Arbaud	PERSON	of
Aix	LOCATION	en
Provence	LOCATION	, and was pub - lished for the first time in
M. Barthou	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		It will be a revelation to those who have seen nothing but the reproductions of contem - porary paintings or sketches of Mirabeau .

		It shows a strong face , the face of a genius ; and the geniality , to which all bore testimony who knew him well , has left its fascinating stamp upon the face of the dead .

		It is a smile that
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	might have loved to paint .

		heroes and saints of agitators and revolution - ists in popular causes .

		These two works are mutually corrective , in many matters almost mutually eliminative , like factors in an alge - braical equation .

		Mr.
Fyfe	PERSON	is a newspaper correspondent of the usual sort , whose keen - ness of observation overrides any marked pre - possessions for either side of the present struggling forces , but who shows more regard for the facts on the surface than for under - lying causes and for the state of affairs now and in the immediate future rather than for anything in a remoter past .

		The truth seems to lie somewhere between Mr.
MacHugh	PERSON	and Messrs.
De Lara	PERSON	and
Pinehon	PERSON	, and , on the authority of Mr.
Fyfe	PERSON	, rather nearer the so - cialistic than the capitalistic writers .

		The books by all three writers will be found inter - esting in direct proportion to one 's interest in
Mexico	LOCATION	's problems , past , present , and future , and their perusal will add enormously to any interest now felt .

		`` Modern Mexico '' is , however , rather a compilation than an organized and premedi - tated work on the subject of which it treats , a series of disconnected articles written for independent publication and left unrevised when brought together in book form .

		This lack of method permits the author to say everything more than once , and it is probable that the volume 's size might have been dimin - ished by one-fifth to the benefit of everyone concerned .

		And , as there has been no appar - ent attempt to reconcile conflicting accounts of the same fact , the result is rather discon - certing .

		The
Emperor Iturbide	PERSON	, for example , is referred to as `` Augustin I. '' on page 31 and on subsequent pages as `` Augustus I. '' ; a note on page 164 says , `` The peso , at par , is worth almost exactly two shillings , '' while on page 265 we are told that `` the peso at par is as nearly as possible the equivalent of 2s .

		Id . ''

		; on page 5 one reads `` seventy thou - sand human victims were annually offered , '' but on pages 108 and 276 the number is given as twenty thousand .

		Other similar errors may be noted , such as that on page 63 , where General
Reyes	PERSON	, already in his native land , is dispatched to ``
Mexico	LOCATION	'' ; and on page 108 , where the Aztecs are said to have adopted helmets `` in recent times . ''

		The book is written for the British reader , and the facts regarding the
United States	LOCATION	in their relationto
Mexico	LOCATION	have been taken largely from tlUr followers of
Huerta	LOCATION	.

		On page 173 , after speaking of the `` suspicion and lurking fea ^ : that that -LSB- this -RSB- country harbors ulterior Designs against the sister re - public , '' the remarkable statement is made that ' ' This suspicion has been increased rather than lessened by the attempt which , it is 502 THE DIAI , -LSB-
June 16	DATE	rumored , President
Wilson	PERSON	's
Administration	ORGANIZATION	has made to make
Mexico	LOCATION	pay for recogni - tion . ''

		It is too much , apparently , to expect a writer of this sort to acquaint himself with President
Wilson	PERSON	's express declaration against the acquisition of more territory ; but it is difficult to see why a Briton should find any - thing mysterious in the refusal to acknowl - edge
Huerta	PERSON	, when
Great Britain	LOCATION	delayed for years in her recognition of a Balkan king whose throne was attained by assassination .

		On page 285 one reads that `` There are three parties in the
United States	LOCATION	actively concerned in the opposition to the
Huerta Adminis	LOCATION	- tration . ''

		Of these there is one '' whose opposition to
General Huerta	ORGANIZATION	is based on the assumption that his Government was rendered possible by the support of British interest in
Mexico	LOCATION	, and that they are bound , as a matter of policy , to oppose it . '' ''

		The others are , first , those who desire to bring about military intervention at any cost ; and , sec - ondly , the section who do not desire the
United States	LOCATION	to intervene directly in Mexican internal affairs at first , but whose plan it is to induce some of the Northern Mexican States , particularly
Sonora	LOCATION	,
Chihuahua	LOCATION	,
Coahuila	LOCATION	,
Nuevo Leon	PERSON	, and
Tamaulipas	LOCATION	, and possibly
Sinaloa	LOCATION	,
Durango	LOCATION	, and
Zacatecas	LOCATION	, to secede from
Mexico	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		As a record of the sort of rumor
Huerta	PERSON	and his crew are spreading concerning American intentions , this possesses the value of news ; but Mr.
MacHugh	PERSON	evidently believes it him - self , for he goes on to say : `` If
Mexico	LOCATION	allowed them to go peaceably , well and good , but if an effort should be made to retain them in their old allegiance then this third party would require the
United States	LOCATION	to take up arms and complete the severance . ''

		This astonishing statement appears to be based solely on the imaginative writings of the
Texas	LOCATION	newspaper correspondents , Mr.
MacHugh	PERSON	be - ing probably the only person in the world who takes them seriously .

		As neither Democrats , Republicans , Progressives , nor Socialists have shown themselves willing to be enrolled as members of any of these newly-discovered American parties on the Mexican question , one is reduced to the belief that some regard - less countrymen of ours have been engaged in the national game of supplying the British tourist with exclusive information .

		The author appears to be .

		totally blind to the reasons for the present Constitutional revolution in
Mexico	LOCATION	, and attributes its suc - cesses solely to the American refusal to recognize
Huerta	PERSON	.

		Presided
Wilson	PERSON	's recent declaration of intentions should enlighten him , and they are so pertinent that they deserve quotation : '' First The
United States	LOCATION	, so long as Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is President , will not seek to gain a foot of Mexican territory in any way or under any pretext .

		When we have finished with
Mexico	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	will be territorially intact . ''

		Second No personal aggrandizement by American investors or adventurers or capitalists , or exploitation of that country , will be permitted .

		Legitimate business interests that seek to develop rather than exploit will be encouraged . ''

		Third A settlement of the agrarian land question by constitutional means such as those followed in
New Zealand	LOCATION	, for example will be insisted on . ''

		It is this last clause that Mr.
MacHugh	PERSON	has quite failed to discover in his investigations , though it appears to be the chief reason for
General Carranza	ORGANIZATION	's uprising ; which would have directed against Madero for his complete failure to deal with it , as it is now against
Huerta	PERSON	, the successor of that
Diaz	PERSON	whose wholesale confiscations of private property in the possession of the tillers of the soil raised the question .

		But one must read with care , however strongly in disagreement , the whole of `` The Mexican People : Their Struggle for Free - dom '' in order to understand the situation .

		Being a socialistic work , it is written as an economical interpretation of history .

		It finds all of
Mexico	LOCATION	's many troubles to lie in the age-long struggle between the commonalty on the one side , and the governing classes , the landed aristocracy , the church , and the army , in close alliance on the other .

		It boldly holds that what is called , with some confusion in terms , `` industrial civilization , '' is not civi - lization at all , and hopes to carry
Mexico	LOCATION	to the status of a cooperative commonwealth without having to pass through such a stage .

		To those who have assimilated Mill 's dictum regarding the failure of machinery to contrib - ute to the happiness of the human race such views may still appear extreme , but to the ordinary mind the failure to identify the fac - tory system with progress must seem arrant nonsense .

		Nevertheless , the facts of Mexican history interpreted from the point of view of the proletariat , in this case the oppressed and dispossessed peon , whose name is officially , in this country at least , identified with that of slave , are too valuable to be ignored , how - ever little one sympathizes with a collectivistie government as an ideal step toward true prog - ress .

		Especially informing in this connection is such a paragraph as the following : '' Were we to compile a text-book for the Sci - ence of Government by a ruling class , for the use , for instance , of some young modern aspirant to power , the testimony of all history , from the most remote times , would compel us to divide our work into three main chapters : the first , on the neces -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 503 sity of religious instruction for the people ; the second , on the necessity for the patriotic instruc - tion for the people ; the third , on the necessity of diverting the revolt of the people by instituting a campaign of foreign aggression , or by inviting the invasion of the home country by a foreign army .

		Herein lies the entire science of government by class rule . ''

		Those who have wondered at the insults offered the
United States	LOCATION	, leading to the seiz - ure of Vera Cruz by our army and navy , may find an explanation here , in so far as such insults are not merely the results of ignor - ance or the legacy of hatred from our in - famous war of
1847	DATE	.

		Carranza and
Villa	ORGANIZATION	, as we know both from this book before us and from authentic news sources , are dividing among those to whom they rightfully belong the estates stripped from the smaller land - OAvners by means the most infamous .

		The mil - lions of acres brought under the control of General
Felix Diaz	PERSON	by wholesale murder and fraud are among those so apportioned .

		This , and the success of the Constitutionalista arms , made it necessary for
Huerta	PERSON	to provoke the intervention of the
United States	LOCATION	, in the des - perate hope of uniting under his administra - tion all the forces now in field to fight a common enemy .

		Little in recent history is more reassuring than
Villa	ORGANIZATION	's , followed at an interval by
Carranza	PERSON	's , refusal to be diverted from an honest purpose by such a pretext , after the intentions of President
Wilson	PERSON	had been made clear to them ; it means the possi - bility of a lasting and prosperous peace among the
United Mexican States	LOCATION	, based upon the welfare of the submerged peon , who forms the huge majority of the Mexican nation .

		It even bespeaks , less remotely in the future , an effort to prevent the submerging of the Amer - ican tiller of the soil , now drifting into ten - ancy and a peasant state with alarming speed .

		It is , as President
Wilson	PERSON	clearly sees , the only possible solution of Mexican troubles , as it is the only basis for a lasting national pros - perity .

		This well-written book has other uses .

		It will bring home to American readers the sorry part in Mexican affairs played by this gov - ernment in the past .

		It will bring about a sincere and intelligent sympathy for the real aspiration of the Mexican people , and con - vince the reader that at last they are pre - paring themselves for self-government in a manner impossible under the atrocities of the Cientificos , in part through the steady growth of an intelligent artisan class , but more through the founding of a class of small farmers .

		Mr.
Fyfe	PERSON	's `` The Real
Mexico	LOCATION	'' well supple - ments the previous books , providing a sound basis for the moderation of the extreme state - ments found in both , and leaving a pleasant flavor after it of the common humanity we enjoy with the Mexicans , however they have been debased by the ruling classes through centuries of oppression .

		If not the bright angels of Messrs.
De Lara	PERSON	and
Pinchon	PERSON	, the Mexicans are certainly not the black devils of Mr.
MacHugh	PERSON	.

		Every shade of opinion is represented , but the writer himself has not been befooled by the suavity of the Latin - American official into acceptance of the be - neficence of Diazism , even where so astute an authority as Lord
Bryce	PERSON	has proved amenable to their smoothness further south .

		Constructive ideas , not merely conven - tional , are also advanced by Mr.
Fyfe	PERSON	.

		The Mexican government in the near future must move against the drunkenness which has be - sotted too many of the poorer citizens , just as the Russian government has found the same course needful .

		The general schooling of the people , which Juarez began with such en - thusiasm and Diaz stifled , must be rigorously attended to ; their childish characteristics are largely attributable to ignorance of books and total lack of intellectual discipline .

		Mr.
Fyfe	PERSON	believes the future of the country to be well assured through the steady growth of the arti - san class , almost wholly Indian , and he has little good to say of the half-castes , or Mes - tizos , almost the sole components of the present futile middle class .

		Hie investigates and throws aside as worthless the tale of the present war being a struggle between the petroleum interests of the British Lord Cow - dray and the American Standard Oil Com - pany , though the
Diaz	PERSON	family is profoundly interested in the former and the book pre - viously considered admits the receipt of help to the Constitutionalistas from the latter .

		His chapter on
Diaz	PERSON	, entitled `` The Nemesis of Paternalism , ' ' should dispose of the myth that
Diaz	PERSON	was a benefit to his country in any pos - sible sense of the word , though here , again , he does not go into such details as the social - ists have to offer .

		He further suggests an efficient army as the only possible corrective to the brigandage into which the landless peons have been forced .

		`` Modern Mexico '' is sparsely indexed , has a prefatory map , and a few reproduced photo - graphs ; `` The Mexican People '' is profusely and interestingly illustrated by similar means and has a large folding map , with smaller maps to illustrate historical periods , but it sadly lacks an index ; `` The Real
Mexico	LOCATION	'' also has a large map , but lacks illustrations and an index its lighter character and briefer space not rendering this last any great loss .

		* The distinction , so commonly attempted in newspaper offices , between reporters who '' write '' good stories and reporters who '' get '' good stories is often applied to novel - ists .

		And though to press the point is to divorce form and material to a degree alto - gether misrepresentative of the facts , the dis - tinction is a useful one .

		It was not artistry that made `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' the naming document it was .

		Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	had a thumping story to tell , a story that circumstance had made so good that only her limited skill was needed to render it effective .

		On the con - trary , it was artistry that made `` Mademoiselle de
Maupin	PERSON	'' the book it was , and is .

		The story was nothing , or would have been nothing in the hands of a lesser writer than
Gautier	PERSON	.

		The case of Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's new volume , the second of his `` trilogy of desire , '' is as far as possible from that of `` Mademoiselle de Mau - pin . ''

		My first feeling was that Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	had as good a story as Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's , and one a good deal more to my own taste , without the art to tell it .

		But the truth is that Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	has , in the slang of the city-room , `` fallen down on the story . ''

		He wanted to give us , against the background of that great , new , struggling
Chicago	LOCATION	of the eighties and nineties , the figure of an adventurer without master or scruple , a Superman .

		He has all the facts .

		I do not doubt that he could give names and dates for every incident in the book .

		Indeed , any one who knows
Chicago	LOCATION	could come very near doing it without any assistance from him .

		The story is always dangerously close to actual event ; dangerously close because Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	has depended on this actuality to convey reality .

		He has so many facts that he supposes he has done enough when he has set them down .

		But outward facts are significant only when they are the sign of an inward meaning .

		And Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	simply does not know the inward meaning .

		He has never for a moment stood in
Frank Cowperwood	ORGANIZATION	's shoes and looked out upon the

		he is no more a Superman than the barber around the corner .

		But if Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	has failed to draw his figure he has done some astonishing things with his background .

		No other writer 's view of
Chicago	LOCATION	is so individual or so effectively presented .

		I confess , also , to enjoying his ironies at the expense of the pillars of society , though it is silly to pretend that the liaison was as well established in the
Lake Shore Drive	ORGANIZATION	of
1886	DATE	as it was in the French farce of the same period and tiresome to read so many pages about dull creatures like
Stephanie Platow	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Patrick MaeGill	PERSON	ensured himself a story to tell by taking himself for hero : if there is a receipt for writing a novel worth reading it is the autobiographical one .

		Mr.
MacGill	PERSON	has the advantage of being a navvy who until recently earned his living at the aluminum works of
Kinlochleven	LOCATION	, in
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		How he learned to make use of this advantage is another matter .

		One might expect that a navvy who learned to write at all would be either helpless or academic .

		Mr.
MacGill	PERSON	is seldom either .

		His is a stout narrative , some - times boastful and sometimes tender , with a flavoring of folk-speech .

		His view of life is for the most part conventional .

		He believes that the truth is not in newspapers ; that men who work with their hands are much more genuine than others ; that the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is a travesty of Christianity ; and that fighting with the fists is a joy .

		He says of himself and his fellow navvies : '' We never asked questions concerning the ulti - mate issue of our labors , and we were not sup - posed to ask questions .

		If a man throws red muck over a wall to-day and throws it back again to-morrow , what the devil is it to him if he keeps throwing that same muck over the wall for the rest of his life , knowing not why nor wherefore , provided he gets sixpence an hour for his labor ?

		There were so many tons of earth to be lifted and thrown somewhere else ; we lifted them and threw them somewhere else ; so many tons of iron-hard rocks to be blasted and carried away ; we blasted and carried them away , but never asked questions and never knew what results we were laboring to bring about . ''

		The fact that Mr.
MacGill	PERSON	came only the other day from such work can not but add to the interest of anything he writes ; it should not be permitted to conceal the more important fact that the author of `` Children of the Dead End '' is by way of being an artist .


Robert Tressall	PERSON	's autobiographical novel , `` The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists , '' is told with less art than Mr.
MacGill	PERSON	's , but the story would carry larger headlines in a news - paper .

		Tressall was , as Miss
Jessie	PERSON	Pope
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 505 informs us in a prefatory note , a socialistic house-painter and sign-writer who gave up the struggle to make a living .

		About half the manuscript that was found among his effects after his death makes the book now published .

		His
Frank Owen	PERSON	is himself , but it is his indictment of the working-classes that dominates the book .

		Tressall 's mood is that of Mr.
Arturo Giovannitti	PERSON	's poem , the one in which he represents himself as standing in front of
Tiffany	ORGANIZATION	's window , disheartened be - cause two men ask him , not for a stone but for a nickel .

		Tressall 's charge is the more credible simply because it comes directly from the ranks of those against whom it is made .

		Per - haps if he had been willing to let his facts speak for themselves there is no lack of circumstantial detail we should have been compelled completely to accept them .

		Un - fortunately his tone is the tone of the propa - gandist .

		That gives the middle-class reader , at least it gave me , an excuse for refusing to believe that the British workman is of as poor stuff as
Tressall	ORGANIZATION	has made him out to be .

		Poverty-stricken he doubtless is ; '' ground under the iron heel of capitalism '' he may be ; but incapable of revolt he is not .

		One point , and
Tressall	ORGANIZATION	has made it almost by the way , deserves mention .

		These painters care nothing about their work and take no pride in it .

		They are not permitted to do good work .

		The whole trade is degraded by scamping and rushing .

		But when
Frank Owen	PERSON	has a solitary chance to exercise the skill that is in him on a special contract he can think of nothing else until he has finished .

		That incident is worth thinking about .

		Mr.
James Oppenheim	PERSON	's novel , `` Idle Wives , '' is out of place among these others .

		It is abominably written .

		No sense of the value of words restrains Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's attempts at poetizing .

		Such a bath of senti - ment as he has prepared may be acceptable to the poorer magazines for women or to the moving-picture people , but elsewhere its day is past .

		Incidentally , Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	has passed by a case that could hardly fail , just now , to arouse interest that of the woman who finds that the care of a small flat and a child or two to which she is confined takes all her time without using half her energy or one-quarter of her capacities in order to devote all this bad writing to a case of no particular consequence : that of the woman with plenty of servants whose husband objects to her activity on behalf of wayward girls .

		Mr.
Owen Johnson	PERSON	is another young Ameri - can writer who has not done all that has been expected of him .

		There is evidence that he would welcome the sort of praise which may be bestowed on the few contemporary novel - ists who have dealt frankly and artistically with life while continuing to sell his serial rights .

		At any rate Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has lately been defending publicly his conception of ' ' The Salamander , ' ' asserting he was justified in making his Dore
Baxter	PERSON	wicked because her wickedness is typical of a new but large class of American young women .

		Hjis naivete is revealed in his assumption that Dore is daringly unconventional and that she is peculiar to the present decade .

		As a matter of fact , Dore is a tolerable example of the parasite without any courage or special indi - viduality .

		She lives , until she makes a suc - cessful marriage , by enticing men while pre - serving her `` virtue . ''

		Hence the title of the novel which presents her .

		Young women of her sort , it should go without saying , are weak rather than daring , conventional rather than unconventional , and old rather than new .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has no perspective for viewing the phenomenon he has isolated .

		It is as if the last twenty years of feminist and anti-feminist propaganda had never been .

		But this is of no consequence to Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's audience .

		Sophistication would be a positive disadvantage to him .

		`` The Salamander '' is rattling good magazine stuff and Dore is bound to be discussed wher - ever high school misses gather .

		If it does any harm it will be in persuading the inex - perienced that it is easier to gain a living without working or sinning in
New York	LOCATION	than they are likely to find it .

		To turn from `` The Salamander '' to `` The Price of Love '' is to turn from juvenility to assured competence .

		Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	is the Admirable
Crichton	PERSON	of contemporary novelists .

		He can do anything sufficiently well to excite admiration , and though his willing - ness to do just anything is hardly respectable , his adequacy to such occasions as he permits himself is satisfying .

		The present occasion is not a great one .

		The story involves theft and a marriage .

		The figures are trivial .

		Its distinction is in its workmanship the sort of workmanship which characterizes a double gun by Messrs. West - ley-Richards or a trunk by
M. Vuitton	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		The Price of Love '' is an excellent example of what a first-class craftsman may do with a little material .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	has collected ten times as many facts and attempted an in - finitely more important task than has Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, but Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	has done precisely what he set out to do , which is more than any one can say for Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	.

		506 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	BRIEFS oyf NEW BOOKS .

		New aspects of English governance .

		The revised edition of Mr.
Sid	PERSON	- ney Low 's treatise on `` The Governance of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- is not , on the whole , greatly changed from the original work , published nine years ago .

		The new edition deals chiefly with the `` working constitution , '' which , as every one knows , is quite different from the formal and conventional aspects of the English system .

		Dry legal discussions are accordingly unnec - essary , and the book is correspondingly in - teresting to the layman a quality greatly enhanced by an admirably simple style .

		The author realizes that he is at a disadvantage in describing the actual government of En - gland just at a time when the Parliament Act has limited the power of the Lords , and when the Home Rule Bill promises a funda - mental change in the relations of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	to the parts of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		These and related topics find a place in the Intro - duction and in the final chapter , `` Aspects of Change ' ' ; and the reflections of so eminent a publicist as Mr. Low on these matters are vastly more interesting and important than the description of the English system , which is already fairly well understood .

		The Par - liament Act , thinks Mr.
Low	PERSON	, adds to the strength of the Cabinet , by restricting the power of the Lords over legislation .

		The Quinquennial Act contributes to the same re - sult , as it tends to establish regular elections , like those of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Within the Cabinet the Prime Minister 's influence and power are growing , as is shown by the royal proclamation of
1905	DATE	which gave precedence to the Premier , next after the two highest ecclesiastical dignitaries of the realm .

		There is a danger in this growing power of the chief minister , in the authority it gives him the leader of the dominant party in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	over the British dominions .

		It is pointed out that the colonial constitution - alists fear the Prime Minister more than the
King	PERSON	, indeed , that they regard the latter as their protector against `` Downing Street . ''

		The control of the dominions by an elective Minister , who secures this control by effective mastery of a political party in one part though the central part of the British Em - pire , seems to Mr. Low quite as hazardous as direct personal control by the
King	LOCATION	.

		To be sure , the King can not in these days rees - tablish unlimited monarchy , but must always be influenced by the representatives of the people .

		But what would result if the advice given the King by the elective English Pre - mier should differ from that given by the elective Premier of one of the Dominions ,
Canada	LOCATION	, for example ?

		This seems to point to the need of some other system of coordinat - ing the Empire than that in vogue .

		The Prime Minister and the Cabinet should also be limited to some degree in their control of foreign affairs through the establishment of a
Committee of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, like the
American Senate Committee on Foreign Relations	ORGANIZATION	, enti - tled to know the foreign problems and policies of the Cabinet .

		Finally , Mr. Low again de - clares his conviction that some machinery of subordinate legislatures , some devolution on a large scale , is required to relieve the central Parliament of what are local questions , in order that all matters may be dealt with more carefully and effectually .

		Mr.
Arthur Ruhl	PERSON	used to write ^ out plays for `` Collier 's Weekly . ' '

		But he did not write in the capacity of first-night critic : that `` bored but witty person , with a black ribbon to his eye-glasses , who descends to his seat just before the curtain rises , and turns to survey the house ere he sits down . ''

		His was the more leisurely , less exciting , but no less exacting or important task of sorting out of second nights or second weeks or months , as the case might be significant figures , trends , and aspects of our contemporary theatre .

		Some of these impressions and opin - ions fill his recent book , cleverly entitled `` Second Nights '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		There is noth - ing technical about Mr.
Ruhl	PERSON	's criticisms ; he leaves that to the astute first-nighters .

		He views the theatre and its people as a side of life , particularly interesting and significant during the period covered by his observation that is , from
1905	DATE	to the present ; and he writes of such human and general considera - tions as may have weight with the average reader , whose interest in the stage is some - what cursory , though genuine .

		No one can complain that Mr.
Ruhl	PERSON	's outlook is narrow .

		He appreciates all the phases of Mr.
George M. Cohan	PERSON	, admits the `` charm '' of Miss
Maude Adams	PERSON	in Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's settings , and finds `` Sumurum '' amusing ; his review of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's American nights is intelli - gent , yet he is not above enjoying a vaude - ville turn or a Bowery burlesque ; and he interviews Mile .

		Genee .

		Miss
Duncan	PERSON	, and
Miss St. Denis	ORGANIZATION	with absolute impartiality .

		The lengths at which his kindly tolerance draws the line are the `` no quarter '' school represented by `` Madame X '' and the plays of Mr.
Eugene Walter	PERSON	, and the plays with sawdust insides and photographic exteriors by the ingenious Mr.
Belasco	PERSON	.

		His warmest admiration , on the other hand , is divided be -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAI , 507 tween the best of the `` new '' drama as typi - fied by Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's `` The Pigeon '' and the old-fashioned but perennially refreshing melodrama , whether you get it glorified at a
Drury Lane	ORGANIZATION	opening or merely what the public wants at the ten-twenty-thirties .

		How much of life of all sorts , mere play and splendid earnest , besides some innocent and some calculated affectation , there has been behind the footlights in the last few seasons will astonish many of Mr.
Buhl	PERSON	's readers .

		The truth is that most observers have axes to grind , whereas Mr.
Buhl	PERSON	devotes himself to seeing and passing on his observations ; with the result that there is an amazing amount of information about the theatre to be had from the pages of `` Second Nights . ''

		Over forty years ago Mr.
Ed	PERSON	- The story of _ , if - * ' VAJ.I u 1 man 's evolution ward -LRB- Jlodd wrote a little book simply toid .

		on The childhood of the World '' which contained a simple account of man 's origin and early history freed from the technicalities of science and set forth as a continuous story of progress .

		The book has been deservedly well received , having been translated into seven languages and printed in raised type for the blind .

		The rapid prog - ress of the sciences has compelled a revision of the text , which now appears in expanded form and with new illustrations .

		It tells the story of the evolution of life on the globe , but prin - cipally of man 's origin from lower forms , the growth of human society and of the arts of civilization .

		Man 's migrations , the methods by which his primal needs of food , warmth , and shelter were met , his development of tools , and the discovery and use of metals are recounted and pictured .

		The origin of the various occupations , the development of lan - guages , the arts of writing , counting , and measuring , and the more social arts of sport and music , are traced back to their begin - nings .

		More attention , however , is paid to the growth of ideas and of myths interpre - tative of natural phenomena and leading to worship , magic , witchcraft , animism , and theism in its several forms , culminating in the sacred books of various peoples .

		A few words , all too brief , are devoted to the growth of modern science and its bearings on race progress .

		A Norwegian dramatist in translation .

		Mr.
Edwin Bjorkman	PERSON	, who has already laid the American pub - lic under a heavy debt of grati - tude for his translations from the modern Scandinavian literature , now gives us a second series of Plays by
Bjornstjerne Bjornson	PERSON	-LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		In these plays
Bjornson	PERSON	evi - dently attempts to combat the nihilistic pessi - mism of some of his contemporaries and the `` master morality '' of others by the formula - tion of a more socially constructive interpre - tation of life and character .

		`` Beyond Human Might '' is a powerful effort to argue the problem of Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's `` Strife , '' - the problem , that is , of the modern labor war against capitalistic tyranny .

		The Norwegian poet does not , like the Englishman , stop with a picture of hopeless misery , a cul-de-sac for both sides ; but after a rather over-melodra - matic climax of violence and sacrifice involv - ing innocent with guilty , he eloquently points the path to a better future to be achieved by science and by love .

		It is easy to cavil at the long speeches , often too heavily freighted with thesis , and at the tinge of a too pietistic sentimentality at the close ; yet in spite of all this it must be admitted that the beauty of the vision in this drama and the power of its grasp on life make ' ' Strife ' ' seem an ama - teurish pamphlet in comparison .

		The other two plays in the volume , `` Love and Geog - raphy '' and `` Laboremus , '' are in them - selves less interesting than `` Beyond Human Might , '' chiefly because they are not so mod - ern in .

		theme ; but they reveal very wonder - fully the breadth and nobleness of
Bjornson	PERSON	's nature .

		Mr.
Bjorkman	PERSON	, though himself a Swede by birth , writes his adopted tongue with great fluency rather than with a fine sense for the spirit and idiom of the lan - guage ; his work , therefore , while never halt - ing , never quite deludes the reader into forgetting that it is translation ; a slight stiff - ness , an occasional jarring tone resulting sometimes from the juxtaposition of a too colloquial beside a bookish expression , an unequal success in keeping the speech of the different characters sufficiently individual , such blemishes of style must tend to lower the effect of plays which in the original are of high poetic quality .

		These blemishes are not so many or so serious , however , as to de - tract notably from the reader 's interest and enjoyment .

		With such slogans as efficiency Psychology and , , .

		, the management and conservation dominant in of labor .

		tne worifl O f material goods , it is inevitable that the same attitudes should be transferred to the things of the mind .

		Psy - chology is summoned , though commonly less as an expert physician than as a trained nurse , to minister to ills beyond the control of house - hold art .

		Mr.
L. M. Gilbreth	PERSON	's `` The Psy - chology of Management '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is one of a growing number of books that aim to set forth the principles upon which work may be sustained with least waste , 508 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	and the human individual brought to the highest efficiency as an operative with due recognition that he is human .

		The laborer has a psychology of his own which determines his work and how that work may be related to his individuality .

		That the alliance of psychology and the management of labor is sound and well founded can hardly be dis - puted .

		The question of how this campaign of enlightenment and mutual support is to be carried on , is less certain .

		Much crudity of effort is inevitable ; and it can not be said that Mr.
Gilbreth	PERSON	, any more than his col - leagues in the art , has succeeded in presenting more than a programme , and a rather didactic book of advice .

		The danger is inherent of relying upon method as a panacea , and still more obviously of letting method obscure the importance of the end .

		Common sense and the ordinary versatility of a `` handy '' mind and hand are assets that can not be neglected or overruled .

		Standardization is one of the fetishes that may defeat its own end by the blindness with which its worship is pursued .

		The present book suggests that the phrases in which a carter speaks to his horse may well be standardized in the interests of efficiency .

		But when all is said and done , the theme and the policy remain ; what is still in its infancy is the sense of perspective in which the values of one order or another find their proper places .

		Until this emerges , the art of scien - tific management is likely to exterminate as well as to weed , even to throw out the child with the bath .

		The appeal to psychology is welcome ; gradually it will be more intelli - gently addressed and its behests more sym - pathetically followed .

		democratic of cratic and socialistic experi - ments in
Australasia	LOCATION	, there is no end .

		One of the most brilliant studies of the kind that has yet been written is
M. Andre Siegfried	PERSON	's `` Democracy in
New Zealand	LOCATION	, '' published in French some ten years ago , and now offered to the public in an English trans - lation by Mr.
E. V. Burns	PERSON	.

		M. Siegfried is best known to American readers as the author of a study on the race question in
Canada	LOCATION	, published several years ago .

		In his book on `` Democracy in
New Zealand	LOCATION	, '' he considers in turn such matters as the influ - ence of geographical factors , present political and social conditions , federation , imperialism , projects of expansion , etc. ; but his principal theme is the working out in practice of the various legislative experiments in relation to compulsory arbitration of labor disputes , old age pensions , land legislation , government loans to farmers , state aid to immigration , and other measures of a more or less socialistic character which have attracted world-wide attention to
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		His interpretation of the results of such legislation is , on the whole , marked by singular good judgment , and his attitude is one of sympathy , insight , and breadth of view .

		During the ten years that have elapsed since the publication of his book in French , some things have occurred , however , to make his interpretation less ac - curate now than it was at the time he wrote .

		Thus his statement that the arbitration act had put an end to strikes is no longer true , since in recent years there has been a recru - descence of strikes , some of which have been serious and prolonged ; and it may be added that the people no longer have the same whole - hearted confidence in legislative panaceas that they had ten years ago .

		But when due allow - ance has been made for these unexpected results , the book remains one of the most bril - liant , sympathetic , and accurate studies of the sturdy little democracy of
New Zealand	LOCATION	that we have .

		A case of learned precocity .

		In a volume entitled `` The Ed - ucation of
Karl Witte	PERSON	, '' Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	publish an English translation of a record of the methods pur - sued in educating the eminent German Dante scholar -LRB- 1800-1883 -RRB- , who received the doc - torate at the age of eighteen and a professor - ship at twenty-two .

		Wide public interest in recent cases of precocity of learning furnishes an ostensible reason for introducing the vol - ume to present-day readers .

		It has been the customary view of the parents of precocious boys that the system which they apply is re - sponsible for the results .

		The record of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	remains the one of greatest inter - est and value .

		It may be recalled that Lord
Kelvin	PERSON	was another example of such precoc - ity encouraged by the father ; and the recent case of the son of Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	and that of the son of Professor
Wiener	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	furnish other examples .

		The present volume owes its translation to Professor
Wiener	PERSON	, and thus sponsored is presumably a document with which he is sympathetic .

		The introduction by Mr.
H. Addington Bruce	PERSON	contains a rather slight formulation of the educational princi - ples involved .

		But cases of this kind , while they carry a very real lesson , are not likely to be educationally convincing .

		To show how far the forcing method may be carried in tra - ditional fields of scholarship may be an inter - esting demonstration .

		It is not the only or the most convincing proof that the pace set by school systems and social expectations is
1914	DATE	-RSB- 509 too slow .

		Also it is important to have shown , as has been done , that precocity within limits is directly associated with more than aver - age , even with exceptional ability , popular tradition to the contrary notwithstanding .

		But the pros and cons of what is gained and what may be lost by forcing are not thus dis - closed .

		Such cases throw an interesting side - light upon the limitations and the possibilities of nurture when seconded by nature : beyond that their utility is not notable .

		To a considerable extent Dr.
C. B. Reed	PERSON	has succeeded in doing this in his `` Masters of the Wilderness '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is issued as the latest volume in the ' '
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	Series ' ' of the
Chicago Plistorical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		This attractive little book embraces three essays , the first , which gives its title to the volume , being a study of the
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's Bay Company ; the second , a sketch of the old
Beaver Club	ORGANIZATION	, of
Montreal	LOCATION	, and its members the partners of the
North West Company	LOCATION	; and the third , a picture of the romantic attempt of

Alexander Mackenzie	PERSON	never saw Great Bear lake ; the reference -LRB- p. 37 -RRB- is evidently to Great Slave lake .

		On the same page , `` Atabasca '' should be `` Athabaska . ''

		Fort

North West Company	LOCATION	, not of the con - federated companies -LRB- p. 40 -RRB- .

		York Factory , and later
Norway House	ORGANIZATION	, were headquarters of the
Hudson	LOCATION	's
Bay Company	LOCATION	, where the Governor and Factors met in annual council .

		Apropos of the reference on p. 27 to beaver as almost extinct , it may be interesting to note that the protection afforded by the
Ontario Government	ORGANIZATION	in
Algonquin Park	LOCATION	has led to such an extraordinary increase that beaver have become almost a pest to the farmers in the neighborhood of the park .

		The fever of love in the animal world .

		Much of the elaboration of or - nament and of the development of complicated instincts and unusual types of behavior among animals have arisen in the course of the evolution of the animal world in conjunction with the function of reproduction .

		The organs of bat - tle and the fighting instinct in some animals at least find their present use in the struggle for mates , and the theory of sexual selection seeks to explain much that is militant as well as much that is beautiful in the animal world as the result of capture by the victorious suitor or of preferment of the most charm - ing one .

		Mr.
W. P. Pycraft	PERSON	in his study of `` The Courtship of Animals '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- decries somewhat the efficiency of this theory , and prefers the idea of `` an inherent diathesis '' which must work itself out in the evolution of ornament , a sort of physiological orthogen - esis of animal decoration , or , as Professor
Shaler	PERSON	was wont to put it pithily , a struggle for beauty .

		The author discusses in an en - tertaining way the really remarkable antics attending the courtships of spiders and of various insects , and especially the mating habits of birds whose evolution of decorative feathers is usually attended by a supplemen - tary instinct of display , as in the strutting of the peacock , or accompanied and to some extent even displaced by the development of vocal powers , as in song .

		Following the fash - ion of some other recent English writers on biological themes , the author uses his biolog - ical data to point a moral as well as to adorn his tales .

		His thesis is that the path of de - generation in the animal world is marked by the assumption on the part of the female and of the young of structural features originally characteristic of the male .

		The militant suf - fragist , yea , the whole feminist movement , is therefore a solemn warning fraught with dir - est threat of impending degeneration for the future of our civilization and race , if only our fearsome prophet 's thesis be a general biological law and his argument by analogy from biological structures to the field of social evolution be valid .

		Poe as reflected in his poems .

		To present the main facts of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		's life , in particular those that may be inferred from his poems , and in the light of these facts to in - terpret and appraise anew his poems , is the task that Mr.
Lewis N. Chase	PERSON	has set himself in the little volume , `` Poe and his Poetry , '' issued in the `` Poetry and Life Series '' -LRB- Lon - don :
Harrap & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , under the general ed - itorship of Professor
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	.

		This task Mr.
Chase	PERSON	has performed in a manner in most respects satisfactory .

		The facts of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's life he gives with unusual accuracy ;
Poe	PERSON	's character he interprets with admirable sympathy and fairness ; and so much of ap - preciation as he attempts is in accord with the views now generally held by students of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		In reading autobiography out of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's 510 THE DIAL
June 16	DATE	verses , moreover , Mr.
Chase	PERSON	has proceeded cautiously .

		As revelations of Foe 's inner life , he justly says , the poems are invaluable ; but as reflecting concrete facts in his life , he holds that they are not to be relied on im - plicitly , in view of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's well-known fondness for mystification and hoaxing .

		Accordingly , Mr.
Chase	PERSON	ignores the traditional interpreta - tion of ``
Tamerlane	LOCATION	'' as adumbrating the poet 's early love-affair with
Miss Royster	PERSON	; and in the case of `` Ulalume , '' although he maintains that the poem is `` allegorized auto - biography , '' he is silent as to the possible allu - sion contained in it to the poet 's infatuation for Mrs.
Shew	PERSON	.

		A number of the earlier and more personal poems are omitted altogether .

		The volume throws no new light on any of the obscure places in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's biography , but it pre - sents the case for the poet from a new angle , and hence will serve a useful purpose .

		An unusual number of books oferMr b y k8 published of late years on her - aldry would seem to indicate a revival of interest in that subject .

		Though its vitality and meaning have departed , her - aldry is still of importance to the archaBolo - gist and antiquarian , as well as to the student of history and art .

		Of the two most recent books on the subject , Mr.
Francis J. Grant	PERSON	's `` Manual of Heraldry '' -LRB-
Edinburgh	LOCATION	:
John Grant	PERSON	-RRB- is a revision of a former edition of a standard work , and contains all the technical knowledge of the subject that the student would wish to possess , presented , through a complete dictionary of terms and 350 illus - trations , in such manner as to make it inval - uable as a ready book of reference .

		The other volume , Mr.
W. H. St. John Hope	PERSON	's `` Gram - mar of Heraldry , '' in the ``
Cambridge	LOCATION	Man - uals of Science and Literature '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , presents the subject in a far more attractive manner to the general reader , and goes far toward justifying the oft-repeated claims of heraldry to be a `` science . ''

		Though the smallest book on heraldry that has come to our notice , Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's manual is of value out of all proportion to its size .

		The author makes wise suggestions regarding the modern use of heraldry and a revision of its archaic nomenclature .

		Ancient
Rome	LOCATION	and modern
India	LOCATION	.

		Some years ago Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	published a series of essays under the title , `` Studies in History and Jurisprudence , '' two of which dealt with the government of
India	LOCATION	viewed in the light of the Roman imperial system .

		These have recently been revised and republished in a separate volume by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the first essay , `` The Ancient Ro - man Empire and the British Empire in
India	LOCATION	, '' the author traces a number of inter - esting and suggestive parallels between the ancient provincial system and the British oc - cupation and administration of
India	LOCATION	.

		He also finds a number of notable differences , some of which are more significant and fun - damental than the similarities .

		The second essay , `` The Diffusion of Roman and English Law throughout the World , '' deals particu - larly with the development of a new legal system for the
Orient	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the Hindu na - tionalistic movement is attracting some atten - tion at present , these essays make a very timely publication ; they will do much to clarify the mind of the average American reader on the subject of Hindu affairs .

		It may be said in passing that Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	does not believe in a speedy realization of the dreams of the Hindu nationalists : the differ - ences of caste , religion , and race are too pro- nounced and too dividing .

		Whether or not we sophisticated twentieth-century grown-ups be - lieve in fairies , we can not get on happily without them : this is the thesis of Mr.
S. R. Littlewood	PERSON	's original little essay entitled `` The Fairies Here and Now '' -LRB- Mc - Bride ,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Nowadays we like our fairies to be little and good ; we prefer the familiar house-and-garden fairies to the more elusive sprites that inhabit inaccessible places .

		Above all , our fairies must have charm , since to enchant us with gaiety and sweetness , daintiness and grace is the modern mission of the `` little people . ''

		There is a good deal of fairy history in Mr.
Littlewood	PERSON	's book , and an alluring account of fairy land , or shall we say fairy lands , since there seem to have been as many kinds of fairy worlds as there have been of fairy folk to people them .

		But Mr.
Littlewood	PERSON	's original contribution to fairy lore is his keen analysis of present-day conditions .

		Fairy stock is going up .

		We do want the fairies , and in spite of scoffers and unbelievers this drab old world is getting more and more fairylike all the time .

		The most hardened scoffer will be entertained by Mr.
Littlewood	PERSON	's argument , equally with readers who already appreciate the fairies at their true worth .

		With a very un-Bergsonian in - ondr e e r ams n troduction , Mr.
E. E. Slosson	PERSON	presents an English version of
M. Bergson	PERSON	's essay on `` Dreams '' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The essay , though slight in form and compass , is suggestive and penetrating .

		It is in ac - cord with the current interpretation of dream -
1914	DATE	THE DIAL 511 life by applying , with allowance for altered condition of the apperceptive mind , the nor - mal processes and relations of perception .

		Eliminate the sense of support as well as the consciousness that one is lying down , and the movement becomes one of flying or falling .

		Release the sense of directive guidance , and the mind lapses back to the natural romanc - ing of dreams and the relaxed material of casual attention .

		Dismiss the errand , and the walk becomes a stroll responsive to the in - vitations of the wayside .


M. Bergson	PERSON	dips interestingly here and there into the mecha - nism of dreams , brings in an apposite illus - tration , and shapes the whole to a consistent interpretation .

		As an apercu , clear , succinct , to the point and purpose , the essay will de - light the attentive public which
M. Bergson	PERSON	has made his own .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Herbert Cescinsky	PERSON	and Mr.
Malcolm R. Webster	PERSON	have written a book on '' English Do - mestic Clocks '' -LRB- Button -RRB- which supplements the former 's authoritative work on ''
English Furni	PERSON	- ture of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It is a history , elaborately illustrated from photographs and line drawings , of English clocks from
1665	DATE	down to the present day .

		A list of English clockmakers is appended .

		Mr.
Ernest A. Baker	PERSON	has included in his `` A Guide to Historical Fiction '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- many novels dealing with periods contemporary to their authors .

		Thus Fielding 's ,
Jane Austen	PERSON	's , and
George Eliot	PERSON	's novels are listed because '' they are the finest history of society available for the periods to which they belong , '' even though they were not avowedly or intentionally historical .

		The book is an elaboration of Mr.
Baker	PERSON	's '' History in Fiction '' and a companion volume to his `` A Guide to the Best Fiction in English , '' being in - dexed on the same encyclopaedis system .

		The autobiography of a manuscript , told in the style and with the limitations that one may imagine as belonging to a manuscript , comes to us from Mr.
Henry H. Harper	PERSON	, who chooses to call the little book '' The Story of a Manuscript , '' though the relation is , throughout , in the first person .

		It is a rather pathetic little tale of a literary master - piece , unappreciated and unpublished in the author 's lifetime , but valued at an incredible price a century later , when an American millionaire collector got possession of it and gave it a place of honor in his magnificent library .

		After his death it was returned to its English home , the '' humble cottage '' of its author , which had been restored as nearly as possible to the condition in which its now illustrious occupant had known it .

		The tasteful volume , with its excellent linen paper , clear print , broad margins , and what has the appearance of half - vellum binding , is '' printed privately for complimentary distribution only . ''

		CHICAGO THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 16	DATE	From Nebula to Nebula or The Dynamics of the Heavens This work , among other original features , presents a new interpretation of the
Moon	PERSON	's surface , depicting that body as in the midst of a '' great ice age . ''

		The lunar day and night being each a fortnight long , they may fairly be termed seasons ,
summer	DATE	and winter .

		Assuming , then , that when this order of rotation began , the
Moon	PERSON	possessed her proper quota of water , and that the severity of winter exceeded the
summer	DATE	's mildness , it follows that each succeeding turn of the planet marked a fresh deepening of the snows on the land and a correspond - ing , though slighter , lowering of the waters in the seas and pools , until in the end what had once lain flat and formless , became entirely converted by the magic hand of Nature into the white sculptured craters , cones , mountains , rays and rills that excite man 's wonder to-day .

		Grotesque and varied as these formations are , they may be easily recon - structed by the imagination , when remembering that one cubic inch of water makes ten of snow and that receding waters mean emerging lands .

		The phenomenal tenuity and feeble refraction of the lunar atmosphere the writer fully accounts for by -LRB- 1 - -RRB- the absorption of the air in the snowflakes , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the natural scarcity of atmospheric dust , because the soil is snow - decked , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the probable evenness of temperature , from top to bottom , of the atmosphere , resting as the latter does upon a universal glacier , which can not gather warmth .

		That such a surface , free from impurities , will not vaporize is evident , hence the absence also of humid clouds .

		Paper , 50 c net An enquiry into the nature of man 's highest ideal and a solution of the problem from the standpoint of science .

		The God conception here proposed is both very radical and very conservative .

		It has been character - ized as the faith of an atheist who loves God .

		It is not pantheism , for here God and nature -LRB- or the All -RRB- are not identified , nor is it the traditional dualistic deism .

		It may be called nomotheism , for the formative or determinant factors of existence , what is commonly called the laws of nature in their unity , are declared to be the divinity that governs the world and deserves our veneration .

		PERSONALITY With special reference to super personalities and the interpersonal character of ideas .

		Cloth , 7Sc This little book insists on the paramount significance of personality ; explains its origin as due to the unity of an organism ; sets forth the history of the word persona and its connotations in
Greece	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	and modern times ; discusses the nature of personality and its relation to ideas , the latter being interpersonal entities ; and finally points out the part played by superpersonalities , religious ideals , patriotic heroes , the Christ-conception and especially the conception of God , throwing a new light on the doctrine of the

		THE MECHANISTIC PRINCIPLE AND THE NON - MECHANICAL Cloth ,
